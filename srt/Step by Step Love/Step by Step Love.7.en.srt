=Episode 7=

20
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:58,218
Did you follow me just to film me
venting in embarrassment?

21
00:01:58,418 --> 00:01:59,498
Haven't you done enough today?

22
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:01,179
I saw the boss scolding you,

23
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:02,778
so I came to try and comfort you.

24
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:04,899
How can you be so ungrateful?

25
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:06,899
You failed to pacify Mr. Liu,
so I had to do it.

26
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:07,778
I did what I could

27
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,218
and ended up being yelled at.

28
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,899
Shouldn't you, my supervisor,
step in to explain for me?

29
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:13,179
You call this comforting?

30
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:14,778
Like you're really that kind-hearted.

31
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:16,899
Mr. Liu favors you.

32
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:17,899
I was just

33
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:20,419
giving you a taste of the hard work
in the marketing department.

34
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:21,899
Don't say I never let you try.

35
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:22,698
Look,

36
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:23,938
the things I face every day

37
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,378
are far more challenging than today.

38
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,859
Did I ever complain?

39
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,938
Just calm yourself.

40
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,419
Then apologize to Mr. Lu,
and admit your mistake.

41
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:33,739
I...

42
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,978
Drop the attitude, okay?

43
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:39,739
Bye.

44
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,258
Is Lu Cenyang blind?

45
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:52,258
Can't even tell right from wrong.

46
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,339
I've never heard you raise you voice.

47
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:00,538
Sorry, Mr. Li.

48
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:02,299
I lost my temper.

49
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,019
I was infuriated.

50
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:06,139
Here,

51
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,818
deliver this bonsai

52
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:09,498
to Mr. Lu's office.

53
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:12,818
If there's misunderstanding,
clarify with him face-to-face.

54
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:14,938
Go on.

55
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:29,859
Thank you.

56
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:46,498
Mr. Liu has left.

57
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:48,019
Can you tell me what I did wrong?

58
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,019
Do you think

59
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:51,098
getting Mr. Liu to
approve your design is a big deal?

60
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:52,739
And that my scolding was foolish,

61
00:03:52,938 --> 00:03:54,258
and crushed your enthusiasm?

62
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:55,778
I feel that if it can help the company,

63
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:56,899
I should be more proactive.

64
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:58,098
You're paying me salary,

65
00:03:58,258 --> 00:03:59,619
of course I have to earn it.

66
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:01,019
You said if,

67
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:02,739
which means it's hypothetical.

68
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:04,139
You'd better think carefully

69
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:06,218
about your duties
that come with the salary.

70
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:12,179
Respecting your authority as the boss.

71
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,098
Complying with every word you say.

72
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:16,779
Flattering, adoring and idolizing you.

73
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,458
Best yet, always gawking

74
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,498
at your perfect-looking face.

75
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,458
Kerry put up a good act,

76
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:27,179
but I'm simply not
cut out for marketing.

77
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:28,779
Putting up with you is already my limit.

78
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:29,659
Do you think

79
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:31,138
speaking to the boss in this way

80
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,378
makes you so special?

81
00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:33,818
You haven't learned anything good.

82
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:35,779
You're always dissatisfied,
and complaining.

83
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,299
Why should I indulge someone

84
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:38,299
still in probation?

85
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:42,698
What?

86
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:44,419
Did that hurt you?

87
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,498
If receiving Mr. Liu made you so angry,

88
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:48,818
the only reason I can think of is

89
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:50,099
you're afraid he will poach me.

90
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:51,578
You really are a blockhead.

91
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:52,179
Right.

92
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:54,018
Only Kerry can guess your thoughts.

93
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,779
All I get from you is talking back.

94
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:56,779
If you don't know

95
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:58,338
why I said that to Mr. Liu,

96
00:04:58,539 --> 00:04:59,578
go home and think it over.

97
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:02,419
Did I let you leave?

98
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:08,018
A temper worse than mine.

99
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,859
I haven't given you the assignment yet.

100
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,898
Come on. Let's take the subway.

101
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:14,179
- I'm exhausted.
- Okay, let's go.

102
00:05:22,378 --> 00:05:23,898
Just got off work. Available tonight.

103
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:26,539
Sounds like you're unhappy about

104
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:27,739
not working overtime.

105
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:31,458
Do you know the pain of someone
having superhuman strength

106
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:33,179
but can only haul bricks?

107
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:34,338
I understand.

108
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:36,219
I'm on day shift, finishing up soon.

109
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,338
Let's go have skewers.

110
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:39,698
Fine, see you at Old Pal's.

111
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,099
(Luckily you didn't go straight
to meet with Mr. Liu like a chump.)

112
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:58,258
(Heartless one.)

113
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:08,419
Ms. Hua.

114
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,018
Ms. Hua.

115
00:06:24,338 --> 00:06:26,099
Based on my observation,

116
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,018
Lu Cenyang's attitude towards Bu Ran

117
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,018
is quite complicated.

118
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:31,859
How so?

119
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:33,898
He showed

120
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,739
complete disregard for Bu Ran's feeling.

121
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:36,739
But at work,

122
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,859
no matter what I do to frame Bu Ran,

123
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:40,258
he refuses to let her go.

124
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:41,659
Also,

125
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:42,698
he'd rather take

126
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,578
the broken mug Bu Ran fixed

127
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:46,179
than a new one from me.

128
00:06:46,258 --> 00:06:48,859
Any progress on the task I gave you?

129
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,539
I've been at Pinshang for a while.

130
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,659
Not once did Lu Siqi show up.

131
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:57,299
Keep looking.

132
00:06:58,338 --> 00:06:58,979
Okay.

133
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,338
I brought some of your things over.

134
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,099
Aren't you afraid that your neighbor

135
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:10,619
will see it and suspect something?

136
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:12,898
She probably doesn't
want to see me today.

137
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:14,179
So she won't be back soon.

138
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:18,498
It seems you've known
Bu Ran pretty well already.

139
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:28,018
Your attention to details is creepy.

140
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:29,338
Who knows which

141
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,938
lucky girl will be my sister-in-law?

142
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,018
Under my influence,

143
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:34,859
you're certain to marry well.

144
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:37,818
I'll wait a few years
before getting married.

145
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,619
At least until Yihua
is no longer a threat

146
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:43,299
and Lu Siqi is no longer
your weak point.

147
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:45,498
Rest assured.

148
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:46,779
I will resolve it soon.

149
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,619
Are you hungry? I'll go make noodles.

150
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,539
Okay.

151
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:10,258
I'll put the family photo in the closet.

152
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:12,698
It's discreet enough
and you can see it anytime.

153
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:14,619
Okay.

154
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:42,858
Noodles are ready, come on.

155
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:44,899
Okay.

156
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,218
It smells so good.

157
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,499
You always cook the best noodles.

158
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,179
Butt kisser.

159
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,578
Before, when you had no appetite,

160
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,698
I'd make you noodles and you'd say

161
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:08,899
"Such tasty noodles,"

162
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:10,779
"you can only cook for me and dad."

163
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:12,618
Was I that stingy?

164
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:14,818
When dad was around,

165
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,299
we would cook a simple meal

166
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:18,818
and you'd enjoy it so much,

167
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:20,618
praising our exceptional cooking skills.

168
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:23,098
We knew you were being nice,

169
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,618
but dad and I just

170
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:26,338
couldn't be more satisfied.

171
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,419
Your head hurts again?

172
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:41,659
It's okay. It will pass soon.

173
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:46,539
Eat slower.

174
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:48,379
Is it really that good?

175
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:50,218
Try something else later.

176
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,858
Kerry literally pushed me to the client.

177
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:54,338
Am I supposed to keep a straight face?

178
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:56,218
He blames me for everything.

179
00:09:56,938 --> 00:09:57,419
The guy.

180
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:58,978
Can't believe dad
wanted me to marry him.

181
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:00,139
Thank goodness it's off.

182
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,738
It'd be like throwing me
in a pit of fire.

183
00:10:04,218 --> 00:10:04,978
Let me ask you.

184
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:06,618
When you heard your dad say

185
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,818
that you might marry Lu Cenyang,

186
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:11,578
was it not even a little tempting?

187
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:18,738
Are you crazy?

188
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,779
I'm all fed up working for him now.

189
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:23,738
The last place I want to go back to
is Fortune Pavilion.

190
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:24,938
The sight of him upsets me.

191
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:27,978
Okay.

192
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,458
Then move out.

193
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:30,499
I have plenty of places.

194
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:31,379
Stay with me.

195
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:32,419
Not yet.

196
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:37,618
Here are your clams.

197
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:38,858
Let's go.

198
00:10:41,818 --> 00:10:42,338
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,019
Bu Ran.

200
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:44,779
Let's go.

201
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:50,978
Bad guy.

202
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,419
We should go have it treated.

203
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:04,938
Awake?

204
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,019
Have some water.

205
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,139
How are you feeling?

206
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,338
I'm fine.

207
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,499
Don't worry. Dr. Ma said

208
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:30,698
headache is not a bad thing.

209
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:32,458
It means the treatment is working.

210
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,419
Just now when we were eating,

211
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,419
I felt like I was remembering something,

212
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:39,139
but after sleeping, it was gone again.

213
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:40,299
Don't force yourself.

214
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:42,899
Your memories will come back eventually.

215
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:46,618
Dr. Ma says you should stay here
for observation tonight.

216
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:48,698
If all is well, you can leave
tomorrow morning.

217
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:51,098
You go home first.

218
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:52,858
Too many people in the morning.

219
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,139
I'll handle the discharge myself.

220
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:56,059
Alright, I will let Dr. Ma know.

221
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:57,179
Okay, go ahead.

222
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:10,338
Try not to move it.

223
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:11,499
Thank you.

224
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:12,578
You're welcome.

225
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,218
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:19,338
I didn't know those guys
were coming after me.

227
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:21,098
Now your hand is injured.

228
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:24,059
It was a reflex when I
saw you in danger.

229
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:25,419
I'd do the same again.

230
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,419
It's not worth mentioning.

231
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:33,419
Even now you're still joking.

232
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:35,419
I am truly impressed.

233
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:37,379
I'm not joking.

234
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:40,938
Think about when we first met abroad.

235
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:44,458
And how we gradually
became best friends.

236
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,738
How long have we known each other?

237
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,259
Yeah.

238
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:00,578
(Son.)

239
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:03,858
(Your dad was driven to death
by the Yihua Group)

240
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:05,738
(because he misplaced his trust)

241
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:08,978
(in his so-called friend, Yi Minde.)

242
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,179
Hey.

243
00:13:17,618 --> 00:13:18,659
Do you speak Chinese?

244
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,299
I'm Chinese.

245
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:22,978
I'm new here,

246
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:24,578
trying to get a dishwasher job.

247
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:26,019
Could you ask your boss for me?

248
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:26,618
Sure.

249
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:27,779
I'll ask our manager for you.

250
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:30,539
(I never expected)

251
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,779
(to be moved by
Bu Ran's kindness later.)

252
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:39,299
Hello?

253
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:41,419
What are you thinking?

254
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,938
I'm thinking about
the first time we met.

255
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:47,818
You helped me out just like this.

256
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:51,098
A true hero doesn't
dwell on past glories.

257
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:52,858
Put your hand down.

258
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:54,458
You're injured.

259
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,299
About earlier,

260
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:58,458
it didn't look like an accident to me.

261
00:13:58,738 --> 00:13:59,818
Who have you offended?

262
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:03,458
They were probably Yi Zihe's men.

263
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,218
Is Yi Zihe going after you

264
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,139
because of me?

265
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,419
No.

266
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,618
It was because of Lu Cenyang.

267
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:14,098
I worked with Lu Cenyang
to teach Taylor a lesson.

268
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:15,338
Your younger brother

269
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:17,499
sees Lu Cenyang as a threat.

270
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:18,978
He dared not confront me openly,

271
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:20,059
so he did it in secret.

272
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:21,539
That's pretty much the case.

273
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:24,618
Since when did you stand by Lu Cenyang?

274
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,499
I swear I'm not.

275
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:29,059
Both Taylor and his imposter
were in China back then.

276
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:31,938
I stumbled upon
Lu Cenyang beating up Taylor.

277
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:33,059
He was pretty tough.

278
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:34,779
And like me,

279
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:35,738
he also wanted Taylor

280
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,299
to pay for what he did.

281
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:38,858
I just used him

282
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:41,139
to revenge on Taylor
for how he treated you.

283
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:43,259
That's why I chose to work with him.

284
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:45,419
Go.

285
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:47,299
You're still trying to cover for him,

286
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,779
just because he is the real Taylor?

287
00:14:48,978 --> 00:14:50,419
We broke into someone else's room.

288
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:51,578
It won't look good for you.

289
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:52,618
Just leave.

290
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:54,779
I finally see you for who you truly are.

291
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:57,098
Only a scum would use
a design done by another scum.

292
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,059
Go.

293
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,499
I thought he urged me away

294
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:05,779
to cover up for Taylor.

295
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,139
So, he was trying to protect me?

296
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:15,259
I wanted to do it, too.

297
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:16,578
I was just late.

298
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:20,179
Yi Zihe is coming after you now.

299
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:22,338
It's very likely he'll go after Lu, too.

300
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:23,738
I have to warn him.

301
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:24,578
Give him a heads-up.

302
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:27,019
Look at you.

303
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,938
You were just furious at Lu Cenyang
a moment ago.

304
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:30,618
Now just because
he did you a small favor,

305
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:31,698
you've gone soft.

306
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,578
You got hurt today.

307
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:36,858
Send him a text message
and your conscience is clear.

308
00:15:37,098 --> 00:15:38,098
No way.

309
00:15:38,098 --> 00:15:39,299
What if he doesn't see it?

310
00:15:39,618 --> 00:15:41,059
Then call him.

311
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:42,218
We just had an argument.

312
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:43,899
What if he's still mad
and wouldn't answer?

313
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:44,738
What should I do?

314
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,419
Your hand is injured.

315
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:47,458
You can't leave until tomorrow.

316
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:49,539
Think about me,
your best friend, will you?

317
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,539
I don't want to be worried all the time.

318
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:52,738
Lie down.

319
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:55,779
I know.

320
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:57,059
You're right.

321
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,139
I'm going to sleep now.

322
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:04,419
What a timely yawn.

323
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,299
You are not thinking about sneaking out

324
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,659
after I leave, right?

325
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,259
It's getting late.

326
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:11,499
You have work tomorrow.

327
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:12,659
Just leave.

328
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:13,779
Promise me then.

329
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,059
I will talk to Lu Cenyang.

330
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:18,379
Have a good rest tonight.

331
00:16:18,818 --> 00:16:19,259
Tomorrow...

332
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:20,059
I know.

333
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:21,499
I'll pick you up.

334
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:58,299
I'll leave her to you then.

335
00:16:58,818 --> 00:16:59,338
Don't worry.

336
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,698
I'll keep an eye on the treatment.

337
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:03,019
One more thing though.

338
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:04,499
Once the memory is recovered,

339
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:06,459
all the pain and sorrow from her past

340
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,418
will also return.

341
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:09,979
Are you sure you can
help her get through it?

342
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:11,378
No matter what,

343
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:13,739
she has a right to know her life.

344
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,818
If regaining memory

345
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:17,818
means she has to deal with
all sorts of problems,

346
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,459
then I'll certainly be there for her.

347
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:23,019
Okay, I'll do my best.

348
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:24,779
Dr. Ma,

349
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,658
for the time being I'm too busy

350
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:27,818
to look after my sister.

351
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:30,259
Please watch over her for me.

352
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:32,618
(Lu Cenyang is here to see a doctor?)

353
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:34,219
(Just the man I want to see now.)

354
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:35,459
Dr. Ma,

355
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:38,178
thank you for your help all these years.

356
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,818
It's been such a long time,

357
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:43,259
but I feel I'm beginning

358
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:44,138
to see a hint of hope.

359
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,338
(I knew Yi Zihe was
plotting against Lu Cenyang too.)

360
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:47,499
(Is he trying to expose)

361
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:49,219
(a secret illness Lu Cenyang has?)

362
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:51,059
(I must help him conceal it.)

363
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:53,499
No worries. Go home.

364
00:17:57,658 --> 00:17:58,779
Photo snatcher, three o'clock.

365
00:17:58,939 --> 00:17:59,779
I'll distract them.

366
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:00,418
Play along.

367
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:04,658
Look, honey,

368
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:07,618
these are the hands
that draw design sketches.

369
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:11,418
That's why I took you to the hospital
to have them checked.

370
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:13,459
I won't be at ease
until I know you're fine.

371
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:15,378
Does it hurt?

372
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:16,499
Yes.

373
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:18,259
Does it make your heart ache?

374
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:22,378
My heart aches for you.

375
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:27,379
(Billing)

376
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:46,979
The guy who took your photo
must be working for Yi Zihe.

377
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:48,699
Luckily you caught up quick.

378
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:50,578
At worst, they'll expose

379
00:18:50,939 --> 00:18:53,098
a case of office romance.

380
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:54,578
I'm just an untalented rookie

381
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:56,219
on the brink of getting fired.

382
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:57,219
Not news-worthy.

383
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:58,499
Not scandal material.

384
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:02,578
This concerns your reputation.

385
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:03,699
Is it worth it to help me?

386
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:06,539
You beat up Taylor for me.

387
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,178
Consider this me returning the favor.

388
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:13,658
How did you injure your hand?

389
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:17,658
I was eating skewers with Qin Xun.

390
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:18,618
Someone ambushed him.

391
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:20,019
I blocked a strike for him.

392
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:22,979
Is it serious?

393
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:24,459
I know the chief doctor there.

394
00:19:24,578 --> 00:19:25,618
He can take a look for you.

395
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,098
Just a scratch. No big deal.

396
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,979
You came to the hospital this late,

397
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:30,459
I hope it's not a freaky disease.

398
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:31,578
Don't curse me.

399
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:34,138
I'm sincerely worried they might
expose your weird medical condition.

400
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:35,658
That's why I stepped up.

401
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:40,779
When did you see me?

402
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:44,138
As soon as I entered the lobby.

403
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:45,699

Thank you.

427
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:40,979
Bu Ran.

428
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:43,019
The company has chosen you for the

429
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,178
orphanage renovation project.

430
00:21:54,338 --> 00:21:55,658
You're too reckless.

431
00:21:55,818 --> 00:21:56,939
How could you go home unapproved?

432
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:58,418
The bandages need to be changed today.

433
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,178
Stop nagging.

434
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:01,739
I can't sleep in the hospital bed.

435
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:03,699
I'll go change the bandage now.

436
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:07,858
Bu Ran.

437
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:10,219
The company has chosen you for the
orphanage renovation project.

438
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:16,499
Why brought up such

439
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:18,858
an import thing when I was sleepy?

440
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:26,299
Mr. Lu.

441
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:29,539
They gave me a large dose of
antibiotics yesterday.

442
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:30,578
I was all fuzzy.

443
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,658
Did you have some important task

444
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:34,739
for me?

445
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:40,418
You're a tea enthusiast.

446
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:41,858
Is this tea you got

447
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:43,539
the award-winning one?

448
00:22:44,818 --> 00:22:45,898
You know tea?

449
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,499
I did some research.

450
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:51,459
You're quite suitable for drinking tea.

451
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:52,539
Cultivate your temperament.

452
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,618
Don't always listen to
only half of the sentence.

453
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,699
I'll start drinking later.

454
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:59,739
To ease my hastiness.

455
00:23:00,658 --> 00:23:01,098
Mr. Lu.

456
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:03,178
If you have anything important to say,
just tell me.

457
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:05,098
I promise I'll listen
patiently to the end.

458
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:08,219
(She fell asleep yesterday
before I could ask clearly.)

459
00:23:09,618 --> 00:23:10,378
Let me ask you.

460
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:12,739
When did you first see me yesterday?

461
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:15,618
Did you hear what I said in the lobby?

462
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,019
Is what you mentioned

463
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:21,378
related to something important?

464
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:23,378
That depends on your answer.

465
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:29,378
When I called to you at the hospital,

466
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:30,858
that was when I first saw you.

467
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,658
You seemed to be
saying goodbye to a doctor.

468
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:38,059
I thought you said "see you".

469
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:39,739
Nothing else?

470
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:42,338
No.

471
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:43,138
Mr. Lu.

472
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:43,858
Come in.

473
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:46,898
Mr. Lu.

474
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:48,618
Engineering and design teams are ready,

475
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:50,418
awaiting discussion on the construction.

476
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:51,299
Good.

477
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:56,259
Think if there's anything
you'd like to add.

478
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:57,578
We'll talk after the meeting.

479
00:23:57,739 --> 00:23:59,338
I don't...

480
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:03,658
I don't have anything to add.

481
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:36,019
Boss.

482
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:37,059
You're off work so early today.

483
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:38,979
I smelt the scent of tea
from your place.

484
00:24:39,219 --> 00:24:39,658
Why?

485
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:40,898
Do you have an important guest?

486
00:24:42,098 --> 00:24:43,818
I'm just following your teachings.

487
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:46,618
Drinking tea to calm my mind.

488
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:48,259
Would you like to join me?

489
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:50,059
Sure.

490
00:25:00,618 --> 00:25:01,499
Please, take a seat.

491
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:04,539
You're brewing Pu'er?

492
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:06,098
You like it strong?

493
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:09,138
I just don't want to feel sleepy

494
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,098
and miss important instructions,

495
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,858
then wait all day for them.

496
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,138
You pour tea quite skillfully.

497
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:25,618
It's too strong.

498
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:37,618
(Look at this irritated demeanor.)

499
00:25:37,858 --> 00:25:39,178
(Working to ease her hastiness?)

500
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,299
(Who would believe that?)

501
00:26:10,658 --> 00:26:12,459
(Say something.)

502
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:17,779
Well, Mr. Lu.

503
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:19,578
We're having a conversation over tea.

504
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,059
Don't just drink tea.

505
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:22,818
Go on if you have something to say.

506
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:25,059
I asked you when you saw me
at the hospital,

507
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:26,699
but you said you couldn't recall.

508
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:29,019
So, I'm giving you more time
to refresh your memory.

509
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:32,779
What you remember determines
what I'll tell you.

510
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:35,459
I've already told you the truth.

511
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:37,219
If you don't believe it, too bad.

512
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:39,739
I have no interest
in your private illness.

513
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:41,499
A man visiting the doctor at late hours

514
00:26:41,578 --> 00:26:43,418
is usually due to
an embarrassing guy problem.

515
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:45,098
Why would I be so reckless as to

516
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:46,979
ruin your image by gossiping around?

517
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:49,618
Why are you so persistent anyway?

518
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:51,499
If I really knew something,

519
00:26:51,658 --> 00:26:53,219
you'd be the one facing humiliation.

520
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:56,499
Talking to you is such a waste of time.

521
00:26:58,338 --> 00:26:59,098
I've had enough tea.

522
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:01,459
Mr. Lu, at least finish

523
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:03,019
