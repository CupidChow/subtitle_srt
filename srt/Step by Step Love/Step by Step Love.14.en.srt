Take a few more pictures.

25
00:02:19,484 --> 00:02:22,163
(I adopted a light palette
and a semi-open partition wall,)

26
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:23,764

27

(To maximize interior lighting,)

28
00:02:26,484 --> 00:02:28,484

(enhancing the spatial transparency.)

30
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:34,843
(I elevated the bedroom

00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,804
(and moved the external
staircase indoors,)

(enhancing the sense of space layering.)

33
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:40,563
Really nice.

00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:42,044
It's pretty good.

Bu Ran

36
00:02:43,403 --> 00:02:44,084

00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:00,443

Lu Cenyang.

Are you childish?

46
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:21,163
Why are you acting like a thug?

47
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:24,244
I'm not acting like a thug.

48
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:32,484
The president of Pinshang
is a sore loser,

49
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:34,964
and resorts to such petty tactics?

50
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:36,764
Are you afraid to do it openly?

51
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,044
Chen Manni competed
by hiring a stand-in,

52
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:40,484
and she never draw sketches,

53
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,484
relying on marketing and good looks
to get popular.

Lu Cenyang, stop slandering me.

56
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:49,484
Besides
appearing on the show these days,

57
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:50,443
you've spent your time

58
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:51,723
hanging out with Yi Zihe.

59
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:52,484
Let me ask you.

60
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:53,883
When did you draw the design sketches?

61
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:55,324
When did you collect the materials?

62
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:57,563
Did you do that
in the hotel's restaurant, pool,

63
00:03:57,723 --> 00:03:58,964
or in bed?

64
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:00,123
You!

65
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:03,244
My assistants
can realize my creative ideas.

66
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:04,084
Just like Taylor,

67
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:05,843
he doesn't have to
deal with every design work.

68
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:07,443
Spatial renovation competition

69
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:09,163
is a contest between designers.

70
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:10,524
What the netizens want to see

71
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,723
is your design work

72
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:12,524
completed on your own.

73
00:04:13,324 --> 00:04:14,403
Through your designs,

74
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:16,163
they want to feel
the heart-stirring space

75
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:17,603
Your demeanor is dismissive.

76
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:18,483
Trying so hard

77
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:20,564
to become Lady Yi

78
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:23,043
is pointless.

79
00:04:24,204 --> 00:04:25,803
So what?

80
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:27,603
We can just make netizens see what they

81
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:28,283
want to see, right?

82
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:30,524
I'm not gonna let Bu Ran
defeated by you.

83
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,004
I had to share the proof
that you've hired

84
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:35,243
a stand-in online.

85
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,324
Is this how I told you?

86
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:44,884
What's this?

87
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:02,603
(So, Chen Manni
hired a stand-in for the contest.)

88
00:05:02,764 --> 00:05:03,764
(I didn't expect she did that.)

89
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,803
(Is this how I told you?)

90
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:05,363
(What's this?)

91
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:08,803
(Guys, she ruined her reputation.)

92
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:10,324
(I really liked her before.)

93
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:11,204
(She let me down.)

94
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:13,403
(Really disappointing.)

95
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:15,363
(Competing by hiring a stand-in)

96
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,803
(is shameless.)

97
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:20,204
(This guy is so ugly.)

98
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,403
(How could Chen Manni kiss it?)

99
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:22,204
Zihe.

100
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,483
Zihe, what should we do?

101
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:27,524
I asked you to keep a low profile.

102
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:29,088
You said it was for the marketing.

103
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:31,843
You wanna be criticized in public.

104
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:33,124
Don't pull me down.

105
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:34,723
Yi Zihe!

106
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:38,483
Open the door.

107
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:39,283
What do you mean?

108
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:40,163
Open it!

109
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:42,403
Open the door!

110
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:49,204
Yi Zihe,
are you still acting like a man?

111
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:50,764
You left me here all alone.

112
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,043
How am I gonna get back?

113
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:53,803
Yi Zihe!

114
00:05:58,644 --> 00:05:59,483
My bag!

115
00:05:59,644 --> 00:06:01,283
My bag is still in your car!

116
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,524
I wonder who helped us

117
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:07,803
turn the tide at the last second.

118
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:09,964
Thanks a lot!

119
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:12,964
We are relieved.

120
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:14,243
So let's enjoy our breakfast.

121
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,764
The wontons and xiaolongbao here
are delicious.

122
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:18,283
What a coincidence.

123
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,803
The BBQ is really tasty too.

124
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:21,964
Together next time.

125
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:23,803
Boss, two wonton servings, please.

126
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:24,764
Two xiaolongbao steamers.

127
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:25,403
Take a seat.

128
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:30,204
When Mr. Lu couldn't
squeeze in time for breakfast before,

129
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:31,444
I'd bring him some too.

130
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:33,324
Recently,
he's had meals before arriving.

131
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:35,004
I haven't been here in ages.

132
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,684
Let's give him a serving today.

133
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:40,444
These days,

134
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:41,964
I feel like I'm on edge all day

135
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:44,884
while persistent site issues occur.
I was afraid of being defeated by Yihua.

136
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:47,084
Fortunately, I haven't let anyone down.

137
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:49,723
Hey!

138
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,884
I've just joined the Extraordinary Place

139
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,603
to marry Yi Zihe.

140
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:55,124
You and Lu Cenyang are to blame.

141
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:56,964
You've ruined my happiness.

142
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:58,243
You'd better understand

143
00:06:58,403 --> 00:07:00,363
Yi Zihe toyed with your love.

144
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:01,524
That's why you lost so badly.

145
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:02,803
Had you not meddled,

146
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:04,964
I'd have met the Yi Family by now.

147
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,363
With your reputation,

148
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,803
why do you fret over
a scumbag like Yi Zihe?

149
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:10,483
You could rely on your own strength

150
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:11,603
to be respected.

151
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:12,964
So what?

152
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:14,843
How long must a designer struggle

153
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:16,204
to live the ideal life?

154
00:07:16,363 --> 00:07:17,564
What's the benefit of minor fame?

155
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:19,084
Anyone can critique the design,

156
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:20,243
and everyone can meddle.

157
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:21,603
Marry a wealthy handsome guy,

158
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:23,043
and have no concerns about clients.

159
00:07:23,204 --> 00:07:23,964
Isn't that good?

160
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:25,043
My admired senior,

161
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:26,723
how could you
have such negative thoughts?

162
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:28,124
My boss once said

163
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:29,243
accomplished individuals

164
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:30,843
don't need for extras

165
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:31,964
to boost their self-assurance.

166
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:33,723
It's the same in romantic relationships.

167
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:35,684
Your talent and ability
breed your confidence.

168
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:38,004
Creating your own empire
is the surest method.

169
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:40,204
Men aren't necessary for success.

170
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:43,803
Why are you laughing?

171
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,923
It's ironic
you advanced by relying on a man,

172
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,644
and you still have the guts
to lecture others?

173
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:50,124
Even a fool can see

174
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:51,283
Lu Cenyang likes you.

175
00:07:51,444 --> 00:07:52,964
He made an effort to help you defeat me.

176
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,483
Stop playing the innocent one.

177
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:56,723
In the end,

178
00:07:57,283 --> 00:07:58,444
what's the difference between us?

179
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,564
Are you done talking?

180
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:01,204
Yi Zihe toyed with your love,

181
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:02,163
not Bu Ran.

182
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:04,163
Dispute with Yi Zihe.

183
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:07,363
Just leave,
or I'll call the cops to escort you out.

184
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:14,723
Are you alright?

185
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:17,124
Anger makes people speak recklessly.

186
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:18,163
Just brush it off.

187
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:19,243
I'm fine.

188
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:20,524
Thank you, Ms. Yao.

189
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:38,204
Madam,

190
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:40,324
Zihe just had a bit of bad luck.

191
00:08:40,843 --> 00:08:42,643
Experiencing some failures and setbacks

192
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:45,164
is helpful for his growth.

193
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,883
Aren't you very fond of him?

194
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:54,924
Kexin,

195
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:56,763
I've always anticipated

196
00:08:57,084 --> 00:08:59,643
your son is more promising than mine.

197
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:01,084
But now it seems

198
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:03,763
he needs to marry a woman
as capable as you.

199
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:08,123
Otherwise, I can't count on
him in taking over family business.

200
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:11,924
I've still
got to tackle this dusty office.

201
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:22,164
Why are you waiting?

202
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,123
Tidy up Mr. Yi's office.

203
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:37,123
Come on.

204
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:37,964
Thank you.

205
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:42,363
Why didn't Bu Ran come with you?

206
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:43,643
Auntie Wang,

207
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:44,964
isn't my visit enough?

208
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:47,523
I'm happy you're here.

209
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:49,924
It's just I'm especially fond of Bu Ran.

210
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:51,804
Considering she's single,

211
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:52,924
I'm ready

212
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:54,123
to set her up with someone.

213
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:57,883
There are great guys
in my son's workplace.

214
00:09:58,243 --> 00:09:59,523
They're tall and handsome.

215
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:01,243
Can't wait for her to choose.

216
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,924
Well, Auntie Wang,

217
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:05,284
Bu Ran is very picky.

218
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:06,723
No need to trouble you.

219
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:10,444
Well,

220
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:12,044
Bu Ran is so excellent,

221
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:13,204
and she won't

222
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:14,564
even like those I introduced.

223
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:17,684
Take a look at my new home.

224
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:20,523
How did she make it look so great?

225
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:23,123
My granddaughter always
wants to come here every weekend.

226
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:24,643
I initially thought of her.

227
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,363
But now,

228
00:10:26,363 --> 00:10:27,964
it's a bit too noisy.

229
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:31,164
Have some water.

230
00:10:31,643 --> 00:10:32,404
Alright.

231
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:38,643
Granny, how much is this?

232
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:39,723
Ten yuan.

233
00:10:41,404 --> 00:10:42,243
Then I'll take one.

234
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:42,924
Okay.

235
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:51,243
Take care on your way.

236
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:58,564
You always visit Auntie Wang

237
00:10:58,564 --> 00:10:59,804
to check on my work?

238
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,763
It looks like my trip here
is unnecessary.

239
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:04,123
The netizens have already
given your work the thumbs up.

240
00:11:05,924 --> 00:11:07,444
Congratulations on your victory.

241
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:10,243
Chen Manni has told me all about it.

242
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:13,123
Your helped me a lot,

243
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:14,483
guaranteeing that I just need to

244
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:16,643
compete by using my skills.

245
00:11:18,523 --> 00:11:19,603
Keep working hard.

246
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:22,883
Sure, the boss always speaks like that.

247
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:24,003
It's not original.

248
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:29,444
(Even a fool can see)

249
00:11:29,603 --> 00:11:30,723
(Lu Cenyang likes you.)

250
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:34,084
I must visit Auntie Wang

251
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,404
to shoot a project graduation photo

252
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:37,084
and to check
for other matters to address.

253
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:39,243
Auntie Wang keeps raving about you.

254
00:11:39,404 --> 00:11:40,832
She can't wait to set you up
with someone.

255
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:42,324
Then I...

256
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:44,603
What?

257
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,684
You really want to go?

258
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:47,523
Have a walk with me.

259
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,123
I order you, as your boss.

260
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,003
Make sure to hang on tight!

261
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,324
You...

262
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,763
Park your e-scooter.

263
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:00,643
Let's walk.

264
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:08,603
Wait for me.

265
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:13,723
The ancient alley
is where my dad used to live.

266
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:16,243
I've come back with him a few times.

267
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:18,684
The folks around here
are friendly and down-to-earth.

268
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:20,363
In the business world for years,

269
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:22,483
I've adapted my speech
for various audiences.

270
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:24,684
So, this place just feels like home.

271
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:26,003
The people and scenery here,

272
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:26,924
and the grass and trees

273
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:29,804
look more beautiful.

274
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:33,643
Elders all prefer a slow-paced life.

275
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:35,084
Inspired by you,

276
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:37,204
I've really started
to like the vibe around here.

277
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:38,523
After you won the match,

278
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:40,084
you're brave as a lion.

279
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:42,243
You are so blunt.

280
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:43,763
I am joking.

281
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:47,164
The pace of life here

282
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:48,763
encourages people to stay calm.

283
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,324
It feels quite nice.

284
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,003
A slow life seems very close,

285
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:54,164
but in fact, it's luxurious.

286
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,324
Even I must wait

287
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:57,843
until Pinshang thoroughly defeats Yihua

288
00:12:58,003 --> 00:12:59,564
before relocating here.

289
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:03,084
What's your definition
of defeating Yihua?

290
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:05,483
When Yihua's business philosophy

291
00:13:05,643 --> 00:13:07,804
can be the same as Pinshang's,
and we can lead the industry

292
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:10,003
to bring more customers higher-quality

293
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:11,684
living spaces.

294
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:14,564
It'd also honor my dad's final wish.

295
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:18,483
Then you'll have to work hard.

296
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:20,684
What Yihua has always pursued

297
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,883
is scaling up and maximizing profit.

298
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:25,804
We must work together.

299
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,643
There and here as well.

300
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:32,564
During the blooming season,
many jade cicada flowers will blossom.

301
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:34,444
The message of the jade cicada
flowers is trust.

302
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:35,723
My dad believed in me.

303
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:37,523
So he entrusted me with the rest,

304
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:39,603
including his ideals
for the whole industry.

305
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,804
Many colleagues assisted me at the firm.

306
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:42,763
With you

307
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,284
and all the teams,

308
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:45,603
we strive together

309
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:47,243
and we can definitely realize it.

310
00:13:47,964 --> 00:13:49,444
Don't just pump me up.

311
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:51,003
Give me more challenges.

312
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:54,363
I'm really want to show what I can do.

313
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:56,723
Now's the time to tell you.

314
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:58,843
I've shared your designs
with the local council.

315
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:01,284
It has bolstered their confidence
in refurbishing the ancient alleys

316
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,684
to draw in visitors and boost revenue

317
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,763
to entice more youth
back to their hometowns.

318
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:08,763
I'm ready to bid for the ancient alleys.

319
00:14:09,523 --> 00:14:11,523
Looks like you got me
to join Extraordinary Place

320
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:13,643
for this big move.

321
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:15,404
I'm aware of your strengths.

322
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:17,523
You help me
clinch these prospective clients.

323
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:20,044
Now that you know
I can be your vanguard,

324
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:22,243
don't ruin my design vibe.

325
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:24,684
It's really hampered my design skills.

326
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,044
Designing for
Auntie Wang's place this time

327
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,523
was quite a tough job.

328
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:31,643
People with power
tend to play by their own rules.

329
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:32,643
I must test you

330
00:14:32,843 --> 00:14:34,483
to see if you will stay by my side

331
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:35,763
and weather the storm with me.

332
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,243
Don't move away

333
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,523
after being praised by me.

334
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:45,044
The company needs you more and more.

335
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:47,763
To make communication easier,

336
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:51,603

00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:20,364
Sorry,

372
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:21,964
I don't drink coffee in the afternoons.

373
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:24,523
I was inconsiderate.

374
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:25,563
Never mind.

375
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,723
Just another one of your specialties.

376
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:28,684
Sure.

377
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:30,043
Take a seat over there.

378
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,803
This contains milk with caramel added.

379
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:48,884
It helps with sleep.

380
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:51,243
Thank you.

381
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,204
I'm here today to book here.

382
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:00,723
Bu Ran's birthday is coming up.

383
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:02,884
I want to book here
for her birthday party.

384
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,523
Bu Ran will be delighted

385
00:18:04,723 --> 00:18:05,563
about your concern.

386
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:08,884
But if you're looking
to celebrate her birthday,

387
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:10,723
she can cherish your intent.

388
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:12,204
Bu Ran isn't into that.

389
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:14,323
In fact, she resists that.

390
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:17,723
Some people
dislike celebrating birthdays.

391
00:18:18,844 --> 00:18:19,763
You're considerate.

392
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:22,763
Bu Ran is a foodie.

393
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:24,483
- Excluding the inability to drink.
- Inability to drink.

394
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:29,924
What you said

395
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:32,323
shows that you really
concern for Bu Ran.

396
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:36,043
The one you actually like is her, right?

397
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:37,003
Keep it to myself.

398
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:38,924
Silent adoration

399
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:40,723
is wonderful,

400
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:44,243
but aren't you worried
someone might win her heart?

401
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:46,204
Bu Ran and I have been helping

402
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:47,083
each other out

403
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:47,964
since we first met.

404
00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:50,644
Nobody can just
shake up our relationship.

405
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,604
From what I know about her,

406
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:56,124
I bet she'd go for someone who steps up.

407
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:01,523
Since she
dislikes birthday celebrations,

408
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:03,644
I won't book here for now.

409
00:19:04,003 --> 00:19:04,763
I'll be leaving first.

410
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:07,283
Let's have a drink later, my treat.

411
00:19:08,204 --> 00:19:10,644
Treat me once your wish comes true.

412
00:19:11,723 --> 00:19:12,563
Be safe.

413
00:19:26,924 --> 00:19:27,964
Who's this lady?

414
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:29,723
Lu Cenyang's secretary.

415
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:33,043
I never thought
Bu Ran would hit it off with her.

416
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:34,083
Significant improvement.

417
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:35,964
Xu,

418
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:39,043
can I leave work a bit earlier today?

419
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:41,404
Bu Ran needs to attend
an award ceremony.

420
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,604
Later, I'll take her for a barbecue.

421
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:45,444
Since you've told me this,

422
00:19:45,924 --> 00:19:46,964
can I refuse?

423
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:48,644
Thanks, Xu.

424
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:56,204
You see?

425
00:19:56,644 --> 00:19:58,283
Fortune Pavilion's vibe doesn't suit me.

426
00:19:58,523 --> 00:20:00,604
Every time,
a nail appears in front of my car.

427
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:02,204
Looks like I still gotta move.

428
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,083
You promised to renew the lease.

429
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:08,444
It's no use backing out now.

430
00:20:08,723 --> 00:20:10,444
If it comes to it,
you can hitch a lift with me.

431
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:13,924
You must keep your word.

432
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:16,283
You don't trust me?

433
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:18,283
Right,

434
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:19,924
aren't you attending tonight

435
00:20:20,124 --> 00:20:21,483
the Extraordinary Place award ceremony?

436
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:22,043
I'll take you.

437
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:22,723
No need.

438
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:24,604
I've got plans
to meet with Qin Xun tonight.

439
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:26,404
His house renovation nears completion.

440
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:27,323
I need to check it.

441
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:29,283
Did you decorate Qin Xun's new house?

442
00:20:30,204 --> 00:20:30,523
How so?

443
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:32,404
Is the salary not enough
to cover expenses?

444
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:33,483
You have to take on private work?

445
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:35,083
I'm not charging for it.

446
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:36,763
Besides, I'm doing it in my spare time.

447
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,684
Why do you seem lost?

448
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:40,243
Friendship thrives on reciprocity.

449
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:42,604
He got me a bunch of votes
for defeating Chen Manni.

450
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:45,604
Plenty of people helped you get votes,
not just him.

451
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:46,723
You designed his house,

452
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:47,563
monitored the renovation,

453
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:48,763
and now join him for meals.

454
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:50,404
What about me? I made an effort too.

455
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:51,763
Shall we dine together first?

456
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:52,924
Visit his house later.

457
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:55,644
Boss, it's your duty to contribute.

458
00:20:56,043 --> 00:20:57,164
Are you going to fuss over this?

459
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:58,964
You're so petty.

460
00:20:59,444 --> 00:21:00,884
The kids at the orphanage said

461
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,563
that we're a prince and a princess.

462
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:03,323
No,

463
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,003
a prince and a princess.

464
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,604
Let's get along better.

465
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:08,204
We can't burst the bubble of fairytales

466
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:09,083
in kids' hearts.

467
00:21:09,283 --> 00:21:11,164
Have you ever
heard of such a petty prince?

468
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,164
Then anyone can be a prince.

469
00:21:13,803 --> 00:21:14,444
No time to talk.

470
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:15,763
I have to change and go.

471
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:21,083
Prince.

472
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,283
You've finished the Extraordinary Place,

473
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:39,604
and now you're here to help.

474
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:41,003
It's too hard on you.

475
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:43,164
I've ordered everything you like to eat.

476
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:44,003
Go ahead.

477
00:21:45,644 --> 00:21:46,884
During the recording
of Extraordinary Place,

478
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,283
Mr. Lu often had me over for meals.

479
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:50,043
Now that the show is over,

480
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,563
there's no more pressure.

481
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,803
Do I need to moderate my diet?

482
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,483
What are you talking about?

483
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:00,243
Can you refrain from it?

484
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:04,003
I won't spoil your intentions.

485
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:05,444
I'll just try a little.

486
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:07,444
If I eat too much, stop me.

487
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:13,803
Feel free to have as much as you like.

488
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,043
If you overeat, I'll diet with you.

489
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,043
Thanks for sparing time amid busyness

490
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:20,404
to help me with the renovation.

491
00:22:21,124 --> 00:22:22,884
Congrats
on winning the Extraordinary Place.

492
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:25,684
Cheers to a streak of luck
coming our way!

493
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:27,483
You've been working hard too.

494
00:22:27,604 --> 00:22:28,364
Busy with work

495
00:22:28,604 --> 00:22:29,763
and busy cheering for me.

496
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:31,243
Cheers.

497
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:31,964
Cheers.

498
00:22:37,243 --> 00:22:38,723
Your development continues to improve,

499
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:40,723
and I'm genuinely over the moon.

500
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:42,483
By the way,

501
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:45,404
Ms. Yao from Pinshang
came to visit Old Pal's.

502
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:48,124
She said she wants to book the venue
for your birthday party.

503
00:22:48,604 --> 00:22:49,723
Why?

504
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,684
You've shot to fame with just one fight.

505
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,444
She is the second
in command in Pinshang.

506
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:54,884
She sure wants to win you over.

507
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:55,604
Don't worry.

508
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:57,204
I said
you're not fond of birthday party.

509
00:22:57,404 --> 00:22:59,043
She's not trying to win me over.

510
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:00,803
Ms. Yao is quite a character.

511
00:23:01,124 --> 00:23:02,563
When you're not familiar with her,

512
00:23:02,684 --> 00:23:03,803
you might feel a bit of distance.

513
00:23:04,043 --> 00:23:05,684
But once you get to know her better,
you'll find

514
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,003
that she's kind
and easy to get along with.

515
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,364
After all,
I have to thank Mr. Lu's advising me

516
00:23:11,563 --> 00:23:12,844
to foster rapport with colleagues.

517
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:15,283
That's how
I gained such a great friendship.

518
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:17,323
Why does it sound like

519
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:19,604
Lu Cenyang's impact on you
is becoming more noticeable?

520
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:21,323
What's wrong with
picking up tips from the boss?

521
00:23:21,684 --> 00:23:22,803
I promised you that

522
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,083
when I make it big,

523
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:24,964
I'll make sure you

524
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,723
find out
who's your famous designer father.

525
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:31,803
Actually, I said that to motivate you.

526
00:23:32,003 --> 00:23:32,964
It just slipped out.

527
00:23:33,164 --> 00:23:34,364
It slipped my mind, actually.

528
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:35,684
You still let it get to you?

529
00:23:36,003 --> 00:23:37,964
You've always been there for me.

530
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:40,164
There's finally a spot
where I come in handy.

531
00:23:40,364 --> 00:23:41,323
I have to try hard.

532
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:45,164
I'll often need your help going forward.

533
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:48,684
Better to do it sooner than later.

534
00:23:49,124 --> 00:23:50,364
Dine at my home tomorrow night.

535
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,404
Sure.

536
00:23:53,124 --> 00:23:54,043
Then it's a deal.

537
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:55,763
I will prepare a meal

538
00:23:55,964 --> 00:23:57,243
even more lavish than now.

539
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,523
Remember to come early.

540
00:23:58,723 --> 00:24:00,844
I'll tell the folks next door

541
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:02,283
you are my girlfriend,

542
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,483
a design world's big shot.

543
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:05,763
I pretend to be your girlfriend?

544
00:24:07,003 --> 00:24:08,283
I'll need to hire a makeup artist

545
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:09,844
and dress up nicely before going.

546
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:11,483
You're just being humble.

547
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:13,844
I love your natural look.

548
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:15,243
Would you like to...?

549
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:18,964
You are Bu Ran from Extraordinary Place!

550
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:21,604
I love your designs.

551
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:24,364
I am studying spatial design.

552
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,283
Master,

553
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:27,523
can I get your autograph?

554
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:32,684
My handwriting is a bit ugly.

555
00:24:32,884 --> 00:24:33,644
Seriously?

556
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:35,924
Your signature must be
as beautiful as you are.

557
00:24:48,483 --> 00:24:49,124
Thank you.

558
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,964
I've got my fans.

559
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,964
I've been misjudging Lu Cenyang,

560
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,283
thinking he puts me down.

561
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:00,323
Now it seems he has some skills.

562
00:25:00,644 --> 00:25:02,124
He said he'd make me even better

563
00:25:02,364 --> 00:25:03,803
and he did what he said.

564
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:06,523
Being praised by fans for my looks

565
00:25:06,763 --> 00:25:07,763
feels quite nice.

566
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:09,964
I can eat two more skewers now.

567
00:25:12,323 --> 00:25:13,003
Eat more.

568
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:25,884
Why isn't she back yet?
It's getting late!

569
00:25:33,644 --> 00:25:35,483
Ensuring building safety
late into the night?

570
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,164
So diligent.

571
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:38,924
Will the property management fee
rise again?

572
00:25:39,124 --> 00:25:40,644
Mr. Lu?

573
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:42,204
It's not like that.

574
00:25:42,364 --> 00:25:44,204
I just happened to pass by.

575
00:25:44,444 --> 00:25:45,763
You should rest early.

576
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:53,283
What's the matter?

577
00:25:54,323 --> 00:25:55,083
You

578
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:57,444
come back so late?

579
00:25:58,364 --> 00:25:58,763
I...

580
00:25:58,964 --> 00:25:59,483
Nothing.

581
00:25:59,884 --> 00:26:01,803
I just had a quick word
with the security guard.

582
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:05,803
I'll whip up some noodles.

583
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:07,003
Would you like some?

584
00:26:10,844 --> 00:26:11,604
No, thanks.

585
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:14,523
Then you should rest early.

586
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:16,523
Tomorrow,
you'll officially join the Design Dept.

587
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:18,644
Don't talk too late with that friend.

588
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:19,684
I won't.

589
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:21,124
We've agreed
to reconvene tomorrow evening.

590
00:26:21,323 --> 00:26:22,043
Your effort shows.

591
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:24,563
Good night.

592
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:31,043
Gathering tomorrow night?

593
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:34,164
She hasn't had dinner with me yet.

594
00:26:53,523 --> 00:26:54,644
Bu Ran, congratulations.

595
00:26:54,884 --> 00:26:56,483
You contributed immediately
after joining the Design Dept.

596
00:26:58,043 --> 00:26:59,563
Thanks you for your guidance

597
00:26:59,723 --> 00:27:00,483
and voting.

598
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:02,644
I feel like
a longtime member of the Design Dept.

599
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:04,283
In the Marketing Dept.,

600
00:27:04,364 --> 00:27:05,444
you were known as a hard worker.

601
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:06,404
You were busy,

602
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:08,364
but you also solved our design issues.

603
00:27:08,763 --> 00:27:10,323
We really appreciated it.

604
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:11,563
Yep,

605
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,723
you even fixed Yang's computer.

606
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:14,404
Otherwise, her efforts would be wasted.

607
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:16,444
Congrats, Bu Ran.

608
00:27:17,124 --> 00:27:17,723
Bu Ran,

609
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:18,844
in our department,

610
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:20,043
we respect ability.

611
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:21,323
During the competition,

612
00:27:21,604 --> 00:27:22,644
all showcase their talents.

613
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:23,483
Nobody gives way here.

614
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:25,563
Once we've picked a plan,

615
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:27,844
we'll all pitch in
and work hard together.

616
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:30,323
This is why Pinshang's design
is strong and competitive.

617
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,164
Since you're here,

618
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:34,763
show us what you've got.

619
00:27:34,924 --> 00:27:35,563
Okay.

620
00:27:36,243 --> 00:27:37,204
There's much more to learn

621
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,523
from all you seniors.

622
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:40,644
Accept my worship.

623
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:42,604
Xu,

624
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:44,763
I'm craving some coffee
whipped up by Qin Xun.

625
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:45,563
Where is he?

626
00:27:47,243 --> 00:27:48,404
He took a day off today.

627
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:50,283
He's busy tidying up his new house.

628
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:51,323
After house makeover,

629
00:27:51,444 --> 00:27:53,483
he will invite friends
to a housewarming, right?

630
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:54,483
Are you going?

631
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:55,763
I have to mind the store.

632
00:27:56,444 --> 00:27:57,204
Besides,

633
00:27:57,964 --> 00:27:59,164
he's young.

634
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:01,204
He surely wants to invite girls over.

635
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:04,124
I don't want to be the third wheel.

636
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:07,964
Perfect timing,

637
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:09,563
I have something for you.

638
00:28:17,323 --> 00:28:18,364
It's a photo of Mr. Lu, me

639
00:28:18,523 --> 00:28:19,964
and little Siqi.

640
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:24,763
Mr. Lu and I were young back then.

641
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:29,404
When was this taken?

642
00:28:29,684 --> 00:28:31,563
I used to
deliver the coffee beans to Mr. Lu

643
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,323
when he wanted them.

644
00:28:33,844 --> 00:28:34,803
Once on a chilly day,

645
00:28:35,243 --> 00:28:38,364
he invited me to stay for a meal
and we took a photo together.

646
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:41,483
Back then,

647
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:44,563
Siqi was just a kid.

648
00:28:45,563 --> 00:28:46,444
Thank you, Xu.

649
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:48,164
You've given me more memories
to cherish.

650
00:28:48,924 --> 00:28:50,884
I'm set to refurbish the ancient alley.

651
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,043
These pics will really come in handy.

652
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:54,204
That's thoughtful.

653
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:55,844
Just a few photos.

654
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:56,964
No need to be formal with me.

655
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:01,083
Swing by with Siqi for a drink
whenever you're free.

656
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:03,083
She must have got the graceful posture

657
00:29:03,604 --> 00:29:06,204
from her father.

658
00:29:08,523 --> 00:29:10,043
Before Siqi gets her memory back,

659
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:11,684
I don't intend to expose her.

660
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:12,763
Please understand.

661
00:29:15,283 --> 00:29:16,043
All this time,

662
00:29:16,844 --> 00:29:17,884
you've been doing double duty,

663
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:18,684
as dad and brother.

664
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:20,003
Excellent effort!

665
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:23,283
Reflecting on how kind my dad's been,

666
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:25,003
it's nothing.

667
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:27,604
I'm leaving now.

668
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:28,964
An unexpected gain.

669
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:29,604
Thanks.

670
00:29:29,763 --> 00:29:30,404
Okay.

671
00:29:31,884 --> 00:29:32,604
Visit when free.

672
00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:33,364
Sure thing.

673
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,204
Came for my coffee?

674
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:42,884
He's looking to pry into

675
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:44,483
my evening plans with Bu Ran.

676
00:29:45,523 --> 00:29:46,803
I'm not the one to weigh in on that.

677
00:29:47,124 --> 00:29:49,364
But as you just heard,

678
00:29:49,844 --> 00:29:52,684
Lu Cenyang has Siqi's back.

679
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:56,723
Your dad is a good man,

680
00:29:57,323 --> 00:29:59,043
which is why there is a Lu Cenyang

681
00:29:59,243 --> 00:30:02,083
who sincerely guards
his family business and Siqi.

682
00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:05,964
You've known who I am this whole time.

683
00:30:06,964 --> 00:30:08,404
Yet he provided the parental affection

684
00:30:08,563 --> 00:30:09,604
to someone else.

685
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:12,323
To me, he's still a bad father.

686
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:15,003
Are you planning to
take out your resentment towards Mingyu

687
00:30:15,243 --> 00:30:16,884
on Lu Cenyang?

688
00:30:23,043 --> 00:30:25,404
Before she passed away,
my mom made a point to tell me

689
00:30:25,404 --> 00:30:27,003
to fight for what belongs to me.

690
00:30:28,444 --> 00:30:30,763
She couldn't get rid of the cheater
until the day she died.

691
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,323
But now Siqi has lost all her memories,

692
00:30:35,523 --> 00:30:36,563
and I can't bear to be cruel.

693
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,723
It no longer matters.

694
00:30:40,723 --> 00:30:41,924
Bu Ran is who I aim for.

695
00:31:13,323 --> 00:31:14,323
Where is everyone?

696
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:19,884
Time sure flies in the Design Dept.

697
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:22,444
I should leave now

698
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:25,364
to avoid another round of nagging
from Qin Xun.

699
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:47,404
We know your lunar birthday.

700
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:49,003
Per the tradition of Design Dept.,

701
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:50,684
we need to whip up a cake.

702
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,684
Birthday wishes

703
00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:53,644
can't be left out either.

704
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:56,684
Three, two, one.

705
00:31:57,164 --> 00:31:58,083
- Bu Ran,
- Bu Ran,

706
00:31:58,323 --> 00:32:01,364
- you really spice up the Design Dept.
- you really spice up the Design Dept.

707
00:32:02,364 --> 00:32:03,283
Thank you, everyone.

708
00:32:03,803 --> 00:32:04,364
Put out them.

709
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:05,563
We'll leave then.

710
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:07,924
Let's do it together.

711
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:08,723
Okay.

712
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:18,083
Mr. Li,

713
00:32:18,964 --> 00:32:20,043
this is from the Design Dept.

714
00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:20,884
Please have a taste.

715
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:22,483
Thank you.

716
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25,364
Today is your birthday?

717
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:28,204
The company brims with warm individuals.

718
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:29,684
Mr. Li is my first friend

719
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:30,964
at Pinshang.

720
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,243
Finish the cake.

721
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:34,844
Of course.

722
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:37,763
Isn't Mr. Lu supposed to be

723
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:39,444
your first friend at the company?

724
00:32:40,844 --> 00:32:42,844
What makes me worthy
of being his friend?

725
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:45,604
He is the powerful support
I need to cling to.

726
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:47,164
I must be polite to him.

727
00:32:48,043 --> 00:32:49,483
I'm not implying anything else.

728
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:51,124
Just a heads-up.

729
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,563
No matter he's your friend

730
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:54,684
or your support,

731
00:32:55,483 --> 00:32:56,043
since

732
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:58,684
you've invited me to cake,

733
00:32:59,364 --> 00:33:00,323
have you invited him?

734
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:02,563
If you skip over Mr. Lu,

735
00:33:03,124 --> 00:33:05,083
doesn't that come off as a bit forced?

736
00:33:22,844 --> 00:33:23,483
Mr. Lu,

737
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,563
the design team prepped it for me.

738
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:27,204
It tastes good.

739
00:33:27,364 --> 00:33:28,323
Mr. Lu, have a piece too.

740
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:30,763
It's your birthday.

741
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:31,964
I didn't prepare a gift.

742
00:33:32,164 --> 00:33:33,364
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

743
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:34,604
No need.

744
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,083
I rarely celebrate my birthday.

745
00:33:36,563 --> 00:33:39,083
Birthdays just
make me feel like I'm aging.

746
00:33:40,364 --> 00:33:41,483
My coworkers are super into it,

747
00:33:41,723 --> 00:33:43,563
and it'd be wasteful
to ignore their prepared cake.

748
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:44,924
So I've asked all to help finish it.

749
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:46,483
I also dislike birthday parties.

750
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,003
The birthday on my ID card

751
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:50,323
is estimated and filled in
by the director of the orphanage.

752
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:51,124
I'm someone

753
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:53,043
who doesn't know their own birthday.

754
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:54,644
Little cause for celebration.

755
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:58,884
Your words make me feel like
I might be a bit melodramatic.

756
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:01,763
But for birthdays,

757
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,323
I have been picky since I was young.

758
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:05,204
If there's not a special gift

759
00:34:05,204 --> 00:34:06,283
or special arrangements,

760
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:07,323
I'd prefer to skip it.

761
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,563
Otherwise,
I won't feel good about myself at all.

762
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:14,043
I've delayed your off time.

763
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:15,003
I'll leave.

764
00:34:16,964 --> 00:34:17,643
Mr. Li.

765
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:25,404
No offense,

766
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:28,563
but why did it take you a bit longer
to catch on today?

767
00:34:28,964 --> 00:34:30,163
She had another appointment.

768
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:31,244
I made plans too late.

769
00:34:31,964 --> 00:34:32,804
So what?

770
00:34:33,163 --> 00:34:35,444
If it's still before midnight,
you've got time.

771
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:38,203
That makes sense.

772
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,163
I'll go get ready.

773
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:45,284
Coming.

774
00:34:49,884 --> 00:34:50,924
Welcome.

775
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,364
Who designed your home?

776
00:34:55,364 --> 00:34:57,003
It's really nice.

777
00:34:57,404 --> 00:34:58,884
That's definitely

778
00:34:58,884 --> 00:35:00,724
designer Bu's work.

779
00:35:02,444 --> 00:35:03,083
What do you think?

780
00:35:04,444 --> 00:35:06,043
Why did you make so much food?

781
00:35:06,163 --> 00:35:07,083
Can we finish all this?

782
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:08,324
Isn't that wasteful?

783
00:35:08,683 --> 00:35:10,083
Today is a special day.

784
00:35:10,244 --> 00:35:11,764
We should celebrate,

785
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:12,603
right?

786
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:14,364
I also need to show off a bit.

787
00:35:14,724 --> 00:35:16,683
The dishes I prepared are
all for pairing with wine.

788
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:18,003
Let's have a drink in a bit.

789
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:18,724
Alright.

790
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,284
I can build up my booze tolerance.

791
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:21,083
Okay.

792
00:35:23,043 --> 00:35:25,364
The new layout's a whole lot cozier.

793
00:35:34,244 --> 00:35:36,924
Does this photo look decent enough?

794
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:37,804
Like a family.

795
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:38,724
Please.

796
00:35:39,444 --> 00:35:40,483
Don't treat me as

797
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:42,123
an excuse for not dating.

798
00:35:46,924 --> 00:35:48,563
This is a fruit wine.

799
00:35:49,003 --> 00:35:50,724
It soothes with mild alcohol.

800
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:53,603
Give it a try.

801
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:56,324
Thank you.

802
00:36:03,483 --> 00:36:05,284
Congratulations on our new beginning!

803
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:06,563
You've moved into a new house

804
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,364
and I've transferred
to a new department.

805
00:36:10,244 --> 00:36:10,724
Cheers.

806
00:36:18,324 --> 00:36:19,083
Actually,

807
00:36:19,203 --> 00:36:21,163
when you defeated Chen Manni,

808
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:22,244
we should've celebrated then.

809
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:24,444
Back then,
your popularity really skyrocketed.

810
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,123
It was too thrilling.

811
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,724
A lucky win.

812
00:36:28,003 --> 00:36:30,284
Thanks to Mr. Lu
for totally turning my situation around!

813
00:36:32,284 --> 00:36:34,724
He's pretty much
become your unsung hero.

814
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:36,683
Are you still thinking of moving?

815
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,043
I'm fond of the Design Dept.

816
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:39,163
and the vibe at work now.

817
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,523
I'm hoping to continue
to work for Pinshang if possible.

818
00:36:42,563 --> 00:36:43,683
I mean,

819
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,203
are you thinking about
moving out of Fortune Pavilion?

820
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,844
It's a real hassle.

821
00:36:55,724 --> 00:36:58,123
Is it the charm of Pinshang
that attracts you,

822
00:36:58,284 --> 00:37:00,844
or the personal charm of Lu Cenyang?

823
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:04,523
The food you cook
is what I love the most.

824
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:05,724
Let me have a taste first.

825
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:09,083
Just drinking and eating is dull.

826
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:10,884
Let's play Truth or Dare.

827
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:13,324
Man, that game is old school.

828
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:14,523
So boring.

829
00:37:14,643 --> 00:37:15,203
I'm out.

830
00:37:15,364 --> 00:37:15,964
Don't worry.

831
00:37:15,964 --> 00:37:17,404
As long as you don't choose Dare,

832
00:37:17,563 --> 00:37:18,523
I'll make it easy for you,

833
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:19,884
and I won't force extreme actions.

834
00:37:20,163 --> 00:37:21,844
We've known each other
for so many years.

835
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,163
I don't have anything to ask.

836
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,203
You don't,

837
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:25,404
but I do.

838
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:27,884
Considering all these I've made,

839
00:37:27,884 --> 00:37:28,884
join me for a few rounds.

840
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:31,924
Fine.

841
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:42,203
Truth or Dare?

842
00:37:42,523 --> 00:37:43,203
Truth.

843
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:47,284
What's your type?

844
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:53,444
First off,
he has to be tall and stand straight

845
00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:54,683
for my peace of mind.

846
00:37:55,163 --> 00:37:56,163
And his look.

847
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:57,764
He should look good.

848
00:37:58,284 --> 00:37:59,603
And he has to be considerate

849
00:37:59,603 --> 00:38:01,043
and able to protect me.

850
00:38:02,444 --> 00:38:03,203
Sort of like that.

851
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:05,163
I just thought for a sec.

852
00:38:06,404 --> 00:38:08,083
Seems like
I've got everything you're looking for.

853
00:38:08,284 --> 00:38:09,083
Stop it.

854
00:38:10,003 --> 00:38:11,083
