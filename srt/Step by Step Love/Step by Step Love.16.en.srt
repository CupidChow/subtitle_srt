(The girl from the Yi Family)

21
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:00,475
Hello.

22
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:01,475
Boss.

23
00:02:02,074 --> 00:02:04,395
The video Chen Manni identifying
Bu Ran as a member of the Yi Family

24
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:05,994
has been shared by many media outlets.

25
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:07,874
The topic points to

26
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,074
Bu Ran winning against Chen Manni
with the help of Yi Family.

27
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:12,354
Before public opinion ferments,

28
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:14,195
I'll have the PR department
handle it urgently.

29
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:15,954
No need.

30
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,114
The fewer people in the company know,
the better.

31
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:19,074
I'll handle it.

32
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:21,275
(I want to see what your background is.)

33
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:23,674
(You have the ability to influence
the outcome of the competition.)

34
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:26,354
(The result is really surprising.)

35
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:28,715
(You're Yi Zihe's cousin.)

36
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:30,514
No matter what happens,

37
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:31,875
I'll stand by you.

38
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:35,315
He has already been good enough to me.

39
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:37,954
Once he knows my identity,

40
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:39,954
he must be very disappointed.

41
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:43,475
Uncle Li,

42
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:46,475
I don't want to the PR department
to deal with Bu Ran's matter.

43
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,954
So I can only ask for your help.

44
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:50,114
I've helped your father liaise
with various media in the past.

45
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:52,834
Now is a good chance
to see how many people

46
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:54,315
still recognize me.

47
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:04,354
Hello, Jin?

48
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:06,354
The major accounts you manage

49
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,755
have posted the video
of Bu Ran's altercation with Chen Manni.

50
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:10,074
Please delete it for my favor.

51
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:12,074
I want to protect the privacy
of our company's employee.

52
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:12,954
Yang.

53
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:14,394
It's me.

54
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:19,275
Alright.

55
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:21,114
Buddy, the situation is quite tricky.

56
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:22,195
You must help me out.

57
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:23,195
Okay.

58
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:24,315
Just wait a moment.

59
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:28,275
It's okay now.

60
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:38,514
Is this Reporter Li
from Jiangchen Media?

61
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:46,275
(How come it's gone?)

62
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:47,794
(Could he have already seen it?)

63
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:57,595
I'll talk to him.

64
00:03:58,755 --> 00:03:59,794
I'll say it.

65
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:02,275
At the worst,

66
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:04,995
it might be a farewell.

67
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:07,554
I should be more sincere.

68
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:27,395
No one is there.

69
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:33,434
Maybe the property management did it?

70
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:35,635
And he hasn't come to ask you yet
even by now.

71
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:36,915
Perhaps he didn't see it.

72
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:37,835
Impossible.

73
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:40,395
The video has been uploaded
and started to get attention online.

74
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:41,915
He and my colleagues will all see it.

75
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:45,794
The outcome is decided.

76
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:47,994
I am mentally prepared.

77
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:50,715
Bu Ran,

78
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:52,395
listen carefully.

79
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:54,314
You're from Yi Family,

80
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:56,155
and it shouldn't be a shackle
you have to bear.

81
00:04:57,915 --> 00:04:59,075
And relax,

82
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:01,994
Lu Cenyang isn't an unreasonable person.

83
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:05,155
I'm fine.

84
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:06,515
It's getting late.

85
00:05:06,794 --> 00:05:07,754
You should go back and rest.

86
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:08,994
Can you manage on your own?

87
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,434
You can't wrap fire with paper.

88
00:05:13,554 --> 00:05:14,515
I indeed approached him

89
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:16,354
due to an agreement with my grandma.

90
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,234
Although after I joined Pinshang,

91
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:20,595
I never accepted grandma's demands.

92
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:23,314
But I never took the initiative
to come clean to him

93
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:24,595
that I'm from the Yi Family.

94
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:26,314
If in his shoes,

95
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:28,114
anyone

96
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:29,794
would feel disappointed and betrayed

97
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:32,994
after knowing the truth.

98
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:37,595
No matter what, I owe him an apology.

99
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:41,395
I will adjust myself.

100
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,035
I'll call you if anything.

101
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:44,275
You go back now.

You stayed up late?

132
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:45,314

that someone splashed paint

called me about it.

I saw you were too anxious.

166
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,714

00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:01,794
Sorry for the trouble.

185
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:03,594
Hi, Bu Ran.

186
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:04,794
Morning, Bu Ran.

187
00:12:05,554 --> 00:12:06,395
Morning, Bu Ran.

188
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:07,314
Morning.

189
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:07,915
Bu Ran.

190
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:08,915
Good morning.

191
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:09,515
Morning.

192
00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:11,875
(Everyone didn't see
Chen Manni's video, either?)

193
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:13,235
Morning.

194
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:19,155
I really underestimated you.

195
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:23,474
Able to delete all videos overnight.

196
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:27,074
Unfortunately, I'm a living witness.

197
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,115
Today, I'm going to tell all the staff
at Pinshang.

198
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:32,235
You are granddaughter of Ms. Hua,

199
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:34,115
a spy sent by Yihua to Pinshang.

200
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:35,474
A spy?

201
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:37,594
What's she talking about?
Must be fake, right?

202
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,115
How could she say that about Bu Ran?

203
00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:40,954
Exactly.

204
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:42,554
Can't she stand to lose?

205
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:45,554
Chen Manni, accuse with proof.

206
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:47,594
You said I'm a spy sent by Yihua.

207
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:48,474
Then let me ask you.

208
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:49,635
After I came here,

209
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:51,074
has Pinshang lost to the Yi Family?

210
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,474
People lurking in the rival company

211
00:12:53,635 --> 00:12:55,155
won't be exposed right away.

212
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:02,194
If you insist on denying
your relation with Yihua,

213
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:03,155
fine.

214
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:05,755
Last night, I contacted the academy.

215
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,834
I got your student loan information.

216
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:10,875
It was Ms. Hua who guaranteed your loan.

217
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,794
Never expected she really is
a spy sent by Yihua.

218
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:13,714
Then she's truly a spy.

219
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:14,474
Exactly.

220
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:15,995
She shouldn't stay in our company.

221
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:16,674
It was hard to see.

222
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:18,594
(Mr. Lu, come to the company quickly.)

223
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:21,275
Haven't thought Bu Ran is like this.

224
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:21,834
Exactly.

225
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:22,915
How could she be like this?

226
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:24,155
She still has the nerve to be here.

227
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:26,074
Can't believe that such people exist.

228
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:30,314
I watched the video.

229
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:32,875
Never thought

230
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:35,515
you would stoop to the level
of a junior designer at our company.

231
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:36,714
Well,

232
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:38,995
are you here to speak for Bu Ran?

233
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:40,434
Quite the contrary.

234
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:42,554
My goal aligns with yours.

235
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:44,674
I particularly despise the Yi Family.

236
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,635
You could say the hatred is deep-rooted.

237
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,995
If you can drive out Bu Ran with me,

238
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:52,594
then in the future,

239
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:55,714
we will have many opportunities
for deep collaboration.

240
00:13:58,074 --> 00:13:58,714
Well.

241
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:00,834
Don't you want to work with Pinshang?

242
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:06,314
Didn't expect her to be a traitor.

243
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:07,635
I trusted her a lot.

244
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:08,474
Me too.

245
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,355
How could she do such a thing?

246
00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:11,674
She betrayed the company.

247
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:13,834
Ms. Yao,

248
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:16,275
I never thought of betraying Pinshang.

249
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:17,755
Ms. Yao, please believe me.

250
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:18,674
Ms. Yao.

251
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:21,714
Get away, you spy from Yihua.

252
00:14:25,194 --> 00:14:25,875
Let's go.

253
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:29,115
Right.

254
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:30,035
She just left like that?

255
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:30,794
They're from Yihua.

256
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,115
Indeed, unbelievable.

257
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:33,035
Who is this guy?

258
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,515
They're cold and unfeeling.
No need to linger here.

259
00:14:40,954 --> 00:14:41,594
Bu Ran.

260
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:45,355
Mr. Lu,

261
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,474
I never thought the famous Pinshang

262
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:49,995
would also be an unreasonable place.

263
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,235
Bu Ran should never have stayed here.

264
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,915
Bu Ran, no matter what others say,

265
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,515
I believe you.

266
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,995
You deleted Chen Manni's video, right?

267
00:15:02,554 --> 00:15:03,794
You knew it all along.

268
00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:05,515
Why pretend not to know?

269
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:07,115
What is your real motive?

270
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,434
Indeed, Mr. Lu made countless calls

271
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:11,674
to have these videos deleted.

272
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:15,474
He didn't sleep at all last night,

273
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:17,834
calling all the time.

274
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:19,915
He was worried about Bu Ran.

275
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:21,915
Mr. Lu,

276
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,594
good deeds should be acknowledged.

277
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:26,674
Otherwise, how would others know

278
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:28,834
what you are really thinking?

279
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:37,235
You did PR for me on all websites
last night?

280
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:41,635
Yes.

281
00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:43,155
And

282
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:45,995
I've known for a long time
that you're the daughter of Yi Minde.

283
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:50,834
Lu Cenyang,

284
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,915
you wouldn't be planning

285
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:56,074
to keep Bu Ran

286
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:57,995
and exploit her trust in you.

287
00:15:58,194 --> 00:16:00,155
So someday you can
turn the tables on Yihua.

288
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:07,235
This man is too scheming. Let's go.

289
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:09,194
I don't want Yi Family

290
00:16:09,355 --> 00:16:10,834
to become an obstacle between us.

291
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:14,875
Because

292
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:18,235
I like you.

293
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:24,474
I really, really like you.

298

Lu Cenyang,

299
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:52,915
you not only want people's life

300
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:54,794
but also want them to give their hearts.

301
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:02,074
Bu Ran,

302
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:04,954
it's a blessing in disguise.

303
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,474
We have seen his insidious plot.

304
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:07,635
Let's go.

305
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,155
Let's get away from him.

I seem to have said the wrong thing.

313
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:09,555
It's okay.

314
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:12,714
Bu Ran was clearly set up by someone.

315
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,514
I don't know what will happen next.

316
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:18,994
I'll settle accounts with them.

317
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:22,395
Uncle Li, I have a favor to ask of you.

318
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:24,115
For someone like Bu Ran,

319
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:25,835
she should be moving out very soon.

320
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:28,234
I hope you can help me delay the time.

321
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:29,754
Okay.

322
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:44,635
(Though my wife often scolded me,)

323
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:46,355
(fortunately, this woman)

324
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:48,754
(has quite effective tricks
against Bu Ran.)

325
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,635
(The generous gift given to Bu Ran)

326
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:53,355
(is spot on.)

327
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:09,595
Let's go.

328
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,754
Ms. Bu, happy birthday.

329
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,194
Is this a benefit prepared by
property management for homeowners?

330
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:32,555
No.

331
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:35,155
It's because I did something
that violated professional ethics.

332
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,674
And it affected your life.

333
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:37,714
I am sorry.

334
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:39,635
Ms. Bu,

335
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:42,555
Mr. Lu said
if I don't get your forgiveness,

336
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:44,274
I won't have good days ahead.

337
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:47,395
What did you do?

338
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:48,355
I...

339
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,075
Explain clearly.

340
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:49,994
I...

341
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:52,795
I took a bribe from Mr. Yi Mincai.

342
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:55,514
He wanted me
to tail after Bu Ran and Mr. Lu.

343
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,075
He gave me some money

344
00:19:57,234 --> 00:19:58,555
to splash paint and write those words

345
00:19:58,674 --> 00:19:59,754
to expose that Ms. Bu is

346
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:01,514
from the Yi Family.

347
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:02,754
How dare you come here?

348
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:03,514
Qin Xun,

349
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:05,075
I want to talk to him.

350
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:12,595
So it was Uncle who made you expose me?

351
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:13,674
Yes.

352
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,075
But I'm just doing my job
for the payment.

353
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:17,395
Could you please forgive me?

354
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:22,194
I won't hold it against you, you can go.

355
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:23,714
Ms. Bu,

356
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:26,194
then, could you give Mr. Lu a call

357
00:20:26,315 --> 00:20:28,115
and tell him
that you don't hold a grudge against me?

358
00:20:28,315 --> 00:20:30,635
Otherwise, I'll lose my job.

359
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:33,034
I'm begging you, please.

360
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:33,754
Bu Ran,

361
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:35,954
this could be another
trick of Lu Cenyang.

362
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:41,474
I'm begging you.

363
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:53,115
It'll be good if you forgive him.

364
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:54,474
If I'm not mistaken,

365
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,115
you and Qin Xun have already packed up,

366
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:57,155
ready to move out.

367
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,635
Don't rush off.

368
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:01,155
Today is your solar birthday.

369
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:03,234
Wait for me.

370
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:06,034
I will go to Yihua
to get you a special gift.

371
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:06,835
Go.

372
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,674
After you receive the gift,

373
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:10,315
you can decide.

374
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:17,234
Thank you.

375
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:23,115
What brings you here so suddenly?

376
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:25,115
I wanted to inquire about something
with Ms. Hua.

377
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:29,395
When my father signed a contract
with you at the villa years ago,

378
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:31,514
I met a student,

379
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:33,875
who was kneeling in the rain,
seeking your help for her studies.

380
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:35,474
Is she your granddaughter?

381
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:37,474
I have only one grandson.

382
00:21:37,915 --> 00:21:40,915
I heard that your eldest son,
Yi Minde, has a daughter.

383
00:21:41,514 --> 00:21:43,395
Yi Minde has already severed ties
with us.

384
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:46,315
His daughter has nothing to do with me.

385
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:48,595
Even if I did help a student,

386
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:50,034
it was an act of kindness.

387
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:55,795
Then let me get straight to the point.

388
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:57,728
Someone can't stand
to see Ran doing well,

389
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:58,954
and has been playing dirty,

390
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:00,635
exposing her
as a member of the Yi Family.

391
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:02,875
It very embarrassed her at Pinshang.

392
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:04,555
But actually,

393
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:06,714
I have known her true identity
for a long time.

394
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,595
As I empathize with her circumstances,

395
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:12,595
I've given her more help and care.

396
00:22:13,194 --> 00:22:13,835
Mr. Lu,

397
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:16,274
whom you want to help and care
is your business.

398
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:18,075
You don't need to report to us.

399
00:22:18,555 --> 00:22:19,875
I want to tell Ms. Hua

400
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:21,714
that Bu Ran's real identity

401
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:23,595
was exposed by your own people.

402
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:26,514
It Indicates serious infighting
within the Yi Family.

403
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:27,915
I had been wondering

404
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:29,915
if it was because
Yihua was too formidable

405
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,194
to take me seriously.

406
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,075
So you resort to such clumsy means.

407
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:35,395
Or it was simply very low-level.

408
00:22:35,714 --> 00:22:36,795
The former Yihua is the one

409
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:39,474
I truly want to take revenge on.

410
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:41,115
As for you now,

411
00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:43,635
I might as well
provoke infighting among you.

412
00:22:44,474 --> 00:22:45,795
You're not worth my effort.

413
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:47,514
Stop beating around the bush.

414
00:22:48,155 --> 00:22:49,674
You say there's infighting among us.

415
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:50,875
Do you have evidence?

416
00:22:51,274 --> 00:22:53,315
Chen Manni, to redeem her dignity,

417
00:22:53,835 --> 00:22:55,474
constantly picks on Bu Ran,

418
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,875
losing both status and grace.

419
00:22:58,395 --> 00:22:59,835
I never understood why.

420
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:02,115
Unless someone offers a handsome reward

421
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,115
to buy her off.

422
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:04,434
Ms. Hua,

423
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:07,514
as for the person who did it,

424
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,315
you are able to find out quite easily.

425
00:23:10,274 --> 00:23:12,194
The Yi Family never had infighting.

426
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:14,034
Mr. Lu,

427
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:15,795
you don't need to

428
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,555
deliberately instigate trouble here.

429
00:23:18,754 --> 00:23:20,315
Ms. Hua, you really keep a tight lip.

430
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:22,315
Then let me guess what's on your mind.

431
00:23:23,395 --> 00:23:25,714
Actually, as for what Bu Ran is to you,

432
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:27,234
I have thought about it before.

433
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:29,514
And only after talking to Uncle Minde
did I realize

434
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,274
due to Uncle Minde's disobedience,

435
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:34,754
Ms. Hua never regards Bu Ran
as her own granddaughter.

436
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:36,514
While you dote on Yi Zihe,

437
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:38,155
you are harsh to Bu Ran,

438
00:23:38,555 --> 00:23:40,514
forcing Uncle Minde to support Bu Ran

439
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:41,795
to come to Pinshang.

440
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,795
You must be very clear in your mind

441
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:46,714
that relying on a rookie designer

442
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,395
won't deal me any severe blow.

443
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,954
You have expectations for Bu Ran,

444
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:54,155
hoping she can be valued at Pinshang

445
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:56,355
and then fall hard again,

446
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:59,274
thus to intensify the conflict
between me and Uncle Minde.

447
00:24:00,075 --> 00:24:02,474
The third party benefits
from the tussle.

448
00:24:03,954 --> 00:24:05,714
I advise you to drop this idea.

449
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:07,434
It's no use.

450
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,155
Stop being so self-righteous here.

451
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:12,835
You couldn't possibly guess
what my mom is thinking.

452
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:16,034
Otherwise, you might as well
take over Yihua.

453
00:24:17,994 --> 00:24:19,155
Enough with this.

454
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:20,395
Mr. Lu,

455
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,395
what is your purpose for coming here?

456
00:24:26,994 --> 00:24:28,315
I've just come to show my stance.

457
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:30,395
Bu Ran is the woman I like.

458
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:33,194
Whoever dares to scheme against her,

459
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:35,474
I will make sure they pay back double.

460
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:36,555
Lu Cenyang,

461
00:24:37,115 --> 00:24:38,555
this is Yihua headquarters.

462
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:40,395
It's not your turn to threaten us.

463
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:42,474
Mr. Yi has bought off
the security at Fortune Pavilion.

464
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:44,674
Do you know
why I haven't exposed it all along?

465
00:24:45,474 --> 00:24:46,954
Because I want to track down with clues,

466
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:49,315
tracing the security's source of income.

467
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,474
The money you gave to the security

468
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:53,115
came from a shareholder

469
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:54,635
of the gallery, a shell company, right?

470
00:24:55,635 --> 00:24:57,075
Then it's best you be sensible.

471
00:24:58,274 --> 00:24:59,155
Or else,

472
00:24:59,595 --> 00:25:02,395
the Yi Family's use
of a shell company for money laundering

473
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:05,155
is something I believe
the public would be very interested in.

474
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:09,434
Mincai, get down to it now.

475
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:11,155
Find out which audacious employee

476
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:13,635
took it upon themselves
to create a shell company

477
00:25:14,075 --> 00:25:16,954
and engaged in illegal activities
behind Yihua's back.

478
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,355
Once found out,
punish severely without leniency.

479
00:25:21,674 --> 00:25:24,835
To thank Mr. Lu for his kind reminder,

480
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:28,714
you should thoroughly investigate.

481
00:25:29,754 --> 00:25:31,835
Whoever has been troubling Bu Ran,

482
00:25:32,395 --> 00:25:34,395
dismiss and settle with all of them.

483
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,395
It's best this way.

484
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:41,875
If I find out
you're scheming against Bu Ran again,

485
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:44,795
I will certainly squeeze out your tears

486
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:47,155
to water the flowers.

487
00:26:02,954 --> 00:26:04,315
(Bu Ran is Hua Lan's granddaughter.)

488
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:05,635
(When she came here,)

489
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:07,034
it was just as Chen Manni said,

490
00:26:07,194 --> 00:26:08,115
she came to be a spy.

491
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:09,875
A spy?

492
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,234
Really a spy?

493
00:26:11,234 --> 00:26:12,274
Of course she is.

494
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:14,954
Otherwise,
why wouldn't she stick with Yihua?

495
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:15,994
Why come to us?

496
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:16,474
Hello, Mr. Lu.

497
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:17,714
Right.

498
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,994
Then she really has ill intentions.

499
00:26:20,034 --> 00:26:20,714
That makes sense.

500
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:21,795
Everybody be quiet.

501
00:26:22,075 --> 00:26:23,795
Mr. Lu wants you to hear this.

502
00:26:26,395 --> 00:26:28,994
When my father signed the contract
with you at the villa,

503
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:31,034
I met a student,

504
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:33,474
who was kneeling in the rain,
seeking your help for her studies.

505
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:35,115
Is she your granddaughter?

506
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:42,474
She's over there.

507
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:44,635
What would you like to drink?
Xun'll get it for you.

508
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:47,674
Thank you.

509
00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:07,674
Sorry for being late.

510
00:27:12,635 --> 00:27:13,355
Not at all.

511
00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:15,994
I actually have something to tell you.

512
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:20,595
After I finish moving,

513
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:23,395
I will return the keys to you
as soon as possible.

514
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:26,395
I will send

515
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:29,674
the resignation letter
to the HR email tomorrow.

516
00:27:31,754 --> 00:27:33,474
I lied that I didn't know
about your identity.

517
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:35,395
Because I wanted you

518
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:37,555
to do what you truly want at Pinshang.

519
00:27:38,635 --> 00:27:39,875
It caused you trouble.

520
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:42,795
I apologize to you.

521
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:45,754
I'm sorry.

522
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:48,474
I am the one who should apologize.

523
00:27:50,595 --> 00:27:53,355
When I first approached you,
I did have an ulterior motive.

524
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,714
But from the moment
I accepted your invitation,

525
00:27:57,395 --> 00:27:59,474
the agreement with my grandmother
was voided.

526
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,714
I came to Pinshang

527
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:03,395
simply because I want to be

528
00:28:03,555 --> 00:28:05,034
a genuine interior designer.

529
00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:06,315
I know.

530
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:08,395
And what about you?

531
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:14,514
Have you ever thought about
exploiting my identity

532
00:28:14,674 --> 00:28:15,514
to go against the Yis?

533
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:21,395
That did cross my mind.

534
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:25,115
For what happened back then,

535
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:26,514
your dad had no choice,

536
00:28:27,714 --> 00:28:29,355
and he paid the price for his actions

537
00:28:29,514 --> 00:28:30,355
indeed.

538
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:32,954
But my father is dead.

539
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:36,274
Though it wasn't intentional,

540
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:38,915
the result cannot be changed.

541
00:28:40,474 --> 00:28:42,155
I could hate everyone in the Yi Family,

542
00:28:43,194 --> 00:28:43,994
including you.

543
00:28:47,915 --> 00:28:49,075
But later I realized

544
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,754
that the reason
why you're not favored by Ms. Hua

545
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:53,075
is because your whole family

546
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:54,994
does not want to collude with Yihua.

547
00:28:58,635 --> 00:28:59,355
So,

548
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:02,795
I want to compensate you
for my once ill intentions

549
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:04,875
by giving you more opportunities.

550
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:08,875
Thank you for your kindness.

551
00:29:10,155 --> 00:29:11,234
Had I known earlier,

552
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:14,395
I wouldn't have had to
bear this pressure.

553
00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:17,274
Now that it's out in the open,

554
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:19,395
it's actually a relief, isn't it?

555
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:30,355
I guess the reason why you've always
disliked celebrating your birthday

556
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:32,355
has something to do with Ms. Hua, right?

557
00:29:34,115 --> 00:29:35,355
Why ask about this all of a sudden?

558
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:45,674
I have only one grandson.

559
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,875
I heard that your eldest son,
Yi Minde, has a daughter.

560
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:51,795
Yi Minde has already severed ties
with us.

561
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:54,555
His daughter has nothing to do with me.

562
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,315
Even if I did help a student,

563
00:29:57,555 --> 00:29:58,754
it was an act of kindness.

564
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,595
Although Chen Manni dug up the fact

565
00:30:04,075 --> 00:30:06,194
that Ms. Hua was your guarantor
for the student loan,

566
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,795
Ms. Hua has personally admitted

567
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,194
she was simply doing a good deed,

568
00:30:09,514 --> 00:30:11,115
without acknowledging that you are a Yi.

569
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:12,355
So, what Chen Manni said,

570
00:30:12,514 --> 00:30:14,234
that you are a mole sent by Ms. Hua,

571
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,315
is unfounded.

572
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,954
You don't have to worry about
the company's side.

573
00:30:18,355 --> 00:30:19,915
Word of Ms. Hua
distancing herself from you

574
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:21,434
has already reached the company.

575
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:23,434
Not only will everyone know the truth,

576
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:25,514
but they'll also admire you
for wanting to do good design,

577
00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:27,075
even at the risk of opposing Ms. Hua.

578
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:28,434
That's quite impressive.

579
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:32,795
This is the gift you got at Yihua

580
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:34,674
for my birthday?

581
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:43,155
But it's too risky

582
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:44,875
for you to openly challenge Yihua

583
00:30:45,115 --> 00:30:46,315
like this for my sake.

584
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:55,155
Now you know

585
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:57,115
the pressure I'm about to face, right?

586
00:30:57,595 --> 00:30:58,994
Are you still insisting on resigning,

587
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:01,434
leaving me to fight alone?

588
00:31:04,355 --> 00:31:05,155
How can I

589
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,994
control your business competition?

590
00:31:08,155 --> 00:31:09,954
Since our colleague relationship
can't keep you,

591
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:12,674
then I can only switch
to a more solid one

592
00:31:13,075 --> 00:31:14,234
to keep you by my side.

Earlier on your lunar birthday,

596
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:31,635
I wanted to surprise you,

597
00:31:32,115 --> 00:31:33,954
but it ended up
with us both catching a cold.

598
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:35,994
Today is your solar birthday,

599
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:37,514
and I want to make amends.

600
00:31:38,155 --> 00:31:40,595
Why would you catch a cold on that day?

601
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:44,194
If you wear the thin bodyguard uniform

602
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:46,075
and stay in the mountains for an hour,

603
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:47,635
you will catch a cold too.

00:31:49,514 --> 00:31:50,234

The flowers are really beautiful.

617
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:09,754
How is it?

618
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,434
Looking at the flowers should have
improved your mood a lot, right?

619
00:33:14,635 --> 00:33:15,315
Mr. Li,

620
00:33:16,075 --> 00:33:18,714
Boss went to Hua Lan for Bu Ran.

621
00:33:19,194 --> 00:33:20,915
He revealed the Yi Family's secrets.

622
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:23,115
Why didn't you stop him?

623
00:33:23,395 --> 00:33:25,434
So your mood is bad because of this?

624
00:33:27,395 --> 00:33:28,395
Aren't you worried?

625
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:30,234
The high-level executives

626
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:31,754
of Yihua finally made a mistake.

627
00:33:32,034 --> 00:33:34,835
For Bu Ran, he exposed the trump card.

628
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:36,875
Boss was impulsive.

629
00:33:37,194 --> 00:33:39,754
I am worried that
he has forgotten his original intention.

630
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:42,115
Mr. Lu could easily turn the table

631
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:44,274
and let the Yis fix the problem.

632
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:46,274
This indicates that those things

633
00:33:46,595 --> 00:33:48,274
are not his real trump card at all.

634
00:33:48,915 --> 00:33:50,274
To beat Yihua,

635
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,915
simply seizing the mistakes of them

636
00:33:53,474 --> 00:33:55,115
is just a small tactic.

637
00:33:56,595 --> 00:33:57,754
What Mr. Lu wants

638
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:01,434
is to shake Hua Lan's faith.

639
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:05,514
Whether it's competition or business,

640
00:34:06,315 --> 00:34:07,155
being heartless

641
00:34:07,674 --> 00:34:09,594
might not make one invincible.

642
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,315
Just like growing flowers,

643
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:14,154
you need sunlight,

644
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:15,915
and also warmth.

645
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:16,954
With these,

646
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:19,355
they can bloom and spread,

647
00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:23,514
rapidly growing upwards.

648
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:57,275
You once said

649
00:34:57,715 --> 00:35:00,395
celebrating a birthday
needs something very special.

650
00:35:00,994 --> 00:35:02,235
Then see if my preparation

651
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:04,114
can withstand your scrutiny.

652
00:35:26,074 --> 00:35:28,715
This is decades-old Pu'er tea.

653
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:29,755
Give it a try.

654
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:33,875
Are you celebrating my birthday
or my longevity,

655
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:34,554
old man?

656
00:35:36,074 --> 00:35:37,195
You don't like it?

657
00:35:38,074 --> 00:35:38,835
Forget it.

658
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:39,954
It's kind of you anyway.

659
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:44,355
You are not quite the same as before.

660
00:35:46,154 --> 00:35:46,875
Why?

661
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:50,835
I'm just a little nervous.

662
00:35:59,114 --> 00:36:02,474
- Happy birthday to Miss Bu Ran.
- Happy birthday to Miss Bu Ran.

663
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:04,994
- I miss you both so much.
- I miss you both so much.

664
00:36:06,195 --> 00:36:10,434
You and the prince
haven't come to see us for a long time.

665
00:36:10,715 --> 00:36:13,954
We are having a great time
in the new classrooms.

666
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:16,835
There are many fun toys.

667
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:21,034
We're waiting for you and the prince
to come and play with us.

668
00:36:21,835 --> 00:36:23,554
Come quickly.

669
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:28,315
The children of the orphanage

670
00:36:28,434 --> 00:36:30,114
say that we are the prince and princess.

671
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:33,275
I never want to let them down.

672
00:36:36,715 --> 00:36:37,554
In what?

673
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:38,994
At least,

674
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:41,755
the prince must make the princess happy.

675
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:49,235
