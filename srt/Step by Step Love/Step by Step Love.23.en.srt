=Episode 23=

20
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:47,236
(I personally saw Lu Siqi
holding Lu Cenyang's arm,)

21
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:48,475
(and he didn't deny it.)

22
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:50,915
(Those two were
already all lovey-dovey.)

23
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:01,275
What's on your mind?

24
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:02,716
Where are you going?

25
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,516
I wanted to look for you.

26
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:09,036
I remember someone said

27
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,835
we should say what's on our mind.

28
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:13,316
Don't get jealous for no reason
and sour your teeth.

29
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:15,555
You're the one with sour teeth!

30
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:16,835
Let's find a place,

31
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:18,675
and you can tell me where I did wrong,

32
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:19,675
okay?

33
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:26,356
It's finally quiet.

34
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:30,595
So many things have happened
these past few days.

35
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:33,435
I shouldn't have
left you alone yesterday.

36
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:38,316
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:40,115
It must have been hard for you.

38
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:45,835
Don't take Yi Zihe's words to heart.

39
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:47,796
Siqi has just regained her memory.

40
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:50,275
I am worried that Yi Zihe
would continue to pester her

41
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:51,395
and it would upset her again.

42
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,316
That's why I put on the act.

43
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:55,956
But did you have to pretend

44
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:57,435
to be her boyfriend?

45
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,196
The situation demanded it at the time.

46
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:01,115
Siqi was also worried
about how you'd feel

47
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:02,516
so she asked me to explain.

48
00:03:03,236 --> 00:03:05,995
What's with the wrist-cutting?

49
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:07,875
Wrist-cutting?

50
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:11,115
Siqi indeed got hurt for me.

51
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,395
But she was young then.

52
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,356
I know that you and Siqi
have been close since childhood,

53
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,715
and you must have gone through a lot.

54
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,275
But I know very little.

55
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,956
What others say might be made up,

56
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:34,595
or it might be true.

57
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:37,115
Either way, it could affect

58
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:38,835
my judgment of our relationship.

59
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:42,275
The past is heavy,

60
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:44,715
and I don't want you to bear it with me.

61
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:46,796
Bu Ran.

62
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:48,875
The person in front of you now

63
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:50,356
is real.

64
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:54,476
Let's not let past events
and relationships

65
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:55,916
affect us, okay?

66
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:06,115
It's Siqi.

67
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:09,196
Siqi.

68
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:12,115
Brother, I went to your office
and you weren't there.

69
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:13,756
The Ancient Alley renovation

70
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:14,756
is about to start.

71
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:16,475
The design is by Chen Manni,

72
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,035
and Bu Ran will follow up.

73
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:20,475
I think you're reluctant to send Bu Ran.

74
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,275
So I wanted to ask you

75
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:25,035
whom from the Design Dept.
should we send?

76
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:29,155
I'll think about it.

77
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:30,915
I'll let you know once I decide.

78
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:35,876
Hey, you coughed.
Are you feeling unwell?

79
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:38,076
It was Bu Ran.

80
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:45,996
I'll go.

81
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:47,876
Bu Ran.

82
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:49,316
I agree with what you just said.

83
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:52,076
Let's not let past events
and relationships

84
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:53,556
affect our feelings.

85
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:57,795
That's why I've decided
we should spend some time apart.

86
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,076
So both of us can calm down
and think things through.

87
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:03,835
Going to the construction site
is a good option.

88
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:04,676
I...

89
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:05,595
I aim to become

90
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:07,556
the top interior designer!

91
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:10,035
I don't want special treatment

92
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:11,475
just because I'm your girlfriend.

93
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,595
I hope during this time
when I'm not around,

94
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:20,956
you can sort out
your relationship with Siqi.

95
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:25,756
Just agree to send me.

96
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:02,035
There's my son.

97
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:04,876
With my son back,
I won't be lonely anymore.

98
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:07,275
Dad.

99
00:06:07,355 --> 00:06:08,196
Grandma and Mom?

100
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:10,035
They're out socializing.

101
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:12,275
Your grandma

102
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:13,915
picks the tallest among the short.

103
00:06:15,196 --> 00:06:15,996
Let me tell you.

104
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:18,155
Your mom is now

105
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:20,835
busier than when we were
in the limelight.

106
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:24,116
As for me, I'm just an office director.

107
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,235
My main job

108
00:06:25,556 --> 00:06:27,956
is to handle internal affairs
and keep the home.

109
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:31,835
So you've been drinking your sorrows.

110
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:35,595
What do you mean by 'drinking sorrows'?

111
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:40,636
I am trying to relate to your uncle.

112
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:43,795
How he manages to have nothing at all

113
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:46,636
yet still enjoy his peanuts and wine.

114
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:48,915
Does he completely disregard this home?

115
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:52,076
Dad.

116
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:54,835
The Ancient Alley construction site

117
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,395
has caused quite a stir now.

118
00:06:57,436 --> 00:06:59,235
If the renovation schedule is delayed,

119
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:02,556
Pinshang will provoke
even more resentment from the residents.

120
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:04,636
When their patience is at its limit,

121
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:06,355
they will drive Pinshang away,

122
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:07,876
and you'll get your relief.

123
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:09,155
Son.

124
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:12,235
Just causing some trouble

125
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:13,876
is not enough

126
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:18,436
Bu Ran must pay the price.

127
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:20,956
As long as she is dealt with,

128
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:23,795
her dad, AKA your uncle,

129
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,756
will surely break down.

130
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:28,595
By then,

131
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,996
he can no longer be a thorn in my side.

132
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:33,436
Dad.

133
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:35,316
I'm thinking the same.

134
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:37,956
Only by getting Bu Ran into some trouble

135
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:39,556
will Lu Cenyang be distracted

136
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:41,035
and get out of my way.

137
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:51,040
(Work together to create safety.
Collaborate to build harmony.)

138
00:07:57,956 --> 00:07:58,876
Move this in, please.

139
00:07:59,035 --> 00:07:59,595
Okay.

140
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,395
Guys, time for an extra meal.

141
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:05,996
Thank you so much
for everything, Mr. Qin.

142
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:06,556
You're welcome.

143
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:08,035
Thank you. Come on.

144
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:11,235
Come on, let's have some barbecue.

145
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:13,355
I've prepared something
even better for you over there.

146
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:14,235
Follow me.

147
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:21,760
(No messages)

148
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:29,355
This is from your favorite

149
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:30,196
barbecue stall.

150
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:31,516
Dig in.

151
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:49,076
I never realized before
that the scenery is great here.

152
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:51,835
Can we come here
more often in the future?

153
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:54,715
Feel free to come whenever you want.

154
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:56,755
But if I'm busy, I might not have time

155
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,875
to accompany you.

156
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,036
I know you care about me.

157
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:05,036
You're holding back your question

158
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:06,796
about if I'm still in a cold war
with Lu Cenyang.

159
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:10,196
So are you and Lu Cenyang

160
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:11,475
still in a cold war?

161
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,235
Bu Ran.

162
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,436
Bu Ran.

163
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:16,475
Bu Ran.

164
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:17,355
Ms. Yao.

165
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:20,276
Group leader, what you're doing here?

166
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:22,436
I brought colleagues
from Design Dept. for a visit,

167
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:24,316
and the workers said you were here.

168
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,196
Qin Xun is here, too.

169
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:29,676
Some people don't cherish beauty,

170
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,355
but I do.

171
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:33,475
We can tell.

172
00:09:34,235 --> 00:09:35,676
No wonder Bu Ran looks more radiant

173
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:37,755
than before at the company.

174
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:40,916
We couldn't adapt
to the construction site life

175
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,595
as quickly as she did.

176
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:44,676
Qin Xun knows how to take care of you.

177
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:45,995
Right, team leader?

178
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:50,036
Bu Ran is our treasure
of the Design Department.

179
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:52,196
She works the hardest
and is the most energetic.

180
00:09:52,436 --> 00:09:53,196
We all like her.

181
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:54,436
Everyone is working hard.

182
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,475
As a junior, of course,
I have to work harder.

183
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:58,436
I'll go get some cutlery for you guys.

184
00:09:58,595 --> 00:09:59,835
Qin Xun, greet everyone for me.

185
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:00,715
Okay.

186
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:04,875
You all know this handsome guy, right?

187
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:07,156
When Chen Manni
caused a scene at the company,

188
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:08,956
it was he who helped Bu Ran out.

189
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:11,156
He is Bu Ran's best friend,

190
00:10:11,515 --> 00:10:13,515
and he's no less nicer to Bu Ran
than Mr. Lu.

191
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:16,076
I didn't expect to be
this popular among you.

192
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:17,556
If you are interested in a drink

193
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:18,875
once in a while,

194
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,875
welcome to my bar, Old Pal's.

195
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:22,115
Over there,

196
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:25,115
we offer many good drinks

197
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:26,835
as well as lots of gossip.

198
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:28,196
Ms. Yao likes to come too.

199
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:31,115
I'll give you a member's discount.

200
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:33,715
You know how to seize every opportunity

201
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,076
and drive people to the Old Pal's.

202
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:37,196
We're busy at the Design Dept.

203
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:38,916
Rest assured, Bu Ran.

204
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:40,956
No one would go to the Old Pal's bar

205
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:42,235
to hear about your gossip.

206
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,995
You work so hard every day
at the construction site.

207
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:46,355
There's no gossip.

208
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:49,115
I'll be the first
to disagree with any rumors.

209
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:00,276
Everyone's here.

210
00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:01,316
- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Lu.

211
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:02,276
Can I join you?

212
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:08,515
The boss has come for an inspection.

213
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:10,196
The project is progressing smoothly.

214
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:12,515
The Ancient Alley renovation

215
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:14,355
is a bigger project
than the orphanage one.

216
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:16,715
It's Bu Ran's first time
with such a large project

217
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:18,115
and she has been impressive.

218
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:20,595
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

219
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:26,835
Zhao Lei, chopsticks, please.

220
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:28,316
Here you go, Mr. Lu.

221
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:01,635
Mr. Lu.

222
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:04,316
Mr. Lu drove here.

223
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:14,515
This is salty.

224
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:16,436
Mr. Lu, please drink more water.

225
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:26,796
Thank you.

226
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:46,396
Mr. Lu, if we were to drink alcohol,

227
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:48,916
it's not easy to call
for a designated driver here.

228
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:51,115
How about we see
who can drink more Coke?

229
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:52,355
The winner

230
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:55,036
can take Bu Ran
back to the staff dormitory.

231
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:56,635
That's childish.

232
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:58,595
Can you knock it off?

233
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:00,755
Eat more vegetables.

234
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:01,676
Okay.

235
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:06,715
Zhao Lei, hand me the Coke.

236
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:07,796
Okay, Mr. Lu.

237
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,276
Qin Xun, this drink is for you.

238
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,235
Thank you for taking care
of Bu Ran for me.

239
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:31,355
Mr. Lu.

240
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:33,276
Please don't flatter yourself.

241
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,036
I came today solely for Bu Ran.

242
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:43,595
I've heard you brought coffee before,

243
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:46,115
and this time you brought barbecue.

244
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:48,396
It truly boosted the workers' morale.

245
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:49,436
How much does it cost?

246
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:50,556
I'll hire you for more.

247
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,595
I'm not one to talk about money.

248
00:13:55,355 --> 00:13:56,715
However, whenever Bu Ran needs it,

249
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:57,835
I'll be there.

250
00:13:58,115 --> 00:13:59,635
After all, my relationship with Bu Ran

251
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:01,475
is not something ordinary.

252
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,436
Are you giving up so soon?

253
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:17,276
If you're close, you should drink more.

254
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:18,875
Alright.

255
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:24,036
I'll finish mine.

256
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:24,995
I'll do it with you.

257
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:25,916
Mr. Lu.

258
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,156
Let's see who can hold it longer.

259
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:32,355
No problem.

260
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,715
Losers adhere to the bet.

261
00:14:48,676 --> 00:14:49,796
I'll take Bu Ran back later.

262
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,595
I have low blood sugar,

263
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:53,436
so it's fine to drink more Coke.

264
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:54,995
Be careful not to get bloated.

265
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:55,956
You know,

266
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:57,556
you really know how to be annoying.

267
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,715
I don't even know
what Bu Ran sees in you.

268
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:03,796
If I'm not mistaken,

269
00:15:04,556 --> 00:15:06,436
Siqi's memory must have returned, right?

270
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:08,556
Bu Ran was upset about this before.

271
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:11,316
Don't forget. She's also your sister.

272
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:12,515
Don't provoke her.

273
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:18,115
Look at how she speaks
with a hidden dagger to Bu Ran.

274
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:19,875
Obviously, she doesn't see herself

275
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:21,156
as your sister.

276
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:22,556
You can protect your sister,

277
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:25,676
but not at the Ms. Bu of hurting Bu Ran.

278
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:50,235
Qin Xun, what was that messed up idea?

279
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:51,916
A Coke-drinking challenge?

280
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,436
I'll take it.

281
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:01,796
Don't come here this often.

282
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:03,235
Take these back to eat.

283
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,076
Don't waste.

284
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:05,875
Yes, madam.

285
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:12,875
Brother, it's getting dark.

286
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:14,036
Let's go back.

287
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:16,556
You can go first.

288
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:18,715
I want to have a few words with Bu Ran.

289
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:20,355
Let's go.

290
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:23,835
Brother.

291
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:25,835
I think Bu Ran is still angry.

292
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,355
Why don't you come
to look for her in a couple of days?

293
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:30,676
Bu Ran has been diligent
with the Ancient Alley.

294
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:31,755
It should be fine.

295
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:34,316
Okay.

296
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,835
Why do I feel
that this Ancient Alley is so eerie?

297
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:57,036
During construction,

298
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,396
do you have enough light?

299
00:16:58,995 --> 00:16:59,635
Should I maybe

300
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:02,196
get you a couple of talismans
to ward off evil?

301
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:03,235
Stop it.

302
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,075
So many men on the construction site.

303
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:05,995
No one's afraid.

304
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,515
Are you seeking revenge on me
on behalf of Lu Cenyang?

305
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:14,315
I've been standing up
for you all day today.

306
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:15,555
"Thanks" a lot for that.

307
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:16,396
Thanks to you,

308
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:18,156
I don't even know
what to say to Lu Cenyang.

309
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:21,035
Take these back to eat.

310
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,235
Hurry up and leave.

311
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:23,515
Then I'm off.

312
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:24,916
Be careful on the way.

313
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:26,436
Send me a message when you're bored.

314
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:27,515
Got it.

315
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:28,596
Stay safe.

316
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:46,116
(Lu Cenyang)

317
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:48,196
There's a ghost. There's a ghost!

318
00:17:48,795 --> 00:17:49,836
There's a ghost!

319
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:55,995
Come in.

320
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:56,836
Boss.

321
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,075
The Engineering Dept. said

322
00:17:58,235 --> 00:17:59,596
that there's been a problem at the site.

323
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:00,515
It's haunted.

324
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:04,235
My dad has lived in the alley
for so many years.

325
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:05,755
He has never heard of such things.

326
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:07,876
As soon as the renovations start,
it's haunted now?

327
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:10,196
Clearly, someone is playing tricks.

328
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,396
Is Bu Ran okay?

329
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:15,475
She's fine. She's soothing the workers.

330
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:18,196
Boss, let's call the police.

331
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,715
The Ancient Alley residents
are very superstitious.

332
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:21,715
Don't act rashly

333
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:23,396
so as not to cause unnecessary trouble.

334
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:26,795
I'm going out.

335
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:28,075
To the site?

336
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:29,636
I'll go with you.

337
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:31,356
Bu Ran is in charge of the site.

338
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:32,275
It's OK in the day.

339
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:34,876
I'm going to buy some exorcism supplies.

340
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:37,755
Boss, why are you superstitious too?

341
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,396
Where is the scared worker?

342
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:53,916
He's been taken to the hospital.

343
00:18:54,196 --> 00:18:55,156
What did he see?

344
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:59,156
Mumbling about seeing a faceless figure.

345
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:00,676
That floats.

346
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:03,515
The elders always say

347
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,475
that old wood artifacts
can harbor souls.

348
00:19:07,235 --> 00:19:07,876
Could it be because

349
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:09,515
we brought in so many old wood artifacts

350
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:11,555
that we attracted unclean things?

351
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:13,035
Well, in that case,

352
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:14,515
if an antique dealer needs company,

353
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:16,475
all he needs to do is
knock on an antique twice?

354
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:18,795
Should we talk to the company

355
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:21,075
about new building materials?

356
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:23,075
We can't afford to provoke it.

357
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:23,995
Exactly.

358
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:24,956
Yes, yes.

359
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,795
You've been watching
too many ghost stories, haven't you?

360
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:30,636
Here.

361
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:32,436
Tonight, I'll stay here alone.

362
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:34,035
I'll camp out at the construction site.

363
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:35,196
When you come tomorrow

364
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:37,075
and see that I, a woman, am all right,

365
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:38,555
there's nothing to be afraid of.

366
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:40,836
But...

367
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,876
It's cold and damp.

368
00:19:50,196 --> 00:19:51,636
Why am I trying to play the hero?

369
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:29,676
(Lu Cenyang)
Bu Ran.

370
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:30,755
I'm at the company.

371
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,676
I could have drunk more Coke,

372
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,315
but I saw you were not happy.

373
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:37,555
I know it's pointless
to compete with Qin Xun,

374
00:20:38,356 --> 00:20:40,196
and it put you in an awkward place.

375
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:42,515
I've been waiting for you to talk to me.

376
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:45,275
I've been keeping up
with your social media updates

377
00:20:45,515 --> 00:20:46,916
more diligently than I read documents.

378
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:51,555
I'm not in the mood for social media.

379
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:54,075
I'm holding back so many grievances now.

380
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:56,356
Talking about it to you
seems melodramatic.

381
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,396
They say the construction site
is haunted,

382
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,876
and you didn't even make a call
to check on me today.

383
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:03,156
Do you really think
I'm tough like a man?

384
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:28,715
Whether you're a human or a ghost,

385
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:29,555
can you

386
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:32,916
show up and chat for a bit?

387
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:36,116
I've got aged, brewed rice wine here,

388
00:21:36,315 --> 00:21:37,755
originally for warding off the cold.

389
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,396
It's perfect for practicing
our drinking tolerance together.

390
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:42,235
Anyway, I'm going to drink

391
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:43,876
with the residents later.

392
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:49,035
I don't know where you are.

393
00:21:49,995 --> 00:21:51,876
I'll toast to the four corners.

394
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:31,315
The atmosphere is already set.

395
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:32,956
You must be around here, right?

396
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:42,596
Or let's see who's more depressed.

397
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:45,156
I'll take the initiative and go first.

398
00:22:58,636 --> 00:22:59,755
To save my mother,

399
00:23:00,515 --> 00:23:02,116
I got close to the family rival

400
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:04,156
and ended up capsizing in the gutter.

401
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:06,636
My mind is filled
with that stupid man now.

402
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:14,916
I know all his responsibilities
lie with his sister.

403
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,676
Having a weak spot
is enough to worry him.

404
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:20,596
I don't want to add
to his psychological burden.

405
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:22,315
So I'm hiding at the construction site.

406
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:26,555
But what's most disappointing to me now

407
00:23:29,515 --> 00:23:31,555
is myself.

408
00:23:32,755 --> 00:23:34,275
I can't compete with Siqi,

409
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:36,596
with the tacit understanding they have
as childhood sweethearts.

410
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:39,075
I feel inferior.

411
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:49,636
Who is it?

412
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:57,275
Come out!

413
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:01,035
Show yourself.

414
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,475
I see you there!

415
00:24:04,436 --> 00:24:05,035
Don't move.

416
00:24:16,315 --> 00:24:16,916
I'll beat you.

417
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:19,156
I'll kill you.

418
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:22,196
Put me down,

419
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:23,075
whoever you are.

420
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:24,396
My boyfriend is tough.

421
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:25,916
He takes on several bodyguards alone.

422
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:27,995
He could squash you like a bug.

423
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:31,475
Die now.

424
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,636
Go away. I'll kill you.

425
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:33,275
That's me.

426
00:24:33,396 --> 00:24:35,156
I'm the stupid man you mentioned.

427
00:24:39,235 --> 00:24:39,755
You?

428
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:41,196
Are you crazy?

429
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,275
You scared me.

430
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:43,836
I'm sorry.

431
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,315
You almost stepped on the trap I set up,

432
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:47,836
so I carried you back.

433
00:24:48,315 --> 00:24:49,116
Trap?

434
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,836
Who is so despicable?

435
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:22,715
I came here before sunset.

436
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,636
The reason I didn't come to you

437
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,916
is to avoid startling the snake
by beating the grass.

438
00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:29,515
Now let's see if the snake is lucky

439
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:30,755
to escape from my hand.

440
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,555
Don't you hate TV dramas?

441
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:35,275
Where did you learn how to set traps?

442
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:37,956
I grew up in an orphanage.

443
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:39,475
Older children would bully you.

444
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:41,275
So you need ways to teach them a lesson.

445
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:44,916
Your monologue just now

446
00:25:45,315 --> 00:25:46,475
distracted him,

447
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:47,795
so I could set the trap.

448
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:51,075
What did you hear?

449
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:56,116
I thought you would
curse me out after a drink,

450
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:58,956
but you reflected on yourself instead.

451
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:01,396
As your boyfriend,

452
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:03,596
I should care for you more.

453
00:26:04,515 --> 00:26:06,715
I didn't do enough.

454
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:12,795
I was deceiving the ghosts.

455
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,876
But I mean what I said.

456
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,075
The more I tried to balance
our relationship and Siqi,

457
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:22,436
the more clumsy I became.

458
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:24,275
It felt like everything I did was wrong.

459
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:26,636
I wanted to suppress my emotions

460
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:29,075
and not disturb your work,

461
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:32,156
but I feared you would
think I was neglecting you.

462
00:26:32,795 --> 00:26:34,596
I missed you and sent you
so many voice messages,

463
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:35,676
but you didn't reply,

464
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:38,715
which made me angry with myself,

465
00:26:38,995 --> 00:26:40,676
thinking that you were angry,

466
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:41,995
but I was disturbing you again.

467
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:42,956
In short...

468
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,356
You don't have to be so mushy.

469
00:26:46,956 --> 00:26:48,715
My overnight anger lasts one day,

470
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:51,755
two days,

471
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:55,075
or a week at most.

472
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:56,755
Any longer and it's easy to get spots.

473
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:57,636
It's not worth it.

474
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:02,715
Seeing you show up today,

475
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:04,396
I'm not angry anymore.

476
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:05,515
Really?

477
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:08,755
That's a shame.

478
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:10,995
I still have some tricks
up my sleeve to cheer you up.

479
00:27:11,436 --> 00:27:12,156
What is it?

480
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:13,715
Close your eyes.

481
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:31,795
How is it?

482
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:35,636
Is it good?

483
00:27:36,235 --> 00:27:37,035
Sweet and sour.

484
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:39,515
It tastes like sweet and sour pork.

485
00:27:39,836 --> 00:27:42,356
Your special trick is so down-to-earth.

486
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:44,196
Do you like it?

487
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:45,676
I knew you would like it.

488
00:27:46,715 --> 00:27:48,315
You've worked so hard
that you've lost weight.

489
00:27:48,475 --> 00:27:49,315
Eat some more.

490
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:51,315
Thank you for being so considerate.

491
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:00,196
This is the alley where my dad grew up.

492
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:01,876
There are definitely no ghosts.

493
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:04,156
But there are still snakes, bugs,
rats, and ants.

494
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:06,475
But don't worry, I'm with you.

495
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:10,315
Are you going to stay
overnight here with me?

496
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:11,035
Of course.

497
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:12,396
I have to perform well.

498
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:13,315
Otherwise,

499
00:28:13,515 --> 00:28:14,636
my qualifications as a boyfriend

500
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:15,795
will be taken back by you.

501
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:16,436
But,

502
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:18,555
I only prepared one tent.

503
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:20,636
I'll sleep there.

504
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,436
Just a little space is enough.

505
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:23,836
I won't come near you.

506
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:27,755
You should go back.

507
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:30,235
What I just said to the ghost

508
00:28:30,596 --> 00:28:31,795
wasn't entirely drunken nonsense.

509
00:28:33,555 --> 00:28:35,235
You stress me out more than any ghost.

510
00:28:35,956 --> 00:28:36,876
What stress?

511
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,396
During the time we've been together,

512
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,075
I feel like I don't understand
you as well as Siqi does.

513
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:47,396
But you also prepared porridge
and chocolate for me.

514
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:48,515
You're getting to know me.

515
00:28:48,836 --> 00:28:50,676
But I get inexplicably jealous.

516
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,715
Your jealousy shows
that you care about me.

517
00:28:53,396 --> 00:28:55,275
I'd be more worried
if you didn't care at all.

518
00:28:55,436 --> 00:28:56,795
I'm also a member of the Yi Family.

519
00:28:56,956 --> 00:28:58,235
I've said it before,

520
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:00,475
the Yi Family is not an obstacle
to our being together.

521
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:02,196
I have many inexplicable shortcomings

522
00:29:02,396 --> 00:29:03,235
that you don't know yet.

523
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:03,995
Alright.

524
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,116
Just your perseverance in wanting
to be an outstanding designer

525
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:08,916
is enough to impress me.

526
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,596
Not to mention you have
so many other strengths.

527
00:29:14,715 --> 00:29:16,876
My father taught me
the most important lesson.

528
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:17,676
That is,

529
00:29:18,075 --> 00:29:19,755
no matter how many
setbacks a person faces,

530
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:21,795
one should never
give up on their dreams.

531
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:27,035
My simplest, most direct dream now

532
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:29,275
is to have you.

533
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:32,596
To "have" me?

534
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:34,436
What kind of word is that?

535
00:29:34,596 --> 00:29:36,836
I can't think of a more
accurate word than this.

536
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:39,315
I'm afraid that if I hesitate,

537
00:29:39,596 --> 00:29:40,916
you'll hide far away again.

538
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:44,836
I've already lost so much.

539
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:47,876
So, I force myself to become stronger,

540
00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:49,636
hoping that one day,

541
00:29:49,795 --> 00:29:50,916
when the right person

542
00:29:51,075 --> 00:29:52,396
is standing in front of me,

543
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:54,916
I can firmly hold onto her.

544
00:29:58,848 --> 00:30:01,194
♪The only one unchanged is you♪

545
00:30:01,194 --> 00:30:03,616
♪Together with you♪

546
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:06,425
♪Inseparable as shadow and form♪

547
00:30:06,656 --> 00:30:12,931
♪Let me just be your everything♪

548
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:17,186
♪Encouragement that gives me courage♪

549
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:22,276
♪Turns into everything,
holding you tight♪

550
00:30:29,836 --> 00:30:30,555
Someone is screaming.

551
00:30:30,715 --> 00:30:32,035
Someone has stepped into my trap.

552
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:33,196
Let's go and check.

553
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:34,475
Don't let the prankster get away.

554
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:36,156
Slow down. Watch for the sticky boards.

555
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:37,995
What?

556
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:41,396
What's this?

557
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,356
This is my ghost-catching tool.

558
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:45,475
You fool.

559
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:47,075
Don't move.

560
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:47,795
Let me.

561
00:30:49,676 --> 00:30:52,916
These are my ghost-catching device,
sticky boards.

562
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:55,715
Can you not be so hasty in doing things?

563
00:30:57,475 --> 00:30:59,475
Can these sticky boards catch ghosts?

564
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:02,075
Well, I didn't catch any ghosts,

565
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,116
but I caught you, the careless one.

566
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:09,995
Well, you caught me.

567
00:31:10,196 --> 00:31:11,275
That's quite impressive too.

568
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:15,475
Alright.

569
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:19,235
When we catch the prankster later,

570
00:31:19,436 --> 00:31:20,596
let's clean this up together

571
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:22,715
so as not to harm the nocturnal animals.

572
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:25,555
Are you worried for nocturnal animals?

573
00:31:26,356 --> 00:31:26,995
Come on.

574
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:29,196
After I clean up these sticky boards,

575
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,515
it would be late.

576
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:31,315
That's alright.

577
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:32,755
After all, we can sleep in tents.

578
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:36,196
You're right.

579
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:38,995
Let's go take a look.

580
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:41,116
Slow down

581
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:42,755
I'm stuck again.

582
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:11,196
Hello, the number you have dialed

583
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:12,956
is temporarily unavailable.

584
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:45,995
We worked with the police
and made a statement until midnight.

585
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:46,956
Sleep some more.

586
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:49,596
The workers will be arriving soon.

587
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:50,755
It's not good if they see you.

588
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:51,956
You can go home for more sleep.

589
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:09,995
I wonder if Ms. Bu

590
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,275
had any trouble last night.

591
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:12,836
I got up as soon as it was light today.

592
00:33:12,995 --> 00:33:14,396
I wanted to come over early.

593
00:33:14,956 --> 00:33:15,956
If you care so much about her,

594
00:33:16,156 --> 00:33:18,196
why didn't you come over last night?
Scared of ghosts?

595
00:33:18,636 --> 00:33:19,356
Stay inside.

596
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:20,636
I'll go and lead them away.

597
00:33:22,995 --> 00:33:24,515
There's nothing to hide here, right?

598
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:25,916
Aren't you afraid of ghosts?

599
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,235
You guys are here early.

600
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:30,035
Worried about me, huh?

601
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,916
Ms. Bu, were you okay last night?

602
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:34,315
You weren't frightened, were you?

603
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:35,676
Not only was I not scared,

604
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:38,075
but I also caught the person
pretending to be a ghost.

605
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:39,916
It's right over there.

606
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:40,836
You can take a look.

607
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:41,676
Is that so?

608
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:42,475
Let's go.

609
00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:43,436
Let's go and see.

610
00:33:47,795 --> 00:33:48,755
Okay, they're gone.

611
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:49,676
Come out now.

612
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:51,436
Hurry up and leave
before they come back.

613
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:54,755
Leave? What for?

614
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:56,636
Come on, I'll take you to breakfast.

615
00:33:57,515 --> 00:33:58,515
What?

616
00:33:58,715 --> 00:33:59,356
Ms. Bu.

617
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:02,396
How did you catch him?

618
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,755
So, it was with Mr. Lu's help.

619
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:06,156
Good morning, everyone.

620
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:07,755
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

621
00:34:09,995 --> 00:34:11,316
Mr. Lu Cenyang.

622
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,555
About last night,

623
00:34:12,555 --> 00:34:14,716
don't you still have to make a statement
at the police station?

624
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:15,995
Hurry up and go.

625
00:34:16,276 --> 00:34:16,876
No need.

626
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:18,595
We agreed to have breakfast together.

627
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:21,115
What exactly is going on?

628
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:23,675
Guess what they did last night.

629
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:24,555
Let's go.

630
00:34:24,756 --> 00:34:25,396
Let's go.

631
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:28,836
What's this friend of yours
to present the painting?

632
00:34:29,155 --> 00:34:31,075
Do we have to wait here this early?

633
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,236
It was a call from a stranger.

634
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:35,075
But the voice sounded very familiar.

635
00:34:35,515 --> 00:34:37,356
They said that the painting
was bought at a high price.

636
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,555
But they couldn't hold it

637
00:34:38,756 --> 00:34:39,796
so they donated it to a museum.

638
00:34:41,316 --> 00:34:42,756
That indicates a guilty conscience.

639
00:34:43,035 --> 00:34:44,716
Why can't anyone hold a painting?

640
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:47,316
Who cares? As long as it's expensive.

641
00:34:52,195 --> 00:34:53,195
What are you two doing here?

642
00:34:53,956 --> 00:34:55,035
I called Ms. Meng.

643
00:34:55,555 --> 00:34:56,995
This painting is very eerie.

644
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:58,876
Mr. Yi, you'll know once you've seen it.

645
00:35:03,075 --> 00:35:03,836
This is the ghost

646
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:05,756
we caught last night
at the construction site.

647
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:08,635
He said he took money from Yi Zihe.

648
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:10,675
Stop framing and shifting blame.

649
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:12,276
I don't know what you're saying.

650
00:35:12,595 --> 00:35:13,515
You don't know, huh?

651
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:15,316
Your son will definitely understand.

652
00:35:15,995 --> 00:35:16,916
The workers have all said

653
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:19,716
that Yi Zihe has also
bribed the village head.

654
00:35:20,436 --> 00:35:22,756
I don't know if Yi Zihe
was generous in his dealings.

655
00:35:23,195 --> 00:35:26,035
If the police are called,
it should be easy to investigate, right?

656
00:35:28,276 --> 00:35:28,916
Honey.

657
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:32,876
So what do you want?

658
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:34,675
I want you to promise me one thing.

659
00:35:35,115 --> 00:35:37,396
If Yihua ever does anything
against Bu Ran in the future,

660
00:35:37,675 --> 00:35:38,995
you should oppose it, that's all.

661
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:41,075
In that case,

662
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:42,756
I can overlook the dirty actions

663
00:35:42,756 --> 00:35:43,995
done by Yi Zihe

664
00:35:44,195 --> 00:35:45,155
and you two.

665
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:47,635
How dare you threaten me with Zihe?

666
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:49,195
Aunt Xin,

667
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:50,796
The word 'threaten'

668
00:35:50,876 --> 00:35:52,555
sounds so discordant coming from you.

669
00:35:53,115 --> 00:35:54,916
We are just turning the tables

670
00:35:55,115 --> 00:35:56,115
and getting the upper hand.

671
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:58,916
Who do you think you are?

672
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:01,555
Ms. Meng, you are mistaken.

673
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:03,756
If it weren't for the sake of Bu Ran,

674
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:06,236
your son would have been arrested.

675
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:07,316
Lu Cenyang,

676
00:36:12,316 --> 00:36:15,595
we do not call the shots at Yihua now.

677
00:36:17,236 --> 00:36:19,075
Then you two should
play to your strengths,

678
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:20,956
bribing those who run
errands for Ms. Hua

679
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:23,316
and ensuring that her orders
never leave Yihua.

680
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:24,356
That will do.

681
00:36:30,475 --> 00:36:32,796
I hope you will like this painting.

682
00:36:33,555 --> 00:36:34,555
Good luck.

683
00:36:34,756 --> 00:36:35,836
We shall meet again.

684
00:36:44,595 --> 00:36:46,555
Did you instigate our son?

685
00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:49,675
Well, I did this for everyone's good.

686
00:36:50,396 --> 00:36:51,876
The one thing you're capable of

687
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:52,916
is sabotaging your own.

688
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:54,555
