=Episode 13=

20
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:43,155
I gave you a holiday.
Why didn't you leave?

21
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:46,196
Staying here and doing others' jobs.
You're being a pushover.

22
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,515
Do you not know how to say no?

23
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:48,275
I...

24
00:01:48,435 --> 00:01:49,715
Where is that swagger

25
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,196
when you yelled at me this morning?

26
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:53,075
I...

27
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:54,116
Leave the rest of the work

28
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:54,756
for me to wrap up.

29
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:55,596
Wait a minute.

30
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:57,396
What did you just say?

31
00:01:58,316 --> 00:01:59,196
This morning?

32
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:02,515
So last night, you two slept...

33
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:04,795
Were you together?

34
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:05,635
Yeah.

35
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:07,635
No.

36
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:08,555
I was drunk last night

37
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:09,876
and Mr. Lu took me home

38
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:12,916
to take care of me.

39
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:15,276
He briefly took care of me.

40
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:16,476
And then, we briefly

41
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:17,835
stayed in the same space.

42
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:19,036
The same...

43
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,756
You're stammering now.

44
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:22,036
Go wash your face first.

45
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:24,156
I'll have a word with Mr. Lu.

46
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:25,675
You...

47
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,955
Rest assured.
A gentleman speaks, not strikes.

48
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,515
Come on. Don't you know me?

49
00:02:43,716 --> 00:02:44,555
What was that?

50
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:45,756
You'd better explain.

51
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:48,075
Bu Ran was very clear.

52
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:52,436
I took care of her all night.

53
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,036
I don't know what you are
plotting in your mind,

54
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:55,916
but I warn you.

55
00:02:55,955 --> 00:02:57,596
Discard your impure thoughts.

56
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:00,955
Impure thoughts?

57
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:02,476
Do you mean I like Bu Ran?

58
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:03,876
Listen, don't even think about it.

59
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:05,316
How I think is my business.

60
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:07,235
Do you think your warning works?

61
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:08,036
You...

62
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:13,075
Why are you arguing?

63
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,436
You'll make a rumor out of nowhere.

64
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:18,916
I'll take the work home.

65
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:19,996
I'm off.

66
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,756
I'll do the rest of the work.

67
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:25,555
That'll be against the rule.

68
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:26,756
I set the rules.

69
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:28,156
Let's go. I'll take you home.

70
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:33,515
I'll take her home tonight.

71
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,716
You trespassed into Pinshang.

72
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:38,235
I didn't call the police

73
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:39,196
for the sake of Bu Ran.

74
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:42,235
Hurry up and leave
before I change my mind.

75
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,795
He really would call the police.

76
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:47,795
You go home first.

77
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:48,996
I'll call you when I get home.

78
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:50,996
I'll be leaving now.

79
00:03:57,955 --> 00:03:58,835
Boss.

80
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,716
Was that really necessary?

81
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:01,756
He is my friend.

82
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:02,996
He came out of concern for me.

83
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:04,355
So what?

84
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:07,555
Even if it was wrong
for him to come to the company.

85
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:09,276
Why did you mention
last night to upset him?

86
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:10,756
He's not your boyfriend.

87
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:11,876
Why would he be upset?

88
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:13,395
Do you think only a boyfriend

89
00:04:13,476 --> 00:04:14,795
can truly care for a girl?

90
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:15,995
You let me stay in your home.

91
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:16,995
He's not wrong to worry

92
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:17,995
about your motives.

93
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:20,916
Then tell me what motive I have?

94
00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:26,875
How would I know?

95
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:28,235
Perhaps it's because

96
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:30,076
you find it more convenient

97
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:32,435
to grab a towel or a basin

98
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:33,235
at your own home.

99
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:34,636
I should have stopped you

100
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:35,596
from drinking at Kerry's

101
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:36,636
birthday party.

102
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:37,755
I took care of you

103
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:41,435
to show my apology.

104
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:46,195
(I don't have the habit
of apologizing to subordinates.)

105
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:56,156
What now?

106
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:57,836
My stomach hurts. I'll take a taxi home.

107
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:58,795
Come back here.

108
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:11,795
Who would have thought
that the usually decisive Mr. Lu

109
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:13,596
would also have moments of faltering?

110
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:16,355
Take my advice. She'd never like you.

111
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:19,516
Before advising others,
think about yourself first.

112
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:21,076
After all these years,

113
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:22,435
why are you still the backup guy?

114
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:26,755
Lu Cenyang.

115
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:27,716
You weren't arrogant

116
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:28,956
when you asked for my help.

117
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:38,716
This looks good. Look at this.

118
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:39,956
I'll hold it.

119
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,836
Take a photo for me, would you?

120
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:43,516
Okay.

121
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,276
I should have stopped you

122
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:47,315
from drinking at Kerry's

123
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:48,435
birthday party.

124
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:49,636
I took care of you

125
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:51,355
to show

126
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:53,276
my apology.

127
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:56,036
If your tire goes flat, I can drive you.

128
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:58,396
If you worry about rent,
you can owe it for now.

129
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:00,716
With me here,
I won't let you drink again.

130
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:02,156
And,

131
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,355
if you get a leg cramp,
you can always come to me.

132
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,435
You can come here for noodles at night.

133
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:13,956
I must be crazy.

134
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:16,036
Your neighbor has said

135
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:18,156
that it was a casual show of concern.

136
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:19,956
What are you getting all excited about?

137
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:25,276
How long has it been since we broke up?

138
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:27,076
You've found someone new so quickly.

139
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,636
Her prominent cheekbones
are said to overpower her husband.

140
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,916
A woman's cheekbones
symbolize career and self-identity.

141
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:34,636
I make my own pocket money.

142
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:36,795
You'd have to work a year
just to buy my bag.

143
00:06:37,235 --> 00:06:38,995
Someone like you
is not fit to challenge me.

144
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:42,755
Liking scumbags like Yi Zihe
can easily shorten one's life.

145
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,864
Anyone who hates living a long life
gets involved with him.

146
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:46,755
You've already been
cheated once by Yi Zihe.

147
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,115
Why not cut your losses?

148
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:50,195
Bu Ran.

149
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:52,115
She almost harmed you.

150
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:53,555
Why offer her kindness?

151
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:54,795
I don't like it

152
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:56,995
when a flirtatious scoundrel is treated

153
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:58,956
as a precious wild ginseng.

154
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:01,076
What about the interior designer

155
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:02,076
more famous than Taylor?

156
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:09,276
You are Chen Manni.

157
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:11,276
So you have some discernment.

158
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:14,036
Why are you... How did the two of you...

159
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:15,995
Manni and I got together

160
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:16,956
at Cape of Good Hope.

161
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:23,795
And who is she?

162
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,795
Never mind her. Just a junior designer.

163
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:41,276
I've received news

164
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:43,195
that Lu Cenyang

165
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,156
will be collaborating with the currently
popular Extraordinary Place.

166
00:07:47,315 --> 00:07:50,836
The aesthetic of Future Spaces
is decided by the young.

167
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:56,755
Lu Cenyang will begin
to generate traffic for the brand.

168
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:59,675
This is a clever move.

169
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,836
We can't just
watch others shine, can we?

170
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:04,355
Mom.

171
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,476
Why don't we privately

172
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,396
acquire that MCN company?

173
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:10,036
Does having milk make one a cow?

174
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:12,355
Such shows can be
replicated in great numbers.

175
00:08:12,516 --> 00:08:13,675
Are you going to buy it all?

176
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:17,076
We might as well switch to doing media.

177
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:18,115
Mom.

178
00:08:18,355 --> 00:08:20,516
I can use media friends to hire spammers

179
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:23,276
and smear them
before their show launches.

180
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:26,675
The aesthetic of Pinshang Design
is widely recognized.

181
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:28,516
Just smearing them

182
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,836
would only increase their visibility.

183
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:33,835
Why spend money to boost
someone else's popularity?

184
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:36,715
Working on ways to deal with Lu Cenyang?

185
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:38,195
I have a proposal.

186
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:41,356
When I went to Tibet,

187
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,795
I started dating
an amazing female designer.

188
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,356
She's now more
popular abroad than Taylor.

189
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:49,715
Zihe, you're not needed here.

190
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,315
Mom, let me finish first.

191
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,356
We can invest in Extraordinary Place

192
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:55,715
and change the program format

193
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:57,516
to allow more companies to participate,

194
00:08:57,756 --> 00:08:59,276
each bringing a designer to compete.

195
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:00,675
Netizens' vote

196
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,195
will decide the winner.

197
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:04,595
If Lu Cenyang doesn't
agree to the challenge,

198
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:06,996
we can claim
that Pinshang lacks strength.

199
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:07,996
If he accepts it,

200
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:12,356
my girlfriend is talented and beautiful.

201
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:13,675
We're sure to win.

202
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:19,116
Zihe.

203
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:24,116
This is the first time I've approved
of your romantic entanglements.

204
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:27,756
This task is yours.

205
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:29,356
If you can win,

206
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:32,195
bring your girlfriend over
for me to see.

207
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:33,955
Okay.

208
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,595
(Qin Xun)

209
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:50,435
Feeling better?

210
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:52,715
I'm all better.

211
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:54,356
Let me tell you.

212
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,916
Don't get into trouble
with Mr. Lu over me.

213
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:59,516
If I offend him,
I won't fare well either.

214
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:05,675
I understand.

215
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:07,315
Have you decided when to move?

216
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:26,475
You're quite impressive.

217
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:27,916
Your first show plan

218
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,236
got approved right away.

219
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:32,195
This is certainly a step up
from your job in Marketing Dept.

220
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:34,555
I'm quite curious.

221
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,036
You got Mr. Lu on board
by getting drunk.

222
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:38,675
Clever tactics.

223
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:40,876
Bu Ran.

224
00:10:41,555 --> 00:10:42,555
Mr. Lu wants you to meet

225
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:44,156
with the producers
of Extraordinary Place.

226
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:45,116
Coming right away.

227
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:50,595
Ms. Kerry.

228
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:52,835
Even you can't win over Mr. Lu
with your looks,

229
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:54,156
so how can I?

230
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:56,795
Work relies on capability,

231
00:10:56,996 --> 00:10:58,036
not underhanded means.

232
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,595
You've been at Pinshang for so long
and still don't know that.

233
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:13,835
This is Bu Ran from our Marketing Dept.

234
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:16,276
She's also an excellent
interior designer.

235
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:18,516
She optimized the previous plan.

236
00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:19,315
Hello.

237
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:23,315
Ms. Bu, hello.

238
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:24,435
Please sit down.

239
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:27,955
Ms. Bu's planning

240
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:29,195
has really given our program

241
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,595
an extraordinary meaning.

242
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:32,036
You flatter me.

243
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:33,675
Based on your proposal,

244
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,236
we plan to introduce other competitions

245
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:37,116
to add more appeal to the program,

246
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:39,156
including Yihua
that will join the program.

247
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:41,036
This time, they have recruited

248
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:42,195
a designer

249
00:11:42,396 --> 00:11:44,675
with top-tier skills and looks,
Chen Manni.

250
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:46,036
With her on board,

251
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:48,116
not only is the popularity guaranteed,

252
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:50,195
but the show is sure to be a hit.

253
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,595
How about it?

254
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:53,916
Do you want to have
a go against your peers?

255
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:07,876
You want me to compete?

256
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:08,756
Is this indirectly

257
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:10,276
making me a part of the Design Dept.?

258
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:12,876
It's official.

259
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:14,475
Before you joined us,

260
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:15,675
I had transferred you

261
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:16,756
to the Design Department.

262
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:17,756
In the Design Dept.,

263
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:18,756
only team leaders

264
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,236
can oversee project progress.

265
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:22,356
No superior can use
their position to oppress others.

266
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:24,396
You can fully showcase your abilities.

267
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:31,276
I'm truly excited to be
part of the Design Dept.,

268
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,756
But Chen Manni
isn't just exceptionally beautiful,

269
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:34,795
she's a genius who can

270
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:36,715
take on Taylor and get a thumbs up.

271
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:39,356
If I compete with her for popularity,

272
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:41,315
I stand no chance.

273
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:45,075
Extraordinary Place is a variety show
about competing in space renovation,

274
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:46,236
not popularity

275
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:47,595
or out-talking others.

276
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:50,516
If it were purely about design,
I'd definitely dare to compete.

277
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:52,636
But a variety show means
being in front of a camera

278
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:53,996
where people judge and comment.

279
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,835
Chen Manni is a designer widely known

280
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:58,876
as both beautiful and talented.

281
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,835
Anyone with eyes would vote for her.

282
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:02,916
I'm in for a humiliation.

283
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,435
If you're so timid,

284
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:05,876
I'll give up on collaborating.

285
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:08,996
It's windy up there.

286
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:10,955
Go down.

287
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:13,116
What?

288
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:16,516
I...

289
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:40,276
When did you learn to paint?

290
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:42,916
I've liked it since I was young.

291
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,795
Later on, your grandparents
insisted I go into business,

292
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:48,835
so I gave it up.

293
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:52,555
Your mom wants to hang
a painting in the house

294
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:53,795
to look nicer.

295
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:57,156
So I picked up my old hobby again.

296
00:13:58,236 --> 00:13:59,756
My mom has very high taste.

297
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:01,516
You haven't painted for so many years.

298
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:03,116
Are you confident you can paint well?

299
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:05,555
If it's a painting for your mom,

300
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:08,435
I'm confident it will be good.

301
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:15,075
You came back without a word.

302
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:17,835
Is there something troubling you?

303
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:20,116
Where's Mom?

304
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:24,276
Your mom thinks you are
eating chocolate quickly,

305
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,116
so she went out to buy you some.

306
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,396
Tell me while she's not here

307
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,636
so she won't hear and worry about you.

308
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:41,396
Dad.

309
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,075
You're right to worry.

310
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,396
The more Mr. Lu values me,

311
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:47,435
the less I know how to strive correctly.

312
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:49,675
It's so hard.

313
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:52,996
Then let's compare

314
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:54,315
and see who has it harder.

315
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:55,435
Here you go again.

316
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,475
As someone who came out of prison,

317
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:01,075
I can only share with you
the detours I've taken.

318
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:02,916
Your birthday is coming up.

319
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:04,756
You're about to turn 27.

320
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:07,555
When I was your age,

321
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:10,795
it took a lot of effort for me

322
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:13,675
to defeat countless rivals in love

323
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,636
and win over your mother's heart.

324
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:18,996
Yet this romance still faced
opposition from the family.

325
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:21,795
How can this be considered a detour?

326
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:24,195
In your grandmother's eyes, it was.

327
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,876
Even your grandfather's death

328
00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:27,835
was blamed on my unfilial behavior.

329
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:30,276
Later on, we had you.

330
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:34,715
To ensure a more stable life at home,

331
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:36,195
I worked at Yihua,

332
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,756
at a job I was reluctant to do.

333
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:41,356
To accompany you as you grew up,

334
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:42,876
I was unwilling to socialize.

335
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:44,475
I was criticized by your grandma,

336
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:48,475
saying a woman had dampened
my fighting spirit.

337
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:49,835
See?

338
00:15:50,636 --> 00:15:51,475
Luckily,

339
00:15:52,236 --> 00:15:54,435
your mom was always by my side.

340
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:55,955
And you've made us proud.

341
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,236
As you can see,

342
00:15:58,475 --> 00:15:59,435
in hard times,

343
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,315
only after enduring it fully,

344
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:04,636
can you appreciate

345
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:05,996
the beauty of the detours.

346
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,435
Dad, I love you.

347
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:12,996
You are really remarkable

348
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:14,756
to have persevered like this.

349
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:18,036
You know,

350
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:20,835
I was biding my time with determination.

351
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:26,475
I'll share

352
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,595
some information on Yihua

353
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:30,916
that you definitely don't know.

354
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:33,996
Chen Manni once had
a crush on Lu Cenyang.

355
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:36,516
But Lu Cenyang didn't like her,

356
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,555
and she held a grudge inside,

357
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:40,276
which is why she chose Zihe.

358
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:41,876
She even pursued Lu Cenyang.

359
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:43,756
But Chen Manni is so beautiful.

360
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,955
Lu Cenyang grew up as an orphan,

361
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:51,435
but he managed to win
the favor of Lu Mingyu

362
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:53,156
and made something of himself.

363
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,236
Whether it's looks,

364
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:56,595
intelligence,

365
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:57,475
or strength,

366
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,636
he is outstanding
among the young people.

367
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:01,835
It's no surprise anyone would like him.

368
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:03,356
To be honest,

369
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:04,396
I like him.

370
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:05,596
Why else would your mom

371
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:07,675
and I worry for you so much?

372
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:09,995
Don't talk about these baseless things.

373
00:17:10,515 --> 00:17:11,396
Paint your painting.

374
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:12,675
Alright, alright.

375
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:23,076
Join me?

376
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:35,916
Don't be reserved.

377
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:39,195
I think it's better to be bold.

378
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:44,876
By the way, Dad.

379
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,515
Did you really quit drinking?

380
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:48,435
Alcohol is hard to give up.

381
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,235
I drink

382
00:17:51,556 --> 00:17:52,995
not just as a smokescreen,

383
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:54,636
more importantly,

384
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:56,675
it was to bolster courage
against the Yi Family.

385
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:00,116
To overcome psychological fears,

386
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:03,836
it's often hard to do it
just for oneself.

387
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,195
But for someone you care about,

388
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:09,675
you might find it a small matter.

389
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:27,156
If your mom knew

390
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:29,235
that the two of us
completed this painting,

391
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:30,836
she'd definitely like it more.

392
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:37,955
Lu Cenyang.

393
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:39,675
I used to like you so much,

394
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:40,995
but you barely looked at me.

395
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:43,195
Now, I want you to have
no choice but to face me.

396
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:44,755
I will join Extraordinary Place

397
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:45,796
just to see

398
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,556
how you'll have to dodge my edge.

399
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:50,116
Your designers from Pinshang

400
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,796
aren't even fit to hold my feet.

401
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,955
Using design as a tool
for revenge when courtship fails.

402
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,195
Senior.

403
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,715
You're really disgracing us designers.

404
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:05,596
How come you're everywhere?

405
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:06,596
I live here.

406
00:19:07,235 --> 00:19:08,796
How come you're everywhere?

407
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,275
Don't overestimate yourself.

408
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:16,995
He's a man I can't get.

409
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:18,836
Do you think proximity
gives you an advantage?

410
00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:21,755
It might.

411
00:19:28,556 --> 00:19:31,316
I'm doubting Mr. Lu's taste now.

412
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:34,116
Watch your mouth.

413
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:35,396
Enough with the sarcasm.

414
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,116
You think by provoking me,

415
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:38,475
you can prove your taste is superior?

416
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:39,876
Didn't you also pick

417
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,515
that fickle guy Yi Zihe?

418
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:45,796
Yi Zihe is young and willing
to spend money on me.

419
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,235
It's true love for me, no doubt.

420
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:48,836
But as for you...

421
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,715
Want to be Mr. Lu's canary?

422
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:53,435
Look at you, from head to toe.

423
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,715
Are you challenging
Mr. Lu's aesthetic lower limit?

424
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:57,035
After so many years...

425
00:19:57,316 --> 00:19:59,156
Your way of judging people
is still so mundane.

426
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:01,116
Bu Ran is a designer I highly value.

427
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:02,636
Mind your tone when you speak.

428
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,715
Is that so?

429
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:06,235
Well, Bu Ran,

430
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,715
let's have a competition
at Extraordinary Place.

431
00:20:09,396 --> 00:20:11,035
I will crush you.

432
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:17,435
Prepare well.

433
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:19,035
I have great confidence in you.

434
00:20:32,156 --> 00:20:34,715
The merit of one's appearance
and the quality of space design

435
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:36,435
is not for the designer
themselves to judge,

436
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:38,755
but for the admirer to evaluate.

437
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,596
I think you're pretty.

438
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:41,955
Compared to Chen Manni,

439
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:44,876
you have a more natural
and comfortable vibe.

440
00:20:49,356 --> 00:20:50,515
What a compliment.

441
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:52,836
You make me sound like a pillow.

442
00:20:56,995 --> 00:20:58,556
Your timid demeanor

443
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:00,316
does resemble an embroidered pillow.

444
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,596
When I first invited you to Pinshang,

445
00:21:03,235 --> 00:21:05,396
do you remember what you said to me?

446
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:06,876
(I said,)

447
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:08,235
(can you make me)

448
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:10,316
(a better designer than Taylor?)

449
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:12,515
A designer's focus

450
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:14,755
should be on how
to make the client's space

451
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:17,356
somewhere they're willing
to immerse their life.

452
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:18,596
You were pure

453
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:20,356
when you designed the orphanage.

454
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:22,596
That's your winning charm.

455
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,156
You shouldn't have so many concerns.

456
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:29,955
If I lose,

457
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:32,156
wouldn't that prove
your lack of judgment even more?

458
00:21:32,316 --> 00:21:33,955
This is exactly
what Chen Manni wants to see.

459
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:35,675
Then it's good if you win, isn't it?

460
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:38,156
Focus on your design,

461
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,275
and I'll be your support off the field.

462
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:42,796
Don't you look forward
to joining forces with me

463
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,916
to put out Chen Manni's arrogant airs?

464
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,675
But I haven't figured out
what to do yet.

465
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,876
The ancient alley
where my father grew up

466
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:53,356
was particularly beautiful.

467
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:55,876
But the young have all gone
out to make their way,

468
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,356
leaving many old houses abandoned.

469
00:21:57,876 --> 00:21:59,235
I have an Auntie Wang

470
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:00,435
who entrusted me with renovating

471
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:02,116
it for her granddaughter.

472
00:22:02,636 --> 00:22:04,356
But the layout is poor,

473
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:05,435
with bad transportation.

474
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:06,876
The construction is very difficult.

475
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:08,556
Are you willing to do it?

476
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:13,755
(To overcome psychological fears,)

477
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:16,356
(it's often hard to do it
just for oneself.)

478
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,356
(But for someone you care about,)

479
00:22:18,876 --> 00:22:19,916
(you might find it)

480
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:21,316
(a small matter.)

481
00:22:26,235 --> 00:22:26,955
Remember.

482
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:28,755
You're not fighting alone.

483
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:31,396
You're fighting

You're here.

Let me show you around.

509
00:23:55,955 --> 00:23:56,636
This

510
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,156
is our living room.

511
00:23:58,796 --> 00:23:59,675
Over there

512
00:23:59,715 --> 00:24:01,035
is our kitchen.

513
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:02,435
And this here.

514
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,116
Come, take a look inside.

515
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:05,636
Come on.

516
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:08,955
Inside here,

517
00:24:08,955 --> 00:24:10,275
it's my bedroom.

518
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,636
Take a look, it's a bit small.

519
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,235
Only one bed can fit in.

520
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:16,435
Oh right, I also have a second floor.

521
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:17,755
However,

522
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:18,876
the stairs are outside.

523
00:24:19,076 --> 00:24:21,316
How do you think
I should remodel this place?

524
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:23,755
Okay, I'll go measure it first.

525
00:24:24,035 --> 00:24:24,876
Okay.

00:24:30,432 --> 00:24:34,372
♪Let the castle be surrounded by love♪

527
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:50,836
Take this.

528
00:24:55,435 --> 00:24:56,195
Yang.

529
00:24:56,836 --> 00:24:59,356
Have you seen Bu Ran's performance
at Extraordinary Place?

530
00:24:59,836 --> 00:25:00,955
Of course, I have.

531
00:25:01,515 --> 00:25:02,435
Ms. Kerry,

532
00:25:02,955 --> 00:25:03,876
Bu Ran is on camera,

533
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,116
but why didn't she prepare a decent bag?

534
00:25:06,435 --> 00:25:07,556
Carrying such a tattered bag,

535
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:10,475
she's simply making a backdrop
for Chen Manni from Yihua.

536
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:12,876
She's completely embarrassing
the company.

537
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:15,275
Maybe she thinks carrying a tattered bag

538
00:25:15,435 --> 00:25:17,275
has more of an artist's vibe.

539
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:19,435
But in the video competition,

540
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:21,275
a designer's image and temperament

541
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:23,356
will also affect the netizens' votes.

542
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:25,596
We have always been
steadily beating Yihua.

543
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:28,916
Bu Ran better be ready
for the ridicule when she comes back.

544
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:31,836
Well said.

545
00:25:32,076 --> 00:25:32,755
Bu Ran.

546
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:34,675
When you get on camera later,
do you want

547
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:35,955
to get styled to look better?

548
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:37,836
(I think you're pretty.)

549
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:39,475
(Compared to Chen Manni,)

550
00:25:40,116 --> 00:25:41,356
(you have a more natural)

551
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:42,316
(and comfortable vibe.)

552
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:44,116
No need.

553
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:45,316
It's convenient for me to work.

554
00:25:46,636 --> 00:25:48,675
Chen Manni didn't just
bring an assistant,

555
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:50,596
but she also brought
a makeup artist and a stylist.

556
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:52,675
She's completely prepared things

557
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:53,515
as a celebrity.

558
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:54,995
And then there's your bag.

559
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:00,755
When measuring an old house,
convenience is important.

560
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:02,156
I use this bag when measuring houses.

561
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:04,475
It's lightweight and can hold a lot.

562
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,235
Is everything ready?

563
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:10,356
Yes, all set.

564
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:14,393
(Pinshang)

565
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:30,235
How was the construction site?

566
00:26:32,396 --> 00:26:33,796
The Engineering Dept. has helped me

567
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:35,156
to relieve a lot of pressure.

568
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:36,596
As for the difficult parts,

569
00:26:36,755 --> 00:26:37,515
I'll make changes.

570
00:26:37,636 --> 00:26:38,636
It's good to be motivated.

571
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:41,035
The first voting results
of 'Extraordinary Place' are out.

572
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:42,435
I wanted to cheer you up

573
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:44,275
with this gift.

574
00:26:44,955 --> 00:26:46,076
Thank you, Ms. Yao.

575
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:51,116
I appreciate the kind gesture.

576
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:52,596
But I'm not used to these bags.

577
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:54,435
You may as well treat me to a big meal.

578
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:55,715
That would cheer me up even more.

579
00:26:56,556 --> 00:26:58,396
Some people judge others by their bags.

580
00:26:58,916 --> 00:26:59,636
You should take it,

581
00:26:59,755 --> 00:27:00,435
for the company.

582
00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:01,796
I really can't accept it.

583
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:03,955
If I carried such a bag
to the construction site,

584
00:27:04,116 --> 00:27:05,275
it would not only distract me,

585
00:27:05,675 --> 00:27:07,435
but also show a lack of confidence.

586
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:08,836
Please,

587
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:10,156
return it.

588
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:11,755
Okay.

589
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:13,475
I don't want to put
too much pressure on you.

590
00:27:13,636 --> 00:27:15,076
I'll just send more barrage comments

591
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,235
to support you.

592
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:25,316
Ms. Kerry.

593
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:27,435
Did you see what Mr. Lu
carried to work this afternoon?

594
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:28,916
Such a cheap thing

595
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:30,955
actually looked high-end by Mr. Lu.

596
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,556
How could Mr. Lu use something so cheap?

597
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:33,995
It must be some famous brand.

598
00:27:33,995 --> 00:27:35,076
You just don't recognize it.

599
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,556
(Ms. Bu.)

600
00:27:56,995 --> 00:27:58,235
(You've seen)

601
00:27:58,235 --> 00:27:59,275
(my first floor.)

602
00:27:59,755 --> 00:28:02,995
(It is 55 square meters.)

603
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:04,876
(There's a small room upstairs.)

604
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:07,596
where my son lived when he was young.

605
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:09,796
Now that he's married
and lives in the new district,

606
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:13,475
he only comes back occasionally
to sit for a bit.

607
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:16,275
It's both old and damp.

608
00:28:16,556 --> 00:28:18,435
It's not convenient for him to bring

609
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:19,916
his family back to stay.

610
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:21,475
I just want to have an independent

611
00:28:21,715 --> 00:28:24,356
space for my son and his wife,

612
00:28:24,675 --> 00:28:27,116
while ensuring a study space
for my granddaughter.

613
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:31,356
And ideally, a bright and clean kitchen.

614
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:35,715
Do you think my requests are too much?

615
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:36,916
Not at all, Auntie Wang.

616
00:28:37,435 --> 00:28:37,995
You see,

617
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:39,596
your home has limited space,

618
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:41,836
but with the second floor,
your ceiling is high.

619
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:43,755
So I will expand upward to create space.

620
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:45,955
Don't worry.

621
00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:48,316
I will fulfill all of your requests.

622
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:50,076
Good, thank you.

623
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:51,195
That's wonderful.

624
00:29:36,715 --> 00:29:37,955
You looked great on camera.

625
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,675
You will always be the best designer

626
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:41,195
in my eyes.

627
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:46,596
Bu Ran.

628
00:29:46,796 --> 00:29:48,636
We've asked everyone to vote for you.

629
00:29:48,836 --> 00:29:49,755
Keep it up.

630
00:29:50,076 --> 00:29:50,715
Keep going.

631
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:57,435
I hope to see a place

632
00:29:57,556 --> 00:29:59,755
as brilliant as the orphanage.

633
00:30:00,316 --> 00:30:02,796
All the kids are cheering for you.

634
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:04,195
Good luck.

635
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:38,316
Mom, look.

636
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:39,356
Judging their data,

637
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:41,275
Chen Manni has been leading all along.

638
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:42,955
I'm thinking

639
00:30:43,836 --> 00:30:44,916
that once Bu Ran loses,

640
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:46,836
we'll use her real identity

641
00:30:47,316 --> 00:30:48,675
to provoke Lu Cenyang,

642
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:49,955
making him think

643
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:52,515
that all this is a trap set by us.

644
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:56,076
Under the double blow
of failure and betrayal,

645
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,876
Lu Cenyang will surely be devastated.

646
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,076
By the way,

647
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:02,195
we can teach a lesson to Minde,

648
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:04,636
letting him know
the consequences of opposing you.

649
00:31:06,596 --> 00:31:07,755
Kexin and you

650
00:31:08,275 --> 00:31:09,675
need to put in more effort

651
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,995
and ensure Zihe's girlfriend
wins the championship.

652
00:31:13,435 --> 00:31:14,076
Alright.

653
00:31:21,435 --> 00:31:22,316
What are you up to?

654
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:24,876
Ran said she'd take it away,

655
00:31:25,235 --> 00:31:26,995
but I don't know when.

656
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:28,556
I'll mount it first.

657
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:30,035
Ran is competing.

658
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:33,755
Her popularity has been
suppressed by Yihua's designer

659
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:35,916
in second place.

660
00:31:36,316 --> 00:31:37,955
She must be anxious.

661
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:39,916
Let's not

662
00:31:40,035 --> 00:31:41,116
go to her just yet.

663
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:43,116
If Yihua participated,

664
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:46,275
they would do anything to win.

665
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:51,556
There's only so much we can do to help.

666
00:31:54,235 --> 00:31:55,195
If she loses...

667
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:56,275
She has to win.

668
00:31:57,475 --> 00:31:59,515
Only then will Mom allow her
to stay at Pinshang.

669
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:01,195
In this way,

670
00:32:01,435 --> 00:32:03,916
Ran can fight for more time

671
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:07,116
to gain experience
as a new designer in Pinshang.

672
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:19,796
What is this thing?

673
00:32:20,836 --> 00:32:21,755
That's not what I told you.

674
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:22,475
What is this?

675
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:25,195
Wait.

676
00:32:26,556 --> 00:32:27,916
How can you use this color?

677
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:28,836
Mom.

678
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:30,916
I've arranged
all the spammers I could find.

679
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:33,195
I'll guarantee Chen Manni's first place.

680
00:32:33,475 --> 00:32:34,356
What about Bu Ran?

681
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:35,396
Oh, her.

682
00:32:36,195 --> 00:32:37,316
Chen Manni's number of votes

683
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:38,916
is already way ahead of her.

684
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:46,995
Here she comes.

685
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:52,092
(Bird's nest)

686
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:54,955
I thought it was skewers.

687
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:57,515
You always work
on your drawings so late.

688
00:32:57,796 --> 00:32:59,916
Eat some tonic to nourish your body.

689
00:33:00,596 --> 00:33:01,475
Take it easy.

690
00:33:01,836 --> 00:33:03,435
I've already called those people

691
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:04,556
you've helped you with

692
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:06,076
to ask them to vote for you later.

693
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:08,675
I've been looking at Chen Manni's
social media account recently.

694
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:11,556
I noticed she updates daily
and is very active

695
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:13,076
in posting various perks and selfies

696
00:33:13,235 --> 00:33:14,596
and interacting with some fans,

697
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,796
attracting considerable attention
and public favor.

698
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:19,715
But you're diligently working on

699
00:33:19,836 --> 00:33:20,995
blueprints and construction sites.

700
00:33:21,195 --> 00:33:22,596
Doesn't that seem a bit...

701
00:33:24,076 --> 00:33:25,596
You're pouring cold water on me again.

702
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:26,955
Next time when I go on a show,

703
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:27,796
do I need to hire

704
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:29,156
a celebrity makeup artist

705
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:31,035
and carry a limited edition luxury bag?

706
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:32,076
I...

707
00:33:33,195 --> 00:33:34,076
I didn't mean that.

708
00:33:38,076 --> 00:33:38,796
I'm sorry.

709
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,636
I've been stressed lately.

710
00:33:42,316 --> 00:33:43,195
It's okay.

711
00:33:43,316 --> 00:33:44,275
I think you're right.

712
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:46,995
Designers shouldn't
overshadow the main attraction.

713
00:33:47,116 --> 00:33:49,796
They should focus on space renovation.

714
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:56,715
You know me best.

715
00:33:57,356 --> 00:33:58,116
I'll get back to work.

716
00:33:58,275 --> 00:33:58,916
Be careful.

717
00:33:59,156 --> 00:33:59,836
Thank you.

718
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:03,035
Good luck.

719
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,475
What mischief were you up to?

720
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:32,475
Why were you scared?

721
00:34:33,635 --> 00:34:35,555
You scared me on purpose, but now

722
00:34:35,756 --> 00:34:36,995
you're playing the victim.

723
00:34:40,316 --> 00:34:41,676
Who's calling you dystrophic?

724
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:44,635
If you can't speak properly, shut up.

725
00:34:50,276 --> 00:34:51,115
What's that smell?

726
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,035
Do you eat so much in one night?

727
00:35:00,756 --> 00:35:02,075
Can you finish it all by yourself?

728
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:06,836
It's all ordered for you.

729
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:10,876
If I eat all these,

730
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,716
can I still be on the show tomorrow?

731
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:14,876
Are you afraid
that your face will break out?

732
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:18,155
It's okay.

733
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:19,075
Even if you get

734
00:35:19,155 --> 00:35:20,756
pimples, I'll have someone
fix it for you later.

735
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:24,676
This delicacy

736
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,035
not only fills the belly

737
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:27,515
but also relieves stress.

738
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:29,236
