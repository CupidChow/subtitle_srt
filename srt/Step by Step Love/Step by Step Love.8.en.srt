What's the matter with you?

Haven't eaten all day.

22
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,091
Your tea is too strong.
I have low blood sugar.

23
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,011
What are you talking about?
Can you just...

24
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,050
Hey.

25
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:00,291
I...

26
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:04,651
Hello?

27
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,250
Chew.

28
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,690
My first kiss.

29
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,051
Did you...

30
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,371
I finally understand

31
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:35,730
why you keep asking
what I heard at the hospital.

32
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:38,771
Did you go to the hospital

33
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,530
because of

34
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,771
this low blood sugar thing?

35
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,651
It's not that big a deal.

36
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,771
Just have Ms. Yao accompany you
when seeing the doctor.

37
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,250
It would be dangerous
if you fainted when no one is around.

38
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,771
Or, maybe I can go with you.

39
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,530
You definitely shouldn't go alone.

40
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,530
This is too sweet.

41
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,570
My taste.

42
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,171
(She suggests
I go to the hospital with Siqi.)

43
00:04:02,371 --> 00:04:03,730
(So, she really didn't hear anything.)

44
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,651
Yes.

45
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,051
I just don't want others to know
about this low blood sugar problem.

46
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,530
Furthermore,

47
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,491
you have my permission
to work as a designer

48
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:17,170
on the Welfare Center
renovation project,

49
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,530
followed by a fulltime contract.

50
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:20,410
How about that?

51
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:23,811
Alright, Boss.

Rest assured, your secret

53
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,370

about Mr. Liu,

56
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,290
do you know what you did wrong?

57
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,970
- He...
- Better now?

58
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,891
You should go home if you are.

59
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,490
There's no camera here.

60
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:42,176
What if your situation gets critical?

61
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:43,008
- Mr. Liu...
- You may collapse.

62
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:43,610
I...

63
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,131
My place will become a haunted house.

64
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:46,251
That'd be unfair.

65
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:48,691
Even if I die here,

66
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:49,691
this is still my house.

67
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,891

Pinshang's plan for the renovation

is in here.

80
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,891
Including materials
and construction plan.

81
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:04,610
Do you know who the designer is?

82
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,290
Her name is Bu Ran.

83
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,251
- The kids love her.
- Bu Ran.

84
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,850
Director decided to use her design
a couple of days ago.

85
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:12,211
Come on.

86
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:13,811
Let's go shoe-shopping for my beloved.

87
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,331
Mom.

88
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:23,091
now we have the

89
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:24,610
blueprints for the renovation.

90
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:25,850
Why not take this chance

91
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,410
to teach Lu Cenyang a good lesson?

92
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:30,211
Grandma.

93
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,251
Pinshang is most proud of their designs.

94
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,451
Let's make it public,

95
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,170
taking the designer down.

96
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,091
That would throw Pinshang off course.

97
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,211
You brought back the plan.

98
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:40,370
As you wish.

99
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,410
Kexin.

100
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:44,850
Leak the word out to the press.

101
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:46,571
By tomorrow, the charity foundation,

102
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,131
the whole industry,

103
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:49,290
and even the public,

104
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,811
will know Pinshang is poorly managed,

105
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,410
resulting in the leak of their plan.

106
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:03,530
(You have my permission to work)

107
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,170
(as a designer
on the renovation project,)

108
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,930
(followed by a fulltime contract.)

109
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:18,370
Boss, we're in big trouble.

110
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:20,251
Plan for the renovation
has been leaked.

111
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,050
Rumor says it was leaked
by the designer herself.

112
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,211
I see.

113
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:32,410
Here's some chocolate.

114
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:33,451
In case you get hungry.

115
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:35,211
Keep it for yourself.

116
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,410
You're on leave starting today.

117
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,290
Don't go to the office.

118
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:41,891
But you just gave me
a project yesterday.

119
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,091
Why am I being suspended now?

120
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,850
I made a promise.

121
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:45,211
I won't go broadcast your condition.

122
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:45,850
What happened?

123
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:46,930
Give me a straight answer.

124
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,170
It's the welfare center project.

125
00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:49,930
Rumors says you betrayed us.

126
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,451
You'd better stay put.

127
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,050
I've known Lu Cenyang
since he was a child.

128
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:01,490
His competence and dedication
to the Welfare Center

129
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:03,930
is a well-known fact even to you
at the charity foundation.

130
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,571
There's been a situation.

131
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,251
But that could happen to any company.

132
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:11,011
Even Yihua.

133
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:13,170
I don't think they can guarantee

134
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,811
that there won't be any glitch.

135
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:16,730
I heard

136
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:19,651
you plan to provide
building materials for Pinshang's

137
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,930
renovation project.

138
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:23,571
Now, this leaking of their design

139
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:25,251
has caused quite a stir.

140
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,290
You wouldn't want to
get involved, would you?

141
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,171
It just so happens that
Yihua's residential estates

142
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:34,171
are going through a premium upgrade,

143
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,850
which requires the
eco-friendly materials

144
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:40,331
listed in your catalogs.

145
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:42,770
About materials in the catalog,

146
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:44,850
Lu Cenyang has discussed
the matter with me.

147
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:46,890
Ms. Hua,

148
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,171
is this a deliberate attack on Pinshang?

149
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:51,010
Future projects of Yihua

150
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:53,370
will use a large amount of
new construction materials.

151
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,691
The market will certainly follow.

152
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,850
If all of your guys

153
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,890
wish to work with Yihua

154
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,250
and share in the bounty,

155
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:04,931
I advise you to stock up quickly.

156
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:07,890
Thanks for the help, sir.

157
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,490
Yes, that's the situation.

158
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,691
Hello, Mr. Li,

159
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,051
I heard you've acquired
some co-friendly building materials.

160
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:18,130
I'm willing to offer 20%
above the market rate

161
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,051
to get them from you.

162
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,730
Alright, I'll wait for your call.

163
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:31,850
Mr. Wei.

164
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,850
Sorry, I can't help you.

165
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,411
Thank you.

166
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:41,850
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

167
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,010
You and I both have
just entered the local market.

168
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,571
I wonder if you would like

169
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:48,331
to contribute to
the orphanage renovation?

170
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:49,691
In there.

171
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,571
Look carefully.

172
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,850
There must be something.

173
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,370
Quick, tear it open. Right here.

174
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,211
What are you doing?

175
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:55,250
Anything underneath?

176
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,850
Stop it right now!

177
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,730
We have a mole in the company.

178
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:02,291
They're just following orders.

179
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,610
I've heard about the incident.

180
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,691
Rumor says I sold my own design.

181
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,291
Do you really believe
such an absurd story?

182
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:10,531
I seek no reward for designing
the Welfare Center.

183
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,811
How could it be me?

184
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,850
You held a grudge because

185
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,730
they only gave you
a trivial job in marketing.

186
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,531
The renovation project,

187
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:19,171
despite using your design,

188
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,490
didn't improve your status
in the company.

189
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:24,370
So, driven by indignation,

190
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:26,850
you deliberately leaked all the designs

191
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,770
to make Pinshang look bad
for poor management.

192
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:31,490
All of this is your speculation.

193
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,890
It's obviously her.

194
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,730
It's obviously her.

195
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,331
How are you still denying?

196
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:37,331
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

197
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,610
Mr. Lu will believe me.

198
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:42,211
Bu Ran moved the bonsai.

199
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,451
Dig into the soil and check.

200
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:44,850
See if anything is hidden.

201
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:45,931
Search carefully.

202
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,051
Stop.

203
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,130
What could be hidden in the soil?

204
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,291
A bug?

205
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:52,291
Ms. Yao,

206
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,931
isn't this a bit too ridiculous?

207
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:56,250
Ever since you moved opposite Mr. Lu,

208
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,411
and conveniently appeared
at the orphanage,

209
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,610
your intentions were
questionable already.

210
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,451
The renovation uses your design.

211
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:06,171
Mr. Lu and I were the only ones
who have seen the complete plan.

212
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:08,091
Even senior managers like Kerry

213
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,571
have only seen parts of the plan.

214
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,171
In order to prevent a leak,

215
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:12,171
each department

216
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,370
was given only the part
they were assigned to.

217
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,010
So, you are the prime suspect
for leaking the complete plan.

218
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,250
I put tremendous effort into the design,

219
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:20,730
so that the children can have

220
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:21,730
an ideal home,

221
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,051
so that their dream house

222
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:24,370
can be successfully renovated.

223
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,571
Why would I

224
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,010
betray the company
and hamper the renovation?

225
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,650
I'm just doing my job.

226
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:32,291
If you have truly been wronged,

227
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:34,091
the company will clear your name.

228
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,010
But if it is indeed you,

229
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,730
I will definitely not go easy.

230
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,331
Mom, look at Bu Ran's miserable face.

231
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:50,571
Something's up with Ran.

232
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,051
You should have told her dad first.

233
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,531
Where's Mom?

234
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:56,770
I asked her for some money

235
00:11:56,931 --> 00:11:58,451
to buy nutritional supplements
for Huiyun.

236
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:01,010
She said she'd work to earn it

237
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,811
and took off early morning.

238
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,730
Yi Minde,

239
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,451
Mom is not someone you can mock.

240
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:07,850
You're quite the filial son.

241
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:09,051
Fine. Enough small talk.

242
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,691
I thought you had news about Ran.

243
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,051
Let me see it.

244
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,291
What did she do this time

245
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,691
to make you all smug?

246
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:20,331
Hurry.

247
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:23,770
Okay.

248
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,411
See?

249
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:34,211
Your daughter leaked the renovation plan

250
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:36,531
and is being bullied at the company.

251
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:38,211
Pass on a word for me.

252
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,890
Don't go against us.

253
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,890
It won't end well for her.

254
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:08,571
Stop causing trouble for Ran
from now on.

255
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,571
You'd better take my words to heart.

256
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,370
It's quite delicious.

257
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,051
Now you know that Bu Ran is at my mercy,

258
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,610
you are losing it?

259
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,331
I will tell Mom

260
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,890
you've been playing loser all along.

261
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,490
Mom will surely kick you out.

262
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:45,691
Cai,

263
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:48,970
we're long past the age of innocence.

264
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:51,571
We are both fathers now.

265
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,291
For Ran's sake I'll stay down,

266
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:58,650
but that doesn't mean
I won't fight back.

267
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,370
If you keep pushing your luck,

268
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,970
your position might not be secure

269
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,490
for much longer.

270
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,171
Threatening me?

271
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:24,890
Just wait.

272
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,051
Bu Ran will be forced into a corner.

273
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,130
Boss,

274
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:53,730
is everything okay with the Director?

275
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:56,490
What's with Bu Ran's seat?

276
00:14:57,811 --> 00:14:59,370
Bu Ran was the one being exposed.

277
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:02,571
She'll naturally be
the main target of investigation.

278
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:07,091
I just formally notified
Bu Ran yesterday

279
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:08,451
about using her design,

280
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,931
and putting her on the project.

281
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,970
She has always wanted to
work on the renovation.

282
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,970
Finally, her talent was recognized.

283
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,811
She should be thrilled.

284
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:17,610
How could she be
stupid enough to betray us?

285
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,010
This is obviously
our competitor's trick.

286
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,610
Instead of finding evidence
to expose the real culprit,

287
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,970
you're going after Bu Ran?

288
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,291
This is awfully unwise.

289
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:32,850
Boss,

290
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,650
time is against us now.

291
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,291
Who's our competitor?

292
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,730
Isn't it the Yi Family?

293
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:41,931
Why not use Bu Ran to our advantage?

294
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,411
Investigating her is just a cover.

295
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,730
Wait till after we

296
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,370
expose her as a member of the Yi Family,

297
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,531
then, the design leak

298
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,691
would be an unethical conduct
on Yihua's part.

299
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,091
Public opinion will quickly turn.

300
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,010
Sacrificing a newly promoted employee

301
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,010
to make Yihua
shoot themselves in the foot.

302
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:03,331
It's a win for us whatsoever.

303
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:04,331
I disagree.

304
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,970
I'm not using and framing
an innocent person

305
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,730
for personal gains.

306
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:10,730
Go get another chair for Bu Ran.

307
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:12,770
Boss,

308
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,691
we're not only being sabotaged
in terms of building materials,

309
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,010
but we're also losing
the publicity battle.

310
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:21,171
If we continue to let Yihua
manipulate public opinion,

311
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:23,091
not only will we lose

312
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,650
the renovation project,

313
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:26,411
it will also cause you

314
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:28,130
the brand image,
which you've built over time,

315
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,451
to be trampled upon.

316
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:31,850
Sacrificing Bu Ran

317
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,370
is the quickest way
to defuse this crisis.

318
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:37,691
Where is Bu Ran now?

319
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,691
Boss, we can't be soft-hearted.

320
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:15,130
Thank you, Mr. Li.

321
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,251
Instead of worrying about your fate,

322
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,051
you have the leisure
to caring for plants here?

323
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,610
The bonsai is innocent.

324
00:17:30,011 --> 00:17:31,971
I can't bear to see it die
after all these years

325
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,170
due to a wrongful accusation.

326
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:38,051
You used to get riled up
at the slightest provocation.

327
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:40,450
This time, however, you seem quite calm.

328
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:41,531
What?

329
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,771
You're afraid that others
might see your uneasiness?

330
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:45,610
So, you can only
show kindness to plants.

331
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,971
- You...
- I've said so much to you.

332
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:50,850
You should at least
take a few words to heart.

333
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:53,011
Remember to use the burn ointment.

334
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,531
Take good care of your hand.

335
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,531
You got soil in the gauze.

336
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,051
Security and administration at Pinshang

337
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,370
may have watched too much TV.

338
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,571
Me planting a bug?

339
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:07,370
I would have planted it in your home,

340
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:08,291
to record the snoring,

341
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,170
ruining your image.

342
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,450
That would be more satisfying.

343
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:26,450
I do feel uneasy deep down.

344
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,370
I fear the bonsai may die because of me

345
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,410
and that the children' dream
may be shattered.

346
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:36,251
What worries me the most

347
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:42,450
is that you're under too much pressure

348
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,531
to explain to the Director.

349
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:50,811
Worrying about me, really?

350
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,610
Shouldn't I be the evil boss

351
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:55,450
you curse in the back of your head?

352
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:58,331
You know yourself too well.

353
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,610
Then why do you bother to care about me?

354
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,331
Do you want me to give up

355
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:04,571
before firing me,

356
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:05,850
and cooperate with the company?

357
00:19:06,051 --> 00:19:07,850
Don't pretend you know me
like a fortune teller.

358
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,930
That's lame.

359
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,410
But rest assured.

360
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:15,091
If you really want to fire me,

361
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:17,410
I won't go protest holding up a sign.

362
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,971
I just need more time.

363
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:24,531
At least,

364
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,051
let me stick by you

365
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,890
during this difficult time.

366
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,571
I made a promise
to the children at the orphanage.

367
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,610
I don't want to leave Pinshang

368
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:35,890
frustrated and without a fight.

369
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:42,370
If you stay at Pinshang,

370
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,571
there'll be more disdain and questions.

371
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,890
I asked an old bird
in the design department.

372
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:57,051
She said if I can help

373
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,170
solve the material needs
for the renovation project,

374
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,291
all my problems will go away.

375
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:03,251
Give me Mr. Liu's number.

376
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,291
I'll go beg him.

377
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,850
Whether it's a wedding house for his son

378
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,610
or a palace for his pet,

379
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,051
I can do it.

380
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:09,370
He...

381
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:10,771
This is your great idea?

382
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:12,170
I overestimated you.

383
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:13,011
Remember,

384
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,091
you're just a rookie.

385
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,531
It's not your place to stand up for me.

386
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:18,130
Did I offend you somehow?

387
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,410
Why the sudden burst of rage?

388
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:21,251
I just want Mr. Liu's number.

389
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,930
I annoyed him by accident last time.

390
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,130
I'll go apologize

391
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:25,771
then talk him into
becoming our supplier.

392
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,650
Doesn't that solve all the problems?

393
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,011
Listen to me.

394
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,811
I forbid you to go to Mr. Liu.

395
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:32,771
Better yet, avoid him
if you see him in the street.

396
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,771
Starting today, you're on paid leave.

397
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,850
Take care of your hand.

398
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:38,011
For you, not causing trouble
is the biggest help.

399
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,170
You're giving me a paid leave?

400
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:43,771
You didn't suspect me

401
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,491
of leaking the design?

402
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,091
Nonsense.

403
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:51,930
Given how incapable you are,

404
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,170
you weren't even resourceful

405
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,450
enough to frame Pinshang.

406
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:00,291
The bonsai is ready.

407
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,331
Move it down yourself.

408
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,251
I'm the boss. Why should I move it?

409
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,890
I didn't have lunch.
Too weak to lift weights.

410
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:07,571
All your strength
went into talking back.

411
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:13,731
Which one?

412
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,890
This one.

413
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,051
Keep up.

414
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,850
Minde and Ran are causing troubles.

415
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,170
I doubt your heart will find peace.

416
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:50,971
Zihe told me that

417
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,690
last time he saw Minde and Lu Cenyang,

418
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,130
an engagement was mentioned.

419
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:57,610
It seems Minde is betting on
Bu Ran's total betrayal.

420
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,610
Didn't you hope for a

421
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:02,531
big fall out between Mom and Minde?

422
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:05,890
You want Mincai and Zihe to take over.

423
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,650
Ran and her dad are in the way.

424
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:10,771
I don't need to involve Mom
when dealing with your family.

425
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,571
Whatever scheme you have in mind,

426
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:15,491
Bu Ran is a lost cause.

427
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,690
Have you been following the news?

428
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:20,410
Bu Ran, clumsy as she is,
leaked the design plan.

429
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:22,610
Lu Cenyang is in big trouble.

430
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,491
I guess,

431
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,091
he must hate Bu Ran's guts now.

432
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:31,130
You're obviously deeply worried.

433
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,251
No need to pretend it's nothing.

434
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:35,771
In the future, we will think of Ran

435
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,091
when such good things happen.

436
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:41,610
It's the first time I've seen someone
admitting to their misdeeds.

437
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,331
Thanks to you two being candid,

438
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,091
I realized whom fired the shot

439
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,531
at my daughter.

440
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,291
Minde.

441
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,051
Kexin.

442
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,571
Zihe has done some disgraceful things.

443
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,410
I've obtained the evidence.

444
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:08,051
If you're interested,

445
00:23:08,331 --> 00:23:09,610
could you tell me

446
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:11,610
which building materials supplier

447
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:15,930
is most eager to land a deal with Yihua?

448
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,370
I remember going to
construction sites with you.

449
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,291
Sipping soda in summer,

450
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:31,731
and yellow wine in winter.

451
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,491
Young and ambitious.

452
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:35,170
We haven't met in eight years.

453
00:23:35,491 --> 00:23:36,650
You seem to be in good shape.

454
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,531
Minde, always a joker.

455
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,370
Business was low these past two years.

456
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,811
I spend all day watching and suffering,

457
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:47,771
looking at the meager profits
of my company.

458
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:50,170
I'm too old.

459
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:54,610
If you ever return to Yihua,

460
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:56,690
please look after me, your brother.

461
00:23:57,731 --> 00:23:58,890
To be honest,

462
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,130
all these years

463
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,450
working with Yihua,

464
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,890
I managed to get by.

465
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:03,771
However,

466
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,251
that's pretty much the best I could do.

467
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:09,370
My little brother and my nephew

468
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,650
won't move out of the way.

469
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:13,410
In order to bring down Pinshang,

470
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:15,251
they gathered all the
material suppliers,

471
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,291
trying to impress the president
with a victory.

472
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:18,650
However, all they got

473
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:20,370
were setbacks because of Lu Cenyang.

474
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,971
And they haven't learned.

475
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:24,331
They still believe

476
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,170
this design leak incident with Pinshang

477
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,370
will guarantee them a win.

478
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,210
I'm waiting for a window to attack,

479
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:34,091
to challenge them.

480
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:37,450
Mr. Liu.

481
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,170
Will you

482
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,130
stand by my side?

483
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,491
You are indeed well-informed.

484
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,410
Who told you I was on vacation?

485
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,370
Coming here to bring me to Old Pal's.

486
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,650
You'll know once we're there.

487
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,610
Minde,

488
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,091
what crazy talk was that?

489
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:02,450
Of course, I'm on your side.

490
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:07,650
Mincai and Kexin financed the bad press,

491
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:10,890
claiming that the designer
leaked the plan.

492
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,450
A designer who's about to

493
00:25:13,571 --> 00:25:15,531
become famous renovating
the welfare center.

494
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:18,811
Why would she ruin her own future?

495
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,850
After so many years,

496
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:23,811
they are still using the same scheme.

497
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,650
What do you say I use that

498
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,450
to teach them a lesson?

499
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:32,850
Minde,

500
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,410
don't be hasty.

501
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,531
I've been to Pinshang.

502
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,771
As I saw it, Lu Cenyang

503
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,890
was quite restrictive
towards that woman designer.

504
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,130
If I had to guess,

505
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:46,450
what happened was

506
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:48,370
the woman designer,

507
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:53,130
filled with resentment,
betrayed her employer.

508
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,410
A mutual destruction.

509
00:25:55,531 --> 00:25:57,491
That would make sense.

510
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,091
How so?

511
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:02,410
I have the impression that

512
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:04,091
the young designer is quite capable.

513
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:05,650
I wanted to give her an opportunity.

514
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:07,531
So, I told Lu Cenyang

515
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,331
to let her have dinner

516
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:11,811
and a few drinks with me after work.

517
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:15,091
Lu Cenyang immediately
rejected with a long face.

518
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,491
As if I was stealing something from him.

519
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:18,531
It's insane.

520
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:23,850
You.

521
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:26,850
Must be drooling over the girl

522
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:28,251
because she's pretty, huh?

523
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:32,170
As long as the lady is willing,

524
00:26:32,331 --> 00:26:34,011
I'd treat her like a queen.

525
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,731
That kid Lu Cenyang
really doesn't appreciate favors.

526
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,930
In fact,

527
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,370
he wouldn't even give up an employee

528
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,971
in exchange of cooperation.

529
00:26:43,491 --> 00:26:45,251
No wonder he's targeted.

530
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:50,370
(So, Lu Cenyang was mean to me
in front of Mr. Liu)

531
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,091
(to protect me?)

532
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:56,771
Lu Cenyang is very meticulous

533
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:58,650
and manages the company well.

534
00:26:59,331 --> 00:27:00,531
Whoever leaked the plan

535
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:02,811
must be a high-rank advisor of his.

536
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,370
I don't believe Zihe has the capacity

537
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,331
to buy off a key member
of Pinshang's management.

538
00:27:07,571 --> 00:27:09,051
Yi Zihe's talent is only

539
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:10,410
good for picking up girls.

540
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,811
Minde.

541
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,571
That's all the tips I can give you.

542
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:19,650
Thanks, brother.

543
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:22,450
Let's drink coffee instead of wine.

544
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,610
Cheers.

545
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:24,410
Here.

546
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:25,370
Cheers.

547
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:29,091
I got too excited.

548
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:30,170
Are you okay?

549
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,331
Look.

550
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:32,610
It's fine.

551
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,370
I guess I'll leave now.

552
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,731
Gotta go change my clothes.

553
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,890
Okay.

554
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,610
Mr. Yi, you were an artist
in bamboozling Mr. Liu.

555
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,890
That little stunt before he left?

556
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:54,811
Impressive.

557
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,410
I saw he was plotting against Ran.

558
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,011
Of course, it pissed me off.

559
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:02,251
I'll settle the score with him later.

560
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:05,811
Dad.

561
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:09,890
What?

562
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,410
The protective father is back, is he?

563
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:20,170
Silly girl.

564
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:22,731
Like father, like daughter.

565
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,091
With you unwilling to concede,

566
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,130
how can I give up on myself?

567
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,491
I was planning to

568
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,731
play the role of the drunkard longer,

569
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,610
so as to draw Grandma's attention

570
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,130
all towards me.

571
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,051
But if I don't act now,

572
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,450
it'd be too risky for you.

573
00:28:42,491 --> 00:28:43,531
Is the hand injury serious?

574
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,571
Just a minor wound. Almost healed.

575
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,370
If I heard it right,

576
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:51,491
you are well aware of my every move?

577
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,170
Sorry, sweetheart.

578
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,091
It's my fault

579
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,491
that you had to walk on thin ice.

580
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:07,930
But seeing my girl
becoming braver with each setback,

581
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:10,331
my heart is filled with gratification.

582
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:14,210
Wait till I become
a better space designer,

583
00:29:14,331 --> 00:29:16,011
you'll be even more gratified.

584
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:18,370
I have no doubt.

585
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,531
You guys should keep digging

586
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,650
as to from whom Yi Zihe got the plan.

587
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:30,610
Find a witness,
the public opinion will change.

588
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,051
and this trouble with Pinshang
will resolve itself.

589
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,011
Yi Zihe got the design from a woman.

590
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,850
The plan was okayed by the Director

591
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:42,251
not so long ago.

592
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,650

from the welfare center?
