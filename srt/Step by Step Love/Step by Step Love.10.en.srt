Boss.

21
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:49,548
The negative public opinion
about Pinshang has been dealt with.

22
00:01:50,308 --> 00:01:51,709
With the support
from the Welfare Center,

23
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,268
our reputation will soon turn around.

24
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:54,108
Ms. Yao.

25
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,668
Focus on speaking up
for the designer in public opinion.

26
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:57,429
Understood.

27
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:58,308
Mr. Lu.

28
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:59,869
There have been many suppliers

29
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,229
actively contacting us,

30
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,869
wishing to participate in the Welfare
Center's reconstruction project.

31
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:06,548
They're offering terms
close to the cost price.

32
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,069
Especially Mr. Liu,

33
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:10,909
he's practically begging
for an appointment with you.

34
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:12,629
They must have heard about the news

35
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,949
that Ms. Hua is willing to provide
building materials for free.

36
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:17,229
She's doing it to cover up the shame,

37
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,988
but if those building material vendors
are willing to cooperate,

38
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:21,108
we can sign a long-term

39
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:22,268
cooperation agreement.

40
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:23,229
No need for the cost price,

41
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:25,029
just use a reasonable one.

42
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:26,868
As for Mr. Liu,

43
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:29,509
he needs to make Bu Ran forgive him

44
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,148
before Pinshang gives him a chance.

45
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:33,428
I see.

46
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:35,629
Notify Bu Ran to come to work tomorrow.

47
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,868
Any colleague who has slandered her

48
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:40,469
must sincerely apologize to her.

49
00:02:46,428 --> 00:02:47,148
Understood.

50
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:48,668
Go back to work.

51
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:01,708
Mr. Lu actually asked me
to apologize to Bu Ran.

52
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:06,108
Ms. Yao, I really envy you.

53
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:08,828
You seem to have
a close relationship with Mr. Lu.

54
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:12,268
I've been with Mr. Lu
since I started working.

55
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:14,029
With special responsibilities,

56
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:15,509
he takes care of me more.

57
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:19,349
But he doesn't see me as a woman.

58
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:21,588
Too bad others don't think the same way.

59
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:22,629
Others?

60
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,148
You're not referring
to Mr. Lu's sister, are you?

61
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,268
Have you also heard about the rumors
of Mr. Lu as a son-in-law?

62
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,949
Once I mentioned it,
you knew who I was talking about.

63
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,509
To be honest with you,

64
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,108
I'm just very curious

65
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:39,909
about what Mr. Lu's sister looks like.

66
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:41,428
Is she particularly beautiful?

67
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,309
Otherwise, why could Mr. Lu

68
00:03:43,388 --> 00:03:44,629
protect her so well?

69
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:46,428
Her looks?

70
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:47,708
Not bad.

71
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:51,949
Siqi has been praying for Mr. Lu
in Tibet for many years.

72
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,708
Doesn't that deserve Mr. Lu's kindness?

73
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,388
Ms. Yao.

74
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:02,108
If you get a chance,

75
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:04,108
you must take me to meet Siqi.

76
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:05,349
You know what I mean.

77
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:06,868
Women are very gossipy.

78
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,828
She's been learning to paint
Thangkas in Lhasa recently.

79
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:12,309
Let's wait for her to come back.

80
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:12,828
Okay.

81
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:13,629
Ms. Yao.

82
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:15,428
This is a local express
delivery for Mr. Lu.

83
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:16,949
Give it to me.

84
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:20,588
I'll deliver it to Mr. Lu.

85
00:04:20,588 --> 00:04:21,069
Okay.

86
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,109
Thanks for the coffee.

87
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:30,629
Lu Siqi?

88
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:52,869
When Zihe got the blueprint,

89
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:56,109
he clearly told me he had
bought off a reliable person.

90
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:59,509
Why is it again about playing
with a woman's feelings?

91
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,788
Wasn't it enough to be
burned once by this trick?

92
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:06,388
Why repeat the same mistake?

93
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:08,309
My face could lose

94
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:10,509
its wrinkles because of embarrassment.

95
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,429
Mom, don't be angry.

96
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,148
Zihe clearly gave that woman money.

97
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:18,588
Who would know

98
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:20,669
that woman is not decent at all?

99
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,669
If they were decent,

100
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,708
we would lose face even more.

101
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:29,268
At every step, we are
countered by Lu Cenyang.

102
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:33,069
He's been preparing for seven years.

103
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:35,148
He knows himself well, and us better.

104
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:37,309
He's completely

105
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,788
figured out our way of thinking.

106
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:41,509
Grandma.

107
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,588
Dad and Mom have people
watching Lu Cenyang.

108
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:45,268
Sooner or later, they'll get something.

109
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:48,588
Is Lu Cenyang really that watertight?

110
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:51,588
Or are the people you sent
as foolish as you?

111
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:55,028
Mom, have some ginseng tea.

112
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:58,189
Mom.

113
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,468
My people did not
come back empty-handed.

114
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,468
It's just that they end up
photographing Bu Ran every time.

115
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:06,348
Don't pin everything on Bu Ran.

116
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:08,268
She's insignificant.

117
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,509
We need to find Lu Mingyu's
daughter, Lu Siqi

118
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:16,069
to effectively take control
of Lu Cenyang.

119
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:17,908
Where is Lu Cenyang

120
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:18,828
hiding her sister?

121
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:20,749
It's as if she has vanished.

122
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:21,669
You have a call.

123
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:26,629
Hello?

124
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:27,549
Speak.

125
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:31,669
Got it.

126
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,189
Well done.

127
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:42,109
My informant found out
that Lu Siqi is in Tibet.

128
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:45,028
Zihe.

129
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:49,549
You know how to captivate
a woman's heart.

130
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:50,908
You should go.

131
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,788
Mom, Zihe is prone to altitude sickness.

132
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,549
I'll send some capable
subordinates instead.

133
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:58,949
In that case,

134
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:02,388
should Yihua be handed over
to your subordinates instead?

135
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:05,509
Zihe.

136
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,828
Prepare well for a few days.

137
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:11,309
Find Lu Siqi before she leaves Tibet.

138
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,549
My dear son, hurry up
and drink the ginseng tea.

139
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:25,588
I want some. Please.

140
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:26,708
Take it, take it.

141
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:32,549
What's up?

142
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:36,869
Colleagues are apologizing to me.

143
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:37,869
Did you make them?

144
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:39,908
You don't need to thank me.

145
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,749
It's a boss's duty
to protect his employees.

146
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:45,588
Even if it's just a janitor,

147
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:47,429
I will defend just the same.

148
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:53,708
Someone is getting arrogant
after just one stroke of luck,

149
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:55,708
trying to start a new persona

150
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:57,908
as a conscientious boss.

151
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:00,028
I didn't win by luck.

152
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,908
My feigned weakness was
to lure the opponent into the trap.

153
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:05,549
Anyway, you won.

154
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:06,629
You can brag about it.

155
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:07,669
I'm not bragging.

156
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:09,549
I had calculated it from the start

157
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:11,588
that Yihua would use
building materials to jeopardize me.

158
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:13,309
The more they want to corner me,

159
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:14,549
the crazier they will get.

160
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:16,669
No matter where I try to get
the building materials,

161
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,228
they would all preemptively cut it off.

162
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:19,549
If it goes on,

163
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:21,749
Yihua's finances
would surely be strained.

164
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:22,949
If Ms. Hua wants to stay safe,

165
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:24,749
she would certainly use
her building materials

166
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:25,749
to work with me.

167
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:30,189
Did Yihua really win?

168
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,748
Back at the Welfare Center,

169
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:44,029
you knew everything
but deliberately scared me.

170
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,868
Is it funny to tease me like this?

171
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:50,429
I didn't expect you
to take it seriously.

172
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:52,108
Have some tea to clear your mind.

173
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,549
When you drink tea,
don't just drink tea.

174
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,389

184
00:09:58,043 --> 00:10:02,577
♪I really want to take you
to the castle♪

185
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:06,149
Look at this handsome face
with sharp features.

186
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:09,269
And his robust pectoral muscles.

187
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:16,663
♪Let the castle be surrounded by love♪

188
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:23,949
Wish you recover soon.

189
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:26,708
Same here.

190
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,662
(I patted Bu Ran)

191
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,588
(Crap, I need an excuse.)

192
00:10:57,228 --> 00:10:57,868
Hello?

193
00:10:58,429 --> 00:10:59,828
Please send red beans, jujubes

194
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:00,628
and honey

195
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:01,988
to Block B of Fortune Pavilion.

196
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,828
Why did he pat me?

197
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:09,508
And he didn't apologize.

198
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:26,949
Your takeaway.

199
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:29,708
I didn't order any.
Did you get the wrong address?

200
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:32,748
Nope, it's your apartment number.

201
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:41,108
(Make it now and deliver it
first thing in the morning.)

202
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,868
(If it's tasty,
it can count towards the rent.)

203
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:44,708
(If not, you don't need to follow up)

204
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:45,909
(on the orphanage renovation.)

205
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,669
What's that all about?

206
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,629
(Eccentric Behavior Studies)

207
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:58,949
This book suits you well.

208
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:18,269
Round head.

209
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:20,348
I'll draw another one for you.

210
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:23,828
Flying slipper.

211
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,149
A word is a bond.
It can reduce the rent, right?

212
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:15,269
You've become a regular employee.

213
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:17,149
With the project bonus and salary,

214
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:19,669
you should be quite well off
after paying the rent.

215
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:23,149
Don't be so stingy.

216
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:24,508
I've been simmering it all night.

217
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:25,669
I barely slept.

218
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:28,949
Alright, I'll deduct it
as if it were takeout, okay?

219
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:30,789
Don't just simmer the porridge for me.

220
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:32,149
Include your portion as well.

221
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:34,149
We'll visit the construction site
more often now.

222
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:35,549
We need to ensure our health.

223
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:37,508
Have you decided?

224
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:39,549
You want me to follow up
on the orphanage project?

225
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,669
This porridge...

226
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:55,269
I will simmer and stew it every day

227
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,828
until you are full of life and vigor.

228
00:14:58,108 --> 00:14:59,389
Then I'll make a different porridge.

229
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:05,748
I was right to transfer
you to the Marketing Dept.

230
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:07,508
Look how quickly you've improved.

231
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,108
You are right.

232
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,149
Boss, you've read this book too?

233
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:16,309
I've seen many bloggers
recommend this book.

234
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,868
But none of them bought it
to read like you did, Boss.

235
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:22,988
Boss, you truly keep up with the times
and have a thirst for knowledge.

236
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:25,468
I just flip through it

237
00:15:25,588 --> 00:15:26,348
when I can't sleep.

238
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,269
May I take a look?

239
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,348
You can't read this book.

240
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:40,189
This is what you should be focusing on.

241
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:44,228
This is the project book
for the renovation.

242
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:45,508
You need to know it by heart.

243
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:47,949
You have to be fully prepared
for different materials,

244
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:49,108
renovation requirements,

245
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:51,189
and whom to coordinate with,
including unpredictable

246
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:52,868
factors like the weather.

247
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:54,348
No room for error.

248
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:56,789
I will certainly not
disappoint the company.

249
00:15:58,348 --> 00:15:59,348
This Welfare Center project

250
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:01,228
has been through twists and turns
during preparation.

251
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:03,108
I wasn't joking about what I said.

252
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:04,189
A project requires

253
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,789
not only individual expertise,

254
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:07,389
but even more so, collaboration.

255
00:16:07,628 --> 00:16:08,348
Do you understand?

256
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:09,228
I do.

257
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:10,988
I will certainly make progress.

258
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:13,189
You'd better do as you say.

259
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,108
Otherwise, don't come
to the Welfare Center's

260
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:16,189
groundbreaking ceremony.

261
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,628
Got it, I'm off to work now.

262
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,029
Wait a minute.

263
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:21,748
Put less honey
in this porridge in the future.

264
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:22,789
It's too sweet.

265
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,149
That's how I like it.

266
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:36,708
Where are the design drawings by Yang?

267
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:37,988
Don't worry.

268
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:39,269
Bu Ran should be able to fix it.

269
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,348
It seems quite tricky.

270
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:42,309
How is it?

271
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:45,149
It's already fixed.

272
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:47,468
Bu Ran is so impressive.

273
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:49,029
Yang owes you a big one.

274
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:51,468
The software tends to lag
after the update.

275
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:52,429
After the rendering,

276
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:54,108
just output it into several files.

277
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:55,828
Impressive, Bu Ran.

278
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:56,868
Thank you.

279
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:58,949
I didn't expect your computer skills

280
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:00,348
to be as good

281
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:01,108
as your design.

282
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:03,269
When I was abroad,

283
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:04,869
the computers and systems
were all very old

284
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:06,028
and would often malfunction.

285
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:07,429
Frequent repairs made me experienced.

286
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:10,149
So feel free to ask me for help
with anything in the future.

287
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,548
- Okay.
- Okay.

288
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,548
Did you need anything
from the Design Dept.?

289
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,028
Mr. Lu wants me to follow up

290
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:16,629
on the Welfare Center project.

291
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:18,829
Everyone should add Bu Ran's WeChat.

292
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,308
About the Welfare Center project,

293
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:22,149
you can ask anyone if you need help.

294
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:24,149
We all have some
experience with projects

295
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:25,548
and can share it with you.

296
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,988
Thank you, team leader.
Thank you, everyone.

297
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,268
Thank you.

298
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:39,308
I appreciate how quickly you adapt,

299
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:42,189
but I must remind you
not to meddle in others' affairs.

300
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,788
I understand, Ms. Yao.

301
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,589
You even bought her a cervical spray.

302
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:04,508
She's made you a pariah at Pinshang.

303
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:06,909
It's not that bad.

304
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,468
At least,

305
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:11,988
Lu Cenyang still trusts me.

306
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:13,228
He trusts you,

307
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:15,468
yet he watched you be wronged
in the company.

308
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:17,068
Forget about him.

309
00:18:18,228 --> 00:18:19,508
Let me fulfill my promise.

310
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:26,943
(Note Details)

311
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:28,589
Don't get emotional.

312
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:31,308
It's because I can't draw
design schematics at the company,

313
00:18:31,468 --> 00:18:32,109
and I got itchy,

314
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:33,669
so I used your house to practice.

315
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:35,389
Do you like it?

316
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:36,629
I do.

317
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:38,788
I can stay inside for months
without going out,

318
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:39,748
and I wouldn't be bored.

319
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:41,389
That's an exaggeration.

320
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:42,949
This is only the first draft.

321
00:18:43,228 --> 00:18:44,468
Check if there's anything missing,

322
00:18:44,629 --> 00:18:45,468
and I'll add it for you.

323
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:49,669
If you put it that way,

324
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:52,028
it's missing a lady of the house.

325
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:53,228
That's simple.

326
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,149
Really?

327
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:02,994
(Matchmaking Corner)

328
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:09,389
Young man, here for a blind date?

329
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,708
You look decent.

330
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:11,949
Do you have a house?

331
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:12,949
Yes, Auntie.

332
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,669
I have 87 houses.

333
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:15,669
15 have been liquidated.

334
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:17,268
There are still 62 remaining.

335
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,548
Stop kidding.

336
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:21,909
Bu Ran.

337
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,308
Are you serious?

338
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,508
You sent me to the matchmaking corner.

339
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:30,149
I should be considered the one
with good looks, right?

340
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:31,869
Do you think I need blind dates?

341
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,508
Young man.

342
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:35,468
You're here to find a match, aren't you?

343
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:37,508
Take a look at this girl here.

344
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:38,028
She is

345
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:39,268
- No, thanks.
- suitable for you.

346
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:41,349
Her height, weight...

347
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:42,429
I said, no, thanks.

348
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:43,508
She's such a beautiful girl.

349
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,349
She suits you very well.

350
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:46,349
- Let me see.
- Take a look.

351
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:46,829
Okay.

352
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:50,189
Young man, don't run.

353
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,708
Take another look
at someone else, young man.

354
00:19:56,268 --> 00:19:56,829
Ms. Yao.

355
00:19:58,429 --> 00:19:59,028
Bu Ran.

356
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:01,268
Ms. Yao.

357
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:02,949
Someone saw you put

358
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:04,548
the cervical spray in my office.

359
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,909
Last time, it seemed like
your neck was uncomfortable.

360
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:08,508
I have used this spray before.

361
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:11,268
If you have a headache, spraying it
on the cervical spine would help.

362
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:12,909
Let alone that I don't like it

363
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:14,949
when people casually enter my office,

364
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:17,349
we are not that close.

365
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:19,109
I won't casually accept your gifts.

366
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:21,429
You've misunderstood my intention.

367
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,508
I noticed your neck
seemed to be in pain,

368
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:24,589
so I thought of this.

369
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,909
If it works well,
you can just pay me for it.

370
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,869
It doesn't carry many personal feelings.

371
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:42,268
Mr. Lu, I have something
to report to you in person.

372
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:50,589
I haven't seen you
at the company these days.

373
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:52,748
So you've been fishing near the company.

374
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:54,349
What would the employees think?

375
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,548
As long as you're strong inside,
why care about what others think?

376
00:20:58,189 --> 00:20:59,189
What did you need?

377
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:01,308
If I'm not mistaken,

378
00:21:02,268 --> 00:21:03,508
you think that Bu Ran

379
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:05,228
was targeted by the whole company,

380
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,508
so you want to take this opportunity
with the project

381
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:09,189
to help her get along with everyone.

382
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,788
You really want to cultivate Bu Ran.

383
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:14,589
When I was young in the Welfare Center,

384
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:16,708
I always wanted to experience fishing.

385
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:18,949
I hoped to get a chance
on the days we went out.

386
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:20,629
But the older kids

387
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:21,909
never let me.

388
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:23,228
I never got to experience it.

389
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:24,988
Sometimes,

390
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:26,548
when you can't stand out,

391
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:28,988
you can try to blend in.

392
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:30,589
Life would become much easier.

393
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:32,068
She wants the project,

394
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:34,829
but it's not as simple
as strategizing on paper.

395
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:37,909
She needs my guidance.

396
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:40,629
In order to win people over,

397
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,349
she's fixing computers
and giving out cervical sprays.

398
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,909
She's been busy.

399
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:48,349
But with just one glance,

400
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:50,748
she saw right through
the headache problem I had.

401
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:52,548
Boss,

402
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:54,548
I'm worried she will discover my...

403
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:57,829
Impatience.

404
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:00,028
Are you being too protective of her?

405
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:03,748
I will go to her before getting off work

406
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:05,389
and tell her to keep her distance.

407
00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:08,748
Do you want to experience it?

408
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:13,949
Let's have a competition to see

409
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:15,228
who gets more.

410
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:15,708
Okay.

411
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:16,468
Come on.

412
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:18,909
I've already caught one.

413
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:20,109
I have one too.

414
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:21,869
I've caught one as well.

415
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:22,909
Here's one for you.

416
00:22:23,189 --> 00:22:23,988
Give me one.

417
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:36,548
Now you know I have good taste
in picking chocolates.

418
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:41,308
Snooping through my privacy?

419
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:43,109
I'm not that scheming.

420
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:45,829
I didn't expect you
to like the chocolates so much.

421
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:47,988
Why would I refuse delicious snacks?

422
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:50,589
I heard that in a short amount of time,

423
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:52,508
you've blended in
with the Design Department.

424
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,228
My encouragement seems
to be very effective.

425
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:55,869
I'll take that as a compliment.

426
00:22:58,589 --> 00:22:59,629
I need to remind you

427
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:01,629
Ms. Yao has been overseeing

428
00:23:01,788 --> 00:23:03,028
internal operations of the company.

429
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:04,349
Don't try to win her over.

430
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:05,869
Maintain a certain distance from her.

431
00:23:08,109 --> 00:23:10,548
So your sudden appearance
was not to compliment me,

432
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:13,028
but to warn me
not to get too close to Ms. Yao.

433
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,268
Perhaps I came across as too eager.

434
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:18,748
I will take it slowly.

435
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:21,508
I think your intention is good.

436
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,548
But some efforts are unrewarding.

437
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:24,829
No need to waste your time.

438
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,109
It's getting late. Let's go together.

439
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:32,189
Are you feeling indignant for me

440
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,988
and giving me some attention?

441
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:37,829
I'm worried if you get home late,

442
00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:39,508
I won't have any porridge tomorrow.

443
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:42,268
I still have work to do.

444
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:43,869
Worry less about useless things.

445
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:45,548
Get off work now.

446
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:11,028
Is anyone there?

447
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:12,909
Are you alright?

448
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:16,988
Ms. Yao.

449
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:19,869
What happened? Are you sick?

450
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:23,869
I'm fine, you can go.

451
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:26,109
I'm the only one left
in the company besides you.

452
00:24:26,268 --> 00:24:27,268
I'll take you to the hospital.

453
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:28,268
No need.

454
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,949
I'll rest for a bit
and then go back myself.

455
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:37,869
If you hate me,
do that when you're well.

456
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,028
Stop being stubborn. Come on.

457
00:24:39,748 --> 00:24:41,669
Now that I know,
I can't let anything happen to you.

458
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:45,666
(Emergency Room)

459
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:53,389
Mr. Lu.

460
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:54,988
You can go now.

461
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:55,629
Go home and rest.

462
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:56,389
Yao...

463
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:09,228
No wonder he was so nervous before.

464
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:11,548
He warned me
not to get close to Ms. Yao.

465
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:14,228
It turns out he was afraid
I'd discover their secret affair.

466
00:25:15,228 --> 00:25:18,389
Why pretend to be a bachelor
if you're not single?

467
00:25:28,548 --> 00:25:30,308
(Still trying to get creepshots)

468
00:25:34,748 --> 00:25:36,228
(I should stay and cover for them.)

469
00:25:37,062 --> 00:25:38,806
(Emergency Room)

470
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,468
I told you to go home.

471
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:06,389
Why won't you leave?

472
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:08,669
I'm tired.

473
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:10,508
Can't I just rest my feet
on the hospital bench?

474
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:12,429
How is Ms. Yao?

475
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,788
Teamwork isn't about cutting corners.

476
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:16,429
Get your eyes off Ms. Yao.

477
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,189
What do you mean by cutting corners?

478
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:19,429
Could I have predicted

479
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:20,949
that Ms. Yao would feel unwell today?

480
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:23,748
Listening to me won't do you any harm.

481
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:27,988
If I wanted to climb the ladder,
I'd go straight for the boss.

482
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:30,228
Why would I go to such lengths
for a secretary?

483
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:37,508
What are you doing?

484
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:39,748
Hitching a ride, not interested
in hitting on the boss.

485
00:26:57,268 --> 00:26:58,468
Did you learn to drive from a bee?

486
00:26:58,629 --> 00:26:59,189
Stop the car.

487
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:08,028
I saw a colleague sick,

488
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:08,748
but I was nagged

489
00:27:08,949 --> 00:27:10,228
for taking her to the hospital.

490
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:11,308
Would I be happy?

491
00:27:11,468 --> 00:27:13,708
Ms. Yao doesn't want her
health condition to be known.

492
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:15,028
I told you to leave, but you stayed.

493
00:27:15,228 --> 00:27:16,109
Can't I say anything?

494
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:16,669
At work,

495
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:19,028
she is the president's secretary,
who needs to be mysterious.

496
00:27:19,189 --> 00:27:20,909
But now, she is just a sick and helpless

497
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,669
patient in need of protection.

498
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:24,149
Besides, I brought her to the hospital.

499
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:25,949
I have to make sure she is okay.

500
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:29,468
If I did anything wrong, at most,

501
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:30,708
I saw your romantic

502
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:32,028
relationship with Ms. Yao.

503
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:32,308
I...

504
00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:33,389
Don't be nervous.

505
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:35,308
I am a worker who knows my limits.

506
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,988
Where on earth did you see

507
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:39,149
that I am dating Ms. Yao?

508
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:40,349
I'm not blind.

509
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:42,349
The way you rushed
to the hospital just now,

510
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:43,669
doesn't that explain it?

511
00:27:44,508 --> 00:27:45,429
Poor Ms. Yao.

512
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:47,268
She can't even publically date you.

513
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:48,589
Do you think you're a celebrity?

514
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:49,708
Such a heavy idol burden.

515
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:50,468
Are you done?

516
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:51,468
No.

517
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,228
Since you are close with her,

518
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:55,389
you should care
even more about her health.

519
00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:56,829
She works overtime so late.

520
00:27:57,028 --> 00:27:58,028
Can't you check on her?

521
00:27:58,228 --> 00:28:00,109
As a cute and cool CEO,
you still need to be a gentleman.

522
00:28:00,268 --> 00:28:01,349
Otherwise, you'd be a scumbag.

523
00:28:02,228 --> 00:28:02,909
I...

524
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:09,389
Listen to me before you go inside.

525
00:28:09,548 --> 00:28:10,429
Let me reiterate.

526
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:11,949
I am not dating Ms. Yao.

527
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,389
We are purely business partners.

528
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:14,228
Do you understand?

529
00:28:15,949 --> 00:28:16,988
I don't need your explanation.

530
00:28:17,189 --> 00:28:19,149
Boss, who you like
is none of my business.

531
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:20,189
As for the ceremony,

532
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:21,308
now that I couldn't make it

533
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:22,149
to blend in,

534
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:23,389
I won't go.

535
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:24,788
There is still one more day.

536
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:26,748
Just assume I choose to give up.

537
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:28,708
Suit yourself.

538
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:37,909
(What's wrong with me?)
(What's wrong with me?)

539
00:28:59,028 --> 00:28:59,708
I'm late.

540
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:07,669
There are no peanuts
in the porridge today, right?

541
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:10,228
If you forget what I told you again,
I'll send you away immediately.

542
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:14,988
What are you doing here?

543
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:15,788
At this time?

544
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,349
Shouldn't you be at the regular meeting?

545
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:19,109
Where I am and what I'm doing

546
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:21,308
is not your concern, servant.

547
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:22,389
What servant?

548
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:27,429
What's going on here?

549
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:30,189
You've repeatedly fallen behind on rent,
with interest piling up,

550
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:32,949
you already owe me so much money.

551
00:29:35,788 --> 00:29:37,109
I've taken back the house.

552
00:29:37,468 --> 00:29:38,949
Serve well as my servant
to repay the debt.

553
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:41,629
Don't I work at Pinshang?

554
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:44,228
I will work hard on my drawings
to repay the debt.

555
00:29:45,988 --> 00:29:48,028
You've been fired by Pinshang.

556
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,468
Why?

557
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:53,389
Because my wife doesn't like you.

558
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:54,949
Your wife?

559
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:57,268
My dear.

560
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:10,308
Yes, because I don't like you.

561
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:14,748
You...

562
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:16,869
Both of you...

563
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,149
You...

564
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,268
Why am I having such a dream?

565
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:45,669
Let's buy some tea.

566
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:47,949
You've quit drinking.
Tea is good for the liver.

567
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:49,629
Never mind, it's not necessary.

568
00:30:50,508 --> 00:30:51,909
I've heard from Ran.

569
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:54,508
She has recently
taken a liking to tea as well.

570
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:57,508
Then let's buy some.

571
00:30:58,988 --> 00:30:59,629
Let's go.

572
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:10,949
Minde, you seem to be happy.

573
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:13,788
I thought after you were
driven out of the Yi Family,

574
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:15,429
you could only suffocate.

575
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,149
Can you afford the tea?

576
00:31:19,788 --> 00:31:22,028
I still have the ability
to earn some pocket money.

577
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:24,228
You're being modest.

578
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:26,109
I am someone who values talent.

579
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:28,028
With your ability,

580
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:30,468
even if you give up on a place in Yihua,

581
00:31:30,988 --> 00:31:32,548
you can surely suffice
for middle management

582
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:34,909
at my mother's family company.

583
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:35,629
Bu Huiyun.

584
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:37,589
You've caused this for Minde.

585
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:40,068
No wonder Mom disapproved

586
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:41,748
of you two getting married.

587
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:44,629
Look at what you brought to him.

588
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:51,308
Kexin.

589
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:53,308
I married Huiyun

590
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:54,829
because I love her.

591
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:57,589
Loving someone isn't about taking,

592
00:31:58,028 --> 00:31:59,189
nor is it scheming for her help.

593
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:01,508
Instead, it's about changing
my personality,

594
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:04,308
my temperament,
and my lifestyle for her.

595
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:08,068
Our life is a bit strained right now,

596
00:32:08,949 --> 00:32:09,949
but still,

597
00:32:11,949 --> 00:32:13,829
we are very happy.

598
00:32:15,508 --> 00:32:18,109
You and Mincai should know.

599
00:32:19,308 --> 00:32:20,389
You don't need to mock me.

600
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:22,869
Mincai will never

601
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:24,308
be as caring as you.

602
00:32:25,189 --> 00:32:26,349
But I have Zihe, who will

603
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,389
eventually take over the Yi Family

604
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:29,869
and make me proud.

605
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:31,988
As for Bu Ran, though,

606
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:34,788
does staying under Lu Cenyang's wing

607
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:36,909
let you rest easy?

608
00:32:37,629 --> 00:32:39,589
Aren't you worried

609
00:32:39,788 --> 00:32:41,028
about Lu Cenyang and her

610
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:43,149
exchanging glances day and night?

611
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:48,068
Once Bu Ran gets charmed by Lu Cenyang,

612
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:50,869
and Lu Cenyang finds out
she's from the Yi Family,

613
00:32:53,468 --> 00:32:56,189
what will become of Bu Ran?

614
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:14,016
(Salary Payment)

615
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:20,829
(Thank goodness.)

616
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:22,268
(I have money to improve)

617
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:23,589
(my family's living conditions.)

618
00:33:26,748 --> 00:33:27,629
Why are you in a daze?

619
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:30,589
Mr. Li, good morning.

620
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:31,508
Morning.

621
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:34,389
I just saw my salary
as a regular employee,

622
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:35,468
and I got emotional.

623
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:37,028
Seeing your hard work

624
00:33:37,268 --> 00:33:39,028
reflected in the salary

625
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:40,508
feels good, right?

626
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:41,589
Yes.

627
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,589
I won't have to worry about living
paycheck to paycheck anymore.

628
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:45,829
I can even afford gifts

629
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:47,389
as filial piety to my parents.

630
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:49,149
Mr. Li.

631
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:50,669
Do you have any good items

632
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:52,149
for gifts to my parents?

633
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:54,389
I'm just a gardener.

634
00:33:54,748 --> 00:33:57,228
All I understand is
fertilizers and pesticides.

635
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:59,189
If you must ask,

636
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:01,869
I suggest asking Mr. Lu.

637
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:03,589
He has a broad perspective

638
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,548
and knows what's trendy now.

639
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:10,108
I'm afraid he'll charge
a consulting fee.

640
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:11,829
I certainly won't ask him.

641
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:14,188
I was just saying.

642
00:34:14,749 --> 00:34:16,148
I didn't expect such a big reaction.

643
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:18,068
Did he scold you again?

644
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:19,229
No.

645
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:20,548
I...

646
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:25,028
I'm going to work first.

647
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,148
(Your dad heard you like drinking tea.)

648
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:36,749
(He was reluctant to spend on himself,)

649
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,028
(but he bought two jin for you.)

650
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:11,229
Give me a hand. I can hardly
carry them anymore.

651
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:15,709
It's payday today.

652
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:17,148
I released my shopping desire.

653
00:35:17,508 --> 00:35:19,028
Mom, these are kitchen supplies for you.

654
00:35:19,229 --> 00:35:20,468
Aren't you working today?

655
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:22,869
Why did you come here at lunch break?

656
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:24,628
My little electric scooter
is very reliable.

657
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:26,508
The earlier you get it,
the sooner you can use it.

658
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:27,949
Our busy Mr. Lu

659
00:35:28,148 --> 00:35:30,749
relies on such smart
and convenient appliances

660
00:35:30,749 --> 00:35:31,988
to make a variety

661
00:35:31,988 --> 00:35:33,188
of tasty dishes

662
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:34,949
in a very short time.

663
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:39,829
My girl.

664
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:42,148
You've chosen a nice pot.

665
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:44,028
Since when do you understand bonsai?

666
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,389
I learned from Mr. Lu.

667
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:47,349
Using bonsai to adorn the indoor space

668
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:48,829
is particularly effective.

669
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,468
Mom also likes to grow flowers.

670
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:51,668
She can play with it.

671
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:54,349
You've learned a lot from Lu Cenyang.

672
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:55,749
Rubbing off on him.

673
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:57,709
Learning more wouldn't hurt.

674
00:35:58,028 --> 00:35:58,909
Dad, where's your tea?

675
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:00,148
Here.

676
00:36:01,468 --> 00:36:02,749
I've prepared it for you early.

677
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:04,468
Come, take a smell.

678
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:09,508
The aroma of the tea is rich,

679
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,628
not at all inferior
to Mr. Lu's treasured collection.

680
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,309
Ran,

681
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:20,588
have you noticed

682
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:22,789
that you can't seem to stop
talking about Lu Cenyang?

683
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:27,429
I saw your Aunt Xin today.

684
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:31,028
Her habit is to have someone
tail the people she dislikes.

685
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:32,668
She warned me, saying

686
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:35,309
you've been getting particularly close
with Lu Cenyang recently.

687
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:36,148
Would you...

688
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:37,389
How could that be possible?

689
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,869
Aunt Xin loves to be condescending.

690
00:36:40,188 --> 00:36:42,229
The more jealous of us she becomes,

691
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:43,628
the more she tends to exaggerate.

692
00:36:44,389 --> 00:36:45,909
I trust you.

693
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:47,588
But Lu Cenyang

694
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:49,749
has always been at odds
with the Yi Family.

695
00:36:50,468 --> 00:36:51,468
If you and he really...

696
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,229
Don't worry.

697
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:55,108
He has a girlfriend.

698
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:58,508
It's just a secret affair.

699
00:36:59,988 --> 00:37:00,909
Well, that's good.

700
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:03,468
His having a girlfriend is one thing.

701
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:04,468
Would you...

702
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:06,309
If there were anything between us,

703
00:37:06,508 --> 00:37:08,548
would I still need to struggle
in the Marketing Department?

704
00:37:09,028 --> 00:37:10,309
I just want to remind you.

705
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:12,229
Some people are just hoping

706
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:13,829
for you and Lu Cenyang to get together

707
00:37:14,028 --> 00:37:16,188
so that they can
catch him by the short hair.

708
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:18,309
Otherwise, why would they

709
00:37:18,508 --> 00:37:20,548
be so kind and not expose
your identity at the Yi Family?

710
00:37:21,548 --> 00:37:23,148
The more important
you are to Lu Cenyang,

711
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:25,108
the greater your value for being used.

712
00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:26,988
Don't get involved

713
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:28,389
and caught in a dilemma.

714
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:31,068
I see.

715
00:37:32,028 --> 00:37:33,148
I'll go back to the company.

716
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:34,188
See you.

717
00:37:34,548 --> 00:37:35,389
Look at this kid.

718
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,949
Whenever we talk about something you
don't want to hear, you'd bolt.

719
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:39,668
Your dad's worries are valid.

720
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:41,949
You have the Welfare Center case
to back you up.

721
00:37:42,148 --> 00:37:44,508
You can start an independent career.

722
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:46,869
I only participated in
a bit of the design.

723
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:48,389
Still a long way off.

724
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:49,508
I have a meeting.

725
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:50,429
I'll rush back now.

726
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:53,148
I'm off.

727
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:55,229
Be careful on the road.

728
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:56,188
Got it.

729
00:38:22,728 --> 00:38:27,177
♪Don't pity the journey
we agreed to embark on♪

730
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:33,992
