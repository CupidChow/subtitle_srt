20
00:01:48,115 --> 00:01:48,755
Please come in.

21
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:52,315
Carry's resignation letter.

22
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:53,315
Please approve it.

23
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:00,115
Although Carry put on
a final good show for you,

24
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:02,475
she was sent by Ms. Hua after all.

25
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,156
Your kindness to her

26
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:06,156
is because she has helped Bu Ran, right?

27
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:07,956
Spare someone when you can.

28
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:09,716
With Carry's staged act,

29
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:11,915
Ms. Hua will be enough
for her to deal with.

30
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:13,595
Let's part on good terms.

31
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:14,595
Oh right,

32
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:17,915
during the last industry gathering,

33
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:20,035
you declared Bu Ran's true identity

34
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:21,556
in front of the whole industry,

35
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,315
which will bring greater
criticism upon Bu Ran.

36
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:26,195
I know I was wrong.

37
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,716
I don't want the Yi family's influence

38
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:29,635
on Bu Ran to continue.

39
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:33,635
You're thinking of Bu Ran
in every aspect.

40
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,116
She's so lucky to be your girlfriend.

41
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:39,035
I want to protect her as much as I can,

42
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:42,276
hoping she won't be hurt again.

43
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:50,236
Yi Zihe.

44
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:51,915
What are you doing?

45
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,396
Show some sincerity for a blind date.

46
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:57,556
You're only checking your phone
and drinking.

47
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:58,795
Who are you looking down on?

48
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:00,795
What's with all the fuss?

49
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:02,956
We're just going through the motions

50
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,956
so we can report back
and be done with it.

51
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:08,035
You're not respecting
other people's time.

52
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:10,195
With the money I make in one day,

53
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,556
I can hire a man who could
outperform you in every aspect.

54
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:14,996
You spend all day flaunting
the money your family gives you,

55
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:17,075
kissing up big shots.

56
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:18,355
I pity you.

57
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:28,075
Stop right there.

58
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:30,396
Who do you think you are?

59
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:50,556
Isn't this the right hand
of Lu Cenyang, Ms. Yao?

60
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:52,996
Leaving so soon?

61
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:55,755
Have another drink, on me.

62
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:57,035
Get out of the way.

63
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:00,956
There's never been a woman
who refused me.

64
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:03,556
Only women that I look down on.

65
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:07,035
Today, I'm up for a challenge,

66
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:08,635
a date with Ms. Yao.

67
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,836
Sit for a while and have a drink.

68
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:13,515
I'll take you home.

69
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:15,595
Let go of me.

70
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:16,436
Let's go.

71
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:17,916
Yi Zihe, let go of me.

72
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,075
What are you doing?

73
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:19,955
Drunk much?

74
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:23,635
I have money, go spend it.

75
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,515
You're taking money from a woman.

76
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:26,356
Don't act all mighty.

77
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:28,315
I...

78
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,155
Yi Zihe.

79
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:30,635
What are you doing?

80
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:33,236
Mister.

81
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:34,955
Sir, please calm down.

82
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,275
My friend's self-esteem
was hurt by a blind date,

83
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:38,395
so please forgive him.

84
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:40,036
I apologize on his behalf.

85
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:41,356
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:42,395
I'll take him away now.

87
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:44,436
Watch your mouth.

88
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,996
If you weren't holding me back,

89
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:53,315
I'd have beaten that brat.

90
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:54,996
He'd be picking up
his teeth off the floor.

91
00:04:58,676 --> 00:04:59,835
Embarrassing.

92
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,155
What?

93
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:02,596
Wai.

94
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:03,315
Let go.

95
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:05,195
Why did you apologize for me?

96
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:05,676
Let go.

97
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:07,315
I don't owe any woman favors.

98
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:09,755
Let go.

99
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:16,116
What do you want? I'll buy it for you.

100
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,395
Yi Zihe, let go of me.

101
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:20,556
My self-esteem only
comes from flirting with girls.

102
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:24,036
Only those who value my status

103
00:05:24,476 --> 00:05:25,835
will respect me.

104
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:27,955
In my grandmother's eyes,

105
00:05:28,556 --> 00:05:30,436
I'm just a good-for-nothing.

106
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,155
In my parents' hearts,

107
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:34,916
I'm just a spoiled child.

108
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:36,715
It's me.

109
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,635
I'm the successor of Yihua.

110
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:42,476
But I have to secure my value

111
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,116
through a business marriage.

112
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:46,075
I'm so angry.

113
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:47,796
All drowned in alcohol.

114
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:54,036
At least you have your father,
mother, and grandmother

115
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,275
to give you clothes and food.

116
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:58,036
What about those who drift alone

117
00:05:58,195 --> 00:05:59,155
without any relatives?

118
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:00,596
You truly are disappointing.

119
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:01,916
Yes, you're right.

120
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:02,635
Let go of me.

121
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:05,916
You're so outstanding. Be my secretary.

122
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:08,476
I promise to cherish you more
than Lu Cenyang ever would.

123
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:15,395
Don't go. I'm not done yet.

124
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:18,556
I need to talk to someone.

125
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:21,876
I have to.

126
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:22,835
Hey, Boss.

127
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,075
I'm in a bit of trouble now.

128
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:25,755
I'll send you the location.

129
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:29,075
Lu Cenyang is so blind,

130
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:31,835
falling for my sister,
that fighting cock.

131
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:34,955
You won't have a future by his side.

132
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:42,996
Yi Zihe, Yi Zihe.

133
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:46,676
Yi Zihe.

134
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:53,556
Ms. Yao. Ms. Yao.

135
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:55,515
Look at your pathetic face.

136
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:57,996
A loser like you
doesn't deserve Ms. Yao.

137
00:06:58,236 --> 00:06:59,596
Who are you calling a loser?

138
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:19,155
Here.

139
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:20,916
Thanks.

140
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:22,835
What a coincidence.

141
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:25,715
I was just passing by.

142
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:27,835
I owe you one.

143
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:28,755
I'll repay you.

144
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:29,635
How about now?

145
00:07:30,996 --> 00:07:32,275
I've heard that Lu Cenyang

146
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,275
was originally going to be
the Lu family's son-in-law.

147
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:35,916
Is that true or false?

148
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:37,916
Are you asking it for Bu Ran?

149
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:47,395
Mr. Lu and Lu Siqi have grown up
together since childhood.

150
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:48,996
They are close.

151
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:51,996
Old Mr. Lu has always
seen him as a son-in-law.

152
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:53,556
When Lu Mingyu went bankrupt,

153
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:55,556
Lu Siqi suffered amnesia
due to the shock.

154
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,796
Mr. Lu has always protected her well.

155
00:07:58,356 --> 00:08:00,116
The son-in-law story is nonsensical.

156
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:03,315
However, Lu Siqi
does have feelings for Mr. Lu.

157
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:06,715
I see.

158
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:07,676
Thank you.

159
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:09,715
It's late. Let me take you home.

160
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:11,996
It's okay. I'll take a cab myself.

161
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:16,356
You're the real loser.

162
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:35,876
Thank you for helping Yao.

163
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:41,395
It's only natural to help my own sister.

164
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:51,395
But I want to ask you,

165
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:54,155
how did the diary appear

166
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:55,555
at the critical moment?

167
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,635
You didn't make a prop
just to fool me, did you?

168
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,635
Where would I find
the time to write so much?

169
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:03,716
As long as I tell Bu Ran what you did,

170
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:05,635
you are no longer a threat to me.

171
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:08,236
Then why don't you tell her?

172
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,795
You don't seem like a soft person.

173
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:12,956
Because you're the friend

174
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:14,356
she cares about most.

175
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:16,596
If she were to lose your friendship,

176
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:19,275
it would probably hurt her
more than losing me.

177
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:21,635
I wouldn't do something so foolish.

178
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:27,196
Lu Cenyang.

179
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:30,836
You have everything,

180
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:35,555
a father, a sister, a family,

181
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:36,915
and a company.

182
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:40,836
You have taken everything

183
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:41,915
that should've been mine.

184
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:48,675
Can you

185
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:52,795
just give Bu Ran to me?

186
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,435
No.

187
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:58,155
If you think it's unfair,

188
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:00,155
I can give up
all the shares of Pingshang

189
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:01,356
for you and Siqi.

190
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,196
You're indeed much more
generous than Yihua.

191
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:12,076
But I won't give up.

192
00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:17,275
Don't give me any chances.

193
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:18,356
Otherwise,

194
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,155
I will bring you down.

195
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:37,155
Son, don't scare me.

196
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:38,635
Did your blind date from yesterday

197
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:39,476
hurt you?

198
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,795
Mom, I'm doing great.

199
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:45,755
Where are you going?

200
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:48,356
Look at your son.

201
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,555
You don't even check on him.

202
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:53,635
What happened to him?

203
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:56,435
A blind date without bodyguards,

204
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,635
and he ended up drunk
next to a trash can.

205
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:00,515
The patrol police brought him back.

206
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:04,395
He has a high fever of 39 degrees

207
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:05,755
and keeps smiling foolishly.

208
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:07,716
He must have been traumatized.

209
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:09,435
Go tell Mom

210
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:10,996
Zihe won't go on blind dates again.

211
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:12,275
It's all because of you.

212
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:13,675
You had to go against her,

213
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:14,876
meddling here and there,

214
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:16,716
insisting on breaking up
Bu Ran and Lu Cenyang,

215
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:20,155
which backfired on yourself.

216
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:22,836
Mom is now utterly disappointed in us.

217
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:24,395
I can hardly save myself now.

218
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:25,915
You go talk to her.

219
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:27,515
Listen to me.

220
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:29,476
How dare you blame me?

221
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:31,795
Aren't you the one who always messes up?

222
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:33,956
If you could have persuaded Qin Xun,

223
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:35,596
my plan would have
been completed long ago.

224
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,076
Let me tell you.

225
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:38,356
I don't expect

226
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:40,356
Yihua to keep its number-one position
in the industry.

227
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:40,915
I don't

228
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:42,555
expect you to be the President.

229
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:44,395
But what do I expect?

230
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:46,035
I just want Zihe to be well.

231
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:47,076
I want him to be fine.

232
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:49,155
I asked you to talk to Mom

233
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:50,356
not for my sake,

234
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:51,435
but for Zihe's.

235
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:52,035
You...

236
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:57,196
You sure know how to talk nicely.

237
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,356
I'm just an unemployed vagrant.

238
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:00,795
I would be grateful

239
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:01,915
if Mom could scold me less.

240
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:03,076
Besides,

241
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:05,435
the blind dates are just a formality.

242
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:06,675
When a man gets humiliated,

243
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:08,076
just recover his pride.

244
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:09,196
Dad.

245
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:10,795
I don't feel humiliated.

246
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:12,356
I have truly encountered the one.

247
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:14,476
What the one?

248
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:15,675
I think you are,

249
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:16,956
just like your father,

250
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:17,956
drunk.

251
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:20,116
Yi Mincai, listen.

252
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:22,395
You might as well kneel down
and beg Mom for mercy

253
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:24,275
to lift the pressure on our son.

254
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:25,915
Otherwise, I will divorce you,

255
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,356
take our son and leave this house.

256
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:30,716
Then you'll have nothing.

257
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:43,876
Why would my mother scare me?

258
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:48,956
Mom.

259
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:54,275
Mom.

260
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:56,915
It's me.

261
00:12:58,476 --> 00:12:59,675
I underestimated the opponent

262
00:13:00,035 --> 00:13:01,076
and I've let you down.

263
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:02,915
But I'm begging you.

264
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:04,996
Please don't make Zihe
go on blind dates again,

265
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:06,196
okay?

266
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:09,395
You and your son didn't
underestimate your opponent.

267
00:13:09,836 --> 00:13:11,395
You've been pampered.

268
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:13,836
The market is only so big.

269
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:15,476
If you want the company to grow,

270
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:18,275
you must eat a bit more than others.

271
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:19,915
If you're not full,

272
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:22,076
you must snatch it from others.

273
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,316
If others won't let go of their food,

274
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:27,915
you must swallow them whole.

275
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:31,716
It has been Yihua's way all along.

276
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:33,635
If you want to take over,

277
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:35,635
you must first be tough on yourself

278
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,596
before you can be tough on others.

279
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:43,716
Stop it. I'm not dead yet.

280
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:47,915
You were dismissed,

281
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:53,116
yet you still attended
the industry gathering with Kexin.

282
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:55,196
Longing for an opportunity
to perform, huh?

283
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:57,435
Fine, I'll give you one.

284
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:01,356
Continue with what Zihe didn't finish.

285
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:03,515
Keep a close watch on Qin Xun.

286
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:05,555
I just can't believe

287
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:08,076
that he doesn't harbor any resentment

288
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:10,275
after having everything
taken by Lu Cenyang.

289
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:13,675
You will go and find some clues.

290
00:14:14,476 --> 00:14:15,116
Mom.

291
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:17,596
He's a bartender. Do I have to go?

292
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:18,635
What?

293
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,596
Do you have a problem with me?

294
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:21,316
Understood.

295
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:23,675
You're clearly trying to get rid of me.

296
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:24,836
Out of sight, out of mind.

297
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:26,236
What kind of opportunity is this?

298
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:28,956
Do you know how much market share Yihua

299
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,236
lost to Pinshang when you were CEO?

300
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:34,915
If you think

301
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:37,476
that keeping an eye on Qin Xun
is a waste of your talent,

302
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:40,836
find a way to do it better than Minde.

303
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,515
At least when he was at Yihua,

304
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,515
I didn't have to worry
as much as I do now.

305
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:46,316
Mom.

306
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,596
However capable Minde was,

307
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:48,316
frankly,

308
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:49,755
he's just a traitor.

309
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:50,996
In these two years,

310
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:52,236
I have put in the hard work.

311
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:55,275
You made me marry Meng Kexin,
whom I don't even like.

312
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,395
And I did it for the sake of our family.

313
00:14:58,876 --> 00:14:59,836
All these years,

314
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:01,356
I've given so much.

315
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:03,836
Am I still dispensable in your heart?

316
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,035
Am I even your biological son?

317
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,116
My son

318
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:09,476
must possess the wisdom and calmness

319
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:11,076
needed to handle the most thorny issues.

320
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:14,956
He shouldn't be like a homeless dog

321
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:15,956
who only knows how to bark.

322
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:20,035
At least when Minde was driven
out of the Yi family by me,

323
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:22,876
he didn't lose composure like you did.

324
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,316
You might as well rely
on Minde's family from now on.

325
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:40,035
Do you like it?

326
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:42,076
I do.

327
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:44,956
Your sense of beauty is always on point.

328
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:48,635
No, it's because I'm in a good mood.

329
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,435
Seeing how Cenyang takes
such good care of Ran,

330
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:54,316
all my previous worries

331
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:55,996
have disappeared.

332
00:15:58,915 --> 00:15:59,635
Yi Minde.

333
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:01,395
Mincai.

334
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:06,116
Cai, why are you so angry?

335
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:07,996
It's all your fault
for siding with Lu Mingyu,

336
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:11,155
leaving behind such a disaster
like Lu Cenyang.

337
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:12,316
Do you know

338
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:13,795
that to deal with him,

339
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:15,596
Mom asked me to follow a bartender?

340
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,596
I am the CEO of Yihua.

341
00:16:17,795 --> 00:16:18,956
How can I do that?

342
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,996
Wait, Cai.

343
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,915
Mom asked you to go,
so why are you getting mad at me?

344
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:25,356
How can I not be mad at you?

345
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:27,635
Since you chose to leave the Yi family,

346
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:28,716
why can't you

347
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,236
go where Mom can't see you?

348
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,395
That way, I don't have
to compete with you

349
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:34,915
or look like a clown in Mom's eyes

350
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:37,035
as the disfavored second son.

351
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:38,675
But you just won't leave.

352
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:41,275
You indulged Bu Ran

353
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:44,356
to help Lu Cenyang against me.

354
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:45,236
So what do you want?

355
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:46,395
What do I want?

356
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:48,316
If you make my life hard,

357
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:49,956
nobody can have it easy.

358
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:51,236
You won't have it easy.

359
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:51,675
No.

360
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,196
You can't have it easy. No!

361
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:53,956
Cai.

362
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:55,236
- Mincai, no.
- You're tough, huh?

363
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:56,076
I'm tough.

364
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:57,196
- So what?
- Mincai.

365
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:58,395
Stop fighting. Let go.

366
00:16:58,596 --> 00:16:59,555
- Go away.
- Stop fighting.

367
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:02,316
So what? I am tough now.

368
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:02,915
Cai.

369
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:04,076
- Calm down.
- What can you do?

370
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:05,235
What?

371
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:06,516
Why should I calm down?

372
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:06,995
Huiyun.

373
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:08,235
Huiyun.

374
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:10,756
Huiyun.

375
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:15,596
Doctor, how is my Mom?

376
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:18,635
She's alright.

377
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:20,596
In her condition,
she can't be emotional.

378
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:22,316
You must never let her
get agitated again.

379
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,195
Okay, we will definitely be careful.

380
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:34,836
You've finally shown up.

381
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:36,876
You shouldn't neglect your treatment.

382
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:38,556
Come on, come with me for acupuncture.

383
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:48,276
Hello?

384
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:49,876
I don't see you on your day off.

385
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:51,036
Where did you go?

386
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:52,596
Visiting my parents.

387
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:56,076
Thinking about the upcoming
rush for the bid,

388
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:57,316
I won't have time.

389
00:17:57,836 --> 00:17:58,756
Why don't you invite them

390
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:00,155
to live in Fortune Pavilion with you?

391
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:02,116
Originally, you lived alone
in such a big house

392
00:18:02,116 --> 00:18:03,475
to hide your identity.

393
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:05,036
Now, there's nothing to worry about.

394
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:07,836
I'll ask them.

395
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:10,195
I'm going to work now.

396
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,475
Take care of yourself. See you around.

397
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:18,556
Are you okay, Ran?

398
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:19,955
Dad.

399
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:21,675
Lu Cenyang suggested you and Mom

400
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:22,836
move in at Fortune Pavilion.

401
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:35,796
Thank him for me.

402
00:18:37,195 --> 00:18:39,356
I'm just worried this might agitate
your uncle even more.

403
00:18:39,796 --> 00:18:42,036
Is he childish or just lawless?

404
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,036
I really can't let it go this time.

405
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:46,395
Don't escalate things.

406
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:47,715
Didn't you hear the doctor?

407
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:49,556
You can't agitate your mom anymore.

408
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:52,356
You have to go to work tomorrow.

409
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,756
Go back and rest early.

410
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:55,596
She will be discharged tomorrow.

411
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:57,395
I'll be here with her.

412
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:58,675
Don't worry.

413
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,116
Give me the kettle.
I'll go get some water.

414
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,076
Grandma.

415
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:26,235
I heard your mom was hospitalized.

416
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,195
She does have a weak body.

417
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:30,516
Of course,

418
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:32,276
that's not her fault.

419
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,356
After all, your parents

420
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:37,076
can't handle Mincai and Kexin.

421
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:40,475
It's clear I made the right decision

422
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:44,955
to make my son marry a woman
of equal social status.

423
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:46,036
Grandma.

424
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:47,395
Did you call

425
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,356
just to specifically humiliate my mom?

426
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:51,796
If you don't want Mincai and Kexin

427
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:53,876
to disturb Bu Huiyun again,

428
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:54,955
it's easy.

429
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:57,356
Just do what I say.

430
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:01,876
Grandma, are you going
to use the same old trick again?

431
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:03,516
I gave you the answer

432
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:04,955
when I joined Pinshang.

433
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:05,596
I don't...

434
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:10,276
You wouldn't want Kexin and Mincai

435
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:12,596
to make trouble at your house
from time to time, right?

436
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:15,995
Did you...

437
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:19,796
Did you deliberately make Uncle mad

438
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:21,435
so that he lashes out at my parents,

439
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,076
forcing me to work for you?

440
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:24,276
Grandma.

441
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,395
How can anyone become your pawn?

442
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:28,155
You really are ruthless.

443
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:29,556
You should understand

444
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:31,955
the situation of your parents

445
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:34,836
has always been under my control.

446
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:39,356
Then what do you want me to do?

447
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:42,715
Of course, something within your power.

448
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:48,675
Hand over the complete set of Pinshang's
ancient alley renovation blueprints

449
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:49,796
to me.

450
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:53,836
How unconfident you are

451
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,435
in Yihua's design department?

452
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,235
If you want to beat Pinshang,

453
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:59,155
all you know is stealing drawings.

454
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:02,155
To demoralize Pinshang,

455
00:21:02,715 --> 00:21:04,675
these means are simple and effective.

456
00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:07,516
Remember,

457
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:09,995
you only have one chance.

458
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,556
Get it done quickly.

459
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:43,276
Lefei.

460
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:44,596
Let's chat for a bit.

461
00:21:46,395 --> 00:21:47,915
I have nothing to say to you.

462
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:50,435
Look at the gift I got you.

463
00:21:55,475 --> 00:21:56,395
Ostentatious.

464
00:21:57,475 --> 00:21:59,116
You don't even know what I like

465
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:00,316
and you want to woo me.

466
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:01,955
It's utterly absurd.

467
00:22:02,516 --> 00:22:04,435
Don't you women just love bags?

468
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,356
These are all the latest models.

469
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:08,516
I'm not one of those women

470
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:09,516
you can easily win over.

471
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:12,195
What I like are eco-friendly bags.

472
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:16,715
Let's chat a bit more.

473
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:20,316
This is our bidding proposal
for the ancient alley

474
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:21,235
renovation.

475
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:23,116
You can look at the document

476
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,435
and see if there's anything
that needs to be changed.

477
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:26,675
(You should understand)

478
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:28,516
(the situation of your parents)

479
00:22:29,155 --> 00:22:31,356
(has always been under my control.)

480
00:22:31,556 --> 00:22:33,756
The ancient alley has fitness equipment

481
00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:36,435
to allow those older grandparents...

482
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:39,635
(Hand over the set of Pinshang's
ancient alley renovation blueprints)

483
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:41,036
(to me.)

484
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,756
In this area...

485
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:48,246
(Pinshang Architectural Group)

486
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:56,516
Please come in.

487
00:22:59,116 --> 00:22:59,796
Just in time.

488
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:01,675
Bu Ran has sent me the final drawings

489
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:02,356
for the ancient

490
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:03,116
alley renovation.

491
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:03,675
Take a look.

492
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:08,116
I received treatment this morning

493
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:11,116
and Dr. Ma said it has had no effect.

494
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,155
Perhaps because I've been too busy.

495
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:15,235
Don't be anxious.

496
00:23:15,516 --> 00:23:16,876
This takes time.

497
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:21,836
I'm thinking of taking my two years'
annual leave together.

498
00:23:23,475 --> 00:23:24,316
Right now?

499
00:23:25,235 --> 00:23:26,796
The company is about
to face a major test.

500
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:30,516
You mean the bidding
for the ancient alley renovation, right?

501
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:33,235
Bu Ran is wrapping up the designs

502
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:35,635
and is about to enter the next stage

503
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:36,516
of the bidding process.

504
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:39,715
The company is well-versed
in this kind of business.

505
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:41,316
Rest assured, Boss.

506
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,915
It's a good opportunity for me
to have a break for myself.

507
00:23:44,276 --> 00:23:45,195
I'll gather information

508
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:47,155
and keep you updated
with any good ideas.

509
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:49,076
Since you've put it that way,

510
00:23:49,276 --> 00:23:50,876
I'll approve your leave.

511
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:52,675
Be careful when you go out.

512
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:54,276
It's best to have some company

513
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,356
to take care of you.

514
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:59,036
I would most like
to travel with you, Boss.

515
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:01,435
I have a lot on my plate here.

516
00:24:02,915 --> 00:24:03,675
Just kidding.

517
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:07,556
Let's arrange it after the company wins
the ancient alley renovation bid.

518
00:24:07,756 --> 00:24:08,516
It's a deal.

519
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:11,915
Oh, right.

520
00:24:12,955 --> 00:24:15,116
Yihua has always been interested
in the ancient alley

521
00:24:15,116 --> 00:24:16,076
renovation project.

522
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:18,316
I'm worried they'll try something again.

523
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,356
Back up the design drawings properly

524
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:23,995
and delete all drafts
stored in the devices.

525
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:25,516
Then I can rest assured.

526
00:24:26,155 --> 00:24:26,756
Okay.

527
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:28,556
I'll leave now.

528
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:29,195
Alright.

529
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:01,155
I'm picking you up.

530
00:25:02,756 --> 00:25:04,756
I have carefully reviewed your design

531
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:06,435
and I have great confidence in you.

532
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:08,435
I've never designed something
of this scale before.

533
00:25:08,995 --> 00:25:10,915
It is indeed a bit stressful.

534
00:25:11,915 --> 00:25:12,756
Be confident.

535
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:14,475
After all, you've won Chen Manni.

536
00:25:15,036 --> 00:25:16,516
That was thanks to you.

537
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:17,715
I am well aware

538
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:19,276
of the gap between me

539
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,596
and renowned designers.

540
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:22,235
I have looked at your final draft.

541
00:25:22,836 --> 00:25:25,036
Your design is not about sensationalism.

542
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:26,635
It's more enduring, more heartfelt,

543
00:25:26,955 --> 00:25:28,596
and has more aesthetic vitality,

544
00:25:29,635 --> 00:25:30,596
just like you.

545
00:25:31,635 --> 00:25:33,836
The more time we spend together,
the more

546
00:25:34,915 --> 00:25:35,955
I fall in love with you.

547
00:25:39,635 --> 00:25:40,995
Although it sounds a bit cheesy,

548
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:43,836
I like it.

549
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:44,796
I know.

550
00:25:48,316 --> 00:25:49,356
I've finished my chocolate.

551
00:25:49,556 --> 00:25:51,276
Can you get me some
from the convenience store?

552
00:25:51,756 --> 00:25:53,076
No problem.

553
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:54,836
I'll wait downstairs.

554
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:25,435
Once the design drawings
are approved by the client,

555
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:26,915
I refuse to believe

556
00:26:26,915 --> 00:26:29,556
that Lu Cenyang
will shamelessly jump out

557
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:31,076
to accuse us of plagiarism.

558
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,076
But if he really gets serious about it,

559
00:26:34,316 --> 00:26:35,155
we're not afraid.

560
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:36,675
We can shift the blame

561
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,635
onto Bu Ran,

562
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:41,235
claiming she sold out Pinshang.

563
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:50,995
Ms. Hua, you've arrived quite early.

564
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:58,116
Mr. Lu, you look great.

565
00:26:58,596 --> 00:27:00,155
Do you think you're bound to win?

566
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:02,635
Be careful not to capsize in the gutter.

567
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,796
My confidence comes from Yihua.

568
00:27:06,155 --> 00:27:08,556
You've given Pinshang the best designer.

569
00:27:09,235 --> 00:27:10,596
Of course, I have reasons to be proud.

570
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,876
Bu Ran, right?

571
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:15,395
I understand her better than you do.

572
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:19,516
The greatest skill of this girl

573
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:22,276
is to say one thing and do another.

574
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:36,276
(You want me to betray Pinshang?)

575
00:27:36,276 --> 00:27:36,995
(No way.)

576
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:37,876
Bu Ran.

577
00:27:38,715 --> 00:27:41,635
Pawns are only meant to be used.

578
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:45,475
The lesson you're about to learn
will be profound.

579
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:46,435
Mom.

580
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:50,155
How could Ms. Hua still use

581
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:52,076
a middle-aged man who fails
at emotion management?

582
00:27:56,756 --> 00:27:57,675
No matter what,

583
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:00,796
I am more loyal than your entire family.

584
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:07,316
(Why do they still look)

585
00:28:07,316 --> 00:28:08,836
(confidently in control?)

586
00:28:09,556 --> 00:28:10,155
This way, please.

587
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:13,395
Let's go inside too.

588
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:16,475
Don't worry.

589
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:24,635
(Hai City Ancient Alley Project Bidding)

590
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:25,556
In a nutshell,

591
00:28:25,715 --> 00:28:28,276
our company's stance
on the ancient alley renovation

592
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:29,955
is to renovate it completely

593
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:31,316
and chase trends.

594
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:33,036
Thank you for your time.

595
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:33,836
Thank you.

596
00:28:38,036 --> 00:28:40,076
Let's welcome the Yihua Group

597
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:42,876
to present their ancient alley
renovation plans.

598
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:02,836
It's a great honor
to participate in this bid

599
00:29:02,995 --> 00:29:04,556
for the ancient alley renovation.

600
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:07,395
Yihua pays great attention

601
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:09,596
to this ancient alley

602
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:10,836
renovation project.

603
00:29:12,796 --> 00:29:15,195
We assembled the nation's top masters

604
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:19,076
of spatial design who best
understand Eastern aesthetics.

605
00:29:20,435 --> 00:29:23,356
The team combines both new
and veteran designers,

606
00:29:23,955 --> 00:29:25,955
striving to preserve the classical...

607
00:29:25,955 --> 00:29:26,915
(How did they still)

608
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:28,395
(get my proposal?)

609
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:31,995
While creating a new cultural village
that appeals to the youth.

610
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,195
Yihua's proposal this time
is very innovative.

611
00:29:48,235 --> 00:29:48,915
Mom.

612
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:50,516
I believe the contents inside

613
00:29:51,516 --> 00:29:53,756
should be enough to redeem
myself for my faults.

614
00:29:54,076 --> 00:29:54,876
What is this?

615
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:56,155
I might be mad that Minde

616
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:58,155
will always be more important to you,

617
00:29:58,395 --> 00:29:59,556
but I'm always thinking

618
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,276
about doing my best for you and Yihua.

619
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:03,276
I bought off an employee at Pinshang,

620
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:04,876
secured their design blueprints,

621
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:05,915
and further optimized them.

622
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:06,955
Besides,

623
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:08,876
I've pulled some strings,

624
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:12,675
allowing us to present
our proposal ahead of Pinshang.

625
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:17,556
It's rare for your thoughts
to be in sync with mine.

626
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:19,836
Mincai.

627
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:22,356
Only after knowing shame,
can one be truly brave.

628
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:24,475
Thank you, Mom.

629
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:30,276
(They released it before us.)

630
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:31,395
(So how can we prove)

631
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:32,715
(that it was Pinshang's proposal?)

632
00:30:33,036 --> 00:30:36,036
That would be all
for Yihua's design presentation.

633
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,316
Yihua...

634
00:30:39,116 --> 00:30:41,195
(Who exactly leaked Bu Ran's proposal?)

635
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:42,635
In terms of design,

636
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:44,876
we participated in this bidding

637
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,675
with the spirit of learning

638
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:50,036
from the many emerging forces here.

639
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:53,076
Whether we can be selected or not,

640
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:54,556
I hope

641
00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:58,036
that we can make our modest contribution
to the revitalization

642
00:30:58,715 --> 00:31:00,955
and development of rural culture.

643
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:02,276
Thank you.

644
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:03,076
Great.

645
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:06,475
Yihua's proposal is just perfect.

646
00:31:22,435 --> 00:31:24,395
Next, we invite the Pinshang Group

647
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:27,155
to present their ancient alley
renovation plans.

648
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:31,276
I'm not sure how Pinshang
will perform this time.

649
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:33,195
Exactly, can they surpass Yihua?

650
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,036
I think Yihua has done a great job.

651
00:31:35,235 --> 00:31:35,675
Yes.

652
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:38,076
I'm still quite looking forward
to Pinshang's proposal.

653
00:32:06,036 --> 00:32:07,475
For Pinshang's project this time...

654
00:32:07,915 --> 00:32:08,596
Wait a second.

655
00:32:11,155 --> 00:32:12,036
What's going on?

656
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:13,036
Is that Ms. Yao?

657
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:13,796
Yeah.

658
00:32:14,915 --> 00:32:15,955
What are they doing

659
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:18,635
interrupting their own speech?

660
00:32:20,276 --> 00:32:22,036
With Chen Manni's assistance,
the new proposal

661
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:22,836
was completed in time.

662
00:32:23,116 --> 00:32:24,876
Let me do the presentation.

663
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:28,715
It's alright.

664
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:29,995
It won't cause much of a stir.

665
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:32,195
Hello, everyone,

666
00:32:32,635 --> 00:32:34,435
I am Yao Lefei from Pinshang.

667
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:41,876
Recently, the famous designer
Ms. Chen Manni and I

668
00:32:42,715 --> 00:32:45,556
have visited some culturally rich,

669
00:32:45,915 --> 00:32:48,316
well-preserved, and advanced
ancient alleys.

670
00:32:49,195 --> 00:32:50,756
We have invited Ms. Chen Manni

671
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:53,116
to optimize our proposal.

672
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:54,556
Please take a look.

673
00:32:57,653 --> 00:32:58,112
(Ancient Alley Renovation Upgrade Plan)

674
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:01,955
This concept is indeed quite good.

675
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:02,596
Yes, right.

676
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:04,675
The design concept is also pretty good.

677
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:06,556
As you can see,

678
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:09,475
the upgrade of the ancient alley is not
just about giving it a makeover,

679
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,796
but also a panoramic planning
of a poetic life

680
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:12,915
in the ancient alley,

681
00:33:13,395 --> 00:33:15,076
including cultural excavation

682
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:16,235
and landscape restoration.

683
00:33:16,836 --> 00:33:17,756
More importantly,

684
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:20,356
it is to make the young natives

685
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:21,635
willing to return home,

686
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:22,715
want to come home...

687
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:25,316
(Did Lu Cenyang have
a contingency plan all along?)

688
00:33:25,516 --> 00:33:26,715
and visit the ancient alley.

689
00:33:28,155 --> 00:33:29,876
(Why didn't he tell me earlier?)

690
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,435
If the proposal we presented

691
00:33:35,036 --> 00:33:37,316
was a 1.1 version of Bu Ran's design,

692
00:33:37,756 --> 00:33:39,076
this current proposal

693
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:40,435
is at least a 2.0 version.

694
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:44,036
(Bu Ran.)

695
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:45,836
(Back then, I lost to you.)

696
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,475
(Today, I will make sure
you lose miserably.)

697
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:54,475
You want to collaborate with me again?

698
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:56,116
It didn't work out last time.

699
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:57,155
Will it work this time?

700
00:33:57,556 --> 00:33:59,036
The project I'm inviting
you to this time

701
00:33:59,356 --> 00:34:00,995
will definitely allow you
to redeem yourself

702
00:34:01,195 --> 00:34:02,316
and teach Bu Ran a good lesson.

703
00:34:04,715 --> 00:34:06,556
I thought Bu Ran was your friend.

704
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:10,475
On the surface, yes.

705
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:12,756
But to some extent,

706
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:16,035
It wouldn't be too much
to call her my indirect enemy.

707
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:20,555
These are the renovation design effects

708
00:34:20,756 --> 00:34:22,515
we created based on the above concepts.

709
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:24,435
Everyone, please continue watching.

710
00:34:25,756 --> 00:34:26,876
This plan is really good.

711
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:28,156
It's more complete than Yihua's.

712
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:28,716
Yes.

713
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:29,716
Impressive, Pinshang.

714
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:32,595
This is even more innovative.

715
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:34,636
In such a short period,

716
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,676
Pinshang has prepared so thoroughly.

717
00:34:37,595 --> 00:34:38,836
How did they manage to do it?

718
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:41,995
Bu Ran must have

719
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:43,636
told Lu Cenyang about our plan

720
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:45,316
so that he could prepare
countermeasures.

721
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:46,995
It's Bu Ran's fault.

722
00:34:50,836 --> 00:34:53,115
Pinshang's proposal is excellent.

723
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:56,515
(While he said he believed in me,)

724
00:34:57,115 --> 00:34:58,555
(he had Ms. Yao and Chen Manni)

725
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,356
(prepare a second plan.)

726
00:35:02,075 --> 00:35:03,115
(From beginning to end,)

727
00:35:03,115 --> 00:35:04,555
(he never considered using my plan)

728
00:35:04,595 --> 00:35:06,075
(to win this bid.)

729
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:11,995
Pawns are only meant to be used.

730
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,676
The lesson you're about to learn

731
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:16,915
will be profound.

732
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:31,156
That concludes our proposal.

733
00:35:32,515 --> 00:35:33,555
Impressive, indeed.

734
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:35,395
This proposal is both
innovative and comprehensive,

735
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:37,595
even more perfect than Yihua's.

736
00:35:43,676 --> 00:35:44,395
Let's go.

737
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:49,636
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

738
00:35:49,836 --> 00:35:51,876
Pinshang's proposal
was truly outstanding.

739
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:52,595
Mr. Lu.

740
00:35:52,756 --> 00:35:53,276
Our judges

741
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:53,955
will carefully

742
00:35:54,075 --> 00:35:54,796
study your proposals.

743
00:35:55,876 --> 00:35:56,555
Boss.

744
00:35:57,236 --> 00:35:58,236
Judging by this applause,

745
00:35:58,716 --> 00:35:59,636
Pinshang has won.

746
00:36:05,156 --> 00:36:06,075
Stop right there.

747
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:18,035
You keep stepping on Yihua's interests

748
00:36:18,196 --> 00:36:19,515
to ingratiate yourself with Lu Cenyang.

749
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:23,395
I will let you know
the consequences of betraying me.

750
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:24,395
I didn't.

751
00:36:24,636 --> 00:36:25,995
Didn't you collude with Lu Cenyang?

752
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:27,756
Then how could he have prepared

753
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:29,356
a plan that entirely suppresses Yihua?

754
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,555
Since when does a thief
get to be so self-righteous?

755
00:36:31,796 --> 00:36:32,475
Who's a thief?

756
00:36:32,676 --> 00:36:33,595
That's nonsense.

757
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:35,075
Stop filming!

758
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:36,555
Stop filming! Stop it.

759
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,035
You're much stupider than your mom.

760
00:36:40,236 --> 00:36:42,836
At least your mom chose Minde,
who is good to her.

761
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:44,115
But what about you?

762
00:36:44,796 --> 00:36:46,915
You've set your sights
on someone who only uses you.

763
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:51,196
Lu Cenyang never intended
to use your proposal.

764
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:53,276
He doesn't trust you at all.

765
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:55,035
And for him,

766
00:36:55,955 --> 00:36:59,435
you've completely lost the chance
to save your parents.

767
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:04,716
You'll see.

768
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:08,915
(Dad, Mom.)

769
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:10,796
(I'm sorry.)

770
00:37:12,115 --> 00:37:13,636
(I could have used this opportunity)

771
00:37:13,836 --> 00:37:15,435
(to keep Grandma from picking on you,)

772
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:18,435
(but I couldn't do it.)

773
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:22,475
(I couldn't fail Lu Cenyang's
trust in me.)

774
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:27,395
(But perhaps he doesn't
trust me that much after all.)

775
00:37:40,156 --> 00:37:40,836
