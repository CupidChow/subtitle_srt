why my brother
could wear beautiful clothes

00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:08,453

00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:10,812

00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:49,452
I'm sorry

189
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:51,612
for not speaking up for you

190
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,773
when Chen Manni came.

191
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,492
Why would I be mad at you?

192
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:58,253
Chen Manni came prepared.

193
00:15:58,413 --> 00:15:59,452
Not to mention you guys,

194
00:15:59,732 --> 00:16:01,212
even I didn't realize.

195
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:04,773
You're generous.

196
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:06,173
You let it go because you know

197
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:07,413
we care about the company.

198
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:13,253
We're relieved that you're not angry.

199
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,253
We worried you wouldn't come anymore.

200
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:17,413
How could that be?

201
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:19,253
I get along with everyone so well.

202
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:20,773
How could I bear to leave Pinshang?

203
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,612
Everyone, go back to work.

204
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,173
Okay.

205
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:29,972
Let's go.

206
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:38,413
Look at her smug look!

207
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:39,692
Carry,

208
00:16:40,253 --> 00:16:41,933
Mr. Lu always speaks up for Bu Ran.

209
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,692
They must be in a relationship, right?

210
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:48,972
What's it to you? Go to your work.

211
00:16:50,572 --> 00:16:51,653
Carry.

212
00:17:31,413 --> 00:17:32,732
Since Bu Ran came back to work,

213
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:34,933
you two must have made up.

214
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:36,573
Thanks for handling

215
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:38,212
the security at the Fortune Pavilion.

216
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:39,653
The Yi Family has had

217
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:41,373
so smooth sailing these past two years

218
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,292
that their tricks are getting clumsier.

219
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:53,452
Have you got some happy news?

220
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:56,732
Yes,

221
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:58,452
but it can't be made public.

222
00:17:58,613 --> 00:17:59,373
A secret relationship?

223
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:03,893
Your apprentice
doesn't allow it to be public,

224
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:05,653
so I can only go along with her.

225
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,093
Yeah.

226
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,452
You chose your girlfriend,

227
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:13,212
so you bear the consequences yourself.

228
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,052
It's rare

229
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,252
that you've fallen for someone.

230
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,813
Ms. Yao, take another look at this.

231
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:41,052
- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Lu.

232
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:43,853
Show me the weekly report.

233
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:47,133
Go ahead.

234
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:47,772
Okay.

235
00:18:57,732 --> 00:18:58,413
Mr. Lu.

236
00:18:58,933 --> 00:18:59,573
Mr. Lu.

237
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,532
Mr. Lu.

238
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:01,452
Mr. Lu.

239
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:02,692
Carry on.

240
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:12,133
Yang,

241
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:15,173
your drawing is getting
better and better.

242
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:16,692
Thank you.

243
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:21,613
(Date time. See you in the break room.)
Bu Ran,

244
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:23,173
your drawing is not as good as Yang's.

245
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:31,972
Bu Ran, go and make me a cup of coffee.

246
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:33,573
Then maybe I'll help you revise it.

247
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:34,933
Alright, Mr. Lu.

248
00:19:37,532 --> 00:19:38,292
Work hard.

249
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:40,252
Mr. Lu.

250
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:57,692
This place needs some renovation.

251
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,133
This height isn't quite enough.

252
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:12,972
Bu Ran,

253
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:15,012
help me take a look at what this is.

254
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:18,093
Come on.

255
00:21:19,373 --> 00:21:20,093
Alright, Mr. Lu.

256
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,373
You first.

257
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:37,212
What happened?

258
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:38,333
The coffee maker is broken.

259
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:39,772
Drink something else instead.

260
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:41,532
Okay, Mr. Lu.

261
00:21:43,772 --> 00:21:46,292
How did such a person
get recruited into Pinshang?

262
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:53,373
Mr. Lu.

263
00:21:57,413 --> 00:21:58,373
I've never hated

264
00:21:58,413 --> 00:21:59,813
being called Mr. Lu as much as this!

265
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:01,813
My shoelace is undone.

266
00:22:22,613 --> 00:22:24,012
It was an exhaustingly long meeting.

267
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:25,573
Let's go have an afternoon tea together.

268
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:27,093
I've got work to do.

269
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:30,333
I'll go to the next place
and wait for you.

270
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:40,452
(Date time.)

271
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:42,133
(See you in the break room.)

272
00:22:49,613 --> 00:22:50,853
Go back to get ready for the meeting

273
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:51,732
this afternoon.

274
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:53,012
Mr. Lu, alright.

275
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:04,772
Bu Ran.

276
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:06,373
Nobody else's here.

277
00:23:16,252 --> 00:23:16,933
Bu Ran.

278
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:22,732
Has Mr. Lu not had his coffee yet?

279
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,613
The coffee maker is broken.

280
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,252
It's broken?

281
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:29,732
Bu Ran,

282
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:31,653
take this document back
and get it signed.

283
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:32,933
Okay, Mr. Lu.

284
00:23:50,252 --> 00:23:51,532
Who unplugged this?

285
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,292
Who was so bored?

286
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,452
You're so careless.

287
00:24:02,613 --> 00:24:06,052
You think you can take down Lu Cenyang
with just a security guard?

288
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:09,853
If I hadn't been out of options,

289
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:14,573
I wouldn't have let you sit
in the president's seat for so long.

290
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:18,012
Mom.

291
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:19,173
Well...

292
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:23,413
Mom, no.

293
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:24,492
My men did it badly.

294
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:25,613
I swear it won't happen again.

295
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:26,292
Mom, really.

296
00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:27,212
I make sure.

297
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:28,373
You...

298
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:30,093
This golf club

299
00:24:30,893 --> 00:24:33,252
helped your dad win quite a few games.

300
00:24:34,252 --> 00:24:36,853
I'm giving it to you. Go play golf

301
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:39,972
and expand your circle of friends.

302
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:42,492
Use it to make amends.

303
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:44,893
Thank you, Mom.

304
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:46,413
Mom.

305
00:24:47,012 --> 00:24:49,452
I definitely won't let you down again.

306
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:54,252
From now on, just focus
on what you're capable of.

307
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:57,492
Leave other affairs of the company

308
00:24:57,972 --> 00:24:58,972
to others.

309
00:24:59,133 --> 00:24:59,853
Okay.

310
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:03,732
Mom.

311
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:05,692
What does it mean?

312
00:25:06,252 --> 00:25:07,452
Do you really want

313
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:09,653
to drag down Yihua when Lu Cenyang comes

314
00:25:09,813 --> 00:25:11,813
to settle scores with you?

315
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:14,492
That's the price you should pay.

316
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:15,492
No, you can't possibly

317
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:17,252
expect me to struggle
with a golf club, can you?

318
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:20,893
The word "struggle"

319
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:23,052
has never had anything to do with you.

320
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,012
If you don't want a beating from me,

321
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:26,212
hurry back to your office

322
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,413
and take your things.

323
00:25:28,613 --> 00:25:29,252
Mom.

324
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:50,692
Come on, I'll take you to eat.

325
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:52,492
I just happen to be

326
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:53,933
out of inspiration.

327
00:25:54,373 --> 00:25:56,093
Do you know why?

328
00:25:56,692 --> 00:25:57,933
Because you haven't eaten.

329
00:25:58,133 --> 00:25:59,853
You need to eat well
to have inspiration.

330
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:02,173
Stay away.

331
00:26:02,573 --> 00:26:03,692
You really want me to leave?

332
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:05,853
I can't work with you here.

333
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,413
See me out.

334
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:22,573
Come on, how old are you?

335
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:24,292
I don't care.

336
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:26,933
I just want my girlfriend to see me out.

337
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:29,413
Will you?

338
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:31,492
Okay.

339
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:32,813
I'll see you out.

340
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:46,413
Take care.

341
00:26:57,212 --> 00:26:59,452
Do I need to take you downstairs too?

342
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:06,052
Someone will come.

343
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:07,133
Everyone's off work.

344
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:11,052
The surveillance!

345
00:27:12,492 --> 00:27:13,452
Only I can watch it.

346
00:27:24,532 --> 00:27:25,613
Mr. Lu.

347
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:34,413
Still working?

348
00:27:34,573 --> 00:27:35,333
Yes, Mr. Lu.

349
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:37,732
Work less overtime.

350
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:39,492
Okay, Mr. Lu.

351
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:49,732
Mr. Lu, goodbye.

352
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:56,093
You've arrived too.

353
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:01,093
The elevator is not safe.
I'll walk you up there.

354
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:02,972
You!

355
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,772
The elevator

356
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,173
is pretty fast today.

357
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:25,133
It needs to be adjusted.

358
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,813
I told you everyone had left work.

359
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:32,653
Come on.

360
00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:34,613
Go away. Stop it.

361
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:39,212
It's okay. No one's around anymore.

362
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:45,813
Mr. Lu.

363
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:50,133
Mr. Lu.

364
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:50,933
Mr. Lu.

365
00:28:58,373 --> 00:28:59,893
There are only five floors.

366
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,413
Take the stairs instead.

367
00:29:01,853 --> 00:29:02,972
It's good for the body.

368
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,692
- Alright, Mr. Lu.
- Alright, Mr. Lu.

369
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:06,052
Let's go away.

370
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:18,173
Please come in.

371
00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:20,772
You need me?

372
00:29:21,653 --> 00:29:23,613
Yes, I want to entrust Bu Ran
with the design competition

373
00:29:23,732 --> 00:29:24,933
for the ancient alley.

374
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:26,373
Mr. Lu,

375
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:28,373
aren't you favoring Bu Ran too much?

376
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:31,093
I believe you are quite clear
about Bu Ran's abilities.

377
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:33,613
I will inform the Design Department.

378
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:37,893
Mr. Lu,

379
00:29:38,452 --> 00:29:41,012
did you send Bu Ran
an Iris ensata-shaped necklace?

380
00:29:43,653 --> 00:29:44,532
Go back to work.

381
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,133
We need to prioritize
the ancient alley project.

382
00:29:48,492 --> 00:29:49,093
Okay.

383
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:55,333
Today's meeting is

384
00:29:55,653 --> 00:29:57,492
about the renovation
of the ancient alley.

385
00:29:58,532 --> 00:29:59,813
After other colleagues' field survey

386
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:01,653
of the ancient alley,

387
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,933
we have made adequate preparations

388
00:30:04,373 --> 00:30:06,212
and the following preliminary proposal.

389
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:07,772
Everyone can take a look.

390
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:17,373
These are the photos
of the ancient alley.

391
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:18,772
You can take a look.

392
00:30:19,732 --> 00:30:21,813
The ancient alley is serene
with abundant vegetation

393
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:24,093
which we need to protect
during the renovation process.

394
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:26,653
Next,

395
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:28,452
the chief designer Bu Ran

396
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,012
will give us a detailed presentation.

397
00:30:38,613 --> 00:30:40,292
As Ms. Yao just mentioned,

398
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,292
a preliminary survey was conducted

399
00:30:42,452 --> 00:30:44,413
and after that, we found some issues.

400
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:46,212
In this renovation,

401
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:48,133
we should prioritize safety,

402
00:30:48,452 --> 00:30:49,292
eco-friendly practices,

403
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:51,333
and public facilities.

404
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:53,492
And during the renovation process,

405
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,573
we should try our best

406
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:58,093
to preserve the original ancient alley.

407
00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:01,532
If demolition or structural changes
are needed,

408
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,653
they must be approved
by the relevant authorities

409
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:06,212
and detailed records

410
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:12,492
and photos should be taken.

411
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,012
Also, after the renovation is complete,

412
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:15,972
we should consider

413
00:31:15,972 --> 00:31:18,292
how to recycle and utilize
waste resources

414
00:31:18,692 --> 00:31:19,573
to reduce environmental...

415
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:24,413
reduce environmental pollution.

416
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:25,692
That's all.

417
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:35,052
Thanks for Bu Ran's sharing.

418
00:31:36,173 --> 00:31:37,893
I hope the Marketing Dept.

419
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:39,352
can strengthen cooperation

420
00:31:39,352 --> 00:31:40,292
(Bu Ran)
with the suppliers.

421
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:41,613
(No more taking pictures of me!)

422
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:43,373
As for the Design Department,

423
00:31:43,813 --> 00:31:46,692
I hope you can actively
cooperate with Bu Ran.

424
00:31:51,012 --> 00:31:51,813
Mr. Lu.

425
00:31:52,972 --> 00:31:55,772
Mr. Lu will give a wrap-up speech.

426
00:32:00,813 --> 00:32:01,452
Bu Ran,

427
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:03,532
your presentation
was not detailed enough.

428
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:04,933
Come to my office.

429
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:06,052
Let me explain it to you.

430
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:09,093
She did pretty well.

431
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:10,933
Bu Ran did a great job.

432
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:11,933
Quite detailed.

433
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:13,012
Why isn't Mr. Lu satisfied?

434
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:14,772
What's wrong with Mr. Lu?

435
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:15,333
Beats me.

436
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:26,212
Haven't you had enough?

437
00:32:26,692 --> 00:32:28,052
Bu Ran was called to the office.

438
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:29,173
This is bad.

439
00:32:29,252 --> 00:32:29,732
Yes.

440
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:33,292
Look.

441
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:33,933
Look.

442
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,292
Is anything gonna happen inside?

443
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:45,052
Bu Ran seems a bit impulsive.

444
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:47,853
Do you seek death?

445
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:49,173
No.

446
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:50,252
I only want you.

447
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:54,413
Fine.

448
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:55,813
Let's see.

449
00:32:57,052 --> 00:32:57,613
I...

450
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:48,732
Would Mr. Lu and Bu Ran

451
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:50,532
start fighting?

452
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:53,413
It seems so. Quite intense.

453
00:33:53,933 --> 00:33:55,452
Bu Ran has long been
displeased with Mr. Lu.

454
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:57,333
But I didn't expect her
to really fight him.

455
00:33:58,373 --> 00:33:59,292
Don't you have work to do?

456
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:00,893
You're even gossiping about the boss?

457
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:02,732
Ms. Yao, you better go and take a look.

458
00:34:02,893 --> 00:34:03,893
I'm afraid it'll be awful.

459
00:34:04,052 --> 00:34:04,613
Yes.

460
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:08,213
What is going on?

461
00:34:16,213 --> 00:34:16,972
What are you doing?

462
00:34:22,612 --> 00:34:24,373
Mr. Lu, calm down.

463
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,253
Weren't you very arrogant
when you threw that?

464
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:32,773
Now you know to pick it up.

465
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,253
You're making trouble?

466
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,092
Today, it was you who started it.

467
00:34:45,612 --> 00:34:47,253
If you continue to be like this,

468
00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:48,813
similar things will happen again.

469
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,452
Mind your attitude.

470
00:34:58,413 --> 00:34:59,333
I will.

471
00:35:06,693 --> 00:35:07,373
Ms. Yao,

472
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:10,293
tighten up your management of the staff.

473
00:35:11,293 --> 00:35:12,693
I will take care of this myself.

474
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:14,052
It's fine now. You can go out.

475
00:35:17,293 --> 00:35:19,893
