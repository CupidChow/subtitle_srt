00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:00,027
Who did this to me?

21
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:04,146
Mr. Lu.

22
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:07,987
Someone pierced my tire.

23
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:09,626
Could you give me a ride?

24
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:10,466
You can take

25
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:12,267
a taxi, the subway, or the bus.

26
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:14,067
But you want a ride from your boss

27
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,267
on your first day of work?

28
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:16,227
Come on.

29
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:18,146
You think I pierced my tire

30
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:19,706
just to hitch a ride with you?

31
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:21,186
That being said,

32
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:24,387
I have a better reason to suspect you.

33
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:26,026
Although we're neighbors,

34
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,507
we should keep our distance.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,910
(Matching vehicles for you)

36
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:39,107
Come on.

37
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:41,746
The endless trials. It's never over.

38
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:46,987
Mr. Lu.

39
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:48,706
Don't be late for work.

40
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:02,586
Qin Xun, someone pierced my tire.

41
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:10,667
I got a coffee for you.

42
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:12,387
Don't doze off on your first day.

43
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:13,227
Thanks.

44
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:14,626
I'm going to take a nap.

45
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:29,787
Isn't this Ms. Bu?

46
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:31,347
Good to see you again.

47
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:34,507
Here for work?

48
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:38,507
Kerry has joined
our marketing department.

49
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,107
You'll be colleagues.

50
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:44,586
Kerry is a highly capable employee.

51
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:50,267
She drugged you once,

52
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:51,787
and you dare to hire her?

53
00:03:52,227 --> 00:03:53,906
A wise person is magnanimous.

54
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:55,667
Get along well.

55
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,186
I think you have
some misunderstanding about yourself.

56
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:03,586
We've become acquaintances.

57
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:05,026
We'll definitely get along.

58
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:06,987
Isn't that right, Ms. Bu?

59
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:10,267
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

60
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:12,146
Morning.

61
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:19,266
Aren't you a lucky man?

62
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:20,787
Enough with your jokes.

63
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:23,467
Bu Ran is new to the company.

64
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:26,386
Please take good care of her, Mr. Lu.

65
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:28,386
Do you have any concerns?

66
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,907
As long as you stay away from her,

67
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,266
I'll feel relieved.

68
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:35,306
Good luck on your first day.

69
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:36,306
I'm off.

70
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:37,506
Drive safe.

71
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:41,547
Bu Ran.

72
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:44,587
Mr. Lu, please.

73
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,227
Come in.

74
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:57,746
Hello, Ms. Yao.

75
00:04:57,907 --> 00:04:58,667
I'm Bu Ran.

76
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:00,587
It's my first day here.

77
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,107
We met during the interview.

78
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:03,987
I'm Mr. Lu's executive assistant,

79
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,107
overseeing the Design
and Marketing departments.

80
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:07,907
I'll handle your HR issues.

81
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,547
Looking forward to working with you.

82
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:12,946
We're assigning you

83
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,946
to the Marketing department,

84
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:17,306
as the assistant
to the Marketing Director

85
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:19,107
with a three-month probation period.

86
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:21,227
Shouldn't I join the Design Dept.?

87
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,066
The higher-ups arranged for it.

88
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,186
Ms. Yao, how is her paperwork
coming along?

89
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:30,667
She only has to sign.

90
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:33,306
Work for me from now on.

91
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,667
I assure you I'll teach you hands-on.

92
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:38,907
I...

93
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:40,147
I...

94
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:48,107
(I can't believe I'm working
under Kerry. Lu Cenyang!)

95
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:53,952
(Employment Contract)

96
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:56,907
You think you can just

97
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:58,746
walk into the president's office?

98
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:00,186
I applied to be a designer.

99
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,186
But you made me a Marketing Assistant.

100
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,467
Are you messing with me?

101
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:05,066
I hired you because

102
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:07,147
I value your righteous act,

103
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:09,266
not because I recognize your ability.

104
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:11,866
Are you saying
I'm not qualified to be a designer?

105
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:13,667
If you have what it takes,

106
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:14,506
I'll be

107
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:16,306
begging you to be a designer one day.

108
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:17,147
But for now,

109
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:19,107
either do your job
as a Marketing Assistant,

110
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:20,467
or don't sign the contract.

111
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:21,347
Your choice.

112
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:23,667
That's not what you promised.

113
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:24,707
You said you would

114
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:25,306
make Taylor

115
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,866
apologize to me one day.

116
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:29,306
I'm useless in the Marketing department.

117
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:30,547
Even if I work till I retire,

118
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,587
I may not hear his apology.

119
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:35,266
Bu Ran,

120
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,027
I'm sorry for what I did.

121
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:40,306
I'm deeply sorry. I mean it.

122
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:41,987
I hope you can forgive me.

123
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:45,547
I did what I promised you.

124
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,826
That's something.

125
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:55,227
But you said you wanted me
to grow with Pinshang.

126
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:56,347
By putting a designer

127
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:57,467
in the Marketing Dept.?

128
00:06:57,987 --> 00:06:59,826
Without good marketing,

129
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:02,147
even the best design
is like a solo dance

130
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:03,626
that doesn't win applause.

131
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:05,347
I hired you, hoping that

132
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:07,787
you could grow with the company.

133
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:08,907
I didn't hire you

134
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,587
to question everything.

135
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:12,186
If you were the boss,

136
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:13,626
would you put a defier

137
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:14,946
in a core department?

138
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:18,707
I...

139
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,386
Surely I'm more reliable than Kerry.

140
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:24,266
Don't you remember
what she's done to you?

141
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:25,826
Kerry is an expert in marketing

142
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:26,787
with vast networking

143
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:28,826
and she's on good terms
with local suppliers.

144
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:30,147
She's willing to make amends

145
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:32,306
and help Pinshang gain a foothold

146
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:33,186
in the local market.

147
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:35,626
I should put aside
past grudges and employ her.

148
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:36,746
As for you...

149
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:39,186
Pinshang has many designers
better than you.

150
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:42,907
Sign the contract

151
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:45,266
or tear it up.

152
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:46,467
What do you say?

153
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:54,746
I'll take the job.

154
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:03,266
Now, bring me some goji berry tea.
Goji berries are good for the eyes.

155
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:06,386
I'll see if you're fit to stay.

156
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:25,186
Come in.

157
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:32,386
It's their first day at work,

158
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,786
and they're against each other.

159
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:35,786
I know.

160
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:38,307
You're worried because
I hired Bu Ran although I know

161
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:40,347
she's from the Yi family.

162
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:43,067
You're also worried because

163
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:44,866
Kerry is not easy to deal with.

164
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:47,386
You hired two women with designs on you.

165
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:48,506
Isn't it troublesome?

166
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,506
I have to keep an eye on them

167
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,626
for you.

168
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:53,866
You saw the design for the orphanage.

169
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:55,107
Bu Ran is talented.

170
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:56,947
If she manages to survive here,

171
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:59,107
I can give Yihua a hard time

172
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:00,146
with her help.

173
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,427
I hope she appreciates it

174
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:04,427
and tries to stay as long as possible.

175
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:05,947
You're underestimating her.

176
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:07,107
She is tough,

177
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,307
motivated,

178
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:10,187
and talented in designing.

179
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:13,146
She's just a bit impulsive

180
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:14,746
and tends to act rashly.

181
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:16,227
Shaping her personality

182
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:17,626
protects her from harm.

183
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:29,386
Have you signed?

184
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:32,626
I bet you wish I'd leave.

185
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:34,786
Once you sign, I can punish you.

186
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:36,587
What did I do wrong?

187
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:37,626
Don't abuse your power.

188
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,386
You went to see Mr. Lu

189
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,146
without my permission,

190
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:43,427
which violated the employee code.

191
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:45,146
Fine.

192
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:46,587
I'll accept the punishment.

193
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,227
Let me bring Mr. Lu

194
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:49,266
his tea first.

195
00:09:49,386 --> 00:09:50,587
I can bring it to him.

196
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:54,347
What if you drug him again?

197
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:56,427
You...

198
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,146
Here's your tea.

199
00:10:07,026 --> 00:10:08,947
That's how you serve tea to your boss?

200
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,107
A designer-to-be

201
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:17,906
doesn't take care of her hands, huh?

202
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:19,626
Have you seen any designer

203
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:20,427
as hasty as you?

204
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:22,107
I destroyed my hands

205
00:10:22,227 --> 00:10:24,227
while part-timing
when I was studying abroad.

206
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:25,866
But my designs still scored highly.

207
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:27,146
If you want to

208
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:29,067
test me in such a petty way,

209
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:30,266
bring it on.

210
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:31,866
I won't back down.

211
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:36,347
Goji berries don't

212
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:37,987
stand the heat. Don't you know?

213
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:39,866
I'm not at your age yet.

214
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:42,467
I'm not so peculiar
about goji berry tea.

215
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:45,587
Throw it away.

216
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:47,786
Make another one with 60-degree water.

217
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:58,347
You look like you want to kill me.

218
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:00,146
It's the first day.

219
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,746
I hope you're not upset.

220
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:04,386
Of course not.

221
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:33,746
I'll pay for the cup.

222
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:43,587
Mr. Lu, I'm really sorry.

223
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,866
I haven't trained Bu Ran properly yet.

224
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:48,587
Kerry.

225
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:50,227
I don't care how you

226
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:51,227
do it,

227
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:53,187
make her disciplined

228
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:54,587
as soon as possible.

229
00:11:55,227 --> 00:11:55,746
Okay.

230
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,546
I will help her adapt
as quickly as possible.

231
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:03,026
You called me

232
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:04,427
to banish me up here

233
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:05,947
to prune and soil the plants?

234
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,626
You didn't get
my good intentions at all.

235
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:09,866
Let me put it this way,

236
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:12,107
Mr. Lu likes the plant here.

237
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,026
He even keeps

238
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:14,947
the pretty ones in his office.

239
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:16,947
A kindly reminder.

240
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:19,467
Don't you want to be valued?

241
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:21,506
Here is the opportunity.

242
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:25,307
Step aside.

243
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:27,587
But if you can't even take care

244
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:29,026
of the plants here,

245
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:30,146
how can I expect you

246
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:32,227
to take care of our clients?

247
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:33,746
You might as well leave.

248
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:35,746
You think you can get rid of me?

249
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:39,746
Step aside.

250
00:12:40,307 --> 00:12:41,227
I'm going to work.

251
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:50,107
Mr. Li.

252
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,187
That's more like it.

253
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:56,386
Mr. Li.

254
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:58,146
Please train her well.

255
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:00,467
Let me know if she's slacking off.

256
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:01,146
Alright.

257
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:04,626
I really hope Mr. Lu can see

258
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,626
the true color of his close friend

259
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,666
and how she gets kicked out.

260
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:13,107
Just trim those plants.

261
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:23,427
Mr. Li.

262
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:24,866
My apologies.

263
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:26,067
I was a bit emotional

264
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,187
and spoke recklessly.

265
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:29,587
My mom loves gardening.

266
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:30,587
Me too.

267
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:31,866
Just tell me if there is

268
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:33,067
anything to do.

269
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:34,467
I feel sorry for you.

270
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,187
I'll handle the heavy labor.

271
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,587
Just act busy.

272
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:38,786
It's alright.

273
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:41,146
Landscaping is also
part of spatial design.

274
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:44,666
I do need someone to teach me gardening.

275
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:45,427
Okay.

276
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:46,827
Look.

277
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:48,266
The flower branch

278
00:13:48,587 --> 00:13:49,707
should be pruned from here.

279
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:50,587
Alright.

280
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:55,227
Chairman.

281
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,026
Bu Ran entered Pinshang today.

282
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:00,067
Today?

283
00:14:00,227 --> 00:14:00,827
Yeah.

284
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:04,866
How dare she lie to me?

285
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:08,227
She said she had joined them
when she came to ask

286
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:10,227
for her mother's medical fees.

287
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:13,866
And she didn't accept
the new task assigned to her.

288
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:19,227
It seems she's determined
to work for Lu Cenyang.

289
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:21,067
Should we do something about it?

290
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:25,067
I've put someone else in Pinshang.

291
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,187
Let's keep Bu Ran

292
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:29,827
for now.

293
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:31,707
I have my plan.

294
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,827
You're lucky to finish work so early.

295
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:39,786
Do me a favor.

296
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,707
Take out the trash on your way.

297
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,827
Why does a marketing assistant

298
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:46,746
keep coming to our design department?

299
00:14:47,146 --> 00:14:49,026
I hope you don't break something.

300
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:50,026
Meeting time.

301
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:52,707
Okay.

302
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,707
Pass around the materials.

303
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:55,427
Take this.

304
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,107
We're working on the design

305
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,266
of the Welfare Center.

306
00:14:58,386 --> 00:14:59,467
I hope everyone can give

307
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:00,467
their full effort.

308
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:01,546
We all know

309
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:03,427
its significance to society.

310
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:04,146
Okay?

311
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:06,266
This is the preliminary model.

312
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:12,026
(What a great vibe.)

313
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:15,307
(I wish I could join them.)

314
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:27,008

00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:31,663

♪Let me love you and be loved♪

326
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:55,227
Coming early to please the boss?

327
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,866
Relax.

328
00:16:58,347 --> 00:17:00,026
I'm just bringing him a cup.

329
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,467
Desperate to improve
his impression of you.

330
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,346
I feel so sorry for you.

331
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:12,427
You're toiling away for nothing.

332
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:14,266
No need.

333
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:48,786
I've reviewed

334
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:51,746
all the proposals again and again.

335
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:55,187
In the end,
I still prefer Ms. Bu's design.

336
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:57,867
Her design is thoughtful

337
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:01,506
and it takes into account
every child's wishes.

338
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,346
Ever since I saw her design,

339
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:06,987
nothing else has been able to please me.

340
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,826
She chose inexpensive
but unique materials

341
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:12,467
to realize the kids' vision.

342
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:14,066
Some need to be customized.

343
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:16,627
So it may take a long time to prepare.

344
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:17,546
Cenyang.

345
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:21,707
You once longed for a bedroom
that wouldn't leak water

346
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:23,427
and could keep you warm.

347
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:25,387
Nowadays,

348
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,826
the living conditions are very good.

349
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:30,947
We need to give the kids what they want,

350
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:33,306
instead of what we want for them.

351
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:37,306
I see.

352
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:38,867
I'll do as you say.

353
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:41,667
Alright.

354
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:47,907
A prince and a princess
are taking care of the orphanage.

355
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:49,707
I'm looking forward to it.

356
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:52,506
Prince and princess?

357
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:56,187
Haven't you heard the kids say?

358
00:18:57,026 --> 00:18:59,026
You are handsome.

359
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:02,266
Ms. Bu is beautiful.

360
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:05,746
You are just like a prince
and a princess together.

361
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,947
The little ones call you that.

362
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,867
I find it quite amusing.

363
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,867
You're not favoring Bu Ran's design
because you want to

364
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,907
set me up with her, right?

365
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:19,907
If so, I will get another designer.

366
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,707
Business is business.

367
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:43,227
Come in.

368
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:45,147
Boss.

369
00:19:45,147 --> 00:19:46,786
Here is your schedule today.

370
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:54,147
Nice gilded cup.

371
00:19:58,306 --> 00:19:59,227
It's from Bu Ran.

372
00:19:59,746 --> 00:20:00,987
I'll throw it away if it affects

373
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,227
your mood.

374
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:09,907
It's not easy to fix it.

375
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:12,306
I won't rush to make my position clear.

376
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,227
Have this one.

377
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:25,947
Kerry is either busy bullying Bu Ran

378
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:27,467
or trying to please you.

379
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:30,707
It does look quite misleading.

380
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:31,667
You're right.

381
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:34,387
I wanted her to temper
Bu Ran's temperament.

382
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:37,106
But she revealed her true color so fast.

383
00:20:37,427 --> 00:20:38,546
What should we do next?

384
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,187
Let things unfold.

385
00:20:40,987 --> 00:20:41,627
I see.

386
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:42,907
So I'll be outside.

387
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:54,667
Ms. Yao.

388
00:20:59,026 --> 00:20:59,947
Nice cup.

389
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,106
Thank you.

390
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:17,506
Mr. Lu.

391
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:20,346
Ms. Yao gave me the project
of wedding home

392
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,147
of Mr. Liu's son.

393
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:22,346
I've called Mr. Liu

394
00:21:22,346 --> 00:21:23,506
and made arrangements.

395
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:26,627
I think we can
start with small projects.

396
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,907
We may get a chance
for greater collaboration.

397
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:29,826
Kerry.

398
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:32,106
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

399
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:34,387
It's my duty. I'll take my leave now.

400
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:58,346
Any update on the orphanage?

401
00:21:59,907 --> 00:22:01,306
The director picked Bu Ran's proposal.

402
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,707
Her talent and responsibility

403
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,786
make her the best candidate.

404
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:07,667
But aren't you worried

405
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,907
that Yihua might use her
to stir up trouble?

406
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:12,427
Let's prioritize
the wishes of those kids.

407
00:22:12,627 --> 00:22:14,546
Bu Ran fits this project the best.

408
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:16,987
She wants to do something
for the orphanage.

409
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:18,947
It may be her true wish.

410
00:22:19,467 --> 00:22:20,867
But finalizing it with her

411
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:23,227
might expose our plans to Yihua.

412
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,667
I suggest we wait a few more days.

413
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:28,187
Good point. Let's hold off for a bit.

414
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:35,227
Get Mr. Lu here.

415
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:36,746
Show me his sincerity

416
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,467
if he wants to cooperate with me.

417
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:39,387
Sorry, Mr. Liu.

418
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:41,266
Don't give me that.

419
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:43,387
Mr. Liu.

420
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:45,506
What's wrong?

421
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:46,506
Who made you

422
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:47,907
so upset?

423
00:22:53,387 --> 00:22:55,106
What designer did you assign to me?

424
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:56,786
Are you trying to fool me?

425
00:22:56,947 --> 00:23:00,026
Or do you think my son
doesn't deserve anything better?

426
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:01,427
This is an insult.

427
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:02,467
Mr. Liu.

428
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:04,667
We are experts in design.

429
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,227
Please tell me what you want

430
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,306
in detail.

431
00:23:07,506 --> 00:23:08,947
We will make changes

432
00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:10,106
until you are pleased.

433
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:13,427
Look at your design.

434
00:23:14,387 --> 00:23:17,346
So simplistic. There is nothing.

435
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:18,387
So embarrassing.

436
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:20,586
Take a look at the Yihua's showrooms.

437
00:23:20,746 --> 00:23:21,506
Make comparisons.

438
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:24,467
Their place is splendid,
luxurious, and high-class.

439
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:25,907
Don't you know why you're trying

440
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:27,306
to approach me?

441
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:29,227
What the heck is this?

442
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:31,106
You really got us wrong.

443
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:32,907
This is

444
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:35,346
a wedding house for your son.

445
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:36,707
So our designers adopted

446
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:38,826
the current trends for young people.

447
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,066
We'll design another version

448
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:43,066
according to your preferences.

449
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:44,826
Please calm down, Mr. Liu.

450
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:46,227
No need for such trouble.

451
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:48,947
I came here to show Mr. Lu

452
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:51,026
that I don't feel respected.

453
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,786
This is not good
for our potential cooperation.

454
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:56,506
Mr. Liu, please calm down.

455
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:57,306
Mr. Liu.

456
00:23:59,106 --> 00:23:59,786
Bu Ran.

457
00:24:00,427 --> 00:24:01,106
Come here.

458
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,026
Come here.

459
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:04,907
Come over.

460
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:15,746
Well...

461
00:24:17,387 --> 00:24:19,187
Talk to Mr. Liu.

462
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:20,546
Mr. Liu.

463
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:22,306
She is Bu Ran, my staff.

464
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:23,947
She majors in design.

465
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:25,066
She can talk to you.

466
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:31,387
Mr. Liu.

467
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:33,227
Can you spare me the time for a coffee?

468
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:38,427
Of course, I can do that.

469
00:24:39,387 --> 00:24:42,266
I'd love to hear
any good ideas you might have.

470
00:24:42,746 --> 00:24:44,066
Alright, this way, please.

471
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,106
Come in.

472
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:11,987
Mr. Lu.

473
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:14,346
Mr. Liu is very upset about the design

474
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:15,867
for his son's wedding house.

475
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,266
He came over to make a fuss.

476
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:18,947
I finally calmed him down.

477
00:25:19,147 --> 00:25:20,506
He is in the reception area.

478
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:21,987
Will you talk to him?

479
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:23,707
I'll deal with him.

480
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,026
Get Bu Ran here.

481
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:26,026
I have a task for her.

482
00:25:27,707 --> 00:25:30,586
Bu Ran is dealing with
Mr. Liu right now.

483
00:25:33,387 --> 00:25:34,627
Your coffee, Mr. Liu.

484
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,026
You make better coffee

485
00:25:43,147 --> 00:25:44,467
than my secretary.

486
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:46,187
I'll write down

487
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:47,746
the tutorial for you.

488
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:48,867
Ms. Bu,

489
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,306
we've met before.

490
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,947
Do you remember me?

491
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:53,707
It was an industry gathering.

492
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:55,987
You were stunningly beautiful.

493
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,907
I can't forget
those white shoes you wore.

494
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,066
I remembered you instantly.

495
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,147
If you like them,

496
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:03,667
I'll send you the link.

497
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:06,746
It's really nice to talk to you.

498
00:26:09,427 --> 00:26:10,306
To be honest,

499
00:26:10,506 --> 00:26:12,506
I know very well about Yihua's style.

500
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,467
They use the priciest materials

501
00:26:14,627 --> 00:26:16,467
to make you feel extravagant

502
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:17,987
as if it shows your status.

503
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:20,306
But in fact, they're just
making money from you.

504
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:21,867
Think about it.

505
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,627
Yihua tries to equalize
extravagance to aesthetics.

506
00:26:24,987 --> 00:26:26,867
Their design resembles

507
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:29,746
that of a tacky nightclub.

508
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:33,667
Your dressing style
shows how exquisite you are.

509
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:35,667
Those flashy designs can't please you.

510
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:36,506
Yeah.

511
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:38,427
I want something better than Yihua.

512
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,907
That's why I came to you.

513
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:43,227
I checked my colleague's design.

514
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:46,026
It's just missing
the grandeur touch you desire.

515
00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:48,147
Absolutely!

516
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:50,947
I want it grandeur and cultured.

517
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:52,947
The old design

518
00:26:52,947 --> 00:26:54,586
was too petty.

519
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:13,467
Look.

520
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,746
I've simplified the structure

521
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:17,346
and canceled some walls.

522
00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:20,266
The whole place forms a cohesive whole

523
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:23,227
like an ink painting
with an intended blank.

524
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:25,187
It has layers and depth.

525
00:27:25,387 --> 00:27:25,987
We can add

526
00:27:26,026 --> 00:27:27,026
some elements

527
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:28,707
of the study and gardens to it,

528
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:31,467
making it grandiose
and showcasing your taste.

529
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:32,786
Of course.

530
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:35,187
These are just some suggestions.

531
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:36,147
We'll come up

532
00:27:36,147 --> 00:27:37,826
with better ideas if we talk more.

533
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:38,786
You're right.

534
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:40,786
We must talk more.

535
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:42,746
I'm very happy about

536
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,066
your ideas.

537
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:45,826
I'll talk to Mr. Lu

538
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:47,106
and make you the designer.

539
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:49,867
And your cooperation with Mr. Lu...

540
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:51,786
Judging from your talent,

541
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,627
I have all the confidence in Pinshang.

542
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:06,387
Bu Ran, haven't you learned the rules

543
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:07,266
as a newcomer?

544
00:28:07,427 --> 00:28:09,427
You think you're qualified
to serve Mr. Liu?

545
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:10,667
I...

546
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:11,826
Mr. Liu.

547
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:13,467
Bu Ran is new here.

548
00:28:13,786 --> 00:28:14,586
She's eager to

549
00:28:14,586 --> 00:28:15,387
gain approval.

550
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:16,907
Her remarks and design

551
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:18,306
are nothing representative.

552
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:19,947
Please forgive us if she has

553
00:28:20,147 --> 00:28:20,907
offended you.

554
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,707
I'll take over from now on.

555
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:24,667
Kerry, take her away.

556
00:28:25,227 --> 00:28:25,826
Okay.

557
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:27,907
Mr. Liu, take your time.

558
00:28:28,826 --> 00:28:29,707
Let's go.

559
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:36,026
Mr. Liu, please take a seat.

560
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:47,106
You must have overcome

561
00:28:47,746 --> 00:28:49,707
the resistance from Yihua to come here.

562
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:50,907
We're alone now.

563
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:52,066
Feel free to name

564
00:28:52,227 --> 00:28:53,266
your demands.

565
00:28:53,586 --> 00:28:54,907
You're so straightforward.

566
00:28:55,786 --> 00:28:58,387
I make money to be happy.

567
00:28:58,947 --> 00:28:59,667
Just offer me

568
00:28:59,746 --> 00:29:02,066
a higher share than Yihua does.

569
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:03,667
I'd love to help you

570
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:05,467
make money through collaboration.

571
00:29:06,387 --> 00:29:07,786
I can offer you

572
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:10,387
a higher share to get you

573
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:11,987
from Yihua.

574
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:15,586
You're a smart guy.

575
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:19,506
Also, I'd like to invite Ms. Bu

576
00:29:19,546 --> 00:29:22,346
for a drink
and talk about design after work.

577
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,467
Is that alright?

578
00:29:26,026 --> 00:29:26,786
Mr. Liu,

579
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:29,427
I'd love to work with you

580
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,867
for mutual benefit.

581
00:29:31,147 --> 00:29:33,066
But you shouldn't be here if you want to

582
00:29:33,427 --> 00:29:34,467
harass my employees.

583
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:36,987
She's just an employee.

584
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,467
Why are you so protective?

585
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:42,786
Is there anyone willing

586
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:45,346
to betray Yihua and work with Pinshang?

587
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,346
I meant well
by offering to work with you.

588
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:50,306
Are you going to fall out with me

589
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:51,947
for an employee?

590
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:55,346
I favor partners who act independently

591
00:29:55,746 --> 00:29:57,266
without strings attached,

592
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,306
rather than the pets of Yihua

593
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:00,586
who don't respect women.

594
00:30:01,506 --> 00:30:02,106
