20
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:47,732
Mr. Lu,

21
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:50,812
this tea has a very strong aftertaste.

22
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:53,252
This is an aged tea, drink it slowly.

23
00:01:53,452 --> 00:01:54,333
Avoid tea intoxication.

24
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:55,413
Don't worry.

25
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,532
I've had the delicious salad
and sandwich made by Qin Xun.

26
00:01:57,693 --> 00:01:58,493
Avoid getting tea drunk.

27
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:01,892
I thought Qin Xun
could only make coffee and mixed drinks.

28
00:02:02,732 --> 00:02:03,933
You're unfamiliar with him.

29
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:05,892
Qin Xun has many tricks up his sleeve.

30
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:08,092
He cooks to win a woman's stomach,

31
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:09,213
effortlessly.

32
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:14,812
Talking about food makes me hungry.

33
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,173
I'll make noodles.

34
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,092
Would you like a bowl?

35
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:18,333
No, thanks, Mr. Lu.

36
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:23,333
Actually,
I need to talk to you about something.

37
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,812
What is it? Go ahead.

38
00:02:29,053 --> 00:02:30,412
I want to say

39
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:32,733
I'm gonna drop my lease.

40
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:39,412
What? Why?

41
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:42,053
If everything's fine, why move out?

42
00:02:42,252 --> 00:02:43,372
Is the rent too high?

43
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:46,372
That's not the only thing.

44
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:49,412
I want to separate work from life.

45
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:51,453
Living too close to my boss

46
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:53,812
isn't convenient.

47
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:55,213
Are you accusing me

48
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:56,572
of squeezing you like this?

49
00:02:56,773 --> 00:02:58,773
I'm telling you this
after serious consideration.

50
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,372
I'm fine without the deposit refund.

51
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,453
Your poor deposit...

52
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:04,532
Your deposit doesn't matter to me.

53
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,053
Hello?

54
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:09,173
Mr. Lu, tomorrow is my birthday.

55
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,532
I want to invite you
to my birthday party.

56
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:13,733
It's my first birthday
since I came to Pinshang.

57
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,252
You must come, please.

58
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:17,733
Carry, I don't really do parties.

59
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:22,933
If you're willing to combine it

60
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:24,053
with the orphanage's renovation bash,

61
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,692
I'd like to join.

62
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:27,013
Alright!

63
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:28,613
That was actually my intention.

64
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:30,412
It's perfect to celebrate
with colleagues as well.

65
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:31,613
Great, that's settled then.

66
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:34,572
Bu Ran,

67
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:36,852
tomorrow is Carry's birthday.

68
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:39,053
We're combining it
with the orphanage's renovation bash.

69
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:40,293
I need to plan out

70
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,412
how to proceed correctly.

71
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:43,572
So, about you moving out,

72
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:44,852
let's discuss it in a few days.

73
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,812
You need to throw a birthday party
for Carry?

74
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:50,493
Are you
suffering from intermittent deafness?

75
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:51,572
I just said that,

76
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,412
it should be combined
with the orphanage's renovation bash.

77
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,572
The number you dialed
is not answered at the moment,

78
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:14,013
please try again later.

79
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,892
- Happy Birthday!
- Happy Birthday!

80
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:18,892
Thank you, everyone!

81
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:22,212
Tonight,
we won't return until we're drunk.

82
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:24,012
- No return until drunk!
- No return until drunk!

83
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:25,132
Come on!

84
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:30,413
- Happy Birthday!
- Happy Birthday!

85
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:31,332
Happy Birthday!

86
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:37,293
Ms. Yao, why aren't you drinking?

87
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:39,892
I'm Mr. Lu's driver, so no drinking.

88
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:40,812
Happy Birthday!

89
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:41,533
Thank you.

90
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,093
Bu Ran, is that all you're drinking?

91
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:46,892
I...

92
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:48,613
Bu Ran needs to draw diagrams later.

93
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:50,173
Excessive drinking impairs work.

94
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:51,452
Mr. Lu,

95
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,452
it's also the orphanage's bash

96
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:54,212
to mark the renovation's completion.

97
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:56,293
It wouldn't be right
for the chief designer not to drink.

98
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:57,413
Don't you think so?

99
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:58,093
- Yes.
- Yes.

100
00:04:58,293 --> 00:04:59,252
Bu Ran, take a sip.

101
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:00,653
Bu Ran, take a sip.

102
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:02,933
Carry, you are the backbone
of the Marketing Dept.

103
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:05,173
On behalf of the company,
I wish you a happy birthday.

104
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:06,212
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

105
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:08,973
It is you
who helped me find my right career.

106
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:11,332
But I'd like to drink like this.

107
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,533
Happy Birthday!

108
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,973
Bu Ran,
are you really not going to drink?

109
00:05:26,572 --> 00:05:27,252
Indeed,

110
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:29,212
I may have been
a bit strict with you normally,

111
00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:31,653
but it's for Mr. Lu and the company,
isn't it?

112
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:33,293
It's also to help you grow quickly.

113
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:34,173
Please understand.

114
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:35,613
Come on, let's have a drink.

115
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:36,853
Yeah, have a drink.

116
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:38,132
Just a sip, come on.

117
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,452
Carry,
Bu Ran can't hold her liquor well.

118
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:42,613
I'll drink with you.

119
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:43,613
Mr. Lu,

120
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:46,293
people in the Marketing Dept.
can't do without drinking gatherings.

121
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:47,973
To handle your liquor, practice.

122
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:51,093
And this amount of alcohol
won't trouble Bu Ran, right?

123
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:52,293
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

124
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:52,812
Sip.

125
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:53,413
Bu Ran,

126
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:55,613
today is my birthday,

127
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:57,973
and also your celebration banquet.

128
00:05:58,173 --> 00:05:59,772
You owe me this favor.

129
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:01,372
Right.

130
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:02,053
Drink some.

131
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:03,252
- Drink some.
- Come on, Bu Ran.

132
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:04,252
Drink a bit.

133
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:06,012
Bu Ran really can't drink.

134
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:07,493
Carry, happy birthday.

135
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:16,733
I am quite a bit older than you,

136
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:18,733
and you should call me Sister Carry.

137
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:21,212
You said it wrong.
Penalty shot, bottoms up.

138
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:23,533
Bottoms up, Bu Ran.

139
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:24,692
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

140
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:25,772
Down one.

141
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:27,093
Yeah.

142
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:27,812
Mr. Lu,

143
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:30,132
although Bu Ran
is a bit thorny normally,

144
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:32,053
I quite like her personality.

145
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:34,653
My attitude towards her
is all in the liquor.

146
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,332
- Carry is impressive.
- Impressive.

147
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,053
- Carry, impressive.
- Impressive.

148
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:48,892
Bottoms up.

149
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:51,212
Bu Ran, today in front of Mr. Lu,

150
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:52,933
let your drinking manners show

151
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:55,332
your unity with the Marketing Dept.

152
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,053
Carry has done hers. You do yours too.

153
00:06:58,212 --> 00:06:58,933
Bottoms up, Bu Ran.

154
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:00,372
Yeah, bottoms up.

155
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:02,212
- Drink some.
- Bottoms up.

156
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:03,053
- Come on.
- Right.

157
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:14,413
Awesome, Bu Ran.

158
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:17,093
Impressive.

159
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:27,132
Come on, Bu Ran.

160
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:29,093
Let's toast Mr. Lu together.

161
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:31,372
Thank him for giving us
the chance to join Pinshang.

162
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:34,892
Carry, I know you're happy today.

163
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:36,252
Don't drink too much.

164
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:37,372
Mr. Lu,

165
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:39,132
we know you care about us,

166
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,973
but drinking shows our sincerity,
doesn't it?

167
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:46,853
Bu Ran, anyone who doesn't drink
is letting Mr. Lu down.

168
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:50,692
Mr. Lu.

169
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:52,733
Since Sister Carry said that

170
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,093
the more I drink,
the more I show my sincerity.

171
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:56,933
I'll snatch some spotlight from her

172
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:58,452
and show it a bit more

173
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,212
to let the envious ones see that

174
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:02,053
I'm worth all this kindness from you.

175
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:18,212
Awesome, Bu Ran.

176
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,452
Impressive, Bu Ran.

177
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,452
Impressive, Bu Ran.

178
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:34,092
Her alcohol tolerance is good.

179
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:40,293
Bu Ran.

180
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:41,572
Bu Ran, are you okay, Bu Ran?

181
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:42,692
How is it going, Bu Ran?

182
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:45,653
Are you okay, Bu Ran?

183
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:48,452
Bu Ran, be careful.

184
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:49,612
Bu Ran.

185
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:53,653
Low alcohol tolerance,
yet you seek the spotlight.

186
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:54,812
You live on the east side?

187
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:55,933
Take her home.

188
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:58,452
I want to play a bit longer.

189
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:00,373
I live close to Bu Ran.

190
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:01,293
I'll take her.

191
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:03,133
Slow down.

192
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:03,812
Get the car.

193
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:04,492
Okay.

194
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:06,692
What?

195
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:07,972
Mr. Lu will take her home?

196
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:08,933
I don't know.

197
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:10,852
Carry, it's your birthday today.

198
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:12,972
Let's go back in and continue singing.

199
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:14,732
Let's go, leader.

200
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,413
Boss, let me do it.

201
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:27,092
No need.

202
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:30,373
It's getting late.

203
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:31,492
Go back and rest early.

204
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:33,413
I'll bring her up.

205
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:34,452
You alone?

206
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:36,173
Previously, I solely cared for her.

207
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:37,332
Nothing to worry about.

208
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:38,332
No.

209
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:39,812
You're good at looking after people.

210
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,173
I've seen it since I was little.

211
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:43,133
Since little?

212
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:45,773
Did you remember something?

213
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:48,092
Even if I can't remember, I know.

214
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:50,452
Hurry back, don't let her catch a cold.

215
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,293
Drive carefully.

216
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:07,692
Brother.

217
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,692
(Today is my coming-of-age ceremony.)

218
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,053
(I had a couple more drinks with dad.)

219
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,773
I can't hold my liquor well,

220
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,212
but you're the best
at taking care of people.

221
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:40,173
Dr. Ma,

222
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:41,293
how've you been?

223
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:43,933
Okay then.
I'll give you another injection.

224
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:49,732
You...

225
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:52,972
I... Emm...

226
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:56,773
I want some of this hand sanitizer.

227
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:24,413
Hello?

228
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:25,572
Hello?

229
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:28,492
After so many calls,
you finally picked up.

230
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:29,293
Have you gotten up?

231
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:31,653
Last night was my colleague's birthday,

232
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:32,812
and I had a bit to drink.

233
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:35,413
I slept really well.

234
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:37,653
Anything happened?

235
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:40,893
If something had happened to me,

236
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:42,732
could I be talking to you properly?

237
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:45,492
I'll get up and go to work.

238
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,053
Let's keep in touch.

239
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:09,293
Oh my!

240
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:14,133
I slept in Lu Cenyang's bedroom.

241
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:20,413
Does it make me seem not reserved

242
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:22,653
if I don't let out a couple of screams?

243
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:44,732
I thought
you were going to sleep till noon.

244
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:46,732
Come have some dim sum and tea.

245
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:48,492
Why did you make me stay in your room?

246
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:54,133
Bu Ran, you're home.

247
00:12:58,533 --> 00:12:59,212
You were drunk.

248
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,212
I feared you would sleep on the floor
like last time and catch a cold.

249
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:03,533
Sorry to make you sleep in my bed
for the night.

250
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,332
Was I talking gibberish?

251
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,492
Qin Xun, you come pick me up?

252
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:11,773
It's all your fault.

253
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:13,133
And that Carry.

254
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,972
Just seeing her gets me angry.

255
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,133
I was so mad
I drank two bottles in one go.

256
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:19,972
Aren't you worried
if you've been taken advantage of?

257
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,972
You worry about misspeaking?

258
00:13:30,053 --> 00:13:30,972
Now, tell me honestly.

259
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:32,452
Did you take advantage of me?

260
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:36,653
Last time you were drugged,
I didn't take advantage of you.

261
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:38,812
Why would I harass you this time?

262
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:40,732
Because you're about to move out

263
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:42,053
and I'll lose my chance forever?

264
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:43,852
There could be many motives.

265
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,013
Like...

266
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:50,293
Like I grow on you.

267
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:51,692
You've found me attractive,

268
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:53,053
and couldn't resist the temptation.

269
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:56,373
Or like you have a secret crush on me.

270
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:57,972
When I'm sober,
you just don't have the guts.

271
00:13:58,092 --> 00:13:59,492
You only dare to do it when I'm drunk.

272
00:14:00,612 --> 00:14:01,572
Do you?

273
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:03,373
Qin Xun.

274
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:05,773
What should I do?

275
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:09,612
Could it be that I've fallen for him?

276
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:10,852
Otherwise, why do I feel here

277
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:14,293
so blocked up?

278
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:16,653
You're talking about yourself.

279
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:20,373
I see no reason for your move.

280
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:22,173
Except that you have a crush on me,

281
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:23,933
but think it's impossible,

282
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:25,612
so you're deliberately avoiding me.

283
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:34,773
As expected of you, Mr. Lu.

284
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:36,293
You know how to turn the tables.

285
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:40,173
Blind self-love
will lead to a slap in the face.

286
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,053
Let me tell you.

287
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:43,332
Last night I dreamed about my male god.

288
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:45,053
Seven years since we parted,

289
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:47,413

00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:52,052
Qin Xun will just
cause you a small loss in rent.

370
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:53,933
Don't treat him as an enemy.

371
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:55,292
Don't move then.

372
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:57,452
I'm used to having you as my neighbor.

373
00:18:58,573 --> 00:18:59,972
I'm not ready to adapt again.

374
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,492
You could choose not to rent it out.

375
00:19:04,613 --> 00:19:05,692
I am not discussing it with you.

376
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,813
I'm having you know.

377
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:11,813
If your tire goes flat, I can drive you.

378
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:14,133
If you worry about rent,
you can owe it for now.

379
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:16,452
With me here,
I won't let you drink again.

380
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:17,853
And,

381
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:20,893
if you get a leg cramp,
you can always come to me.

382
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:24,052
You can come here for noodles at night.

Hello?

(Carry)
Mr. Lu, Bu Ran has gone too far.

399
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:16,732
It's been a while
since the workday began.

400
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:18,452
She's the only one
who skipped the meeting.

401
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:19,772
She didn't drink much yesterday,

402
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:21,093
so she can't have a hangover.

403
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:23,933
Should we ask someone to her place?

404
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:24,853
No need.

405
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:26,933
I had her come over early
to review some design drafts.

406
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:29,653
You're in charge of the Marketing Dept.

407
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,653
You lied to Carry for me.

408
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:44,613
I'm warning you.

409
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:46,413
You're already quite late.

410
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:48,576
You only have five minutes.
Hurry up and get to work.

411
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:50,813
Okay.

412
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:42,052
Something on my face?

413
00:21:46,492 --> 00:21:48,373
You don't gotta chauffeur me

414
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:49,373
just to have me cook.

415
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,212
I just made some porridge.

416
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:53,472
You are still hungover
from last night's drinking.

417
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:54,452
Riding isn't safe.

418
00:21:57,532 --> 00:21:59,893
I just show concern for subordinates.
It's no big deal.

419
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:03,653
So, you showed concern for me

420
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:05,252
as you took care of me last night?

421
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:09,613
Stop questioning.

422
00:22:09,613 --> 00:22:10,413
We're at the company.

423
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:11,772
Time to work.

424
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:17,972
My phone.

425
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:22,573
Alright, I'm on it.

426
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:44,052
Move your hand away.

427
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:53,373

00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:54,052

00:22:54,212 --> 00:22:54,893
Stay right there.

430
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:56,252
It's caught.

431
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:57,333
My hair.

432
00:22:57,373 --> 00:22:58,492
Hurry up.

433
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:02,653
Okay.

434
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:16,933
What are you looking at?

435
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:23,492
Not much to see.

436
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:45,573
Hurry up.

437
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,012
My son has returned from Tibet.

438
00:23:48,532 --> 00:23:49,653
My dear.

439
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:54,532
How did you get tanned?

440
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:55,853
I gave you lots of sunscreens,

441
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:57,173
and several facial masks.

442
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,532
How did you lose all that weight?

443
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:00,613
I was in touch with best BBQ spots
wherever you went.

444
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:01,452
What have you done?

445
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:03,252
Easy there. Don't get choked.

446
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:05,292
Come on. Drink some water.

447
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:06,613
He suffered a bit.

448
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:08,532
Don't feel sorry for him first.

449
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:10,653
Ask him if he's learned his lesson.

450
00:24:11,772 --> 00:24:12,373
Grandma.

451
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:14,413
If the source is credible,

452
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:15,573
I should finish the task.

453
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:25,212
Everyone said she is Lu Siqi.

454
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:26,772
Tibet is so sacred,

455
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:28,052
and vast.

456
00:24:28,492 --> 00:24:29,653
Why are there so many swindlers?

457
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,452
I didn't taste any of that grilled meat.

458
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:34,252
Every time I heard about Lu Siqi,

459
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:35,933
I was right after that person.

460
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:37,813
When the car stalled on the plateau,

461
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:40,173
I didn't think twice
about relying on any ride

462
00:24:40,573 --> 00:24:41,653
that could get me there.

463
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:43,252
Nothing could stop me.

464
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:46,212
But I didn't expect
I would run into Lu Siqi from Sichuan,

465
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:47,692
Lu Siqi from Shandong,

466
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,333
and even the Lu Siqi from the Northeast.

467
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:58,252
Take your time.

468
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:01,093
(Carry's information
shouldn't be wrong.)

469
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,173
Did you remember yet?

470
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:14,692
There are so many things
like a fast-forwarded film,

471
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,413
but I can't remember clearly.

472
00:25:16,813 --> 00:25:18,012
I can't tell who they are.

473
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:20,732
Dr. Ma,

474
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:22,813
do you know how I used to

475
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:25,853
feel about the boss?

476
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:27,413
Why do you ask that?

477
00:25:27,772 --> 00:25:29,933
When I found he was
looking out for a female coworker,

478
00:25:30,772 --> 00:25:33,573
I felt nervous.

479
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:36,972
Honestly,
I'm not even sure what's got me worried.

480
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:38,653
He told me before

481
00:25:39,093 --> 00:25:41,452
that you are
his favorite younger sister.

482
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:44,853
You need to ask Lu Siqi
for the answer you're looking for.

483
00:25:46,252 --> 00:25:47,373
I'll cooperate actively

484
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,933
to bring her back as soon as possible.

485
00:25:58,772 --> 00:25:59,292
Miss Yao,

486
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:01,133
you saw the doctor so early?

487
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:05,532
I have a stiff neck,
so I'm here for acupuncture treatment.

488
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:07,052
What are you doing here?

489
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:10,893
Yesterday, I drank with the client.

490
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,573
I came to get medicines
for my upset stomach.

491
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:14,893
Get some for Bu Ran as well.

492
00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:17,732
She was drunk at birthday party
of our colleague yesterday.

493
00:26:18,893 --> 00:26:20,292
Oh, my!

494
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:22,252
She typically avoids alcohol.

495
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:24,893
but lately she drinks a lot.

496
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,933
She didn't pick up my call yesterday.

497
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,052
Worried?

498
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:33,012
I'll have you take care of her.

499
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:33,772
Okay.

500
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,333
I'll get her medicines and deliver them.

501
00:26:35,972 --> 00:26:36,692
I'm leaving.

502
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:37,532
Okay, bye.

503
00:26:37,653 --> 00:26:38,212
Bye.

504
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:47,613
(So she's my half-sister
with the same father.)

505
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,373
(Lu Siqi.)

506
00:27:05,012 --> 00:27:05,532
Hello?

507
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:08,532
I bumped into Miss Yao
at the hospital today.

508
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:10,373
I heard you've been drinking again.

509
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:11,653
How's your stomach?

510
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:14,732
Fine, I'm already at work.

511
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:16,532
Why'd you go to the hospital?

512
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:18,452
Getting medicines for a coworker

513
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:20,064
and get stomach medicines
for you as well.

514
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:21,373
I'll bring it to you at noon.

515
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:24,173
If you're coming,
wait until I get off work.

516
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,292
I didn't ride my bike today.

517
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:26,373
Please give me a ride.

518
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:28,732
Okay, then I'll pick you up after work.

519
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:30,492
It's quite a trek from Old Pal's.

520
00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:32,052
Leaving later can avoid the rush.

521
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:33,772
Got it.

522
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:37,252
Calling Qin Xun?

523
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:40,613
He feared
I'll get a stomachache from alcohol,

524
00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:41,933
so he got me some medicine.

525
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:45,212
He's totally your good friend.

526
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:47,893
Being jealous won't do any good.

527
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:52,972
Boss,

528
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:56,292
what are you drinking?

529
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:00,613
Make me a cup of coffee.

530
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,813
What would you like?

531
00:28:04,692 --> 00:28:05,452
Forget it.

532
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:08,012
So you won't accuse me

533
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:09,653
of exploiting a sick employee.

534
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:11,452
I'll give you a half-day off.

535
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:12,492
Take a rest.

536
00:28:13,813 --> 00:28:14,532
It's paid leave.

537
00:28:15,853 --> 00:28:17,692
You're so kind to me.

538
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:19,093
If you were any nicer,

539
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,972
I'm afraid I would misunderstand you.

540
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:23,333
Do it as you wish.

541
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:29,373
Boss, I'm fine.

542
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:30,252
I need no leave.

543
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:31,292
I'm off to work.

544
00:28:40,492 --> 00:28:41,093
Mr. Lu.

545
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,692
Coffee or tea? I'll make it.

546
00:28:42,732 --> 00:28:43,732
I was actually seeking you.

547
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:44,893
Make me a cup of coffee.

548
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:46,173
Okay, right away.

549
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:47,653
Men are fickle.

550
00:28:47,653 --> 00:28:48,732
Didn't he drink coffee?

551
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,333
Why the sudden change of heart?

552
00:29:00,492 --> 00:29:01,093
Come in.

553
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:05,692
Mr. Lu,

554
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:07,933
thank you for throwing
me a birthday party yesterday.

555
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:09,333
I'm sorry for the trouble.

556
00:29:09,532 --> 00:29:11,333
We're colleagues,
so there's no need for formalities.

557
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:12,252
It was your birthday.

558
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,893
I forgot to prepare a present for you,

559
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:14,972
so I'll make amends.

560
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:19,732
My sister brought it back from Tibet.

561
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:21,012
It is said to be blessed.

562
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,292
It's meant to remind one
to keep good intentions.

563
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:24,972
Speak kind words and do good deeds.

564
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:26,452
I just give it to you.

565
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:27,813
Hope you like it.

566
00:29:29,173 --> 00:29:29,972
I like it very much.

567
00:29:29,972 --> 00:29:30,933
Thank you.

568
00:29:33,093 --> 00:29:34,012
The company has decided

569
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:35,893
to collaborate with the popular
short video program

570
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:36,772
Extraordinary Place

571
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:38,784
(Extraordinary Places)
on a space-makeover variety show.

572
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:40,373
For the company's branding,

573
00:29:40,532 --> 00:29:41,813
it's a great opportunity.

574
00:29:41,972 --> 00:29:43,413
So, because of content planning

575
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,692
that lead to similarities
with other shows of the same type,

576
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:47,373
the project has been
assigned to your team

577
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:50,093
for infusing novel thoughts,
and focusing on showcasing

578
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:52,212
local cultural and aesthetic expression.

579
00:29:52,613 --> 00:29:53,333
It's urgent.

580
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:55,532
I'll get it done today.

581
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:08,772
Come in.

582
00:30:09,692 --> 00:30:10,333
Boss,

583
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:12,012
Mr. Ma from HG Real Estate in Singapore

584
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:13,012
is already at the hotel.

585
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:13,972
Let's set off.

586
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:14,692
Let's go.

587
00:30:29,212 --> 00:30:29,893
I'm all ears.

588
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,853
What information did you gather?

589
00:30:32,212 --> 00:30:33,972
Zihe has stayed in Tibet for a month,

590
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:35,893
and met countless persons
called Lu Siqi,

591
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:37,573
but all of them are not real.

592
00:30:38,732 --> 00:30:40,413
Have you been tricked?

593
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:42,853
That shouldn't be possible.

594
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,972
Lu Siqi returned from Tibet
with a valuable bracelet.

595
00:30:46,173 --> 00:30:47,893
Mr. Lu even gave me one just now.

596
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:49,093
He also assigned me

597
00:30:49,252 --> 00:30:50,173
to an important project.

598
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:52,252
I was about to tell you.

599
00:30:52,772 --> 00:30:54,373
Pay more attention.

600
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:57,373
You know what happens
to those I get rid of.

601
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,133
(Bu Ran is the only thing)

602
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:23,853
(standing between me and Lu Cenyang.)

603
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:26,653
(I wouldn't be
in this tricky position now.)

604
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:33,292
Bu Ran, come to my office.

605
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:43,452
The company will
partner with a short video firm

606
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:45,413
on a space renovation show.

607
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:46,492
Mr. Lu wants some

608
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:48,133
expressions of Chinese elements.

609
00:31:48,452 --> 00:31:50,452
He trusts you the most,
so you take charge of it.

610
00:31:50,853 --> 00:31:52,252
I don't have experience of making

611
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:54,532
the show plan.

612
00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:56,373
In that case, get learning.

613
00:31:56,853 --> 00:31:59,133
You were late for work in the morning,
so you need to work overtime.

614
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:00,133
Mr. Lu said it's urgent.

615
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:11,333
(Mr. Lu will surely approve of)

616
00:32:11,492 --> 00:32:13,012
(the plan prepared by Bu Ran.)

617
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,413
(Then I'll reveal the plan to Ms. Hua.)

618
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,692
(Once Yihua steps in
and embarrasses Pinshang,)

619
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:21,292
(Bu Ran will be the one to blame.)

620
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:23,452
(And I can finally vent my anger.)

621
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:29,133
Mr. Ma is considerate.

622
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,333
Upon seeing

623
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,052
the video of the renovated orphanage,

624
00:32:32,212 --> 00:32:33,893
he promptly
discussed partnering with you.

625
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,613
He also wants
to invest in a joint venture

626
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:38,560
for exploring the Southeast Asian market

627
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:42,012
Due to the spread of short videos,
we can know Mr. Ma.

628
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:44,613
Fine wine may need marketing.

629
00:32:44,853 --> 00:32:46,972
Good thing you've already
had your eye on this area.

630
00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:50,373
It's a great chance
to divert Carry's focus a bit,

631
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:52,373
so she doesn't get too wrapped up

632
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:53,692
in Siqi.

633
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:55,772
Of course.

634
00:32:56,732 --> 00:32:58,173
You don't need to see me off today.

635
00:32:58,413 --> 00:32:59,532
I'll go to Dr. Ma on my own.

636
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:00,492
Okay.

637
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:13,613
Carry,

638
00:33:15,012 --> 00:33:17,373
has the plan of cooperation
with Extraordinary Places been revised?

639
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:18,853
Mr. Lu,

640
00:33:19,093 --> 00:33:21,893
Bu Ran is taking the initiative
to work overtime on it.

641
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:24,052
It'll be done before dawn.

642
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:26,333
Okay, I got it.

643
00:33:51,252 --> 00:33:53,093
Putting this on your stomach
will make you feel better.

644
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:55,252
How did you get in?

645
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:56,772
I acted like a delivery guy.

646
00:33:57,532 --> 00:33:59,532
I've waited downstairs for you
for a long time.

647
00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:00,853
I'd better keep you company.

648
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,333
Take your medicine.

649
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:06,093
You dare to drink a lot.

650
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,933
You will have an upset stomach.

651
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:15,652
How do you do it?

652
00:34:15,773 --> 00:34:17,333
Just tell me what to do,
and I'll handle it.

653
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:19,333
No, that's not appropriate.

654
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:21,253
Are you sure
you can keep going like this?

655
00:34:21,413 --> 00:34:23,213
Can you continue staying up late?

656
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:26,132
You need to learn to rely on me,
your all-round friend.

657
00:34:31,413 --> 00:34:32,773
I've thought of a planning idea.

658
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:34,773
Revamping ancient alley houses

659
00:34:35,052 --> 00:34:37,492
helps those working in the city
feel the sense of belonging again,

660
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:39,853
and makes city dwellers
used to all the steel and concrete

661
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:41,853
long for the pastoral life
of the countryside.

662
00:34:42,532 --> 00:34:43,373
(Reference images)

663
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,612
I've found some reference images.

664
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:45,693
Help me layout them.

665
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:00,172
Done.

666
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,213
Everything goes more smoothly
with me around.

667
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:06,052
We shouldn't
take our rapport for granted.

668
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,572
Just a neater diagram

669
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,253
shows our rapport?

670
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:12,092
Our rapport is real.

671
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:14,452
About you moving,

672
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:15,693
how have you considered it?

673
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:17,853
You always works overtime,
so I'm really worried about you.

674
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:18,853
If you move closer,

675
00:35:19,012 --> 00:35:20,132
I could take care of you.

676
00:35:20,972 --> 00:35:24,452
Don't fight alone at any time.

677
00:35:24,612 --> 00:35:26,373
I'll always be the man behind you.

678
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:27,972
Got it.

679
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:29,373
Get to work quickly.

680
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:30,612
How did you get in?

681
00:35:30,652 --> 00:35:32,293
Do you think this is a veggie market?

682
00:35:33,012 --> 00:35:33,773
Hello,

683
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,132
you walk silently?

684
00:35:36,132 --> 00:35:37,452
You scared me!

685
00:35:38,132 --> 00:35:39,172
It's my own company.

686
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,893
You don't need to teach me how to walk.

687
00:35:41,293 --> 00:35:42,652
You've entered the Pinshang office.

688
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:43,733
This is a serious matter.

689
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:47,813
Mr. Lu, I lost my mind.

690
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:48,773
I brought him in.

691
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:49,853
Punish me then.

692
00:35:50,052 --> 00:35:51,452
Is the company's surveillance
for display?

693
00:35:52,172 --> 00:35:53,333
It has nothing to do with her.

694
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:55,012
I broke in myself.

695
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,253
There's no one in Pinshang?

696
00:35:57,452 --> 00:35:59,253
Compel an ailing person to work late.

697
00:35:59,413 --> 00:36:00,052
Right.

698
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:02,333
She has an upset stomach

699
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:03,853
because she was forced to drink.

700
00:36:04,012 --> 00:36:05,853
Is Pinshang really that heartless?

701
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:11,172
I gave you a holiday.
Why didn't you leave?

702
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:14,213
Staying here and doing others' jobs.
You're being a pushover.

703
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,532
Do you not know how to say no?

704
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:16,293
I...

705
00:36:16,452 --> 00:36:17,773
Where is that swagger

706
00:36:17,773 --> 00:36:19,213
when you yelled at me this morning?

707
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:21,092
I...

708
00:36:21,253 --> 00:36:22,132
Leave the rest of the work

709
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:22,773
for me to wrap up.

710
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:23,612
Wait a minute.

711
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:25,413
