20
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:56,797
Yes, it's her.

21
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:57,556
Here she is.

22
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:58,836
How is it going?

23
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,877
It's a total mess now.

24
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:01,717
It's all your fault.

25
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:03,237
- Yes.
- You're responsible for this.

26
00:02:03,237 --> 00:02:04,676
You must give us an explanation.

27
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:06,437
Solve it today. Don't try to fool us.

28
00:02:06,597 --> 00:02:07,437
Everyone, calm down.

29
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:08,836
We will come up with a solution

30
00:02:08,957 --> 00:02:09,757
to resolve this matter.

31
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:10,637
- Stop it.
- I will...

32
00:02:10,716 --> 00:02:11,317
What can you do?

33
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:12,517
Let's not listen to her.

34
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:13,996
We shouldn't have trusted her.

35
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:16,037
Otherwise, we wouldn't have been
in such a big trouble.

36
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:16,917
Exactly.

37
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:19,197
Back then, you promised us.

38
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:20,637
What about now? What else can you say?

39
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:22,197
This matter is very simple.

40
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:23,317
If you can't solve this,

41
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:25,276
none of you will leave here.

42
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,276
No one can leave.

43
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,477
Don't push me.

44
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:28,676
Solve it right now.

45
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:29,676
What are you doing?

46
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,757
Stop it.

47
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:31,556
What do you want?

48
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:32,357
Fix it now.

49
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:37,396
Guys.

50
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,556
Pinshang is already

51
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:40,517
investigating this incident.

52
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:42,996
Due to our oversight in management,

53
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:44,957
it has caused trouble for you all.

54
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:47,556
I apologize to all of you here.

55
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,637
I promise you all.

56
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:53,876
No matter what it takes,

57
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:55,156
I will not let any of you

58
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,477
suffer any loss.

59
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:00,797
I hope that you can give us more time

60
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:01,996
before we find the truth.

61
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:02,676
Enough.

62
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:04,156
Drop the act,

63
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:05,197
and stop fooling us.

64
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:06,637
I don't buy it.

65
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:09,237
Give us a solution right now.

66
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:11,517
Right away.

67
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:12,436
Do you hear us?

68
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:13,116
Solve it.

69
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:13,917
Fix it.

70
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:15,596
I've just come back
from the district government.

71
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:16,637
I believe

72
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:18,037
a review team will be dispatched

73
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,357
to audit the project.

74
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,317
Please be patient.

75
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:23,317
It will be resolved in the end.

76
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:24,836
- How?
- We can't wait.

77
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,676
Tell us now.

78
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:27,237
You can leave to fix it,

79
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:28,037
but she must stay.

80
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,197
Yeah, she stays here.

81
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:29,996
Listen to me.

82
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:31,596
If you take down this cordon,

83
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:32,757
I can give you more days.

84
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,676
It's okay if you can't listen to me.

85
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:36,237
Bu Ran, let's go.

86
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:37,716
You can't leave.

87
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:38,237
Stop.

88
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:38,957
You can't leave.

89
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:40,237
- Let go!
- You haven't solved it.

90
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:41,517
- Come back.
- Stop it.

91
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:42,637
Stop pushing.

92
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:43,876
You are not allowed to leave.

93
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,396
- Let go! Don't push me.
- You hit me.

94
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:46,556
You hit me.

95
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:47,276
Let go.

96
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:48,317
Can't leave.

97
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:49,197
Let go!

98
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:50,276
You hit me.

99
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,317
Can't let them leave.

100
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:56,357
Cenyang.

101
00:03:56,357 --> 00:03:57,276
You are going too far.

102
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:58,237
Cenyang, are you alright?

103
00:03:58,957 --> 00:03:59,596
I'm okay.

104
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:03,676
Are you satisfied now?

105
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,237
If anything happens to Mr. Lu,

106
00:04:05,357 --> 00:04:06,876
things will become trickier.

107
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,237
We only need a few more days to fix it.

108
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:11,197
Can't you trust us?

109
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:12,276
Bring it on.

110
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:13,197
Do whatever you want.

111
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:14,556
We'll see if the issue can be fixed.

112
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,356
Let's go.

113
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:22,517
You've gone too far.

114
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:23,957
What should we do?

115
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:25,156
What should we do?

116
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:29,957
Mom.

117
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:32,356
You've promoted Qin Xun
to be the executive president?

118
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:34,596
He used to be a barista.

119
00:04:34,997 --> 00:04:35,997
Does he have business acumen?

120
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:38,276
Anyway, he knows
how to deal with Lu Cenyang.

121
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,077
He only can play petty tricks.

122
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:42,677
You know better than me

123
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:45,317
about Qin Xun's real identity.

124
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:48,716
Lu Mingyu adopted Lu Cenyang

125
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:51,276
and even entrusted the company to him.

126
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:54,396
But Lu Mingyu abandoned Qin Xun,

127
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:56,677
his biological son.

128
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:57,877
In this world,

129
00:04:58,077 --> 00:04:59,916
the two of them are

130
00:05:00,276 --> 00:05:01,156
against each other.

131
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:02,557
Mom.

132
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:05,036
Even if that Qin Xun is a bit clever,

133
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:06,117
don't forget

134
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:08,356
he is Lu Mingyu's biological son.

135
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:10,716
How could he work in Yihua?

136
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,596
I am not senile.

137
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:18,156
Once we defeat Lu Cenyang,

138
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,317
give him a reward.

139
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:22,957
I'll hand over Pinshang to Qin Xun.

140
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,757
This way, we can avoid being hampered
by him

141
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,877
and bind ourselves closely to him

142
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:31,197
to prevent a comeback from Lu Cenyang.

143
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:34,197
Even if Lu Cenyang can stop Yihua

144
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:37,276
from being listed,

145
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:39,596
we can still use Qin Xun

146
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,596
to hold him back.

147
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:47,757
As long as Lu Cenyang remains grateful
to Lu Mingyu,

148
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:52,916
Qin Xun can restrict him.

149
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:55,036
Therefore, before that,

150
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:57,036
any reward we give him

151
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:58,957
is well worth it.

152
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:00,757
Moreover,

153
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:03,596
both of them care about Bu Ran.

154
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:04,716
Mom.

155
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:06,757
Your strategy is truly brilliant.

156
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:09,197
But, isn't it too much for Qin Xun?

157
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:11,077
His position

158
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:13,957
was originally intended for Zihe.

159
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:20,877
He's a disobedient,

160
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:22,677
incompetent grandson.

161
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,117
He brought this on himself.

162
00:06:25,796 --> 00:06:27,236
No matter how reluctant you are,

163
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:28,476
bear with it.

164
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:30,036
Do not interfere.

165
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:32,077
And do not pick a fight with Bu Ran

166
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:33,396
in case of affecting Qin Xun.

167
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:43,716
If Zihe inherits nothing

168
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:44,877
in the end,

169
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:46,197
I will definitely divorce you.

170
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,236
It's exactly what I want.

171
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:00,557
Excuse me.

172
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:01,916
The female designer of Pinshang,

173
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:02,997
has she been here already?

174
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,317
She didn't help.

175
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:05,677
The problem hasn't been solved.

176
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:07,796
They left after being beaten.

177
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,476
I didn't expect that.

178
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:14,437
Though you guys were anxious,

179
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:16,276
you can't resort to violence.

180
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,836
Cenyang grew up here.

181
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,036
How could you hurt him?

182
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:22,796
But he deceived us.

183
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,476
I didn't hit him hard.

184
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:26,197
Next time, I won't be so gentle.

185
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:26,916
You...

186
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:29,276
Ms. Wang, Mr. Lu is injured?

187
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:30,997
He got injured

188
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:32,877
while protecting Ran.

189
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:34,117
Where are they now?

190
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:35,637
They went that way.

191
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:36,836
I...

192
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,036
I didn't do it on purpose.

193
00:07:38,117 --> 00:07:39,197
Hurry back.

194
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:40,156
Let's go.

195
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:49,117
You...

196
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:50,156
I'm so angry.

197
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:52,036
Why are they so unreasonable?

198
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:53,356
They even hit people.

199
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:55,437
Your wound is so deep.

200
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,236
What if it leaves a scar?

201
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:00,036
I'm actually quite grateful to them.

202
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:01,916
You're grateful to them?

203
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:03,236
Are you being silly?

204
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:04,757
Yes, you're a fool.

205
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:05,877
You have the hardest head?

206
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:07,197
You saw that hoe coming down.

207
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:08,796
Why didn't you avoid it?

208
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:09,957
It was worth it, though.

I thought
you would never talk to me again.

It's a blessing in disguise.

212
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,117
Otherwise, you'd still be away from me

213
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:22,036
instead of tending to my wound here?

214
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:24,517
I wish they had hit me harder,

215
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:26,276
so I could be hospitalized

216
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:27,757

287
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:41,836

Residents are upset
about the mismanagement

303
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,836
which led to the project's suspension.

304
00:13:32,636 --> 00:13:36,397
Will you
hold the person responsible accountable

305
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:37,996

This is what you're here for.

307
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:41,596
You're here not to solve the problem,

308
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:43,356
but to exacerbate it.

309
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:45,876
Bu Ran is in charge of this project.

310
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:48,437
And she proposed the plan.

311
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:54,277
You really always

312
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:56,876
shift the blame onto Bu Ran, huh?

313
00:13:59,077 --> 00:13:59,716
Mr. Lu.

314
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:02,836
Is this your corporate culture?

315
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:03,797
Rest assured,

316
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:06,157
Pinshang takes the responsibility.

317
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,516
And you don't need
to know who is in charge.

318
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:11,756
I've heard that the designer Chen Manni

319
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:13,756
was poached by Ms. Yao.

320
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:18,437
You're showing favoritism, Mr. Lu.

321
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:22,037
You just reminded me
not to make things private.

322
00:14:22,636 --> 00:14:23,277
Mr. Lu.

323
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:25,677
It's a double standard.

324
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:28,037
You...

325
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:32,037
You have provided me with a solution.

326
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:34,756
Give me one day.

327
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:36,677
I will give you a satisfactory reply.

328
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:38,317
No problem.

329
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:40,476
However, my patience is limited.

330
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:42,636
Be efficient.

331
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:02,716
I actually have

332
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:04,077
such a terrible half-brother.

333
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:07,197
He joined Yihua for Bu Ran

334
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:08,756
and specifically targeted us.

335
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:12,557
I owed Bu Ran.

336
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:14,557
Pinshang provided Bu Ran

337
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:15,957
with a platform to deploy her talent.

338
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:17,437
He should be grateful.

339
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:18,437
You know it.

340
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:20,077
This isn't just about work.

341
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:21,836
I broke up with her.

342
00:15:22,397 --> 00:15:23,636
I owed her.

343
00:15:27,277 --> 00:15:28,557
Let's focus our minds

344
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,756
on how to deal with Qin Xun.

345
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:31,836
Yihua leads the re-evaluation.

346
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:33,397
So our people

347
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,557
cannot convince the crowd.

348
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:35,557
Siqi.

349
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:36,836
You find authoritative experts

350
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:38,476
as soon as possible

351
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:39,557
and let them work

352
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:41,756
with us to review the project design
and materials

353
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:44,756
to ensure even the most critical people
can't find any faults.

354
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:46,716
But Qin Xun proposed

355
00:15:47,557 --> 00:15:48,677
that someone from Pinshang

356
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:51,236
must take responsibility
for this managerial negligence.

357
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:53,197
This is his real purpose.

358
00:15:53,957 --> 00:15:55,917
Qin Xun came prepared this time.

359
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:59,157
Bu Ran has been
in charge of this project.

360
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:01,957
And the materials went wrong.

361
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:03,516
So, Bu Ran...

362
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:04,236
No way.

363
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,876
I won't let her take the fall.

364
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:08,397
Cenyang.

365
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:09,636
Can you

366
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:11,797
watch us lose everything

367
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:12,836
we worked so hard to get

368
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:14,437
and return to square one?

369
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:19,277
I can't lose anything again.

370
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:21,317
I don't want to endure it again.

371
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:23,317
For me

372
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:24,876
and our company,

373
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:28,116
make the right decision,

374
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:29,116
okay?

375
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:30,476
Enough.

376
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:32,277
I don't want to talk about this.

377
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:11,316
How is your wound?

378
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:16,437
I'm not concerned about you.

379
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:17,877
I'm just...

380
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:19,756
If you are not,

381
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,117
my wound might not heal.

382
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:23,677
Whatever.

383
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,276
Have they made things difficult for you?

384
00:17:27,476 --> 00:17:29,996
All I can say is that they mean no good.

385
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:32,357
What are you doing?

386
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:33,917
I...

387
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:42,677
You will get hurt again.

388
00:17:43,117 --> 00:17:44,036
What are you doing?

389
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:49,796
What's with you today?

390
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:51,357
You're in a suit.

391
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,157
I've found a job.

392
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:56,197
You've switched jobs?

393
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:58,716
I've worked for Yihua.

394
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:00,597
Yihua?

395
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:02,476
Why?

396
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:03,476
Lu Siqi stopped at nothing

397
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:04,716
to defeat you.

398
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:06,476
She has already hurt you.

399
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:08,516
But Lu Cenyang turned a blind eye

400
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:09,597
to that.

401
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:12,796
I had to give them a lesson.

402
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:14,397
Just because of this,

403
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:15,357
you worked with Yihua

404
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:16,917
to halt the Ancient Alley project?

405
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,437
Not really.

406
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:19,716
Before I came,

407
00:18:20,197 --> 00:18:21,957
as the person responsible
for the project review,

408
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,516
I met with Lu Cenyang

409
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:26,437
and discussed solutions with him.

410
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:29,637
I think you try to make matters worse.

411
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:30,637
Do you realize

412
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:31,877
that you will cause Lu Cenyang,

413
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:34,316
no, I mean, Pinshang a lot of trouble?

414
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:36,556
I don't care.

415
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:38,197
All I know is

416
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:39,597
that you are my bottom line.

417
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,516
Let me make it clear.

418
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:44,197
I broke up with Lu Cenyang,

419
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:45,437
but it's none of your business.

420
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:47,877
I don't need others to stand up for me.

421
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:49,516
If you really care about me as a friend,

422
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:50,677
please stop immediately.

423
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,957
Pinshang and I are already
in the same boat.

424
00:18:55,437 --> 00:18:56,957
Before Pinshang collapses,

425
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:58,677
the boat will only speed up.

426
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:00,276
Qin Xun, have you gone mad?

427
00:19:00,677 --> 00:19:01,316
Bu Ran.

428
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:03,036
Stop worrying about Pinshang.

429
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,516
Lu Cenyang deserves it.

430
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:09,117
What on earth is wrong with you?

431
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:11,316
Oh, right.

432
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:13,716
You probably don't know

433
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:15,276
that my last name is Lu.

434
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:18,236
Lu Mingyu abandoned me.

435
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:21,837
So, Lu Cenyang

436
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,677
took everything from me.

437
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:25,197
Can't I just

438
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:27,076
teach him a lesson?

439
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:30,276
Didn't you tell me you grew up abroad?

440
00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:35,637
You said your father was an architect.

441
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:36,716
He...

442
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:37,597
Yes.

443
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,516
My dad was devoted to his work back then

444
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:44,357
and let my mom take me away.

445
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:45,637
Later, I heard

446
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:47,756
he failed to cooperate with Yihua
and killed himself.

447
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:49,917
I saw the news

448
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,837
and saw your photo for the first time.

449
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:56,556
I see.

450
00:19:58,076 --> 00:19:59,236
Back then, in the restaurant,

451
00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:01,556
you got close to me on purpose.

452
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:05,036
But I never intended

453
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:06,197
to use you.

454
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:08,397
Everything I did for you was sincere.

455
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:09,236
I know.

456
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:12,996
No matter why you appeared by my side,

457
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:15,437
or why you wanted to be my friend,

458
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:16,716
I can accept it.

459
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:18,716
I'm not stupid.

460
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:21,117
You've been caring about me.

461
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,637
I can feel that you're not using me.

462
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:27,316
But what I can't accept the most is

463
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:30,516
that you're about to become

464
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:31,957
like my Grandma.

Did you see it?

478
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:20,877
We must let go of Bu Ran.

479
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:24,597

After she saw my WeChat Moments,

she showed up

488
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:05,837
and got targeted.

489
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:08,597
It's not my fault.

490
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:09,437
You...

491
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:10,957
Things have come to this.

492
00:22:11,516 --> 00:22:13,236
If Bu Ran can take all the blame,

493
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,877
Pinshang will be safe.

494
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:16,996
Lu Siqi.

495
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:18,877
Her reputation is already ruined.

496
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:20,597
She can sacrifice a little
for the company.

497
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,756
And we can compensate her.

498
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:23,877
Shut up.

499
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:27,357
I thought you were just capricious.

500
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:29,597
But I didn't expect you
to be so unscrupulous.

501
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:31,437
Can you tell right from wrong?

502
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:32,996
Cenyang.

503
00:22:33,756 --> 00:22:34,677
What are you talking about?

504
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:36,036
Yi Zihe kidnapped you,

505
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:37,316
and that was your idea.

506
00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:39,076
You did it to force me
to break up with Bu Ran.

507
00:22:39,756 --> 00:22:40,437
Is that true?

508
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:43,556
No, it's not.

509
00:22:44,316 --> 00:22:45,036
I didn't.

510
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:47,117
I've been thinking about it.

511
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:48,957
You're not the type
to suffer in silence.

512
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:50,837
I wonder why you forgave Yi Zihe

513
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,117
after being hurt.

514
00:22:52,276 --> 00:22:53,716
That's why I talked to Yi Zihe.

515
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:55,437
I've never told you

516
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:58,197

and me doesn't lie with you.

517

But I can't get it.

518
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:00,316
You've driven her away.

don't worry about it.

Siqi should not be your enemy.

558
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:33,117

560
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:37,637
she just wants to be a good designer.

561
00:26:37,877 --> 00:26:38,756
Don't get her involved.

00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:39,516

00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:46,516
What can I do

565
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:48,556
for you?

566
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:49,716
Ms. Yao.

567
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:52,637
I'm very sorry about last time.

568
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:54,597
At the time, I really thought

569
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:56,917
you said angry words
that you would be with Yi Zihe.

570
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:58,528
I didn't take it seriously.

571
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:01,837
But that's not why I came to see you.

572
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,597
I know that someone needs
to be responsible.

573
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:06,677
I could be the one.

574
00:27:06,996 --> 00:27:08,796
You must have seen the news online.

575
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:10,677
Everyone believes
the cause of this matter lies

576
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,036
in the materials I recommended.

577
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:12,996
Given this,

578
00:27:13,157 --> 00:27:15,197
I think you should draft a PR statement

579
00:27:15,357 --> 00:27:17,357
and shift all the blame onto me

580
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:20,516
so that the project could resume,

581
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:22,556
and Pinshang could turn the corner.

582
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:26,076
I see.

583
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:27,796
You think

584
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:29,957
you can't get your way out this time.

585
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:30,837
So,

586
00:27:31,877 --> 00:27:33,877
you chose to let me owe you, right?

587
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,236
I indeed did not

588
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:37,276
select the building materials strictly.

589
00:27:37,637 --> 00:27:39,996
It's my mistake.
I am willing to take responsibility.

590
00:27:40,996 --> 00:27:42,516
Alright, I agree.

591
00:27:49,157 --> 00:27:49,796
Hello?

592
00:27:51,957 --> 00:27:52,716
What?

593
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:56,996
I'm sorry.

594
00:27:57,796 --> 00:28:00,837
My journey
at Pinshang is coming to an end.

595
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:04,117
The Ancient Alley is the place
where my dad lived.

596
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:06,117
I have deep feelings for it.

597
00:28:06,877 --> 00:28:09,397
I didn't expect there were problems
with the materials used

598
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:10,597
in the project.

599
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:12,276
The designer

600
00:28:12,476 --> 00:28:13,996
who is being denounced online

601
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:15,236
has nothing to do with it.

602
00:28:15,756 --> 00:28:17,917
Before this accident, designer Bu Ran

603
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:19,316
had already resigned.

604
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:21,316
All subsequent related plans

605
00:28:21,476 --> 00:28:23,157
were audited by the company first

606
00:28:23,357 --> 00:28:24,556
and then implemented.

607
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:26,437
I bear direct responsibility

608
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:27,957
for any problems.

609
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:30,637
There is no reason to shift the blame
onto anyone else.

610
00:28:31,236 --> 00:28:34,036
So, I will bear the consequences.

611
00:28:35,637 --> 00:28:36,637
Today,

612
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,397
I will resign

613
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:41,516
and will no longer interfere

614
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:43,316
with the business of Pinshang.

615
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,316
Thanks to my colleagues,

616
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:48,597
partners,

617
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:49,917
and friends.

618
00:28:50,516 --> 00:28:51,957
Thank you for your companionship.

619
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:55,036
I hope you will continue
to support Pinshang.

620
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:57,117
I, Lu Cenyang,

621
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:00,437
would like to apologize again.

622
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:04,516
Everyone,

623
00:29:05,357 --> 00:29:06,076
take care.

624
00:29:26,877 --> 00:29:27,837
Are you satisfied now?

625
00:29:28,357 --> 00:29:30,716
I can no longer find any faults

626
00:29:31,197 --> 00:29:32,756
with the project.

627
00:29:33,316 --> 00:29:35,437
I'll submit my report
to the relevant departments.

628
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:36,796
I will transfer my shares

629
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:39,117
to Siqi as quickly as possible.

630
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:40,516
You also have your shares.

631
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:42,917
I have paid my price.

632
00:29:43,397 --> 00:29:44,476
I hope you'll keep your promise

633
00:29:44,677 --> 00:29:46,076
and let the project resume smoothly.

634
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:47,796
I already have a plan

635
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:49,397
in mind.

636
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:50,957
Besides,

637
00:29:51,677 --> 00:29:54,556
you have no right to manage it now.

638
00:30:00,197 --> 00:30:01,957
Dad gave Pinshang to you.

639
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,556
I have never seen

640
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:07,597
you value anything over Pinshang

641
00:30:08,637 --> 00:30:10,117
and Dad.

642
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:14,197
Yet today,

643
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:17,677
you have given up Pinshang

644
00:30:19,036 --> 00:30:20,357
and me

645
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:23,117
for Bu Ran.

646
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:34,276
I underestimated Bu Ran.

647
00:30:36,516 --> 00:30:37,556
I misjudged what she means

648
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:41,476
to you.

649
00:31:17,157 --> 00:31:18,117
Qin Xun.

650
00:31:18,556 --> 00:31:19,437
What are you doing here?

651
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:21,357
Are you looking for Lu Cenyang?

652
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,316
He has already left.

653
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:28,677
He resigned because of you?

654
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:29,677
Pretty much.

655
00:31:31,996 --> 00:31:32,556
Qin Xun.

656
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:33,476
I have

657
00:31:33,637 --> 00:31:35,076
made it very clear to you.

658
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:37,637
I really appreciate
that you stand up for me.

659
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:38,957
But I'm not happy.

660
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:41,437
Now, because of me,
Lu Cenyang has left Pinshang.

661
00:31:41,637 --> 00:31:42,877
What will happen to Pinshang?

662
00:31:42,996 --> 00:31:44,437
What about the Ancient Alley project?

663
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:46,837
Please stop it, okay?

664
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:49,397
Sure.

665
00:31:50,756 --> 00:31:52,236
As long as you agree
to be my girlfriend,

666
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:53,637
I'll do whatever you say.

667
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:55,637
I'm serious.

668
00:31:55,837 --> 00:31:56,756
I'm serious too.

669
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:01,357
Bu Ran.

670
00:32:02,276 --> 00:32:04,397
I've always said that I really like you.

671
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:05,996
But I don't know

672
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:07,996
why you still chose Lu Cenyang.

673
00:32:08,397 --> 00:32:09,476
What did you see in him?

674
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:12,036
It's okay you make choices for yourself.

675
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:13,236
But don't involve me.

676
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:14,556
And don't target Pinshang.

677
00:32:15,316 --> 00:32:15,877
Bu Ran.

678
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:18,516
We could become friends

679
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:20,877
because we are both very stubborn.

680
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:23,597
You want me to back off?

681
00:32:24,036 --> 00:32:24,677
Fine.

682
00:32:25,036 --> 00:32:26,437
As long as you're with me

683
00:32:26,837 --> 00:32:28,197
and stop thinking about Lu Cenyang.

684
00:32:29,036 --> 00:32:31,597
I will keep my promise.

685
00:32:34,597 --> 00:32:35,476
You're right.

686
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:37,556
We are both stubborn people.

687
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:40,236
That's why I can't use love
as a bargaining chip.

688
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,917
I've known you for so long.

689
00:32:42,117 --> 00:32:43,157
I am sure you know

690
00:32:43,157 --> 00:32:44,276
what the right thing to do is.

691
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:45,516
In the business war,

692
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:46,796
there is no right or wrong.

693
00:32:46,957 --> 00:32:48,236
And the same goes for relationships.

694
00:32:48,437 --> 00:32:49,837
Only the stronger one

695
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:51,316
will not get hurt.

696
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:55,957
Bu Ran.

697
00:32:56,957 --> 00:32:58,276
One day you will understand

698
00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:00,437
that I can

699
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:03,716
give you the power to refuse Ms. Hua.

700
00:33:05,756 --> 00:33:06,437
Unexpectedly,

701
00:33:06,637 --> 00:33:08,076
we disagreed with each other today.

702
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:11,957
You do your work.

703
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:13,117
I'm leaving.

704
00:33:13,756 --> 00:33:14,516
Bu Ran.

705
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:16,516
Choosing me

706
00:33:16,877 --> 00:33:18,556
means choosing to have more initiative.

707
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:21,837
I don't care for that.

708
00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:17,351
(President, Lu Cenyang)

709
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,196
Xu, have you seen Lu Cenyang?

710
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:27,996
No.

711
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:35,797
What do you mean?

712
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:38,397
We have less work to do actually.

713
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:40,116
We don't want to waste time

714
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,277
