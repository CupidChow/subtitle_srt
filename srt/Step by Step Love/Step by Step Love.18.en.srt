Don't be mad at me, alright?

00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,547
Why would I be mad at you?

If Xu sees it later,
I'll be punished again.

00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:04,706
I should have told you

about the night before last.

You value a lover over friends.

We've washed so many
dishes together overseas.

30
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:16,267
Will you talk to me again?

31
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:17,467
I have chores from yesterday.

Look at you,

65
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:02,467
not checking the weather forecast,

66
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:04,106
not putting on more when it's cold,

67
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:05,746
and not using an umbrella when it rains.

68
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:07,507
Caught a cold, right?

69
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:11,786
It's okay. I'll just drink more water.

70
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:12,507
Don't move.

71
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,147
Stay put, alright?

72
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:16,866
You will rest well.

73
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,947
And I will take good care of you.

74
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,666
It's just a cold.

75
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:24,186
Don't make a fuss.

76
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,387
Overbearing much?

77
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:30,467
Take the medicine.

78
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:36,707
Come on.

79
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,346
Take the medicine and have a good sleep.

80
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:45,027
Sweat it out,
and the fever will go away.

81
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:56,666
Why take a photo when you're sick?

82
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:00,507
I want to record
every little bit of our lives

83
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,947
for us to look at when we're old.

84
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:04,387
That's a nice idea.

85
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:06,827
My girlfriend is so cute.

86
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:08,106
I want to take a photo too.

87
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,147
(Post to Moments)

88
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,387
Are you crazy? Delete it now!

89
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:25,226
The more aboveboard we are together,
the more it reassures

90
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:26,866
those who care about you.

91
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:28,147
I made it official.

92
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:29,986
It's no big deal.

93
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:31,786
Let's go. I'll take you to bed.

94
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:38,707
Do I look handsome?

95
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:41,746
Not handsome, but stunning.

96
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:48,707
Come on, have a good sleep.

97
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:50,627
Let's eat something good
when you wake up.

98
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:52,546
But I can't sleep.

99
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:30,907
When the children
at the orphanage can't sleep,

100
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:32,387
do you comfort them this way too?

101
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,746
You're sick today.

102
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:37,666
That makes you a child too, Bu Ran.

103
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:40,947
Go to sleep.

104
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:08,426
Mr. Lu made it official.

105
00:08:08,546 --> 00:08:09,067
Did you see it?

106
00:08:09,226 --> 00:08:11,226
The way Mr. Lu looks at Bu Ran

107
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:12,226
is full of love.

108
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,666
So envious.

109
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,707
When will it be my turn to be in love?

110
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,426
Right?

111
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:18,827
So it's true.

112
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:20,106
Yes, look, look.

113
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,226
Look, oh my Gosh!

114
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:23,306
Ms. Hua, I just found out...

115
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:28,106
How come it's you?

116
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:36,387
Ms. Hua knows everything

117
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:37,347
on Bu Ran and Lu Cenyang.

118
00:08:38,747 --> 00:08:40,627
So it's because you've been
keeping an eye on them.

119
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:43,666
Ms. Meng, what can I do for you?

120
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:47,946
Sit down.

121
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:57,347
I wanted to talk to you

122
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:59,147
because I want you to cooperate with me

123
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,627
and break up Bu Ran and Lu Cenyang

124
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,267
so that Ms. Hua will be utterly
disappointed with Bu Ran.

125
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,347
Ms. Meng, you went
to great lengths to find me

126
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,466
just to have me break them up?

127
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:13,066
Bu Ran seems not to be
regarded highly by Ms. Hua,

128
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:15,786
but she is not entirely forsaken.

129
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:18,267
If Bu Ran climbs up
the ranks of Pinshang,

130
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:21,987
Yi Minde would have a chance
to turn things around.

131
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,747
By then, Ms. Hua

132
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:25,946
will be even less tolerant
of our family.

133
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:29,227
But you can't poach from Ms. Hua.

134
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:34,066
What if she finds out?

135
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,306
My mother-in-law is getting old.

136
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:41,666
How could she get angry
at her daughter-in-law for helping out?

137
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:45,387
Even if she did get angry,

138
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:47,306
she couldn't do anything to me.

139
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,227
But as for you,

140
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,227
if you refuse me,

141
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:55,107
I will let Lu Cenyang know

142
00:09:55,786 --> 00:09:57,586
that you are Ms. Hua's spy.

143
00:09:58,747 --> 00:09:59,747
When that happens,

144
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:02,267
you will be completely useless.

145
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:06,627
Between two evils, choose the lesser.

146
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:09,347
Just be a good fence-sitter,

147
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:11,786
and you will benefit from both sides.

148
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:13,987
Why not do it?

149
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:17,267
Ms. Meng,

150
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:21,107
if you want me to break up
Lu Cenyang and Bu Ran,

151
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:23,107
I might not be capable.

152
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:27,227
However, there is someone
who can help you out.

153
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:30,666
I heard that Ms. Hua
is currently investigating

154
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:32,466
Bu Ran's close friend, Qin Xun.

155
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:34,426
I'm sure you're aware of how important

156
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:35,786
Qin Xun is to Bu Ran.

157
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:38,466
I will talk to him.

158
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:42,267
But you are also
an important part of my plan.

159
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:50,186
Ms. Meng.

160
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,186
A token of appreciation.

161
00:10:57,627 --> 00:10:59,586
You know I'm not helping you

162
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,066
for your coffee beans.

163
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:05,186
You helped me solve

164
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:07,027
the trouble my child faced abroad,

165
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:08,826
and I am very grateful to you.

166
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,907
This is just a small gesture from me.

167
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:14,586
You know what I really want,

168
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,867
so stop beating around the bush.

169
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:19,466
Lu Cenyang is very tight-lipped.

170
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,466
I brought out Mr. Lu's old photos,

171
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,267
but I couldn't find out about Lu Siqi.

172
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:25,306
Say something useful.

173
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:27,267
Why did you keep

174
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:29,027
Bu Ran's lackey, Qin Xun?

175
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,066
He is the child
of an old friend of mine.

176
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:33,426
He's handsome and sweet,

177
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:36,786
perfect for attracting customers.

178
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:40,066
I waited for so long
before coming to you.

179
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:42,107
Do you think
that's what I wanted to hear?

180
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:46,987
Even if you don't think about yourself,

181
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,507
think about your child's future.

182
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:51,987
If you continue to be evasive with me,

183
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:53,706
I cannot guarantee

184
00:11:54,387 --> 00:11:56,426
that your daughter
will graduate smoothly.

185
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,546
Qin Xun...

186
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:14,627
Qin Xun is the biological
son of Lu Mingyu.

187
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:17,507
He hates Lu Mingyu.

188
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:22,426
That's more like it.

189
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,027
Thank you for the coffee.

190
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:28,267
Best wishes to your child.

191
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:46,987
Hey, this is Old Pal's.

192
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:52,507
Two cups of Blue Mountain
coffee delivered where?

193
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:54,867
Sure thing.

194
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,147
If you pay the delivery fee, I'll do it.

195
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,907
Mr. Yi didn't look for me

196
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:16,706
just for Old Pal's coffee, right?

197
00:13:20,946 --> 00:13:23,747
Ever since you helped
Lu Cenyang deal with Taylor,

198
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:25,267
I have started investigating you.

199
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:26,507
I also know

200
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:29,426
that you are the biological
son of Lu Mingyu.

201
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,907
Your father has never acknowledged you.

202
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:37,107
Our Yi Family defeated him,

203
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:40,186
indirectly helping you get some payback.

204
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,306
I do think

205
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:43,546
we can have a pleasant talk.

206
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:46,387
You've investigated me so thoroughly.

207
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:49,186
Could it be that you want my help
to take on Lu Cenyang together?

208
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,907
Lu Cenyang has stolen
your father's love,

209
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:56,627
and he's also taken Bu Ran.

210
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:58,907
Let's join forces.

211
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:02,227
As long as you help me break up
Lu Cenyang and Bu Ran,

212
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:03,306
then,

213
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:07,267
the Yihua shares that Lu Cenyang wants,

214
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:11,786
you can take them for a dime.

215
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,387
Once a man has money,

216
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:21,627
naturally, he'll have the confidence
to vie for a woman.

217
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,586
Sorry, but you have

218
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:25,826
the wrong person.

219
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:27,186
Don't be in a rush to refuse, eh?

220
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:28,907
You can't make the decision now,

221
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,147
but soon enough

222
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:31,786
Lu Cenyang will take
everything that's yours.

223
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:50,666
Yi Mincai is going to make a move again.

224
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:52,347
I must tell Bu Ran ASAP.

225
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:57,227
Navigate to Pinshang.

226
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:02,867
I'll go get your phone for you.

227
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:06,907
Thanks!

228
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:11,507
When you came with colleagues
from the Design Dept.,

229
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,107
you didn't take pictures.

230
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:14,066
But this time, you had

231
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:15,227
to use up your battery.

232
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:16,867
What if someone needs to find you?

233
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:18,907
Wouldn't it be good if you
could find me straight away?

234
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:20,227
Did you talk to the boss

235
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:21,107
about takeaway?

236
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:21,907
Of course.

237
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:23,466
You said Qin Xun
loves vegetable with pork,

238
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:25,066
stewed duck, and deep fried tofu.

239
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:25,867
I've ordered them.

240
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:26,666
Good.

241
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:31,946
Remember the noodle shop
I told you about?

242
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:34,027
I've packed the best dishes
they have for you.

243
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:35,027
Don't have lunch yet.

244
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:36,147
I'll bring them over to you.

245
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:41,706
Where are you now?

246
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:43,227
I need to talk to you.

247
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:50,426
Noodle shop?

248
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,227
Seeing your good appetite

249
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:00,227
makes me relieved.

250
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:02,946
You've spent so much time with me.

251
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:04,107
If I don't get well,

252
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:06,586
the company will lose
so much big business.

253
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,987
You sound like the boss's lady now.

254
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:13,347
I have to think about you.

255
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:14,987
You're thinking so much about me.

256
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:19,507
You weren't at the company
when I went this morning.

257
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,706
Did you go to Old Pal's?

258
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:24,546
I guess you were, while I was working,

259
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:26,586
dealing with the distractions first.

260
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,466
One should not

261
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:30,347
underestimate the insight
of an excellent designer.

262
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:31,507
When I went there,

263
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,706
Qin Xun had already gone out.

264
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,786
Qin Xun must be waiting
to forgive me in person.

265
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,227
I'll find him myself.

266
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,666
Thank you for your efforts and trust.

267
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:42,387
And for the feast.

268
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:43,946
That's it? Saying thanks verbally?

269
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:55,627
Close your eyes.

270
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:56,586
Why?

271
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:57,387
Just close them.

272
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:33,067
Hello, Mr. Yi.

273
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:36,746
I'm interested in your proposal.

274
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:40,547
Ms. Yao,

275
00:17:45,186 --> 00:17:46,067
Have you noticed

276
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:47,706
that Bu Ran and Mr. Lu

277
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:49,307
left the company together at noon?

278
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:51,426
Bu Ran's true identity in the Yi Family

279
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:52,827
is no secret anymore.

280
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,547
Why wouldn't Mr. Lu's sister

281
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,266
make any moves?

282
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:59,307
What reaction do you expect from Siqi?

283
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:01,827
To have a big fight
with Mr. Lu at the company?

284
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:04,787
That's not what I meant.

285
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:06,506
I was just thinking

286
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:09,466
someone should come out
to advise Mr. Lu, right?

287
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:11,426
We can't let Bu Ran

288
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:13,107
be the lady of Pinshang alone.

289
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:15,266
Besides, the boss dating an employee

290
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,787
can definitely affect work performance.

291
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:18,587
Otherwise, why would there
be so many companies

292
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:20,587
that explicitly prohibit
office romances?

293
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:26,266
Bu Ran has made
many contributions to the company.

294
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:28,186
Besides, as the secretary,

295
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:29,946
how could I go about sowing discord

296
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:31,907
between the boss and his younger sister?

297
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:37,946
You've already been made an ally
by Bu Ran's PR, haven't you?

298
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:42,186
Forget I said anything.

299
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:53,026
Hello? Who's this?

300
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:56,147
Lu Siqi.

301
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:58,986
I'm your brother.

302
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:01,587
Go tell Lu Cenyang

303
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:04,506
that I have found you.

304
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,746
Bu Ran, you go back to work first.

305
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:28,147
What happened?

306
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,666
Someone called me claiming
to be my biological brother.

307
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:31,627
They knew my identity

308
00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:32,706
and wanted to meet with me.

309
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:36,827
Is it the person
Dad has been looking for?

310
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:38,147
I'm not sure yet.

311
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:39,347
I don't know if it's true.

312
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:43,147
Dad's been searching for so long,
yet he hasn't shown up.

313
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:45,387
Regardless,

314
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:46,466
I'll go and meet him.

315
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:47,547
Okay.

316
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:49,107
But...

317
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:51,186
Don't worry.

318
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:16,026
Hello?

319
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:16,986
Boss.

320
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:18,827
He said he saw you appear

321
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:20,226
and refused to meet.

322
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:33,627
Mr. Lu.

323
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:34,547
Hello?

324
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:35,746
Who is this?

325
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,587
How can you not recognize my voice?

326
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:41,026
It's Yi Mincai.

327
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,347
Did you make that call?

328
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,067
What call?

329
00:20:45,907 --> 00:20:48,307
Mr. Lu, before my call, were you aware

330
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:50,587
that Lu Minyu's true son

331
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:52,466
has appeared?

332
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,466
Speak. What do you want?

333
00:20:58,107 --> 00:20:59,827
I don't want much.

334
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:01,347
Just break up with Bu Ran

335
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,226
and make it public.

336
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:04,746
Do you think I would agree?

337
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:07,107
If you refuse to do as I say,

338
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:08,547
everyone will know

339
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,627
that Lu Mingyu abandoned
his wife and child.

340
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:14,787
With Lu Mingyu's son's announcement,

341
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:16,907
don't even think about covering it up.

342
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:18,746
What do you think

343
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:20,986
your sister Lu Siqi

344
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:22,506
would feel about that?

345
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:55,186
What's the situation?

346
00:21:55,387 --> 00:21:56,266
The person

347
00:21:56,387 --> 00:21:57,706
who made the call used a voice changer,

348
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,506
and I had the IT and Security department

349
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,587
look up the phone number

350
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:01,787
and found out it was spoofed.

351
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,506
People who know you're Lu Siqi

352
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,186
didn't just appear out of nowhere.

353
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,307
So, what Yi Mincai said
might actually be true.

354
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:09,706
The person who called you

355
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:11,587
was indeed your half-brother.

356
00:22:11,827 --> 00:22:13,827
Dad always used to mention
him in front of me,

357
00:22:14,147 --> 00:22:15,746
but I've never met him.

358
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:17,147
Why would he show up like that?

359
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:18,067
By the way,

360
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:19,986
how did Yi Mincai know about it?

361
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:21,986
Could he know that I am Lu Siqi?

362
00:22:23,506 --> 00:22:24,147
Rest assured,

363
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:27,307
given Yi Mincai's personality,

364
00:22:27,506 --> 00:22:28,867
if he knew you were Lu Siqi,

365
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:30,506
he would come to find you immediately,

366
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:31,907
instead of calling you.

367
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:35,787
I'm guessing your brother,

368
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:37,347
for some special reason,

369
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,666
chose to cooperate
with Yi Mincai for now.

370
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:40,706
But he didn't

371
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:42,266
tell him that you are Lu Siqi.

372
00:22:42,506 --> 00:22:45,627
Which is why Yi Mincai wants
to use this to blackmail you.

373
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,107
He wants me to break up with Bu Ran.

374
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,347
Did you agree?

375
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:56,746
No way.

376
00:22:57,827 --> 00:22:58,867
Right now, we don't know

377
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:00,787
what kind of tactics he will use next.

378
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:02,946
But what I can be sure of is

379
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,787
someone would know.

380
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:06,266
Carry.

381
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:11,587
So you don't need to worry.

382
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:12,986
Take good care of yourself.

383
00:23:13,587 --> 00:23:14,547
For the sake of caution,

384
00:23:14,986 --> 00:23:15,466
don't be alone

385
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,746
starting today.

386
00:23:17,107 --> 00:23:17,746
In that case,

387
00:23:18,627 --> 00:23:20,387
can I stay at Fortune Pavilion?

388
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:24,026
Bu Ran still doesn't know your identity.

389
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:25,867
So you have to stay

390
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:27,426
at the company's appointed hotel.

391
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:28,466
Rest assured.

392
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:29,706
I'll send men on point duty.

393
00:24:17,387 --> 00:24:20,107
Bu Ran had someone deliver it at noon.

394
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:22,387
It's gotten cold now.

395
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,627
(Remember the noodle shop
I told you about?)

396
00:24:30,827 --> 00:24:32,827
(I've packed the best dishes
they have for you.)

397
00:24:33,186 --> 00:24:34,067
(Don't have lunch yet.)

398
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:35,226

You're still up.

I can't sleep.

425
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:38,186
Did anything happen

426
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,547
with Ms. Yao and you?

427
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:40,946
I've never seen you so nervous.

428
00:26:41,907 --> 00:26:42,627
It's nothing.

429
00:26:42,787 --> 00:26:44,387
Just some work matters.

430
00:26:46,026 --> 00:26:46,746
Although I don't know

431
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:47,946
what happened between you.

432
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,387
But when you're in trouble

433
00:26:49,547 --> 00:26:50,986
and I can't help,

434
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:52,587
it feels terrible.

435
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:55,946
I know.

436
00:27:07,213 --> 00:27:08,627
(Yi Mincai)

437
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,466
Uncle.

438
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,266
Don't worry.

439
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:12,547
Good night.

440
00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:23,867
It's me, Yi Mincai.

441
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:25,746
For the industry gathering,

442
00:27:25,907 --> 00:27:27,107
you should come in person tomorrow.

443
00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:29,627
As long as you declare that you have

444
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:32,787
no connection whatsoever with Bu Ran
in front of the entire industry,

445
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:35,226
I will preserve some dignity

446
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,907
for your foster father and sister.

447
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,827
Was that a threat?

448
00:27:40,506 --> 00:27:41,226
Mr. Lu.

449
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:43,147
Between Bu Ran and Lu Siqi,

450
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,147
someone has to get hurt.

451
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:46,666
If I had to choose,

452
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:48,587
the sister is more important, right?

453
00:28:09,547 --> 00:28:11,026
Was my uncle involved in today's matter?

454
00:28:11,387 --> 00:28:12,266
What is he doing now?

455
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:14,347
Just some ridiculous petty tricks.

456
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:15,946
It's not your turn to take action yet.

457
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:17,907
Since we've already started dating,

458
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:18,867
we should

459
00:28:19,026 --> 00:28:20,387
face difficulties together, right?

460
00:28:20,706 --> 00:28:21,627
I know.

461
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:22,946
I am capable of solving it.

462
00:28:23,147 --> 00:28:24,547
Can I take care of this matter?

463
00:28:25,347 --> 00:28:26,547
What exactly are you hiding from me?

464
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:30,746
Either it's because my uncle
did something again,

465
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:33,107
or it's because of my identity,

466
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:34,307
that you can't tell me.

467
00:28:35,706 --> 00:28:37,067
What do you mean by that?

468
00:28:38,226 --> 00:28:39,226
I mean you're wary of me

469
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:40,746
because I'm from the Yi Family.

470
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:42,107
Or that you have a relationship

471
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:43,466
with Ms. Yao that I can't know.

472
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:44,706
Do you not trust me that much?

473
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:46,186
It's you who doesn't trust me.

474
00:29:11,226 --> 00:29:11,827
Ms. Meng,

475
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:14,026
you went to great lengths to find me

476
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,107
just to have me break those two up, huh?

477
00:29:16,746 --> 00:29:18,627
Bu Ran seems not to be
regarded highly by Ms. Hua,

478
00:29:19,147 --> 00:29:21,426
but she is not entirely forsaken.

479
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:23,867
If Bu Ran climbs up
the ranks of Pinshang,

480
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:27,627
Yi Minde would have a chance
to turn things around.

481
00:29:28,347 --> 00:29:29,347
By then, Ms. Hua

482
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,307
will be even less tolerant
of our family.

483
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:34,946
Ms. Meng, what do you
want me to do then?

484
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:37,107
It's simple.

485
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,706
Find someone to pretend
to be Lu Cenyang's girlfriend

486
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:42,666
and accompany him
to our industry's monthly gathering.

487
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:45,946
Do you want Lu Cenyang
to publicly dump Bu Ran?

488
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:50,587
Mr. Lu.

489
00:29:53,946 --> 00:29:54,986
We should get going.

490
00:29:58,107 --> 00:29:58,827
It's you.

491
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:06,266
You're dressed

492
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:08,986
just like the leading lady
in a palace drama.

493
00:30:09,706 --> 00:30:11,186
When declaring sovereignty,

494
00:30:11,347 --> 00:30:12,827
being the leading lady
is very satisfying.

495
00:30:17,627 --> 00:30:19,026
A large sandwich.

496
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:20,986
A large fruit salad

497
00:30:21,347 --> 00:30:23,387
and a strong cocktail.

498
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,506
Are you still mad at me?

499
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:31,627
It's not worth it.

500
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:38,666
You're eating a lot.

501
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:41,827
Can't you tell I'm
in a really bad mood today?

502
00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:43,506
Being with Lu Cenyang,

503
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,347
getting upset was bound
to happen sooner or later.

504
00:30:46,746 --> 00:30:48,107
The sandwich can satisfy you.

505
00:30:48,506 --> 00:30:50,746
If you want to drown your sorrows,
don't look for me.

506
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,986
I won't let you do it.

507
00:30:57,506 --> 00:30:59,706
Don't think that Lu Cenyang's
post on Moments

508
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:01,266
is such an amazing thing.

509
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:02,226
In my opinion,

510
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:04,506
he's using the fact
that you've never been in love.

511
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:06,907
Haven't you seen the gossip news?

512
00:31:07,147 --> 00:31:09,867
Those who are truly recognized
by the CEO as girlfriends

513
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:11,547
are openly taken to social events

514
00:31:11,547 --> 00:31:12,907
to meet more people.

515
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:13,946
You

516
00:31:14,746 --> 00:31:16,547
are the hidden mistress at Pinshang

517
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:18,746
at most.

518
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:21,426
I've been upset all day.

519
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:22,907
Did you have to make it worse?

520
00:31:23,426 --> 00:31:24,746
Is there any wine or not?

521
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:30,827
Your discomfort has only just begun.

522
00:31:31,506 --> 00:31:32,266
Drink this first.

523
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:34,746
If you don't serve, I'll order takeaway.

524
00:31:35,387 --> 00:31:36,946
Today, I need drinks

525
00:31:36,946 --> 00:31:38,627
to have the strength
to contend with Lu Cenyang.

526
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:40,186
I just don't get it.

527
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:41,347
What on earth is going on

528
00:31:41,506 --> 00:31:42,907
that he just has to keep it from me?

529
00:31:43,107 --> 00:31:45,466
If he's hiding it,

530
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:47,827
there are matters
that you shouldn't know about.

531
00:31:49,466 --> 00:31:51,506
Matters that I shouldn't know about?

532
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,186
Mr. Lu, long time no see.

533
00:31:56,186 --> 00:31:58,516
(Hai City Construction Industry Summit)

534
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:01,587
Mr. Lu.

535
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:03,946
You never bring a female companion
whenever you come.

536
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:05,506
Always alone.

537
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:07,627
Mr. Wang, you are wrong there.

538
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,426
Mr. Lu is a young talent.

539
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:11,067
How could he possibly
not have a girlfriend?

540
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:15,907
Speaking of which, I've recently
heard a piece of gossip

541
00:32:16,107 --> 00:32:17,026
saying that Mr. Lu

542
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:19,587
is dating the designer Bu Ran, right?

543
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:21,827
You seem quite interested

544
00:32:21,827 --> 00:32:22,907
in my private life.

545
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:26,307
We're just curious

546
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:28,186
that what kind of woman

547
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,026
can date you, Mr. Lu?

548
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:38,587
- Why come here?
- Ms. Yao.

549
00:32:38,787 --> 00:32:39,666
I am more suitable

550
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:41,627
to play this act with you.

551
00:32:50,547 --> 00:32:51,466
What are you doing here?

552
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:53,426
Carry, you got it wrong.

553
00:32:54,186 --> 00:32:57,067
I should be the one here today
for this occasion.

554
00:32:58,147 --> 00:32:59,186
What do you know?

555
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:02,147
I know what you're to do today.

556
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:05,426
So, for your mission today,

557
00:33:05,587 --> 00:33:06,547
I'll take care of it.

558
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:10,627
I thought you were never

559
00:33:10,787 --> 00:33:12,026
interested in Mr. Lu.

560
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:14,746
I know that Mr. Lu

561
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:16,387
came under pressure today.

562
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:17,627
Compared to you,

563
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:20,587
the identity of a girlfriend

564
00:33:20,946 --> 00:33:22,107
is more convincing on me.

565
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:23,026
You...

566
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,387
You don't know the story behind today,

567
00:33:28,587 --> 00:33:29,946
so you can't replace me.

568
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:32,026
Is that so?

569
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:35,226
I heard that Mr. Yi and Ms. Meng
will both be here today.

570
00:33:35,587 --> 00:33:38,347
Aren't you afraid of revealing
your identity in public?

571
00:33:41,547 --> 00:33:42,266
Listen to me.

572
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,307
I'll take care of this matter.

573
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,547
You can complete the task

574
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:47,946
without getting involved.

575
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,706
Win-win, right?

576
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:56,627
This is Ms. Yao.

577
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:57,867
I suppose you have met her.

578
00:33:58,067 --> 00:33:58,787
Hello, Ms. Yao.

579
00:34:04,347 --> 00:34:06,226
Carry has put effort into her task.

580
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:09,466
I thought she would come herself,

581
00:34:09,787 --> 00:34:10,626
but unexpectedly,

582
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:12,787
she actually found someone
more suitable than her.
