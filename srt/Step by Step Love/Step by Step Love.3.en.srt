20
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:43,468
Sister, I want to go back
to the classroom.

21
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:46,987
I'll take you back.

22
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:55,507
Do you want the little dinosaur?

23
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:57,028
Look at this.

24
00:01:57,028 --> 00:01:58,028
Okay, here you go.

25
00:01:58,707 --> 00:01:59,427
Do you like it?

26
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:02,188
Look, it moves, see?

27
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:07,627
You ran into her.

28
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:10,028
She's really annoying.

29
00:02:10,188 --> 00:02:11,188
More talkative than I am.

30
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:11,988
Qin Xun.

31
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,627
Let's go dance together, hurry up.

32
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:16,227
Yes.

33
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,947
Come and dance with the kids.

34
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:20,148
I can't dance.

35
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:21,188
Sister.

36
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:22,067
Come on, Sister.

37
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:23,827
- I really can't.
- Come on.

38
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,708
It's a kids' dance. Just improvise.

39
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:27,667
Okay, ready now.

40
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:29,947
Three, two, one, start.

41
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:37,028
Wiggle.

42
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:54,868
Smile.

43
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:56,188
Cenyang.

44
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:57,107
Hold your chin.

45
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,988
That's Mr. Qin.

46
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:00,667
He's also a donor.

47
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:03,028
He said his friend Bu Ran

48
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:06,627
is an excellent interior designer

49
00:03:07,947 --> 00:03:09,468
and she wants to help us

50
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:10,588
with the renovation.

51
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:12,268
I knew it.

52
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:13,507
Director,

53
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:15,748
you can't just believe what anyone says.

54
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:20,028
Don't always think so badly of people.

55
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,067
Miss Bu obviously doesn't know
her way around children,

56
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:24,588
but she didn't

57
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:26,908
refuse any child's request,

58
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,067
and she's actively helping the children,

59
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:30,347
playing with them.

60
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:31,547
Look, look.

61
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:33,188
Kids like her.

62
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:37,387
Look at her perfunctory attitude
with the children's dance.

63
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:38,868
She's worse than a kid.

64
00:03:39,547 --> 00:03:41,227
What does she know about children?

65
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:43,387
(What is he talking about?)

66
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:45,908
Let's go.

67
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,748
Here you go.

68
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:18,987
Hello?

69
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:20,347
Boss,

70
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:22,427
I found out

71
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,987
that Yihua has announced
a collaboration with Taylor.

72
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:26,667
Do you know what project it is?

73
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:28,787
Not yet.

74
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:31,227
Yihua's projects have always
been heavily criticized.

75
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:33,468
To persuade a master
like Taylor to collaborate,

76
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:35,268
it must not be an ordinary
commercial project.

77
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:37,787
I found out something else.

78
00:04:38,388 --> 00:04:39,628
Bu Ran was expelled from the academy

79
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:42,028
for offending Taylor,
right before graduation.

80
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:45,547
She's so troublesome and annoying.

81
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:47,468
It's no surprise
she offended her mentor.

82
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:50,107
What's most important now
is to understand clearly

83
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:51,427
what is the project

84
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:53,187
that Yihua and Taylor are working on.

85
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:54,107
Okay.

86
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,307
Do you know what time it is now?

87
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:07,468
Aren't you worried

88
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:08,708
that your grandma would find out?

89
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:10,628
There's a time difference
with Taylor's side,

90
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:11,508
so I got up late.

91
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:12,908
You reek of alcohol.

92
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:15,628
Luckily, your grandma didn't see you.

93
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,187
Hurry and clean yourself up.

94
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:19,547
Got it.

95
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:20,628
By the way,

96
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:22,307
did Taylor reply?

97
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:25,708
Taylor said

98
00:05:25,987 --> 00:05:27,828
that other local companies
are also contacting him

99
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:29,747
with professional
interpretations of his work.

100
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:31,028
He needs time to consider.

101
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:33,227
Who would dare to jeopardize

102
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:34,547
someone that Yihua has eyes on?

103
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,747
I guess it's Lu Cenyang.

104
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:39,547
Isn't Bu Ran getting close to him?

105
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:41,068
It's very likely she helped him

106
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:42,307
with Taylor's design thinking,

107
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,148
so Lu Cenyang
struck a chord with Taylor.

108
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:45,667
It makes sense.

109
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:51,547
And yet your grandma
won't let us interfere with Bu Ran.

110
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:56,227
But I have a way to deal with her.

111
00:05:57,948 --> 00:05:59,747
Dad, what have you got?

112
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:02,987
I have an insider at Fortune Pavilion.

113
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:06,307
Didn't Bu Ran move in
next to Lu Cenyang?

114
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:08,107
And she has a very short lease.

115
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,787
We can buy that apartment.

116
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:16,628
We are close with the neighboring

117
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:17,987
landlord.

118
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:47,427
The community rules dictate
no renovations before 8 AM.

119
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:49,388
If your drill doesn't stop,
I'm going to complain.

120
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:52,028
Excuse me, don't you
have a clock at home?

121
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:54,107
Look at the time now.

122
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:54,828
(10:00 AM Bu Ran)

123
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:56,588
I'm just making an amphibious box.
It'll be quick.

124
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:58,508
I don't care. I want to sleep.

125
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:00,588
Why should I listen to you?

126
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:03,107
Are you my boss or my landlord?

127
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:11,948
The protest has come
right to my doorstep.

128
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:15,227
Perfect timing for you
to see my new work.

129
00:07:19,948 --> 00:07:20,867
Miss Bu, aren't you?

130
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:22,547
Yes, I am. Is there anything?

131
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:23,347
Here's the deal.

132
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:24,588
The landlord has entrusted us

133
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:25,708
to sell this house.

134
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,388
I came to give you a heads-up.

135
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:29,508
I've just rented it.

136
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:30,787
Of course,

137
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,867
if you are willing
to move out immediately,

138
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,588
the landlord will not only
refund all your rent

139
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,628
but will also pay you triple
the penalty fee.

140
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:39,828
Otherwise,

141
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:41,068
according to the contract,

142
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:44,068
you might only get the remaining rent.

143
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:51,388
I was just about to call you.

144
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:53,628
The landlord said someone
made a very good offer

145
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:55,107
to buy this house.

146
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:57,268
Sorry, I couldn't help you.

147
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:58,427
It's not your fault.

148
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:02,028
Miss Bu, perhaps you should move out.

149
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:03,508
The landlord is waiting for my reply.

150
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:10,628
Is this house for sale?

151
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:11,828
Yes, sir.

152
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:13,747
However, it's already been reserved.

153
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:18,068
I'll offer a 5% commission.

154
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:19,708
Convince the landlord to sell it to me.

155
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:22,747
5%?

156
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,107
I'll convince the landlord ASAP.

157
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:26,388
Wait for my good news.

158
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:32,148
What were you saying?

159
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:34,228
Am I your boss or your landlord?

160
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:37,707
It seems I will soon
become your landlord.

161
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:40,187
So you really want to drive me out.

162
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:41,787
I guess.

163
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,628
Then I will ask for compensation.

164
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:45,067
Talk to the previous landlord.

165
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:47,108
Then show off after you've bought it.

166
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:50,067
Hello?

167
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:51,268
Mr. Taylor.

168
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:53,187
Have you made your decision yet?

169
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:54,307
Yes, Mr. Lu.

170
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:57,587
The sincerity of Pinshang impressed me
more than Yihua.

171
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,908
I'm going to have a coffee
with you in China.

172
00:09:00,268 --> 00:09:02,988
I've heard you have
a great passion for coffee.

173
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:05,028
I can't wait for you to share it.

174
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,868
I will book the nearest flight for you.

175
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:11,748
I've already contacted Professor Taylor.

176
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:12,988
As his student,

177
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:15,307
you should know he's a widely
recognized excellent designer.

178
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:20,028
So you can give up
on the orphanage matter.

179
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:35,008
(Ruvest)

180
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:37,028
Mom.

181
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:39,628
There's been a hiccup
with the student loan.

182
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:40,868
But you don't need to worry.

183
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:42,388
I still have the work-study program.

184
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,707
Besides, in this semester,

185
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,587
Professor Taylor is willing
to have me on a project.

186
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:49,348
I have to go.

187
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:50,587
I have a design draft due.

188
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:20,467
Okay.

189
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:22,108
Okay, okay.

190
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:24,787
Bu Ran.

191
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:27,667
I know you're having big problems

192
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:29,908
with your student loan, right?

193
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:34,148
You don't have to worry about that

194
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:38,628
because I will make a special
recommendation for you.

195
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:42,388
And you'll have a scholarship
from our department.

196
00:10:43,988 --> 00:10:45,388
How about that?

197
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:47,988
Thank you very much.

198
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:50,307
I will do my very best.

199
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:53,748
Actually,

200
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:55,467
Your family Yi

201
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:02,348
has always curried favor with me

202
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:04,307
and your uncle also helped me

203
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,587
to have an exhibition in China.

204
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,508
I know they are not very nice to you.

205
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:11,748
I promised him

206
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:15,268
that if you were going to be my girl,

207
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:18,348
and they wouldn't give you a hard time.

208
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,547
Now, let me see your shape, okay?

209
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:26,307
So I can see if you are worthy
of my recommendation.

210
00:11:27,268 --> 00:11:28,628
You're disgusting.

211
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:30,827
You've messed with the wrong person.

212
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:32,388
What was that?

213
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:37,427
I said, you have a little
too much alcohol.

214
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:41,148
Go take a shower first.

215
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:42,467
And,

216
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,547
I'll wait for you here.

217
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:49,787
Okay.

218
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:53,508
Make yourself comfortable.
Take off your coat.

219
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:54,868
I will.

220
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,307
(You're in cahoots,)

221
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:19,667
(conspiring against me.)

222
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:40,467
You suggested hiring
a top designer from abroad.

223
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,187
I'm sure you have your reason.

224
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:44,388
But Cenyang,

225
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:45,787
children of the Welfare Center

226
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:47,667
have already missed out
on too much love.

227
00:12:48,707 --> 00:12:50,028
So their place of residence

228
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:53,187
must give them
a stronger feeling of home.

229
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:54,547
I understand.

230
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:55,827
That is why my father

231
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,508
built this center, to begin with.

232
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:00,268
(Dance Practice Room)
Although I am still far behind him,

233
00:13:00,508 --> 00:13:01,748
I will do my best

234
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,467
to prevent people with impure
intentions from getting involved.

235
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:09,348
You mean Miss Bu, right?

236
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:10,067
She

237
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:11,908
has already given up.

238
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:19,547
Miss Bu is very enthusiastic.

239
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,228
She said even if we
don't use her designs,

240
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,707
we can still reference her ideas.

241
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:30,947
Judging by her dedication and sincerity,

242
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:32,787
she is quite suitable.

243
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:35,547
Director, as you know,

244
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:37,827
I wouldn't be wary
of someone without reason.

245
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:39,827
I know that.

246
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:41,908
You fight in the business world,

247
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,108
and you've seen a lot of bad people.

248
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,067
But it's different
at the Welfare Center.

249
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:48,787
I've seen many kind eyes here.

250
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:51,187
You can't fake

251
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:53,667
a pair of clean eyes.

252
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:57,508
You should

253
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,707
go have a chat.

254
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:01,947
I'll wait for you in the classroom.

255
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:14,028
You really are a lingering presence.

256
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:15,427
You come quite frequently.

257
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:35,427
What? Are you a dog?

258
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:38,868
That's my blood.

259
00:14:40,108 --> 00:14:42,628
I bit my mouth.

260
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:54,028
It hurts.

261
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:56,748
Ouch. Ouch.

262
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:57,787
Alright.

263
00:14:58,667 --> 00:14:59,827
Ouch.

264
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,268
Gentler, please.

265
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,547
A three-year-old doesn't
cry as loudly as you.

266
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:10,028
You know what you're doing.

267
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,827
There are many kids here.

268
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:12,707
So it's normal

269
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:14,467
for older children
to learn nursing skills.

270
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,427
I don't know how you've managed
to make yourself

271
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:19,148
so utterly shameless,

272
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:20,988
but I've already told you repeatedly,

273
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:21,787
you're not needed.

274
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:22,947
Yet you insist on barging in.

275
00:15:23,228 --> 00:15:24,988
Right, from your perspective,

276
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:26,268
you are tenaciously unyielding.

277
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:27,268
But for others...

278
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:28,028
Stop it.

279
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:31,228
I don't want to hear your judgment.

280
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:33,108
I'm not making a blueprint for you.

281
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:34,268
Save your comments.

282
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:35,748
I don't need your lecture.

283
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,707
I know you plan to use Tyler.

284
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:43,228
So what?

285
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:45,508
The renovation is by tender.

286
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:47,268
You face many competitors.

287
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,388
Even with Tyler on board,

288
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:49,508
you're not guaranteed to win.

289
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:50,787
But with my help,

290
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,427
you can increase
your chances of winning.

291
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:54,868
With 'your' help?

292
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,268
What about me?

293
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:01,748
I know you're guarding against me,

294
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:04,508
and constantly using a harsh tone

295
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:05,947
to suppress my enthusiasm,

296
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:07,427
quite successfully, indeed.

297
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:11,028
At one point, I thought about leaving.

298
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:12,228
But the reason why

299
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:14,228
you're seeing me now

300
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:15,667
is because I firmly believe

301
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:16,908
that the children know best

302
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:19,268
which designer can fulfill their wishes.

303
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:22,508
Just this once,

304
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:27,388
regardless of whether you will
use my work or not,

305
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,108
just let me contribute.

306
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:32,508
Do you know how many companies
have ulterior motives

307
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:33,988
for the reconstruction?

308
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,947
The emotions of each child here

309
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,547
are pure and fragile,

310
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:38,988
without the slightest impurity.

311
00:16:39,307 --> 00:16:40,787
I will not allow them to get involved.

312
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:42,228
Nor will I make an exception for you.

313
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,628
Take a rest and go back by yourself.

314
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:46,467
Don't make me evict you.

315
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:48,348
Otherwise, it would be
awkward as neighbors.

316
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,628
So you do know I'm your neighbor.

317
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:52,908
That makes you even more my tenant.

318
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:54,307
I can evict you at any time.

319
00:16:56,508 --> 00:16:57,388
Pack your things.

320
00:16:57,868 --> 00:16:58,748
No, hey.

321
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:05,868
Sister.

322
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:07,828
What are you doing here?

323
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:10,388
Are you hurt?

324
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:13,068
I'm fine.

325
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:15,148
I hurt myself a little.

326
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:16,868
Here's a lollipop for you.

327
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:18,348
It's magical.

328
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:20,628
I can't eat it, so I'll give
the magic to you.

329
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:22,187
Get well soon.

330
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:23,788
Thank you, Douhua.

331
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:24,828
Your consolation

332
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:27,068
made me feel better instantly.

333
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:29,987
Did you have a fight with Uncle Lu?

334
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,148
Uncle Lu?

335
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,068
Is Uncle Lu

336
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:35,628
the fiercest and the most

337
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:36,788
annoying uncle you've seen?

338
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:37,868
Not at all.

339
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,707
He's our guardian angel here.

340
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:41,628
Children shouldn't brag.

341
00:17:41,788 --> 00:17:42,667
I'm serious.

342
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:44,987
The Director says he manages
a big company

343
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:45,908
and is very busy.

344
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:46,788
But still,

345
00:17:46,908 --> 00:17:48,788
he remembers everyone's birthday,

346
00:17:48,908 --> 00:17:51,108
and sends us gifts
written on wish cards.

347
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:52,427
He knows our hobbies

348
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:54,027
and invites the best teachers

349
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:55,868
to give us interest classes.

350
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:57,467
He's the best uncle.

351
00:17:57,747 --> 00:18:00,267
Sister, don't be mad at Uncle Lu.

352
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:03,868
(After all,)

353
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:06,308
(he's doing it
for all these adorable kids.)

354
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,108
Your name is Qin Xun,

355
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:23,828
a returnee.

356
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:27,987
Why would you fancy
my remote little shop?

357
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:31,308
It's quite to my liking.

358
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:32,987
What did you take a liking to here?

359
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:34,588
My mom once told me

360
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:36,588
that when my dad was upset,

361
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:38,227
he loved coming here for a drink.

362
00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:42,427
I don't have any friends
with the surname Qin.

363
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:43,747
I have my mother's surname.

364
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:45,348
My dad's surname is Lu.

365
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:56,588
I sell coffee here during the day.

366
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:58,068
Can you handle it?

367
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,507
Call out your best barista

368
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:01,507
to compete with me.

369
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:04,427
Xu.

370
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:06,187
Cenyang.

371
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:09,187
What brings you here today?

372
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:10,267
I am about to collaborate

373
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,148
with a world-class designer.

374
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:13,828
He is a coffee enthusiast.

375
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,507
I want to find some common topics.

376
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,388
So I came to you
for some last-minute help.

377
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:18,588
Perfect timing.

378
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:19,667
I have a newcomer

379
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:21,308
who just arrived.

380
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:23,667
He claims to be very skilled
at making coffee.

381
00:19:24,908 --> 00:19:25,747
Qin Xun.

382
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:32,707
Tell him whatever you want.

383
00:19:33,348 --> 00:19:34,628
Okay, thank you.

384
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:40,788
We've met before at the Welfare Center.

385
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:42,148
You were with Bu Ran.

386
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:44,828
Mr. Lu has a good memory.
What coffee would you like?

387
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:46,108
Your specialty.

388
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,908
This is my special blend.

389
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:19,747
Be careful.

390
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:22,108
I wonder if Mr. Lu dares to try it.

391
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:33,707
I forgot to tell you

392
00:20:33,947 --> 00:20:35,187
that people abroad like to have

393
00:20:35,187 --> 00:20:36,427
all kinds of special blends,

394
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:37,947
especially ones with a story.

395
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:39,667
What's the story?

396
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:43,467
It's just the story
of an abandoned child.

397
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:44,747
There's not much to tell.

398
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:50,828
The coffee is good.

399
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:52,308
The story is average.

400
00:20:55,348 --> 00:20:57,187
Mr. Lu thinks the story is average.

401
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,947
Is it because you have a perfect family?

402
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:04,187
It used to be perfect.

403
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,788
After my dad took me home
from the Welfare Center,

404
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:09,467
he did his best to make up
for the love I lost.

405
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:12,388
Sounds like your dad
was pretty good to you.

406
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,467
Get your story straight next time.

407
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:46,868
You busted me long ago.

408
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,068
Why did you still take that sip?

409
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:52,588
Did you tease me on purpose

410
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:54,027
because of my attitude to Bu Ran?

411
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:56,588
Are you her boyfriend?

412
00:21:57,908 --> 00:21:58,788
We're friends.

413
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:01,227
The backup guy, no wonder.

414
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:02,868
I'm curious.

415
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:05,227
Have you ever been
genuinely good to anyone?

416
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:06,628
Or does your kindness

417
00:22:06,788 --> 00:22:07,588
always have a purpose?

418
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,308
So, you see everyone else
in the same way?

419
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:12,227
I've already bought
the apartment she rents,

420
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,148
but I have no intention
of driving her out.

421
00:22:14,588 --> 00:22:15,348
Take a guess.

422
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:18,628
Is my kindness genuine,
or is there an ulterior motive?

423
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:33,227
Hi, baby.

424
00:22:33,707 --> 00:22:34,987
What's going on with Taylor?

425
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:38,628
He stood you up?

426
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,548
You really have a knack for timing.

427
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:52,947
Miss Busy.

428
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:54,427
I've got some good news for you.

429
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:58,027
I'm going to start working
at Old Pal's tomorrow.

430
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,348
Congratulations on the new job.

431
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:02,227
Mr. Unemployed.

432
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,427
I've got a new place
to mooch food and drinks.

433
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,588
Do you want to hear
something about Tyler?

434
00:23:11,747 --> 00:23:12,427
Go ahead.

435
00:23:12,987 --> 00:23:14,267
Tyler's girlfriend

436
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,628
told me today

437
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:17,788
that Tyler canceled their date

438
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:19,108
and he's coming to China tomorrow.

439
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,667
Tomorrow?

440
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,388
I heard before that the Yi family
has spent a fortune to hire him.

441
00:23:25,707 --> 00:23:27,348
It seems that Yihua is determined

442
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:28,388
to get this renovation.

443
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:29,427
But Lu Cenyang

444
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:32,267
just came to the bar where I applied
to learn to make coffee today.

445
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:35,467
It seems he is preparing
for Tyler's arrival.

446
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:37,388
And I did some investigating.

447
00:23:38,227 --> 00:23:39,467
The hotel where Tyler is staying

448
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,308
is precisely Pinshang's partner hotel.

449
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,068
Why would Tyler give up
such a big opportunity with Yihua

450
00:23:44,227 --> 00:23:46,068
for a newcomer like Pinshang?

451
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:49,707
No, there must be a trap somewhere.

452
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,388
It's good for Lu Cenyang to take a loss.

453
00:23:52,588 --> 00:23:55,267
How would one know the road
is slippery without taking a fall?

454
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:56,747
Once he's hurt,

455
00:23:56,747 --> 00:23:58,388
he'll know who will help him up.

456
00:23:58,707 --> 00:24:00,068
Listen to me, stay out of this.

457
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,788
Keep calm and let's enjoy the show.

458
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:06,427
The Director says he manages
a big company

459
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:07,348
and is very busy.

460
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:08,108
But still,

461
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:09,828
he remembers everyone's birthday,

462
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:12,187
and sends us gifts
written on wish cards.

463
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:13,507
He knows our hobbies

464
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:14,788
and invites the best teachers

465
00:24:14,947 --> 00:24:16,227
to give us interest classes.

466
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,707
He's the best uncle.

467
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:19,148
Lu Cenyang might seem

468
00:24:19,348 --> 00:24:22,027
aloof and arrogant on the surface,

469
00:24:22,187 --> 00:24:23,108
and frankly annoying.

470
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:25,027
But he is the mental
and material safeguard

471
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:27,148
for the children in the Welfare Center.

472
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:29,187
If someone like Taylor
were involved in the design,

473
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:30,588
the haven that children dream of

474
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:31,667
would be completely ruined.

475
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:34,068
Helping Lu Cenyang
is helping the children.

476
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:36,027
What if the Yi family is setting him up?

477
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:38,588
Well, I've become friends

478
00:24:38,747 --> 00:24:39,667
with the kids there.

479
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:41,308
Can you help me check

480
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:43,027
when Taylor is arriving tomorrow?

481
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:57,267
Dad.

482
00:24:57,868 --> 00:24:59,788
The big gift we prepared for Lu Cenyang

483
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:01,148
has been delivered.

484
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:03,027
Good.

485
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:05,027
Lu Cenyang likes to grab things, huh?

486
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:06,908
He grabbed the house of Fortune Pavilion

487
00:25:07,068 --> 00:25:08,388
and now the orphanage's project.

488
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:10,588
We'll let him grab it.

489
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:24,308
Bu Ran?

490
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:29,908
This project is not just for adults.

491
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:31,828
It is also for the children.

492
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:33,507
What I'm talking about

493
00:25:33,507 --> 00:25:36,227
isn't always staying on the ideal level.

494
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:38,987
It's gonna be everywhere in my design.

495
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:43,628
And I think the kids will like this.

496
00:25:43,828 --> 00:25:45,467
The children will love this

497
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:49,227
at this point, if we continually
further this idea.

498
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,707
You set fire to my home?

499
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:53,628
You accuse me in public, huh?

500
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,267
Do you know why I'm so powerful?

501
00:25:56,427 --> 00:25:59,987
Because I created
this fascinating world.

502
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:01,388
