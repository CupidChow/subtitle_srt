=Episode 9=

20
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:52,892
Are your hands itching?

21
00:01:53,652 --> 00:01:55,652
I told you these shoes
were very expensive.

22
00:01:55,892 --> 00:01:57,172
Are these shoes for you to doodle on?

23
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,012
Stretch out your hand.

24
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:00,172
I'll teach you a lesson.

25
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,812
Quick, give me your hand.

26
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:05,211
Xinyu, go back to the classroom
and wait for me.

27
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:07,012
- I'll be there soon.
- Spread your hand.

28
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:08,091
Quick.

29
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:10,651
What's the matter with you?

30
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:13,371
Give me your hand.

31
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:15,972
Stretch out your hand.

32
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:18,331
Spread your hand. Quick.

33
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:21,132
Ms. Bu.

34
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:23,012
Sorry, I accidentally hurt you.

35
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:25,012
This child is disobedient.

36
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,331
My shoes have been drawn on like this.

37
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:28,771
I'm teaching him a lesson.

38
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:33,252
The watercolor pen marks
should be washable.

39
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:34,931
I've read about it online.

40
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:36,172
Let's add each other on WeChat.

41
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:37,211
Okay.

42
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:38,611
Thank you, Ms. Bu.

43
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:52,331
I'll send it to you later.

44
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:53,172
Okay.

45
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:55,091
Thank you, Ms. Bu. Let's go.

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,960
(Chanel sneakers,11,999 yuan)

47
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:10,651
What's wrong?

48
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:12,572
Any findings?

49
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:15,172
The TA's salary at the orphanage
isn't high.

50
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:17,651
But she is wearing a pair of sneakers
that cost over 10,000 yuan.

51
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:20,132
I've dealt with this female TA before.

52
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,331
She's usually very frugal

53
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:22,692
and is reluctant
to buy expensive things.

54
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:23,852
The TA is naive.

55
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:25,331
She is most likely
to be deceived by Yi Zihe.

56
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:28,292
Before I expose Yi Zihe as a womanizer,

57
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:29,732
please keep an eye on her.

58
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:33,892
Mr. Zhang always refused to meet us.

59
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:49,568
(Mr. Li)

60
00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:55,012
This girl is pretty good.

61
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:56,132
Mr. Wang will surely like her.

62
00:03:58,452 --> 00:04:00,611
(I miss you.
See you at the usual place.)

63
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:21,452
Mr. Qin,

64
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,211
I've noticed that you
have been following me for a while.

65
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,132
Let me tell you,

66
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:28,411
I already have a boyfriend.

67
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,211
Your boyfriend is Yi Zihe, right?

68
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:33,692
I saw you were unable
to reach him just now.

69
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:35,291
He's very busy.

70
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:36,211
Busy with what?

71
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:39,012
Busy ditching you to have fun?

72
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:40,091
Nonsense!

73
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:40,932
Zihe won't do that.

74
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:42,211
Don't be anxious.

75
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:50,651
(I've been waiting for you for ages.)

76
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:52,132
(You haven't visited me
for such a long time.)

77
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:53,372
(I've missed you so much.)

78
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,411
But here I am, aren't I?

79
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:57,211
That clingy woman is so annoying.

80
00:04:57,492 --> 00:04:58,851
I bought her a pair of sneakers

81
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:00,612
and she thinks I'm her entire world.

82
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:02,452
(She messages me whenever she's free.)

83
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:03,452
I didn't reply to her.

84
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,892
Then she blamed me for being too busy
and not taking care of my health.

85
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:07,291
It's none of her business.

86
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,452
(That woman hasn't seen
much of the world.)

87
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:10,892
How about it?

88
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:13,171
Now do you believe what I said?

89
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:16,651
How could that be?

90
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:18,492
Let's go.

91
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:19,651
Mr. Wang has been waiting
for a long time.

92
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:20,492
Go.

93
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:28,612
I know you.

94
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:29,572
Don't bring trouble Mr. Yi.

95
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:30,971
Yi Zihe didn't book
the place exclusively.

96
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,452
Why can he enter but not me?

97
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:33,851
What's going on?

98
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:36,531
Mr. Yi.

99
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:40,932
If you're planning to sneak a photo,

100
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,211
my bodyguard isn't a pushover.

101
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:43,052
You...

102
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:45,692
I won't fall for the same trick again.

103
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:49,971
Keep an eye on her

104
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:51,331
until she leaves.

105
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:52,452
Okay, Mr. Yi.

106
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:53,211
Okay, Mr. Yi.

107
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:54,651
Let's go.

108
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,132
I can walk by myself.

109
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:57,612
Hurry up. Go.

110
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:00,612
Move quickly.

111
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:02,452
I really can walk.

112
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,052
Could you please not be so nervous?

113
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:05,492
Hurry up.

114
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:06,771
I'll go right away.

115
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:30,971
Why are you here?

116
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:31,771
I found Yi Zihe

117
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:32,971
was in a relationship
with the female TA from the orphanage.

118
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:34,211
They caught me
when I was following them.

119
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:35,252
Yi Zihe is also here.

120
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:37,012
It seems he has made a move
on the client I had an appointment with.

121
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:38,771
No wonder you showed up here.

122
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:43,052
Seize the opportunity and slip away.

123
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:45,531
With so many people here,
how can we slip away?

124
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:14,331
I've called the police.

125
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:15,651
It's not too late for you to run away.

126
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:18,012
Let's go.

127
00:07:24,932 --> 00:07:25,651
You're injured.

128
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:27,812
It's nothing.

129
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:29,291
Yi Zihe has got a step ahead of us.

130
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:30,171
We need to hurry.

131
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,252
Let's go to the hospital first.

132
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:32,252
The matter at hand is urgent.

133
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,252
You go back first. Let's go.

134
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:33,971
Okay.

135
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:37,331
Come on, cheers.

136
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:45,331
Mr. Lu, Ms. Yao,

137
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:47,971
Mr. Yi arrived earlier than you.

138
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:49,171
He is very straightforward.

139
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:52,091
He bought my goods at a higher price.

140
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:53,612
Mr. Wang,

141
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:55,572
you promised to negotiate with us first.

142
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:57,252
It doesn't matter

143
00:07:57,252 --> 00:07:58,731
to whom I sell the goods.

144
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:00,851
Mr. Yi already paid in full.

145
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,851
I think you'd better go to someone else.

146
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:06,651
Mr. Wang,

147
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:08,252
my bodyguard was negligent,

148
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:10,531
allowing uninvited guests
to spoil the mood.

149
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:12,091
Let's go somewhere else.

150
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:13,012
Alright.

151
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:14,771
It's all at your disposal.

152
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:16,812
Okay.

153
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:26,572
You lost this time.

154
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:54,811
Do you realize because of the minutes
you delayed,

155
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:56,012
Mr. Wang, whom I struggled
to get in contact with,

156
00:08:56,171 --> 00:08:57,492
was intercepted by Yi Zihe?

157
00:08:57,732 --> 00:08:58,612
You did it on purpose, right?

158
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,771
I've figured out who sold the drawings.

159
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:02,132
I'll find a way
to make her come forward.

160
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,051
As long as the public knows
it was Yihua playing dirty,

161
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:05,411
we still have a chance
to turn things around.

162
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:06,732
Yi Zihe has discovered you.

163
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:07,732
You don't stand a chance.

164
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:09,012
Go back and rest.

165
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:10,691
I had Qin Xun keep an eye
on the witness.

166
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:11,771
We still have a chance.

167
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:13,411
No need for you to make matters worse.

168
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,171
I'll take you to the hospital first.

169
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:28,012
Where are you?

170
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:28,771
I'll come over right away.

171
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:34,811
Where is the female TA?

172
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:36,892
Before you came,

173
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:37,852
Yi Zihe gave her

174
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:39,372
a large sum of break-up fee.

175
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:01,651
Minde made a strong comeback.

176
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,051
To embarrass the Yi family,

177
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:05,451
I thought there would be
a very big move.

178
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:09,451
But it turned out that he just went
for a drink with Mr. Liu.

179
00:10:10,252 --> 00:10:12,852
Minde has never been one
to do anything ruthless.

180
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:15,411
After seven years of influence,

181
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:18,732
he just played the drunkard
to disgust us

182
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:22,012
and was truly useless against outsiders.

183
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:30,252
You are a son
who defies me in everything.

184
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:31,972
Back then, you insisted on marrying

185
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,852
this woman of no value to the Yi family.

186
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:37,132
You even went so far
as to give up on the Yi family

187
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:38,892
to help Lu Mingyu.

188
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:41,651
Seven years have passed,

189
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:45,212
and now you're helping outsiders
undermine Yihua.

190
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:49,171
You're truly incorrigible!

191
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:55,691
Now leave with nothing but yourself.

192
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:41,492
Let's go.

193
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:05,291
It's still not too late
to sacrifice Bu Ran.

194
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:07,132
As long as it's revealed
that she's from the Yi family,

195
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:08,691
the tables could turn in no time.

196
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:17,411
I wanted to catch you before you leave

197
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,691
to say thank you.

198
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,612
Thanks for protecting me.

199
00:12:21,092 --> 00:12:23,051
You were harsh with me
because of Mr. Liu.

200
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:24,732
I understand it all now.

201
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:26,852
I won't be a burden to you anymore.

202
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:27,892
I promise.

203
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,811
You'd better keep your word.

204
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:32,451
Or I'll drive you out from next door.

205
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,732
I will do it.

206
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:35,892
How is your hand?

207
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:41,372
Wish you recover soon.

208
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:44,252
Same here.

209
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:47,612
We haven't lost yet, have we?

210
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:49,571
What nonsense are you talking about?

211
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:51,372
You're not awake yet? I'm leaving.

212
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:52,132
Wait a second.

213
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:57,051
For you.

214
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:06,332
Keep it up!

215
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,012
(No way.)

216
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:36,651
Dad.

217
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:39,212
Ran,

218
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:41,571
you should be at work at this hour.

219
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:43,852
You have time to call me.

220
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:45,372
Is it because the plan didn't go well?

221
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:47,612
Yi Zihe is one step ahead of me.

222
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:49,931
I lost my key witness
to the leak of the drawings.

223
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,892
And still, no one is willing
to provide the building materials.

224
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:55,372
I want to give Mr. Lu a helping hand.

225
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:56,732
Can you give me some advice?

226
00:13:57,892 --> 00:13:59,732
Based on my understanding of Lu Cenyang,

227
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:01,811
he must have a backup plan.

228
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:03,811
You've already done what you should.

229
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:06,411
Now it's better to just watch quietly.

230
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:07,892
Dad,

231
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,931
what I need now is a way
to turn things around.

232
00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:12,451
Maybe I can only...

233
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,332
You know, it's not that there is no way.

234
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,492
But you need to be calm enough

235
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:20,132
to come up with a story for your grandma

236
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:22,571
that Lu Cenyang is full of schemes.

237
00:14:30,051 --> 00:14:30,732
Grandma,

238
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:32,451
you're still in the mood to take photos?

239
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:34,492
The last time I wanted to see you,

240
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:35,531
you refused.

241
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:38,531
Why are you coming to me today?

242
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:41,212
Yi Zihe has fallen
for Lu Cenyang's scheme.

243
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:42,972
Grandma, think carefully about it.

244
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:44,651
How did Lu Cenyang use Taylor to plot

245
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:45,972
against Uncle and the others?

246
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:47,212
Can he be defeated

247
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:48,492
so easily?

248
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:50,332
Last night,

249
00:14:50,492 --> 00:14:52,651
Mr. Wang, whom Lu Cenyang
desperately curried favor with,

250
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:54,691
was intercepted by Zihe.

251
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:56,892
He's doomed to lose.

252
00:14:57,332 --> 00:15:00,732
Are you here to tell me
it was all intentional?

253
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:04,092
Exactly.

254
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:06,171
The renovation of the orphanage
is using my proposal.

255
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:08,171
I chose to use
second-hand building materials

256
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:10,492
because the budget
for the orphanage renovation is tight.

257
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:12,171
But Lu Cenyang deliberately switched

258
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:14,092
to the expensive eco-friendly
building materials.

259
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:17,332
Everything is the most expensive
and the most eco-friendly.

260
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,612
He just figured Yihua would make a move

261
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:21,291
so that Yihua and the suppliers

262
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:22,612
would take in the most expensive goods.

263
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:24,492
But he wanted to use this tactic

264
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:27,411
to make you feel financially strained
due to stockpiling.

265
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:30,931
It's really ridiculous.

266
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:33,411
Yihua has so many residential projects

267
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:37,132
geared for high-end fine decoration
in the future.

268
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:39,531
How could we not be able
to make use of them?

269
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:41,811
Yihua uses the top-tier fine decoration,

270
00:15:42,012 --> 00:15:43,931
so the price will inevitably rise.

271
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:44,571
At this time,

272
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:47,132
Lu Cenyang will utilize
Pinshang's design advantages

273
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:50,092
to engage in a price war with Yihua
in the future housing projects

274
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:51,612
with high cost-performance ratio

275
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:54,492
and defeat Yihua
with their original pricing advantage.

276
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:55,931
This is his plan.

277
00:15:58,132 --> 00:16:00,771
I never place my bets
on only one possibility.

278
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:03,651
If your information is incorrect,

279
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:07,972
think about the consequences
for yourself.

280
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:14,531
If Uncle and Zihe

281
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,051
truly possess exceptional abilities,

282
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,252
you would not have allowed me

283
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:20,612
to stay by Lu Cenyang's side
after I rejected you.

284
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:21,892
Grandma,

285
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:23,332
Lu Cenyang is doing all this

286
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:25,291
to confuse our Yi family

287
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:26,931
so that Zihe will foolishly

288
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:28,531
take in the goods

289
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:29,931
from the suppliers.

290
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:32,212
Once he has really purchased them
one by one,

291
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:33,852
Lu Cenyang will take action.

292
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:35,571
It will be too late for us to regret it.

293
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:38,132
It's not yet too late to make Zihe

294
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,132
pull back from the brink.

295
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:01,972
What's wrong, Grandma?

296
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:06,171
One's heartbeat quickens
when they are nervous.

297
00:17:07,772 --> 00:17:09,052
I came here by bike.

298
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:10,852
I want to know

299
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:12,852
how you

300
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,372
gained Lu Cenyang's trust
in such a short time.

301
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:20,572
As soon as there was news

302
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,651
online that the drawings
were leaked by a designer,

303
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:24,612
people in the company seriously

304
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:26,011
conducted an investigation on me.

305
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:27,211
But, Grandma, have you heard

306
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:28,772
the news of my dismissal?

307
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,011
Moreover,

308
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:32,132
Zihe's bodyguard gave me a hard time.

309
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:34,931
Lu Cenyang got injured
trying to protect me.

310
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,171
If all these still
do not clarify the issue,

311
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:38,651
Grandma, please think about it.

312
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:40,132
If Lu Cenyang wants
to thoroughly investigate

313
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:41,852
the identity of Yi Zihe's subordinates,

314
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,532
isn't that a matter of minutes?

315
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:45,052
Why didn't he call the police?

316
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:47,332
Because he doesn't want
to disrupt the plan.

317
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:03,812
Lu Cenyang has done a lot for you.

318
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:14,772
A young and promising boss
doing all these for you.

319
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:16,971
You must be moved.

320
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:20,211
When a woman is moved,

321
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,491
she tends to be emotionally driven.

322
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:27,532
So that's why you came to me
and said so much.

323
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:30,892
You want me to interrupt Zihe
and their actions.

324
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:34,931
I wanted to be more cautious.

325
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,892
But you came to me.

326
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:41,332
It seems Lu Cenyang
has run out of tricks

327
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:43,971
and has no power to fight back.

328
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:46,691
No, Grandma.

329
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:47,852
Well,

330
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:51,171
instead of worrying
about Lu Cenyang and Pinshang,

331
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:54,332
you might as well be concerned
about your parents.

332
00:18:54,812 --> 00:18:56,931
I've driven them out of the Yi family.

333
00:18:57,532 --> 00:19:00,132
I don't know
where they are wandering now.

334
00:19:00,411 --> 00:19:01,852
Find them

335
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:04,332
and give them some money.

336
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,772
Mom, where have you and Dad moved to?

337
00:19:17,931 --> 00:19:19,572
Okay, I'll go to see you now.

338
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:25,491
Ms. Hua, shall we back to the company?

339
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:27,092
No.

340
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:33,772
(Lu Cenyang)

341
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,532
(Bu Ran fancied herself clever
and has done you in.)

342
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:37,011
(Are you still going
to be soft-hearted?)

343
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,731
(Bu Ran was self-sentimental and caused
you harm. Are you still soft-hearted?)

344
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:41,612
(I will think about this.)

345
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:42,451
(Follow Bu Ran)

346
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:43,691
(and find the whereabouts of Yi Minde.)

347
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:47,211
Uncle Li, you've heard everything.

348
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:49,772
Do you think I should
still be soft-hearted?

349
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:51,852
How did Bu Ran know

350
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:53,332
your scheme so clearly?

351
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:55,772
Could it be that she really installed
listening devices?

352
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:57,211
It doesn't matter.

353
00:19:58,372 --> 00:20:00,052
Fortunately, Ms. Hua
doesn't believe her.

354
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:01,491
That's good.

355
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:03,332
This time,

356
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:06,171
let Yihua taste the pain
the Lu family once endured.

357
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:23,211
If she passes the message,
will Ms. Hua believe it?

358
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:24,691
This time, Yihua

359
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,812
has already stepped one foot
into my trap.

360
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:30,092
If Ms. Hua believes what Kerry says

361
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:31,812
and asks Yi Zihe to stop,

362
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:34,971
Yihua is lucky to survive this time.

363
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:37,612
(I chose second-hand materials.)

364
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:39,292
(Lu Cenyang deliberately switched)

365
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,052
(to the expensive eco-friendly
building materials.)

366
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:42,691
(So that Yihua and the suppliers)

367
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:44,171
(would take in
the most expensive goods.)

368
00:20:47,132 --> 00:20:47,772
Speak.

369
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:48,651
Ms. Hua,

370
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:50,532
I heard Mr. Lu
and the gardener of their company

371
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:52,092
discussing their next move.

372
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:55,332
It seems his current passivity
is all a pretense.

373
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:58,011
Mr. Lu will soon take his next step.

374
00:20:58,292 --> 00:20:59,292
You must be careful.

375
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:02,612
Gardener? Pretense?

376
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:04,971
Is your information accurate?

377
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:07,171
Mr. Lu has an unusual relationship
with this gardener.

378
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,372
I will send you some photos
of the gardener.

379
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:10,971
Please take a look
and see if you recognize this person.

380
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:18,532
(Isn't this Mr. Li,)

381
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,451
(Lu Mingyu's most trusted assistant?)

382
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:22,372
(There has been no news from him.)

383
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:24,852
(So he's been working
as a counsellor for Lu Cenyang.)

384
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:29,532
What did that gardener say?

385
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:30,772
He said

386
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:33,971
they would let you taste

387
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,651
the pain the Lu family once endured.

388
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:40,612
Ms. Sun,

389
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:42,171
let's go back to the company now.

390
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:43,052
Okay.

391
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:03,052
Fortunately, I saved some money.

392
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:05,292
I've made all the necessary purchases.

393
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:07,651
It's enough for us to settle down here.

394
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:10,411
From now on,

395
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:12,572
you might

396
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:14,772
have to live through
some tough times here with me.

397
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:19,612
Why would we live through tough times?

398
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,292
Do you think I liked living in a villa?

399
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:23,772
This place is so nice.

400
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,532
Ran will help us
improve it further later.

401
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,211
It will become more and more enviable
the longer we live here.

402
00:22:30,612 --> 00:22:31,931
The sound insulation here is not good.

403
00:22:32,132 --> 00:22:34,011
Keep your voices down
when you talk about me next time.

404
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:35,892
It can be heard in the courtyard.

405
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:38,892
Do we need to whisper
when we talk about you?

406
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:40,931
Come on, just in time
to give your dad a hand.

407
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:41,892
Okay.

408
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:44,011
What happened to your hand?

409
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:45,171
It's nothing, just got a bit burned.

410
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:47,011
She's always so careless.

411
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,691
Come over here
and help me move the shelf.

412
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:51,852
Be careful.

413
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,132
Turn the corner.

414
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:57,892
You didn't tell me
my grandma kicked you out.

415
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,651
Are you afraid I would cry?

416
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,052
Not at all.

417
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:03,132
You can escape

418
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:05,211
from the Yi family, a place like a cage.

419
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,772
I'm too happy to feel anything else.

420
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:09,292
Your dad

421
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:11,332
is worried about affecting your work.

422
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:15,931
As if I have anything left
to be affected.

423
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:18,772
Dad,

424
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:20,532
I went to see my grandma.

425
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:22,251
But I didn't handle it well.

426
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:24,132
I actually made things worse.

427
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:26,011
I might even lose my job.

428
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:33,052
Mr. Lu,

429
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,731
after arriving at the location,
go through the tea garden.

430
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:36,132
Then you'll reach Yi Minde's home.

431
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:38,092
My daughter,

432
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:40,052
regardless,

433
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:42,532
we still think very highly of you.

434
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,171
Leave no regrets.

435
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:45,211
Look on the bright side.

436
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:50,691
How could there be no regrets?

437
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:53,372
It's ending just as it was beginning.

438
00:23:56,572 --> 00:23:58,852
I really want to contribute to Pinshang.

439
00:23:59,052 --> 00:24:00,812
I also really want
to build a dreamed house

440
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:02,251
for the children in the orphanage.

441
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:04,572
But now

442
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,332
it's all ruined because of me.

443
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:08,931
I...

444
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:17,504
(Director Chen)

445
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:21,171
Hello.

446
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:25,852
Please have some tea.

447
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:29,451
Director,

448
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,372
as soon as I heard Mr. Lu was concerned
about building materials,

449
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:33,892
I came over immediately.

450
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:37,772
Yihua sincerely wants to help

451
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,052
renovate the orphanage.

452
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:41,491
To my knowledge,

453
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:43,292
Yihua has nearly invested
all the cash flow

454
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:45,211
in purchasing building materials.

455
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:47,651
In order to show your charitable spirit,

456
00:24:47,892 --> 00:24:49,132
you have been truly generous.

457
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:50,292
It's admirable indeed.

458
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:54,451
There have always been
many rumors about Yihua.

459
00:24:55,052 --> 00:24:56,931
Mr. Lu, you needn't take them seriously.

460
00:24:58,092 --> 00:25:00,731
I can't do this for years at my age.

461
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:03,092
I want to do more good things

462
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:07,052
while I can.

463
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:09,092
Of course, I am willing
to give you the opportunity.

464
00:25:09,612 --> 00:25:11,892
You may kindly sponsor
the building materials,

465
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:14,092
but you must not interfere
with the construction.

466
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:15,651
If in the future,

467
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:17,612
Yihua wishes to advertise for itself

468
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:19,211
since it has provided
new eco-friendly building materials

469
00:25:19,372 --> 00:25:21,332
in the renovation of the orphanage,

470
00:25:21,572 --> 00:25:22,411
you are free to do it.

471
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,931
Mr. Lu, you really have
a careful scheme.

472
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,332
However we advertise,

473
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:31,931
it ultimately promotes Pinshang.

474
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:34,931
I'm too old to see everything clearly.

475
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:39,092
I don't like making
"wedding dresses" for others.

476
00:25:40,812 --> 00:25:42,292
Yihua provides building materials.

477
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:44,691
Naturally, supervision
must be exercised.

478
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:46,812
Director,

479
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,651
the quality control

480
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:52,332
and schedule of the project
can be ensured by our supervision.

481
00:25:54,092 --> 00:25:55,052
Sorry, Ms. Hua.

482
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:57,892
The renovation
has been authorized to Mr. Lu.

483
00:25:58,931 --> 00:26:00,251
It's up to him to decide.

484
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:03,612
Mr. Lu,

485
00:26:04,451 --> 00:26:05,971
the materials will be delivered to you.

486
00:26:06,211 --> 00:26:08,532
If you don't want them
and delay the start of work,

487
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:11,532
when the Charity Federation
asks about it,

488
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:14,892
it will be a shame for you.

489
00:26:16,572 --> 00:26:18,011
Mr. Yi

490
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:19,971
toyed with a TA at the Welfare Center.

491
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:21,772
I guess the Charity Federation
won't mind

492
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:24,251
that we're just starting
a few days late.

493
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:29,731
Young people date and break up
on good terms.

494
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:32,171
She got a decent break-up fee.

495
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:34,372
What's there to fuss about?

496
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:38,092
It was my employee who stole the design

497
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:39,731
and framed the designer.

498
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:41,852
The facts are clear.

499
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:45,772
Even if I get fired because of this,

500
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,251
I must give the designer
and Pinshang justice.

501
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:55,372
Director,

502
00:26:56,572 --> 00:26:58,092
if there's any misunderstanding,

503
00:26:58,532 --> 00:27:00,292
I am willing
to fully cooperate with Mr. Lu

504
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:01,971
to express my apologies.

505
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:07,411
Mr. Lu, let's do as you wish.

506
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,772
Everything prioritizes starting on time.

507
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:12,892
Thank you for your cooperation, Ms. Hua.

508
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:26,251
(My grandma has come
to the Welfare Center.)

509
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:28,292
(It seems...)

510
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:54,852
Why aren't you going in?

511
00:27:57,491 --> 00:27:59,211
Did Yihua really win?

512
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:09,251
I'm sorry.

513
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:11,132
I really wanted to help do something.

514
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:12,132
I didn't listen to you.

515
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:13,852
I was presumptuous
and made things worse.

516
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:14,931
I fancied myself clever
and have harmed you.

517
00:28:15,092 --> 00:28:16,211
I didn't expect things to come

518
00:28:16,332 --> 00:28:17,892
to an uncontrollable point.

519
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,612
I'm too ashamed to see you.

520
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,572
Are you playing
the distressed strategy with me?

521
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:24,892
I'm not.

522
00:28:25,052 --> 00:28:26,532
I truly wanted to help.

523
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:29,372
I know whatever I say is useless.

524
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,491
However you punish me is fine.

525
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:32,852
Even if you have to fire me,

526
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:37,292
I accept it.

527
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:39,572
You said it.

528
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:40,852
As you wish.

529
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:01,171
Well, why are you crying?

530
00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:04,372
I promised to perform magic
for the children

531
00:29:04,892 --> 00:29:06,612
and to build them a new home.

532
00:29:08,411 --> 00:29:11,292
I can't do it now.

533
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:40,171
Your eyes are like a sprinkler truck.

534
00:29:40,971 --> 00:29:42,092
Have you never cried before?

535
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:52,451
Every time I'm especially unlucky,

536
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,651
you get to see my awkward look.

537
00:29:55,892 --> 00:29:57,491
I didn't come to show concern for you.

538
00:29:57,971 --> 00:29:59,572
The director of the orphanage called me,

539
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,931
saying that Hua Lan from Yihua

540
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:02,612
was willing
to provide building materials.

541
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:04,372
We met her at the orphanage.

542
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:05,892
Now, everything has been settled.

543
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:07,772
Really?

544
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,132
You're not just saying that
to comfort me, are you?

545
00:30:13,171 --> 00:30:14,812
Everything I said just now counts.

546
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:16,892
If you're truly in a difficult position,

547
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:18,812
don't worry about my face.

548
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:20,411
Put all the blame on me.

549
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:22,612
I'll take on even the biggest blame.

550
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:25,011
With that slender frame of yours,
what blame can you take?

551
00:30:25,651 --> 00:30:27,411
You have so little faith
in my crisis management skills?

552
00:30:27,532 --> 00:30:29,372
Believe it or not, I'll punish you
to sweep the company floors for a year.

553
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:33,332
Do you mean

554
00:30:34,011 --> 00:30:35,612
that I can continue
to stay in the company?

555
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:38,132
When did I ever say I would fire you?
