31
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:37,964

Brother, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:47,524
I shouldn't have provoked Yi Zihe.

35
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:53,644
That dickhead Yi Zihe.

36
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:55,283
I'm going to have him arrested.

37
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:56,244
Don't.

38
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:57,163
Don't, big brother.

39
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:58,044
No police.

40
00:02:58,204 --> 00:03:00,044
Yi Zihe has my videos on his phone.

41
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:02,163
Don't call the police.
Don't call the police.

42

As long as you're here,

45
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:06,764
I will get through any difficulty.

46
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,524
I was being capricious.

47
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:14,723
It was my fault.

48
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:18,403
It's my dereliction of duty.

49
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:20,403
You just got well.

50
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:23,124
I should have paid
more attention to you.

00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:30,524
I don't want to close my eyes.

54
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,124
I want to keep looking at you.

55
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:37,084
Brother.

56
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:40,124
You won't leave me alone, will you?

57
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:44,644
I won't.

58
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:49,524
Forget about these things

59
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:51,084
and have a good sleep.

60
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:09,884
Since you're going to marry
this woman from the Yi family,

61
00:05:10,324 --> 00:05:12,084
I will also accept Yi Zihe's pursuit.

62
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:13,764
Don't worry.

63
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:15,524
Your sister will not be with Yi Zihe.

to your email.

69

be transferred to your account.

70

that she was just angry.

not only make one irrational

81
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,483
but also bring insecurity,

146

157
00:12:58,284 --> 00:12:59,523

00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:31,404
I just made for you.

216

I...

220
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:44,043
What happened?

221
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:45,604
Your head hurts?

222
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:49,964
It's nothing.

223
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:51,763
Big brother.

224
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:54,523
I know that I was rash about this.

225
00:19:56,204 --> 00:19:57,003
But Yi Zihe,

226
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:58,003
he just has to see

227
00:19:58,124 --> 00:19:59,964
you in pain over your breakup
with Bu Ran

228
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:01,563
to find his psychological balance.

229
00:20:03,124 --> 00:20:06,404
Bu Ran is stronger than you think.

230
00:20:07,043 --> 00:20:08,684
But the video in Yi Zihe's hands

231
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:11,124
is devastating to me.

232
00:20:12,563 --> 00:20:13,124
Big brother.

233
00:20:13,604 --> 00:20:15,043
Don't go looking for him proactively.

234
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:17,604
Let's just let this go.

235
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:18,844
Okay?

236
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:46,283
Look.

237
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:47,483
What should we do?

238
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:15,404
Mom.

239
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:17,964
What's for lunch? I'm hungry.

240
00:21:18,283 --> 00:21:18,924
I...

241
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:20,323
Huiyun.

242
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:21,604
Go and check if lunch is ready.

243
00:21:21,723 --> 00:21:22,483
Okay.

244
00:21:25,444 --> 00:21:27,043
Baby girl, your mom

245
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:28,803
has prepared your favorites for you.

246
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:31,964
I'll tidy up

247
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:33,283
and let's eat.

248
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:45,283
Come quickly.

249
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:48,043
Our Ran likes it sweet,

250
00:21:48,204 --> 00:21:50,083
so I've added extra sugar to the dish.

251
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:51,164
Make a soup.

252
00:21:51,563 --> 00:21:52,563
Our daughter loves soup.

253
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:53,323
Alright.

254
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,644
Your father went to buy the meat
from the market this morning.

255
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:12,844
It's very fresh. Try it.

256
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:13,844
Sweet and sour pork loin.

257
00:22:19,844 --> 00:22:21,844
Dig in. Clean the plate.

258
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:23,684
Okay, got it.

259
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:25,124
Auntie, I'm hungry today.

260
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:25,763
I want more.

261
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:26,444
Sure.

262
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:44,924
Ran.

263
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:46,444
Let's eat.

264
00:23:09,444 --> 00:23:10,003
Dad.

265
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:11,844
I've completely let go.

266
00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:13,043
You don't have

267
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:15,043
to watch over me like I am
a protected animal.

268
00:23:15,723 --> 00:23:16,204
Okay.

269
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:20,924
I plan to register a studio

270
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:23,003
and start by taking on
some design work at home.

271
00:23:23,523 --> 00:23:24,243
Sounds good.

272
00:23:26,523 --> 00:23:28,043
A few of our neighbors here

273
00:23:28,164 --> 00:23:29,483
actually want to renovate their places.

274
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:32,003
They heard that you were
an interior designer and are

275
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:33,164
eager to let you help.

276
00:23:33,283 --> 00:23:34,844
Sure, you can introduce me to them.

277
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:37,043
I'll try to get all of the projects.

278
00:23:37,164 --> 00:23:37,723
Great.

279
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,083
Then there's no problem at all.

280
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:16,204
Uncle.

281
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:18,604
Is Bu Ran feeling any better?

282
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:20,204
She broke up.

283
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:23,204
She won't be okay
just because she says so.

284
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:26,083
I got her some business
from our neighbor

285
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:27,323
to keep her busy for now.

286
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:28,444
As a result,

287
00:24:30,404 --> 00:24:32,644
she turned the bedroom into a studio.

288
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:34,003
She's busy until late every day.

289
00:24:35,444 --> 00:24:37,884
I think she's numbing herself.

290
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:39,924
Has Lu Cenyang contacted Bu Ran?

291
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:41,763
Even if Cenyang contacts her,

292
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:43,323
it's no use now.

293
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:45,844
It was Ran who initiated the breakup.

294
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:49,164
I think he is also
in a difficult position.

295
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:51,803
Better to rip off the band-aid now.

296
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:53,164
Uncle.

297
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:54,844
Take good care of Bu Ran.

298
00:24:55,283 --> 00:24:56,523
I've been a bit busy.

299
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,563
She still has two boxes of stuff here.

300
00:24:58,803 --> 00:25:00,243
I'll get them to her later.

301
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:01,763
I'll come over and cheer her up.

302
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:02,964
Trust me.

303
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:04,684
Bu Ran will definitely get better.

304
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:05,684
Okay.

305
00:25:07,204 --> 00:25:08,204
I have to go now, Uncle.

306

00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:33,364
Come in.

310
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:37,164
I bought a new cup

311
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:38,364
to change the mood.

312
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,364
I also got one for you.

313
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:42,964
It's time to change your cup too.

314
00:25:43,364 --> 00:25:45,404
My cup was gilded by Bu Ran.

315
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:46,444
It's special.

316
00:25:46,884 --> 00:25:47,644
So no, thanks.

317
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:49,404
You two have already broken up.

318
00:25:49,723 --> 00:25:51,283
Why keep your ex-girlfriend's things?

319
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,604
You can use my cup for tea

320
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:00,924
and hers for water.

321
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:02,723
On a single desk,

322
00:26:03,124 --> 00:26:04,684
there's room for two cups.

323
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,204
No need.

324
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:08,884
I'm used to using one cup for water.

325
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:13,803
Is your headache gone?

326
00:26:14,604 --> 00:26:15,404
What did you need?

327
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:17,404
I'm much better.

328
00:26:17,884 --> 00:26:18,684
For the Ancient Alley,

329
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,483
I've assigned another
colleague on point.

330
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:22,003
The handover went smoothly.

331
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:24,563
In the final stages,

332
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:26,164
I expect everyone can give it their all.

333
00:26:26,364 --> 00:26:28,803
There's a current push to build
high-quality and beautiful villages.

334
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:30,884
The government expects highly
for the Ancient Alley

335
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:31,684
Renovation.

336
00:26:31,844 --> 00:26:32,803
We have to perform well

337
00:26:32,964 --> 00:26:34,204
for the citizens

338
00:26:34,404 --> 00:26:36,164
and meet everyone's
expectations of Pinshang.

339
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:42,644
Hello?

340
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:47,483
The site has been shut down?

341
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:49,723
Okay, I'll look into the situation.

342
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:54,604
Hello.

343
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:56,844
The number you've dialed
is currently in a call.

344
00:26:57,124 --> 00:26:58,523
Please try again later.

345
00:26:58,523 --> 00:27:00,064
(Mr. Hu)

346
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:04,483
The number you've dialed
has been powered off.

347
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:07,964
What happened at the site?

348
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:11,684
There's a problem
with the supplier Mr. Hu.

349
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:13,083
Someone made a report

350
00:27:13,444 --> 00:27:14,884
that some of the old wooden parts

351
00:27:15,043 --> 00:27:17,364
used for the project were taken down
from remote protected buildings.

352
00:27:17,684 --> 00:27:19,563
But the Engineering Depts have checked

353
00:27:20,003 --> 00:27:22,164
the procurement route
of the old wooden pieces from Mr. Hu.

354
00:27:22,444 --> 00:27:23,723
How could there be a problem?

355
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:26,364
It must be someone who is very
familiar with this project,

356
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:27,763
and they are setting us up.

357
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,803
Mr. Hu was recommended by Bu Ran.

358
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:32,364
Is it...

359
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:33,204
It can't be her.

360
00:27:34,323 --> 00:27:35,283
The opponent this time

361
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:37,604
must be a ruthless person
who knows us well.

362
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:40,763
I'm going to the government

363
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:42,563
and report the situation to them.

364
00:27:42,803 --> 00:27:43,684
Before I return,

365
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:45,444
you and the PR Dept.
must monitor the situation

366
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,723
and not let the news spread.

367
00:27:46,884 --> 00:27:47,644
I'm on it.

368
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:49,563
Brother, let me go with you.

369
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:52,003
I'm the chief designer and the presenter

370
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:53,243
of this project.

371
00:27:53,364 --> 00:27:54,003
Don't.

372
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:55,283
You haven't fully recovered.

373
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:56,523
Holding down the fort here

374
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:58,003
would be the biggest help to me.

375
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:06,644
Mr. Hu, purchased several

376
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:09,283
protected buildings in remote areas
for his collection,

377
00:28:09,763 --> 00:28:10,844
and I've reported it.

378
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:12,924
Chen Manni's design works abroad

379
00:28:13,164 --> 00:28:14,243
have been accused of plagiarism.

380
00:28:14,644 --> 00:28:17,364
Both the supplier and designer
are facing issues simultaneously,

381
00:28:17,884 --> 00:28:20,124
the imminent completion of Pinshang's
Ancient Alley Renovation

382
00:28:20,404 --> 00:28:21,964
is likely to go from one to zero.

383
00:28:32,604 --> 00:28:33,604
You're Qin Xun, right?

384
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:36,364
You wanted to see me?

385
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:38,644
I don't think we have any common topic.

386
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:41,884
You are clever and tactful,

387
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:44,124
yet you never focus on proper business.

388
00:28:44,884 --> 00:28:47,924
We know who you're doing it for.

389
00:28:50,723 --> 00:28:52,204
Ms. Hua, are you trying to buy me over

390
00:28:52,924 --> 00:28:53,884
or threaten me?

391
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,604
I'm here to persuade you.

392
00:29:05,803 --> 00:29:07,243
People who act on emotions

393
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:11,043
usually don't end up well.

394
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:12,283
Take Bu Ran, for example.

395
00:29:13,164 --> 00:29:16,844
Sooner or later, she will be
beaten and battered by Lu Cenyang.

396
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,364
Because there's Lu Siqi

397
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:21,723
who is persistent
and he can't shake her off.

398
00:29:22,124 --> 00:29:24,604
You can't get your father's love back.

399
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:26,204
But you like Bu Ran.

400
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:30,043
That I can try to fight for you,

401
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,723
if you cooperate with me.

402
00:29:33,444 --> 00:29:35,283
So you're looking for a pawn.

403
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:39,164
You're directly linked
to my father's death.

404
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:41,604
What makes you think
that I would join forces with you?

405
00:29:42,124 --> 00:29:43,083
If we join forces,

406
00:29:43,723 --> 00:29:45,243
at least I can promise you

407
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:49,364
that I won't be suppressing Bu Ran

408
00:29:50,043 --> 00:29:54,523
and I can help you to quickly become
a formidable match for Lu Cenyang.

409
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,404
You didn't disappoint me.

410
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,003
What reward do you want?

411
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:05,523
Severe punishment for Yi Zihe.

412
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:09,323
I want anyone who hurts Bu Ran

413
00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:11,964
to receive the heaviest punishment

414
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,964
with your help, Ms. Hua.

415
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,844
Including Lu Cenyang?

416
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:21,243
I'll leave now.

417
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:23,523
Qin Xun.

418
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:26,483
As long as you can make Lu Cenyang

419
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:28,124
step down from his undefeated pedestal,

420
00:30:28,924 --> 00:30:31,604
my support for you is unlimited.

421
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:36,844
If you don't disappoint me,

422
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:39,124
I will not disappoint you.

423
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:27,483
Qin Xun.

424
00:31:27,604 --> 00:31:28,364
Come in quickly.

425
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:29,243
Morning, Auntie.

426
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:30,043
Come in.

427
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,364
These are two boxes of Bu Ran's stuff,

428
00:31:34,604 --> 00:31:36,204
all design models from her clients.

429
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:37,323
They are her treasure.

430
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,723
I couldn't trust the moving company.

431
00:31:41,003 --> 00:31:42,323
Sorry to trouble you with another trip.

432
00:31:43,604 --> 00:31:44,604
Have you had breakfast?

433
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:46,364
I've just made some soy milk.

434
00:31:46,924 --> 00:31:47,644
I'll take one.

435
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:48,404
Sure.

436
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:49,243
Thank you, Ms. Bu.

437
00:31:49,404 --> 00:31:50,124
Where's Bu Ran?

438
00:31:50,964 --> 00:31:51,763
She's still sleeping.

439
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:52,884
I'll wake her up in a bit.

440
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:55,164
No, let her sleep a bit more.

441
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:56,924
Here.

442
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:57,644
Thanks, Auntie.

443
00:32:05,964 --> 00:32:07,283
How is she doing?

444
00:32:08,323 --> 00:32:09,604
Since she came back,

445
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:10,964
although she acts

446
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:12,204
as if nothing's wrong,

447
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:13,723
I can tell

448
00:32:14,243 --> 00:32:15,884
she can't bear to let go
nor can she move on.

449
00:32:16,323 --> 00:32:18,723
So she keeps herself busy with work

450
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,243
to distract herself.

451
00:32:20,844 --> 00:32:21,763
She just broke up.

452
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:23,323
There's always a process of healing.

453
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:24,644
But rest assured,

454
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,444
as long as she starts designing,

455
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:27,924
she will be able to shift her attention

456
00:32:28,043 --> 00:32:28,803
and adjust her mood.

457
00:32:28,924 --> 00:32:30,164
It's good to be busy.

458
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:31,444
Don't worry.

459
00:32:31,723 --> 00:32:33,483
Ran is lucky to have

460
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:35,243
a friend like you.

461
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:37,924
All these years, no matter what happens,

462
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:41,444
you've always stood firmly by her side.

463
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:46,204
Qin Xun is here.

464
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:47,164
Uncle.

465
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:50,364
Stay for lunch later.

466
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:51,364
No, thanks, Uncle.

467
00:32:51,523 --> 00:32:52,644
I have a lot to do.

468
00:32:53,124 --> 00:32:54,243
To keep an eye on Zi He, right?

469
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:56,924
Qin Xun.

470
00:32:57,844 --> 00:32:59,003
Although Zihe is fickle,

471
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,563
he is very conceited.

472
00:33:00,844 --> 00:33:02,003
He never forces a woman,

473
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:03,604
let alone

474
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:05,523
the sister of Lu Cenyang.

475
00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:07,404
On the surface,

476
00:33:07,844 --> 00:33:09,003
he used Lu Siqi

477
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:11,483
to make Ran break up with Lu Cenyang,

478
00:33:11,844 --> 00:33:13,204
but his cost was even greater.

479
00:33:14,003 --> 00:33:14,684
Perhaps

480
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:16,964
he was also used.

481
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:20,684
Uncle.

482
00:33:21,644 --> 00:33:22,604
I will find out about this.

483
00:33:22,723 --> 00:33:23,483
Rest assured.

484
00:33:24,444 --> 00:33:25,204
I am here.

485
00:33:26,043 --> 00:33:27,723
No one will be able to easily hurt Ran.

486
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,043
I'll take my leave now.

487
00:33:41,283 --> 00:33:42,243
Do you think

488
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:45,283
Qin Xun seems different from before?

489
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:48,444
It's obvious he likes Ran

490
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:51,924
and is concerned about her.

491
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:54,323
Young people will communicate
on their own.

492
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:56,323
We shouldn't meddle.

493
00:33:56,763 --> 00:33:57,723
I'm just worried

494
00:33:58,684 --> 00:34:00,243
that the Yi Family was somehow

495
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:02,444
involved in this.

496
00:34:04,884 --> 00:34:05,364
Who did this?

497
00:34:05,404 --> 00:34:05,884
What is this?

498
00:34:05,964 --> 00:34:06,644
It's all messed up.

499
00:34:06,723 --> 00:34:07,404
We want answers.

500
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:08,203
Exactly.

501
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:09,123
Is anyone in charge?

502
00:34:09,123 --> 00:34:10,163
Look at this!

503
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:12,284
What should we do?

504
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:12,764
That's right.

505
00:34:12,964 --> 00:34:13,563
We want answers.

506
00:34:16,643 --> 00:34:17,364
Give us an answer.

507
00:34:17,364 --> 00:34:18,364
Is there anyone in charge?

508
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:19,244
(Executive Director Qin Xun)

509
00:34:19,244 --> 00:34:20,683
Is there anyone in charge?

510
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:22,444
Right, who is responsible?

511
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:24,483
Call the designer out.

512
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:25,804
Get the Designer out.

513
00:34:28,804 --> 00:34:29,563
(Lu Cenyang)

514
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:30,924
(You can't protect her,)

515
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:32,123
(but I can)

516
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,724
(From now on, the Yi family
will not target Bu Ran,)

517
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:38,364
(but the price is you and Pinshang.)

518
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:43,123
You sealed it off
as if it's a murder scene.

519
00:34:43,284 --> 00:34:44,163
This is so ominous.

520
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:44,804
Exactly.

521
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:46,123
Right? Take a look at it yourselves.

522
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:46,924
It's ridiculous.

523
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,083
How are we going to live here?

524
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:49,123
Where is

525
00:34:49,284 --> 00:34:51,203
the designer who wanted to
retain the original flavor?

526
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:52,043
Let her come out.

527
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,643
Yes, let her come out.

528
00:34:54,003 --> 00:34:56,083
We asked you to use some new materials

529
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:57,123
and make it beautiful.

530
00:34:57,284 --> 00:34:57,683
Right.

531
00:34:57,844 --> 00:34:58,483
You didn't listen.

532
00:34:58,643 --> 00:34:59,203
Exactly.

533
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:00,683
And now this crap happened.

534
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:02,003
What do we do now? What can we do?

535
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:03,844
Everyone, please keep calm.

536
00:35:04,444 --> 00:35:06,364
Mr. Lu is thinking of ways
to resolve this quickly.

537
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,643
Someone is framing Pinshang now.

538
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:09,364
Oh, come on.

539
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:10,924
Always making excuses
when things happen.

540
00:35:11,123 --> 00:35:12,364
You're clearly fooling us.

541
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:12,724
Right.

542
00:35:12,804 --> 00:35:13,804
Do you think we'll buy it?

543
00:35:13,924 --> 00:35:15,083
No, no, that's not it.

544
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:17,003
There's been a misunderstanding.
Calm down.

545
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,003
That's not it.

546
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,043
The alley was about to be completed.

547
00:35:20,324 --> 00:35:21,603
Everyone can see the quality.

548
00:35:21,844 --> 00:35:23,483
Pinshang wouldn't cheat everyone.

549
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:24,284
Enough.

550
00:35:24,444 --> 00:35:25,764
I could tell when we were drinking

551
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,483
that Mr. Lu was not reliable at all.

552
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:28,003
Exactly.

553
00:35:28,163 --> 00:35:29,884
The moment there's trouble,
he just bails.

554
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:30,563
Right?

555
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:32,123
With such a big issue happening now,

556
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:33,844
how do you expect us to trust you again?

557
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:34,603
That's not true.

558
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:36,003
Mr. Lu isn't that kind of person.

559
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:36,924
You shut your mouth.

560
00:35:37,163 --> 00:35:37,964
Please trust us.

561
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:40,043
What do you plan to do? What now?

562
00:35:40,324 --> 00:35:40,804
We want plans.

563
00:35:40,884 --> 00:35:41,764
We're working on it.

564
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:42,683
What's your plan?

565
00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:43,844
Can you solve the problem?

566
00:35:43,844 --> 00:35:44,603
Please trust us.

567
00:35:44,764 --> 00:35:45,924
Trust us. Please stay calm.

568
00:35:45,964 --> 00:35:46,804
Yes, exactly.

569
00:35:47,003 --> 00:35:50,123
Pinshang has always been
known for its design strength.

570
00:35:50,643 --> 00:35:52,804
Yet this time they chose

571
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,724
the designer Chen Man Ni whom Yihua

572
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:57,603
had discarded and who has
a history of plagiarism.

573
00:35:57,764 --> 00:36:00,203
There are so many new
building materials available,

574
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:03,483
yet Pinshang chose to use

575
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:06,764
obscure old wooden pieces,

576
00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:09,643
causing such big trouble
for the district government.

577
00:36:11,563 --> 00:36:12,683
As Yihua,

578
00:36:12,844 --> 00:36:15,523
we are very willing to do
a reassessment of the project.

579
00:36:16,444 --> 00:36:17,724
Of course. Not at all.

580
00:36:18,324 --> 00:36:19,284
We should leave

581
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:21,683
professional matters
to the professionals, right?

582
00:36:22,043 --> 00:36:25,043
Thank you for your trust in Yihua.

583
00:36:27,884 --> 00:36:28,884
Okay, goodbye.

584
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:51,924
(Do you think a shutdown
would scare me?)

585
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,123
(You underestimate me.)

586
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,163
(Whatever happens, I will)

587
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:55,683
(keep the Ancient Alley
Renovation project.)
