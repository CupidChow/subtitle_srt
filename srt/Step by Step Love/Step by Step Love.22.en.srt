20
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:43,411
Sir, you might not know that

21
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,052
young folks nowadays

22
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:47,092
long for houses filled with
nostalgic aura

23
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:48,491
and the essence of everyday life.

24
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,131
They believe such places
can soothe their souls,

25
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,812
offering a chance to enjoy, unwind,

26
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:56,252
listen to the rain, and birds chirping.

27
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,211
Young girls nowadays are just like you,

28
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:01,252
all caught up in these fanciful,

29
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:02,371
impractical ideas.

30
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:04,092
That's why you guys find it impossible

31
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,491
to land a date.

32
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:06,532
No date.

33
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:07,491
No date at all.

34
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:08,732
Can't land a date at all.

35
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,132
Come on.

36
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:11,971
I've told you

37
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:12,811
that has

38
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,452
nothing to do with the houses.

39
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:21,251
Should Lu Cenyang be willing to come,

40
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:22,771
he will surely bring Bu Ran along.

41
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:24,771
Bu Ran can't handle alcohol,

42
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:26,412
so just get her drunk.

43
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:29,771
Okay.

44
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:36,651
Ms. Bu,

45
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:39,012
you made some good points.

46
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:41,971
But these folks are pretty stubborn

47
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:43,172
when they're sober.

48
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:45,371
So, let's drink up.

49
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,931
Once everyone loosens up
with a few drinks,

50
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:48,931
it'll be easier to talk.

51
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:49,691
Cheers.

52
00:02:50,332 --> 00:02:50,771
Come on.

53
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:51,531
Let's drink.

54
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:54,892
Mr. Lu has made it clear

55
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,531
that Ms. Bu isn't much of a drinker.

56
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:57,892
Let's switch to tea.

57
00:02:58,332 --> 00:02:59,012
Ms. Wang,

58
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:01,931
don't take Mr. Lu's concerns
for his girlfriend seriously.

59
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:03,531
Besides,

60
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:06,211
Ms. Bu has been with Mr. Lu
for so many years.

61
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:07,811
She surely can handle this.

62
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:09,452
That's it.

63
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:10,651
A little alcohol is nothing.

64
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:12,251
Here.

65
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:13,971
Come on. A toast to you.

66
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:14,691
Here's to you!

67
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:16,371
What's wrong, Ms. Bu?

68
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:18,211
Mr. Lu has left,
so you're still not drinking?

69
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:20,971
Is there something

70
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:22,012
we did wrong?

71
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:23,732
Is our sincerity not enough?

72
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:25,172
Let me toast to you.

73
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:26,251
Here's to you.

74
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:28,691
Sir,

75
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,892
I must admit I'm not much of a drinker.

76
00:03:36,572 --> 00:03:37,531
But today is a happy day.

77
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:40,612
I'll join you and drink a little.

78
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,771
That's the spirit!

79
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:45,691
I'll drink to that.

80
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:46,211
Come on.

81
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:46,971
Bottoms up.

82
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:47,892
Come on.

83
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:01,971
It's your turn now.

84
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,612
Nice.

85
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:18,331
Great.

86
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:20,052
You're a good drinker.

87
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:21,172
Come on.

88
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:22,052
Fill it up.

89
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:25,931
Hope you enjoy.

90
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:26,972
Dig in and drink.

91
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:28,451
That's enough.

92
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:29,571
Come on.

93
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,852
I'll fill it up for you.

94
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:31,652
Enjoy the drink.

95
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:32,532
Pour it up.

96
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:40,532
I...

97
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:41,612
Why is it you again?

98
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:44,131
You mess with her again,

99
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:45,852
and I'll break your arm.

100
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:47,251
Lu Cenyang,

101
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:49,331
even you have your moments
of losing it, huh?

102
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:50,772
See the cameras around?

103
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:51,772
Well, I guess

104
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:53,772
we have to deal with it your way.

105
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,251
You're really nosy.

106
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:57,052
What now,

107
00:04:57,772 --> 00:04:59,532
moonlighting as a protector
for your secretary?

108
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:01,251
Does Bu Ran know that side of you?

109
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:04,251
I've taken a liking to Yao Lefei.

110
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:05,292
If you make a move,

111
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:06,691
let's hit the headlines tomorrow.

112
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:08,092
I'll use the chance to declare

113
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:09,972
my love in a grand public gesture.

114
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:10,772
I...

115
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,131
Yi Zihe,

116
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:20,972
I'm not just Mr. Lu's secretary.

117
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:24,052
I'm also his sister, Lu Siqi.

118
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:30,691
What are you talking about?

119
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:32,451
Initially, I lost my memory.

120
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:34,972
My brother asked me to use this identity

121
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:36,011
to disguise myself.

122
00:05:36,972 --> 00:05:38,532
But today, under your provocation,

123
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:41,172
I, Lu Siqi, have returned, with hatred

124
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:42,011
for the Yi Family.

125
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:43,371
The person standing before you

126
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:45,931
is the real Lu Siqi herself.

127
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:49,212
You can go back
and report to your grandma.

128
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,092
If you dare to mess with
my sister again,

129
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,052
I will definitely not let you off.

130
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:56,891
You think I'm afraid of you?

131
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:01,652
You can't beat my brother.

132
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:03,451
Now that you know who I am,

133
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:05,732
you should know
that there is no chance for us.

134
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:07,732
The past generation
is none of our business.

135
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,172
Lu Cenyang can date Bu Ran,

136
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:12,292
so why can't I date you?

137
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:18,412
Because I like my brother.

138
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:21,331
There's no blood relation between us.

139
00:06:22,052 --> 00:06:24,212
I've liked him even before
I lost my memory.

140
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:26,092
See?

141
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:29,331
I got myself this scar
in a fit of anger

142
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:31,092
when my brother was unkind to me.

143
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:33,131
I would only do this for him.

144
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:34,172
You stand no chance.

145
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:36,251
How is that possible?

146
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:37,972
You think I'm a child?

147
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:40,052
Lu Cenyang,

148
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:42,131
isn't Bu Ran the one you like?

149
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:43,571
I'm asking you now.

150
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:45,412
Is Bu Ran the one you like or not?

151
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:51,652
Siqi and Bu Ran

152
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:53,532
are off-limits to you.

153
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:55,092
This is your final warning.

154
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,371
Stay away from them.

155
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,052
Never thought I'd see

156
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:00,652
you being ambiguous one day.

157
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:03,092
If today, you can say

158
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,732
that Lu Siqi is the only one you like,

159
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:06,331
I promise to not bother you again.

160
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:08,011
Well, say it then.

161
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:21,412
Hello?

162
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:23,451
What?

163
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:25,212
Okay, I got it.

164
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:27,011
Locals got Bu Ran drunk.

165
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:27,772
I need to go there.

166
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,612
I'll come with you.

Thank you, Ms. Wang.

173
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:09,131
It's alright.

174
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:11,331
I have successfully completed the task,

175
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,092
convinced all the locals.

176
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:16,251
Ms. Wang said you drank too much.

I didn't.

179
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,292
I only drank a little bit.

180
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:23,131
Don't worry.

181
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,491
From now on, when I'm not around,
you can't drink this much.

182
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:28,612
Got it?

183
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:31,331
It's my fault.

184
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:33,652
I was supposed to bring you good news

185
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,492
that Bu Ran had persuaded the locals.

186
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:38,532
But seeing you leaving her behind
for something else

187
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:39,772
made me wonder,

188
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:43,172
what could be more important
than your girlfriend?

189
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,931
So I jokingly told you she got drunk.

190
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,132
Take care of her.
I'll go get some fruit for you.

191
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:49,372
Okay, thanks, Ms. Wang.

192
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:50,931
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

193
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,691
It's my fault.

194
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,571
Let's go home.

195
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:00,331
I'll take you home.

196
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:02,611
I'll go bring the car around.

197
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,492
Help me take care of Bu Ran.

198
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:15,331
Ms. Yao.

199
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,091
You're fine.

200
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:20,571
Mr. Lu was just with me
for an acupuncture session,

201
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,012
and you rushed to call him over.

202
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:26,172
You said before

203
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:28,492
that you wouldn't let emotions
interfere with work.

204
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:31,211
It seems you can't do it.

205
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:38,252
Over here.

206
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:44,971
Mr. Lu,

207
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,652
you really take me for your driver?

208
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:47,892
Come sit in the front.

209
00:10:38,252 --> 00:10:38,931
Ms. Yao,

210
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:41,132
did you come specifically
to pick me up today?

211
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:42,971
Not exactly.

212
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:44,611
Mr. Lu got your call

213
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,252
at the hospital,

214
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:47,611
and said he'd come over.

215
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:50,012
I was worried about him,
so I came along.

216
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:53,292
Yi Zihe was pestering Ms. Yao
at the hospital

217
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:54,772
like a fly that won't go away.

218
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:55,731
So I had to step in.

219
00:10:56,012 --> 00:10:56,931
I see.

220
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:59,611
I'll get you some pepper spray then.

221
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,172
To deal with someone like Yi Zihe,

222
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:02,532
you need to use some tough measures.

223
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:03,492
No need.

224
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:07,931
My brother has got my back.

225
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:09,211
He won't dare to

226
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:10,652
harass me again for a while.

227
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:12,172
Brother?

228
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:15,691
I'm sorry

229
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:17,492
I couldn't tell you before

230
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,292
that Lefei is Siqi.

231
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:22,052
I rushed to the hospital today

232
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:23,971
because Siqi got her memory back.

233
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:26,412
So Ms. Yao is

234
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,811
your sister Lu Siqi
whom I've heard so much about.

235
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:31,052
Why?

236
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:32,532
Why do I get the feeling

237
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:34,252
you're not exactly thrilled for me?

238
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:35,211
Not at all.

239
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:37,012
Congratulations on getting
your memory back.

240
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:39,492
So who are you now, Yao Lefei

241
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:40,451
or Lu Siqi?

242
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:42,851
I have the memories of both.

243
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:45,451
I remember us having breakfast together,

244
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:47,012
dealing with Chen Manni together,

245
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,532
and winning the qualification
for ancient alley's reconstruction.

246
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:52,372
Mr. Lu trusts you a lot,

247
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:53,611
even kicked Chen Manni

248
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:55,611
to let you take over
the execution of the project.

249
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:07,252
Are you okay?

250
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,611
Sorry about that. I was distracted,

251
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:22,851
so I didn't see the car ahead.

252
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:27,532
You just got your memory back.

253
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:28,731
You need time to adjust.

254
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:29,412
I'll drive.

255
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,532
My brother used to
drive me around everywhere.

256
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:33,772
It'll be nice to relive that.

257
00:12:39,331 --> 00:12:40,532
Bu Ran, where are you going?

258
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:41,611
We'll drop you off.

259
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:49,172
Old Pal's.

260
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:54,091
Why go there at this hour?

261
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,652
Qin Xun got some hangover tea for me.

262
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:02,571
No need for his gallantry.

263
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:03,611
I'll make it for you.

264
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:10,571
Speaking of gallantry,

265
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,252
Mr. Lu is quite an expert as well.

266
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:13,611
Old Pal's is just up ahead.

267
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:14,691
It's not on your way.

268
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:15,892
No need to trouble Mr. Lu.

269
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,492
Brother, my head hurts again.

270
00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:20,412
Are you alright?

271
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:22,252
Can you take me to Dr. Ma's place?

272
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:23,091
Hang in there then.

273
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:24,052
I'll take you there now.

274
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,451
This is ridiculous.

275
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,892
Why push drinks on a girl?

276
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:12,611
You really went all out

277
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:13,611
to solve problems.

278
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:15,492
Cenyang asked me not to

279
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:17,012
let you drink when he left.

280
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:18,772
How am I supposed to
explain this to him?

281
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:21,892
Here, have some honey water.

282
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,492
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

283
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,052
I need to work on my alcohol tolerance.

284
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:37,331
Can't always have Mr. Lu
drinking on his own.

285
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:38,412
Alright.

286
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:39,331
Sure.

Please come back soon.

291
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,412
Bu Ran is drunk.

292
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:02,331
Mr. Lu?

293
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:04,652
Ms. Wang,

294
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:07,931
did you just call Mr. Lu?

295
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:09,611
I won't feel

296
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:11,811
at ease until he comes to pick you up.

297
00:15:15,532 --> 00:15:16,492
Ms. Wang,

298
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:18,091
do you have

299
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:20,851
any quick remedies for sobering up here?

300
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:23,211
If Mr. Lu sees me like this,

301
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,091
who would know how long he'll nag.

302
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:27,252
So you're not concerned about yourself,

303
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:29,372
but about Mr. Lu
being worried about you?

304
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:31,372
Let me think...

305
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:33,571
A quick way to sober up...

306
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,412
Oh, right.

307
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,892
We have karaoke set here.

308
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:40,372

It's too late for her to be alone.

I shouldn't have left her there.

316
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,012
I should've escorted her to Qin Xun.

You drank baijiu?

322
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:35,851
Aren't you afraid of
upsetting your stomach?

323
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,532
It was business drinking.
I didn't drink much.

324
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:40,091
I'm hungry.

325
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:41,292
Get me something to eat.

326
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:42,132

even become your boyfriend?

329
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:49,652
He knows you can't drink.

330
00:16:50,132 --> 00:16:51,252
And yet he doesn't care for you.

331
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,691
He wasn't there when I drank.

332
00:16:54,492 --> 00:16:55,451
It's no big deal.

333
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:57,052

I'll get you some food.

00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:17,292
Thanks.

337
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:51,091
Eat up.

338
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:05,492
Something's wrong with
the renovation materials?

339
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:09,331
Though we've convinced the locals
to accept the renovation,

340
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:11,532
while keeping its original charm,

341
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:13,891
they're worried it'll end up looking

342
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:15,371
neither old nor new,

343
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:17,331
losing its historical essence

344
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:19,292
without gaining the modern look
they desire.

345
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:21,331
I'm wondering

346
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:24,411
if we can find old wooden pieces
from private collections.

347
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:26,972
If there are enough replacement parts,

348
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:29,012
it would greatly meet the design needs.

349
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:32,091
But they are not using your proposal.

350
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,331
Why fuss over it so much?

351
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:36,371
I've made a promise to the locals
over drinks.

352
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:38,452
Besides,

353
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:41,171
Lu Cenyang's father used to live there.

354
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:42,411
It's personal to him.

355
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:45,131
I want to help as much as possible.

356
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:48,452
You

357
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:51,131
always put Lu Cenyang first.

358
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:53,171
I know why

359
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:55,371
you came here alone today.

360
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:57,651
You had a tiff with Lu Cenyang

361
00:18:58,131 --> 00:19:00,012
and decided to keep yourself busy

362
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:01,252
to avoid overthinking,

363
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:02,692
didn't you?

364
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:04,091
Of course not.

365
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:06,932
As if I don't know you.

366
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:09,171
It's written all over your face.

367
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,252
But don't worry.

368
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,331
No one but me can read those emotions.

369
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:18,131
If Lu Cenyang hurts you, just blink.

370
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,171
I'll stand up for you.

371
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:23,052
I know you're only trying to help,

372
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:25,012
but it's not as dramatic as you think.

373
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,611
He's too busy looking out for me

374
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:28,851
to ever hurt me.

375
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:30,611
I'll be fine after eating.

376
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,292
You sure?

377
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:34,571
Of course.

378
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,565
(Searching for materials)

379
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:52,171
Bu Ran suddenly got off.

380
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:53,772
She can't be angry at me, can she?

381
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:55,492
Sorry.

382
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:56,252
It's all my fault.

383
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:57,171
It's okay.

384
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:59,611
I'll go check
if she has arrived at Old Pal's.

385
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:00,891
Wait for me in the car.

386
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,811
Alright, stop searching.

387
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:10,611
I know a Mr. Hu

388
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:13,091
who specializes in renovation
of old houses.

389
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:16,651
He has quite a lot of
nice antique items.

390
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:17,851
I've seen them,

391
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:19,972
truly appealing.

392
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:21,772
It should be able to help
with your project.

393
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:22,972
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

394
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,371
Well, you never asked.

395
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:28,091
Besides, why should I meddle in
your company's projects?

396
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:29,891
This is helping me.

397
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:32,252
Hurry up and contact Mr. Hu for me.

398
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,331
No,

399
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:34,532
you need to eat first.

400
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:36,052
It won't stop you from making a call.

401
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,331
Get in touch with Mr. Hu,

402
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:38,772
and then I can talk to Mr. Lu about it.

403
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:39,811
I am the boss.

404
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,131
You need to eat first.

405
00:20:42,212 --> 00:20:43,411
You're not even sober yet.

406
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:45,452
You have to finish this.

407
00:20:51,532 --> 00:20:52,212
Eat some more.

408
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:56,732
Then give me a massage.

409
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:00,052
Is that okay, boss?

410
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:01,492
Continue.

411
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:19,411
Qin Xun and Bu Ran

412
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,571
have been close for years.

413
00:21:20,972 --> 00:21:22,692
Barging in and making accusations

414
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:24,171
will make you come off as petty.

415
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:29,732
Let's go.
I'll take you to the hospital first.

416
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:30,811
Won't you talk to Bu Ran?

417
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:34,692
She'll be fine here.

418
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:50,012
What's the matter?

419
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:51,452
Still not feeling well?

420
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:52,611
I'm fine.

421
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,411
Brother,

422
00:21:53,571 --> 00:21:55,811
about what I said to Yi Zihe
earlier today,

423
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:57,292
I'm not sure if it bothered you.

424
00:21:57,492 --> 00:21:59,292
Don't worry. I understand.

425
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,292
Dr. Ma just said

426
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:02,611
your memory has just recovered.

427
00:22:02,772 --> 00:22:04,772
You should rest more
to avoid headache attacks.

428
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:07,012
Has Bu Ran gone home?

429
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:09,012
Make sure you explain things
clearly to her,

430
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:10,131
in case she gets it wrong.

431
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:12,052
You're overthinking it.

432
00:22:12,492 --> 00:22:13,411
You are my sister.

433
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:15,012
No one

434
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:16,851
can affect my relationship with her.

435
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:18,732
Brother,

436
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:20,851
I'm afraid Yi Zihe will harass me again.

437
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,851
Can I stay at your place?

438
00:22:23,331 --> 00:22:24,891
You were worried that
my unclear identity

439
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,811
would cause unnecessary trouble before.

440
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:28,972
Now that everyone knows I am Lu Siqi,

441
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:30,012
can I...

442
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:31,012
I'll drive you

443
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:32,411
to and from work tomorrow.

444
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:33,651
Get some rest.

445
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:42,331
Xu,

446
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:44,331
could you check
if Bu Ran is still in the bar?

447
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,371
She left a while ago.

448
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:50,091
Qin Xun gave her a ride back.

449
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:53,532
Okay, thanks, Xu.

450
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,932
Still not back at this hour?

451
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:10,091
You can lie to me all you want,

452
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,972
but don't lie to yourself.

453
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,331
Got stomach medicine, right?

454
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:15,171
Take some if you feel unwell.

455
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:17,772
Stop nagging. I know myself.

456
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:19,571
If I say I'm fine, then I'm fine.

457
00:23:21,811 --> 00:23:23,772
You look pale every time after drinking.

458
00:23:23,932 --> 00:23:25,252
And yet you claim you're fine.

459
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:26,371
It's so late.

460
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,052
Your boyfriend doesn't even call

461
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:29,651
to check up on you.

462
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:31,891
Is he too busy, or just too trusting?

463
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:39,206
(Lu Cenyang)

464
00:23:40,371 --> 00:23:42,131
Speak of the devil, and he calls.

465
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:43,732
Should've called earlier.

466
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:48,012
I'm home now. No picking up.

467
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:49,611
That's more like it.

468
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:52,212
Stand firm if you're giving someone
the cold shoulder.

469
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:54,212
Don't let him think you're a pushover.

470
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:56,052
I'm not giving him the cold shoulder.

471
00:24:00,851 --> 00:24:02,492
(Exit)
Hello, the number you have dialed

472
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:03,811
is currently busy.

473
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:09,851
Thank you for the ride.

474
00:24:10,052 --> 00:24:10,891
Hurry back.

475
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:12,772
Get straight to bed once you're home.

476
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:15,651
And if that guy comes knocking,
trying to sweet-talk you,

477
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:17,651
don't go soft.

478
00:24:17,972 --> 00:24:19,492
I'm not that love-struck.

479
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:21,571
By the way,

480
00:24:21,972 --> 00:24:23,252
hurry up and arrange

481
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:24,611
a meeting with Mr. Hu.

482
00:24:25,052 --> 00:24:25,891
Get my work sorted.

483
00:24:26,052 --> 00:24:27,772
Then I can get a good sleep.
That's what matters.

484
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:29,091
I'm off.

485
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:33,692
Bu Ran,

486
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:36,972
let me know if you change your mind.

487
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:38,972
I've been waiting for you.

488
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:43,611
Why don't you say it a bit louder?

489
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:45,411
And give Lu Cenyang a sense of crisis.

490
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:50,492
Hurry back, Qin.

491
00:25:33,692 --> 00:25:34,371
You're back.

492
00:25:35,692 --> 00:25:36,851
Why didn't you answer my calls?

493
00:25:40,212 --> 00:25:41,532
Nothing, I just didn't

494
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:42,891
feel like answering.

495
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:47,772
Didn't you worry
that I might worry about you?

496
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:48,811
Worried?

497
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:51,171
Seems rather superficial,
don't you think?

498
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,411
You didn't bother looking for me,

499
00:25:53,692 --> 00:25:55,171
but came up to the balcony
to enjoy the view.

500
00:25:55,732 --> 00:25:56,371
And what about you?

501
00:25:57,571 --> 00:25:58,891
You were drunk. Instead of going home,

502
00:25:59,252 --> 00:26:00,212
you went to see Qin Xun.

503
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:01,012
Not that drunk,

504
00:26:01,171 --> 00:26:02,651
you didn't even bother to take me home.

505
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,171
I went to Old Pal's, so what?

506
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:07,012
Siqi suddenly had a headache.

507
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,732
I took her to the hospital.

508
00:26:09,972 --> 00:26:10,571
Fine.

509
00:26:11,212 --> 00:26:12,131
Let's talk business then.

510
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:14,692
Although I convinced
those residents today,

511
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:17,091
the key to gaining
their sincere approval

512
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:19,131
is the quality and material used
for the renovation.

513
00:26:19,532 --> 00:26:20,932
Are you jealous of Siqi?

514
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:23,052
Qin Xun connected us

515
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:24,371
with Mr. Hu, who has old wooden pieces.

516
00:26:24,732 --> 00:26:26,131
Siqi just got her memory back.

517
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:27,331
Bullied by Yi Zihe,

518
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,052
she's full of insecurities now.

519
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,571
Clear some time tomorrow for Mr. Hu,

520
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:32,331
and check the quality of his goods.

521
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,292
Siqi is just my sister.

522
00:26:35,772 --> 00:26:36,651
After my dad passed away,

523
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,131
I've been looking after her.

524
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:40,171
I'm the only one she can rely on
in this world.

525
00:26:40,492 --> 00:26:42,371
She might come off as petty
in front of you,

526
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:44,212
- but I...
- Are you even listening to me?

527
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,692
Can we not talk about work?

528
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:49,371
- Let's talk about us, okay?
- Lu Cenyang.

529
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:52,732
We can if it's just you and me.

530
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,331
If there is a third person,

531
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:55,411
we can't talk it through

532
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:56,532
as we did before.

533
00:26:58,452 --> 00:26:59,212
Not just three,

534
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:01,532
there's also a fourth, Qin Xun.

535
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:03,492
Qin Xun and I are just friends.

536
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:04,692
Siqi is just my sister.

537
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:06,772
Yes, precisely because
she's your sister,

538
00:27:06,932 --> 00:27:08,532
I'm not allowed to feel anything.

539
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:10,732
Or I'd be considered
lacking understanding.

540
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,052
Seems we got nothing to talk about
other than work.

541
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:22,171
I'll meet with Mr. Hu.

542
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:25,571
I know you mean well for me.

543
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:27,532
Bu Ran,

544
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:31,091
I have something

545
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:33,052
to tell you in advance.

546
00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:38,452
Then just say it.

547
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:40,891
Don't make it feel like pulling teeth.

548
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:43,411
I'm worried Yi Zihe

549
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:45,252
will harass Siqi again.

550
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:48,452
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be driving her to and from work.

551
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:51,292
That's your business.

552
00:27:51,692 --> 00:27:52,571
You don't need to tell me.

553
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:18,252
Remember to eat breakfast.

554
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:19,651
Your favorite steam buns.

555
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:20,772
Thank you.

556
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:33,611
Bu Ran.

557
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:39,292
I was just about to call you.

558
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:40,972
I came here with Mr. Hu.

559
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:42,252
Qin,

560
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:43,932
this must be the friend

561
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:45,252
you often talk about, right?

562
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:46,532
This is Bu Ran,

563
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,252
the most talented designer of Pinshang.

564
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:49,811
Mr. Hu, hello.

565
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:50,692
Hello, Ms. Bu.

566
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:54,252
Qin contacted me in a hurry yesterday,

567
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:55,692
insisting that I must help you.

568
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:58,091
Your boyfriend really does his part,

569
00:28:58,811 --> 00:29:00,411
so considerate for his girlfriend.

570
00:29:01,052 --> 00:29:01,932
Girlfriend?

571
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:12,571
Mr. Hu,

572
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:14,692
this is Mr. Lu, CEO of Pinshang.

573
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:16,532
Hello, Mr. Lu.

574
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:18,171
Hello.

575
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:20,772
Mr. Lu and his girlfriend
are indeed a handsome couple,

576
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:21,651
a perfect match.

577
00:29:21,851 --> 00:29:22,292
This is my...

578
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,091
Mr. Hu, this way.
Let's go upstairs to talk.

579
00:29:24,252 --> 00:29:24,932
Alright.

580
00:29:28,012 --> 00:29:29,811
Didn't have breakfast, right?
I bought this on the way.

581
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:32,371
Let's go.

582
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,772
Seems Mr. Hu and I really hit it off.

583
00:29:59,212 --> 00:30:01,052
Thank you for supporting
the ancient alley project.

584
00:30:02,212 --> 00:30:03,252
Mr. Lu, you are too kind.

585
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:05,732
I've nowhere to store
these old wood pieces.

586
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:06,891
Good to see you turn them

587
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:08,452
into something valuable.

588
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:10,732
Besides, Qin and I are good friends,

589
00:30:11,012 --> 00:30:12,811
and he's also close with Bu Ran.

590
00:30:13,171 --> 00:30:15,012
With such deep bonds of friendship,

591
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:16,371
how could I not support

592
00:30:16,532 --> 00:30:17,772
this remarkable project?

593
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:18,972
Mr. Hu, Mr. Lu,

594
00:30:19,212 --> 00:30:20,411
we've had such a great chat today.

595
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:21,611
How about I take a pic of you?

596
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:23,452
Sure.

597
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:25,692
Bu Ran, let Qin Xun take the pic.

598
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:26,891
Come over and join us.

599
00:30:28,131 --> 00:30:29,171
Why not get someone to take

600
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,292
a pic of all of us?

601
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:31,932
Okay, leave it to me.

602
00:30:35,732 --> 00:30:37,331
Bu Ran is really a good girl.

603
00:30:38,331 --> 00:30:39,252
If you like her, go for it.

604
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:43,252
Maybe Mr. Lu could give you a hand.

605
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:53,891
Mr. Hu, Mr. Lu.

606
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:54,851
Let's move over here.

607
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:55,732
This way.

608
00:30:57,611 --> 00:30:58,411
You're a lady,

609
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,171
so you should stand between us.

610
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:01,772
That's not quite appropriate.

611
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:02,452
It's fine.

612
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:03,651
Come to the center.

613
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:06,012
Come to this side.

614
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:06,851
Okay.

615
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:09,811
Okay.

616
00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:11,411
Everyone, look at the camera.

617
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:15,171
One, two, three.

618
00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:17,932
Another one.

619
00:31:22,651 --> 00:31:23,252
Alright.

620
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:33,732
One, two, three.

621
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:41,411
Alright then, guys.

622
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:43,012
See you when the project starts.

623
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:43,732
See you soon.

624
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:44,252
Bye.

625
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:45,252
- Take care.
- Bye, Mr. Hu.

626
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:46,131
Bye-bye.

627
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:49,091
Impressive.

628
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:50,891
You've secured a big collector for me.

629
00:31:51,212 --> 00:31:53,292
Mr. Hu clearly did it for you.

630
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:54,772
He was so easy to talk to.

631
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:57,252
When have I ever let you down?

632
00:31:57,692 --> 00:31:59,411
Feeling better today, huh?

633
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:01,732
I'll take you for a meal after work.

634
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:04,532
Now we've got Mr. Hu.

635
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:06,091
Our materials are secured.

636
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:07,692
Today, my treat.

637
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:08,532
No need.

638
00:32:08,732 --> 00:32:10,131
Mr. Lu's tastes are

639
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:12,292
probably more upscale.

640
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:14,692
Bu Ran and I are more into
humble home cooking.

641
00:32:15,171 --> 00:32:15,772
Bu Ran,

642
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:17,571
tell Mr. Lu

643
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:19,171
what our feast looks like.

644
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:24,651
Scallops and oysters,
half a dozen each.

645
00:32:24,932 --> 00:32:25,851
One grilled fish.

646
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:28,091
20 lamb skewers, 20 pork loin skewers.

647
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,212
Bu Ran doesn't like vegetables,

648
00:32:30,651 --> 00:32:31,371
so we get

649
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:32,492
three skewers,

650
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:33,811
each of chives,

651
00:32:34,012 --> 00:32:35,692
green peppers,
and grilled potato slices.

652
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:37,772
Usually two for me, one for her.

653
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:40,411
For carbs, two grilled buns.

654
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:41,571
Plus a pitcher of plum juice.

655
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:42,171
We may consider

656
00:32:42,371 --> 00:32:43,932
adding some spicy crawfish.

657
00:32:45,811 --> 00:32:47,371
But that's usually
just for the two of us.

658
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:49,371
We probably need to order more
with Mr. Lu joining.

659
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:51,692
My mouth is already watering.

660
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:56,091
I've got to clear
the next couple of days

661
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:57,972
to iron out the project details,

662
00:32:58,171 --> 00:33:00,091
before I can truly indulge.

663
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:01,212
No problem.

664
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:03,411
We can meet up anytime.

665
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:04,811
Or I can just

666
00:33:04,972 --> 00:33:07,411
bring the ingredients to the site
and grill them myself.

667
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:10,171
I'll be off then.

668
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:10,932
Bye-bye.

669
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:17,772
You two were trying

670
00:33:18,252 --> 00:33:18,932
to annoy me or what?

671
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:21,012
We've always talked like this.

672
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:21,972
Just get used to it.

673
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:23,972
I can't. You need to change.

674
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:33,452
Yi Zihe, can't you just stop?

675
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:37,571
Mr. Lu,

676
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:38,811
better clarify

677
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:40,891
who you really like,
Bu Ran or Yao Lefei?

678
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:41,891
What are you talking about?

679
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:46,732
Seems you're still in the dark.

680
00:33:47,212 --> 00:33:48,331
When Yao Lefei, I mean,

681
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:51,571
Lu Siqi, was getting treatment,

682
00:33:52,411 --> 00:33:53,371
your boyfriend's attitude

683
00:33:53,772 --> 00:33:55,371
towards her was ambiguously intimate.

684
00:33:56,012 --> 00:33:57,732
I'm here today to make one thing clear.

685
00:33:58,212 --> 00:34:00,012
If you've already lost to Lu Siqi,

686
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,052
then I'll give up and stop pursuing her.

687
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,052
Yi Zihe,

688
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:05,371
if you keep buzzing around
like an annoying fly,

689
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:06,571
I'll make all that dirt

690
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:07,811
I have on you public.

691
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:11,532
Bu Ran, did you hear that?

692
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:13,691
Your dear Mr. Lu

693
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:15,892
seems more concerned about Lu Siqi.

694
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:16,611
I...

695
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:19,611
Look how upset you are.

696
00:34:20,131 --> 00:34:21,091
Don't think you can

697
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,251
shut me out from her.

698
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,611
Even Grandma can't stop me now.

699
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:27,171
I'm determined to fight you.

700
00:34:27,372 --> 00:34:27,651
I...

701
00:34:27,852 --> 00:34:28,452
Lu Cenyang.

702
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:29,892
Never thought you'd be driven

703
00:34:29,892 --> 00:34:30,812
crazy by this idiot.

704
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:35,852
I need a half-day off

705
00:34:36,131 --> 00:34:37,091
to drive this

706
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:37,972
lunatic home.

707
00:35:10,052 --> 00:35:11,251
Will you get off the car yourself?

708
00:35:11,412 --> 00:35:13,171
Or should I notify someone
to pick you up for work?

709
00:35:14,332 --> 00:35:14,972
No need.

710
00:35:15,812 --> 00:35:17,291
I'm leaving Yihua anyway.

711
00:35:18,091 --> 00:35:19,052
I'd like to spend

712
00:35:19,972 --> 00:35:22,291
my remaining energy
loving someone freely.

713
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:23,932
That's so pathetic.

714
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:26,571
There are plenty of women
willing to fall for you.

715
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:28,211
Stay away from Lu Siqi.

716
00:35:28,571 --> 00:35:30,171
Are you really that naive
or just pretending?

717
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:31,852
I've seen her arm in arm

718
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:33,091
with Lu Cenyang,

719
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:34,532
and he didn't even deny it.

720
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,892
Those two were already all lovey-dovey.

721
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:37,771
Yet here you are

722
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:39,892
holding me back to help your love rival.

723
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:41,412
What's wrong with you?

724
00:35:41,812 --> 00:35:42,892
Cut the nonsense.

725
00:35:43,412 --> 00:35:45,412
Lu Cenyang was just
protecting his sister.

726
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,211
You better wise up.

727
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:50,571
He's not some innocent CEO as you think.

728
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:53,332
Haven't you heard about

729
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:54,251
how he climbed the ladder

730
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,892
using his so-called

731
00:35:56,091 --> 00:35:56,812
sister?

732
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:57,972
You...

733
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:02,972
What I said is all true.

734
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:07,251
He is my boyfriend.

735
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:08,492
Stop slandering him.

736
00:36:11,892 --> 00:36:12,771
Lu Siqi said she'd

737
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:14,091
slit her wrists for Lu Cenyang.
