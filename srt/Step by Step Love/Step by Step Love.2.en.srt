00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,483
(Pinshang)

21
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:43,843
Congrats on making to the second round.

22
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:45,043
Today's exam topic

23
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:46,964
is to Implementing spatial renovation

24
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:48,084
for a 40 square meter condo.

25
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:50,884
The homeowner is a middle-aged man
with hemiplegia

26
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:52,884
who lives with his father
who is in his sixties.

27
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:53,524
Let's start.

28
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:08,364
Time's up.

29
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,204
Who would like to go first
to present their work?

30
00:02:15,204 --> 00:02:16,244
The main principle of my design

31
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:18,524
is to break the original spatial pattern
of the condo

32
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:19,883
and create an open layout.

33
00:02:20,044 --> 00:02:20,723
Look at this.

34
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:23,563
It facilitates the homeowner's
movement indoors.

35
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:26,364
(While storage makes greater use
of the upper space...)

36
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:27,244
This isn’t realistic.

37
00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:27,683
Look at this.

38
00:02:27,683 --> 00:02:29,003
(with overhead cabinets, bunk beds...)

39
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:32,123
Do you expect

40
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:34,403
a person with a high amputation

41
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:36,283
and a person in his sixties

42
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,603
to be climbing up and down every day?

43
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:40,644
My design

44
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:42,244
emphasizes convenience.

45
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,964
It will ensure both the functionality
of the space

46
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:46,524
and safety.

47
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:48,804
Given the conditions
of the homeowner and his family,

48
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:49,603
for spatial design,

49
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:51,683
safety and convenience
are surely the top priorities.

50
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,644
Look.

51
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:56,804
The space is too small

52
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:58,764
and the operability is very limited.

53
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:08,764
Next.

54
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:17,843
The focus of my design revolves around

55
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,843
addressing the basic necessities
of living convenience.

56
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:21,883
This is a ground-floor

57
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:23,443
40-square-meter condo

58
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:24,683
with limited space

59
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,964
occupied by two individuals
with mobility issues.

60
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:28,843
And just below is a garage.

61
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:30,003
I've designed an elevator

62
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:31,683
at the entrance

63
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,324
to connect the condo and the garage,

64
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:35,524
which effectively
solves the mobility issue.

65
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:36,603
As for the bedroom,

66
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:38,403
I've opted for a Murphy bed design.

67
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:40,163
This sort of concealed design

68
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:41,924
can maximize the activity space

69
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:43,403
for the mobility-challenged residents

70
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:45,003
within the limited space.

71
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:46,603
I think her design is quite good.

72
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:47,443
Indeed, it's not bad.

73
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:51,764
The entry point for our exam question
is very narrow.

74
00:03:52,403 --> 00:03:54,443
Bu Ran has uncovered the potential needs
of the residents

75
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:56,443
which they themselves
may not even be aware of.

76
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:58,723
She is a designer with warmth.

77
00:03:59,283 --> 00:04:00,764
She fits your requirements very well.

78
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:02,843
Being able to be so delicate,

79
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:04,244
her sincere attitude is obvious.

80
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:08,123
It's a rare highlight
among the interviewees.

81
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:09,804
If she joins Pinshang,

82
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,563
she will be of great value.

83
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:31,564
We are announcing the list of candidates
who passed the interview.

84
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:36,283
Zhao Lei.

85
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:45,603
Bu Ran.

86
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:50,004
Congratulations to both of you
for passing the interview.

87
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:10,483
(Occupiaed)

88
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:11,084
Mom,

89
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:12,764
I've finally found a job as a designer.

90
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,204
I'm one step closer to my dream.

91
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:14,843
Wait a moment.

92
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:15,964
You forgot your change.

93
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:19,324
Stay in the hospital with peace of mind.

94
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,964
Don't worry about the medical expenses.

95
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:22,363
Once I've picked up my dad,

96
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:23,644
we'll have a family reunion.

97
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:26,084
Our family's days
will surely get better and better.

98
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:28,004
Miss, here’s your change.

99
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:28,964
Thanks.

100
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:30,923
Mom, I’ve arrived. I need to go.

101
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:42,024
(High-security prison. No trespassing.
First Prison of Hai Shi)

102
00:06:01,163 --> 00:06:01,923
Dad.

103
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:12,204
Do you have money?

104
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,043
What do you need the money for?

105
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:17,644
I've been locked up for seven years.

106
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:19,723
Now that I'm out,
shouldn’t I take a bath, get a massage,

107
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:20,684
have some drink,

108
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,043
and enjoy my new life?

109
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:22,884
Hurry up.

110
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:25,403
What?

111
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:27,564
Won't you give your own dad some money?

112
00:06:28,603 --> 00:06:29,644
Won’t you ask

113
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,483
why I’m the only one picking you up?

114
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:36,283
Right. I don't see our car.

115
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:38,524
Don't you care where my mom is?

116
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:40,684
Mom had a heart attack
because of my uncle family.

117
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:41,764
She was rescued in time.

118
00:06:42,204 --> 00:06:44,043
Let's go to the hospital
and see her first.

119
00:06:52,684 --> 00:06:53,403
Dr. Ma.

120
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:55,124
No matter how busy you are,

121
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:57,124
remind the patient
to cooperate with the treatment.

122
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,803
Siqi can only get better
through timely treatments

123
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:00,923
every time.

124
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:03,084
Meeting a doctor
as serious and responsible as you,

125
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:04,803
I dare to be occasionally inattentive.

126
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:05,803
Rest assured.

127
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:07,723
I will keep a close eye on her
from now on

128
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:08,644
to receive acupuncture.

129
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:09,843
It still needs 40 minutes.

130
00:07:10,004 --> 00:07:10,644
Okay.

131
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:18,043
(Cashier)

132
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:19,603
Dad, over here.

133
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:32,964
Mom, look who's here.

134
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:38,684
Minde.

135
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:41,644
Dad came to see you
as soon as he got out.

136
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:43,204
He wouldn't even take a rest.

137
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:46,243
I have something to do.

138
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:47,403
Let my dad keep you good company.

139
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:54,923
Minde,

140
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:56,923
you have suffered.

141
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,843
I've been longing every day

142
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:00,803
for when you return,

143
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:03,723
which will be the time
our family reunites.

144
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:08,684
But my body lets me down.

145
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:12,204
(She spends so much money treating you)

146
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:16,084
but grudges me a bit to buy some liquor.

147
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:18,723
She is such a filial daughter.

148
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:20,803
An ingrate.

149
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,404
Minde?

150
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:01,763
Brother Minde!

151
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:07,003
Minde, you're out of the prison.

152
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:08,843
Look at you, Ran.

153
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:10,044
Why didn't you tell us

154
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:11,643
so we could go to pick him up?

155
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:12,723
That's right.

156
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:15,564
I was wondering why the house
is full of the smell of alcohol.

157
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:17,483
Cai,

158
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,883
you've put on weight
after all these years.

159
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:30,324
Got some money?

160
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:32,003
Money?

161
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:33,564
Kexin,

162
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:35,603
transfer some money to my brother later.

163
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:37,164
Look at him.

164
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,763
He has no means of subsistence.

165
00:09:38,924 --> 00:09:40,763
And her wife is constantly ill.

166
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:43,324
Bu Ran, you should be considerate

167
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:44,684
and find a job soon.

168
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:46,164
You don't even have a job now.

169
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:48,363
I really envy your family.

170
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:51,603
No jobs, yet you can eat and live
for free and have money to spend.

171
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:52,883
Right.

172
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:55,523
Which company would hire someone

173
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:56,964
whose mother is frequently sick

174
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:58,164
and whose father went to jail?

175
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:05,883
That's very kind.

176
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:08,284
Thanks a lot, Kexin.

177
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:10,243
Thank you.

178
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:16,123
You are not very well-informed, Uncle.

179
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:17,284
Don't you know

180
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:19,363
I'm about to start working at Pinshang?

181
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:21,123
I've already told grandma.

182
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:23,723
She is especially pleased with me.

183
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:26,883
For this I should
thank you and your wife's inaction.

184
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:29,084
If you can get into Pinshang so quickly,

185
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:30,204
I can be the...

186
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:31,444
Let's wait and see then.

187
00:10:33,804 --> 00:10:35,324
You'd better be as you say.

188
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:38,044
Otherwise, you'll be kicked out
of the house sooner or later.

189
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:51,564
Hello?

190
00:10:52,363 --> 00:10:53,084
Ms. Buyan,

191
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:54,564
I'm very sorry to inform you

192
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:56,243
that we've found that your design

193
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:57,843
is very similar to the published works

194
00:10:57,843 --> 00:10:58,883
by Taylor.

195
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:00,924
We have a reason
to believe you've plagiarized.

196
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:01,444
No, I...

197
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:03,284
So the interview results are invalid.

198
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:04,404
You can't join Pinshang.

199
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:06,723
Hello?

200
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:21,924
You canceled a given offer.

201
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:23,924
Pinshang doesn't have such precedents.

202
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:25,523
Is there a specific reason

203
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:27,404
that you gave up on her?

204
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,204
She is the daughter of Yi Minde.

205
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:35,404
No one from the Yi family
can get into Pinshang.

206
00:11:41,723 --> 00:11:43,284
Mr. Lu! Mr. Lu!

207
00:11:43,523 --> 00:11:44,483
I did not plagiarize Taylor.

208
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,084
It's he who stole my work.

209
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:47,523
I already explained to you

210
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:48,843
the first time we met.

211
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:50,204
I am the victim.

212
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:51,243
If you want to cancel

213
00:11:51,363 --> 00:11:52,243
my offer for this reason,

214
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:53,123
that's not acceptable.

215
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:54,404
What if you don't accept it?

216
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:57,404
Taylor is a master of space design

217
00:11:57,564 --> 00:11:58,964
who has social prestige.

218
00:11:59,084 --> 00:11:59,763
And you?

219
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:01,883
You are a drop-out, a ringer,

220
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:04,084
and a woman
with a not-so-good reputation.

221
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,763
Who do you think I should believe?

222
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:07,404
I can prove my abilities.

223
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:08,324
Abilities?

224
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:09,843
Even if you're able,

225
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:12,044
you lack integrity and is treacherous,

226
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:14,003
and you gain benefits
by betraying others.

227
00:12:14,123 --> 00:12:14,523
I

228
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:15,843
won't employ hire someone like you.

229
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:19,363
I...

230
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:27,804
Hello?

231
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:29,964
You've come back?

232
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:31,964
I have a job for you.

233
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:44,123
Not bad, Qin Xun.

234
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:46,363
You did a great job of investigating.

235
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:54,444
That's it.

236
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:56,363
It's only been a few days.

237
00:12:56,564 --> 00:12:58,044
You wrap things up too easily,
don't you.

238
00:12:58,564 --> 00:12:59,324
Calm down.

239
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:20,444
I've already sent you the evidence

240
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:21,684
of your husband's infidelity.

241
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:23,523
Let's stick to our previous agreement.

242
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:25,084
I don't want a payment.

243
00:13:25,564 --> 00:13:27,444
You can rent that Fulege property
under your name

244
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:29,003
to me at a low price.

245
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:33,164
Okay. Pleasure to cooperate with you.

246
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:38,964
First come, first served.

247
00:13:39,123 --> 00:13:40,243
I think

248
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:41,723
that by moving close to Lu Cenyang,

249
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:42,964
I will find an opportunity.

250
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:45,643
Bu Ran, although
I am willing to help you,

251
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:47,564
I'm quite worried about you too.

252
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:49,164
If you want to use Lu Cenyang

253
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:50,763
as your trump card,

254
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:52,564
it's very possible

255
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:54,444
that you become just a pair of threes
in his hand.

256
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:57,883
My uncle and his wife
are keeping a tight watch on me.

257
00:13:58,123 --> 00:14:00,084
I can’t find a suitable job at all.

258
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:03,003
Although I can’t join Pinshang
right now,

259
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:04,564
if I rely on my own abilities

260
00:14:04,564 --> 00:14:06,164
to clear up the misunderstanding
with Lu Cenyang,

261
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:07,643
there might still be a chance.

262
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:09,763
After all,
what Pinshang values is design.

263
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:10,804
Lu Cenyang

264
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:13,363
dislikes you for he misunderstood
that you plagiarized Tyler.

265
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:16,164
Since it’s a misunderstanding
, it will be cleared up sooner or later.

266
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:17,603
Ease your mind.

267
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,044
Mr. Lu,

268
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:39,924
you’re off work so early today.

269
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:41,564
What do you want?

270
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:43,723
To retrun this to its owner.

271
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,883
You came here especially
to return the trench coat?

272
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:51,243
Could you help me with moving?

273
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:53,084
It’s not far,
just opposite to your place.

274
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:58,084
So you are targeting me.

275
00:14:58,204 --> 00:14:59,843
Yes, you’re right..

276
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:02,284
The rent here isn't cheap.

277
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:03,643
You're so willing to spend a lot.

278
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,044
It seems you have big plans.

279
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,284
Of course.

280
00:15:06,763 --> 00:15:08,684
If you accidentally find out

281
00:15:08,684 --> 00:15:09,924
about my design abilities,

282
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:12,243
the door to Pinshang might open to me.

283
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:14,684
Besides, good neighbors are precious.

284
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,883
Seeing that you’re reluctant
to leave Fulege,

285
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,084
I have to move over here.

286
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:19,603
Isn’t that very sincere?

287
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:23,204
I'll help you move.

288
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:25,044
Okay.

289
00:15:25,243 --> 00:15:26,723
Then I’ll hold the elevator for you.

290
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:23,044
I’ve had a great start today.

291
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:25,084
I not only greeted Lu Cenyang,

292
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:27,003
but also let him feel my sincerity.

293
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:28,243
She brought up sincerity to me.

294
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:29,603
Do the Yis have sincerity?

295
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,324
Just as hypocritical as her father.

296
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:33,404
I did smile a bit hypocritically.

297
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:35,044
But he shouldn't be able to tell.

298
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:36,804
Seeing how hard I’m working,

299
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:38,123
wanting to become his employee,

300
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:39,483
he must be very touched.

301
00:16:39,684 --> 00:16:40,564
She pretends and poses

302
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,003
to hide her real intent.

303
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:44,243
Did she underestimate me
or overestimate herself?

304
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:46,483
Then you will succeed very soon..

305
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:49,483
He spent three years

306
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:51,243
to get Pinshang to its current size,

307
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:52,843
directly challenging Yi Hua.

308
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:54,603
He must be very intelligent

309
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:57,284
and probably not as easy as he seems.

310
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,483
If you want to deal with her,
just tell her directly

311
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:01,003
the reason for turning her down

312
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:02,363
is becuase she is from the Yi family

313
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:03,483
and make her give up hope.

314
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:06,884
For someone as shameless as her,

315
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:07,844
the more you say no,

316
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,684
the more it arouses
her combative spirit.

317
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,924
Better to make her think
she sees her goal

318
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,523
but has to endure setbacks
over and over.

319
00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:16,604
After all, she is the daughter
of Yi Minde.

320
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,884
Everyone must

321
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:21,043
pay a price for their actions.

322
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:22,644
Now that I’m here,

323
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,364
I won't leave empty-handed.

324
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:43,283
(Since I've decided to fight
for the long term,)

325
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:45,404
(why not treat this place as a work?)

326
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:47,884
(That way, I can live better)

327
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:50,803
(and give Lu Cenyang a real eye-opener)

328
00:17:50,964 --> 00:17:52,803
(to see what a warm home is like.)

329
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:36,083
(I have to find a way)

330
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,844
(to let him see my design works.)

331
00:19:12,404 --> 00:19:13,323
No.

332
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:41,803
Pick it up for me, please.

333
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:58,644
Thank you.

334
00:20:00,243 --> 00:20:01,124
Filthy.

335
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:06,283
No, that's not what I meant.

336
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:08,723
Look at this, right here.

337
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,684
So downcast?

338
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:15,844
Bro,

339
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:18,644
I was too idealistic.

340
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:21,884
I thought as long as Lu Cenyang sees

341
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:23,604
my works abroad,

342
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:25,323
he will surely be moved.

343
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:26,444
But he

344
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:29,604
didn't even bother to glance at them.

345
00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:32,684
A brief setback is okay.

346
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:35,323
But our spirit must grow stronger
with each setback.

347
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:39,164
The 'see what I got' strategy
doensn't work on Lu Cenyang.

348
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,723
Then let's employ the 'throwibf a sprat
to catch a whale' strategy.

349
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,644
How are we going to do that?

350
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,323
First off, you must undertake a project

351
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:48,563
that can make you famous
in a single battle.

352
00:20:48,844 --> 00:20:51,523
One that Lu Cenyang cannot ignore.

353
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,523
Where can I find such a project now?

354
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:56,723
I have a plan.

355
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:58,124
You'll know in my place.

356
00:20:58,563 --> 00:20:59,083
Let's go.

357
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:07,924
Please come in.

358
00:21:14,043 --> 00:21:15,003
It's quite cozy.

359
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:18,003
Places in this area aren't cheap.

360
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:19,964
Of course.

361
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:22,003
More than 20 years ago,

362
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:24,404
my mom took me abroad alone.

363
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:27,124
She did all kinds
of dirty and tiring jobs,

364
00:21:28,763 --> 00:21:30,523
and she was especially frugal
with herself.

365
00:21:31,884 --> 00:21:32,723
Back then,

366
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:34,523
I would blame her
for not buying me gifts.

367
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:36,763
It wasn't until she passed away

368
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:39,604
that I found out she

369
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:41,364
left me quite a few properties.

370
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:44,924
My mom was obsessed with properties.

371
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:47,323
I remember her mentioning

372
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:50,083
that my dad was originally
an architectural designer.

373
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:52,763
I guess she either hated him too much

374
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,523
or loved him too much.

375
00:21:56,844 --> 00:21:58,684
No wonder you became friends with me.

376
00:21:59,644 --> 00:22:01,124
You are looking fo

377
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:02,884
a father's image on me.

378
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:04,043
Get lost.

379
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:06,404
How about it?

380
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:07,684
I want to entrust

381
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:09,924
this place to you.

382
00:22:11,283 --> 00:22:12,884
Haven't you already renovated it?

383
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:16,364
The renovation is too old-fashioned.

384
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:18,164
You've been setting up so much

385
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:20,563
just to get me
to design your place for free?

386
00:22:21,803 --> 00:22:23,124
Will you take the job?

387
00:22:23,444 --> 00:22:25,243
I am the designer who knows you best.

388
00:22:25,604 --> 00:22:27,404
If you entrusted this place
to someone else,

389
00:22:27,604 --> 00:22:28,803
I would be angry.

390
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:30,803
You're indeed my bestie.

391
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:31,964
You are so reliable.

392
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:36,604
By the way, I had you come over today

393
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:38,043
primarily for this.

394
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:43,043
I also make donations occasionally.

395
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,763
As long as one is a donor,

396
00:22:45,043 --> 00:22:47,604
they receive a custom calendar
from the welfare home every year.

397
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:49,844
That place's facilities
are old and outdated.

398
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:51,803
They plan to renovate it recently.

399
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,083
I inquired about it.

400
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:56,803
And Pinshang is very interested
in the renovation.

401
00:22:57,563 --> 00:22:58,243
Do you want

402
00:22:58,684 --> 00:22:59,604
to take on the challenge?

403
00:23:01,364 --> 00:23:02,723
You can introduce me.

404
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:03,723
I'll take you there tomorrow.

405
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:30,364
(Cenyang,)

406
00:23:31,124 --> 00:23:32,204
(come home with me.)

407
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:35,404
I will teach you a lot in the future.

408
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,523
Once you've learned the skills,

409
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,204
you can do more things
for the welfare home.

410
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,164
You like lollipops, right?

411
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,043
What flavor?

412
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:52,604
I like lemon flavor the best.

413
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,884
My daughter, who is also your sister,

414
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:57,964
likes strawberry flavor.

415
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:00,043
What flavor do you like to eat?

416
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,243
I like lemon flavor.

417
00:24:03,763 --> 00:24:06,164
I've had strawberry-flavored lollipops.

418
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,444
But I gave them away to other kids.

419
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:11,444
You're really great,

420
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:13,803
knowing how to share
at such a young age.

421
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:15,243
It seems

422
00:24:15,563 --> 00:24:17,404
I have a lot to learn from you
in the future.

423
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:21,444
I hope you'll give me more chances
to be with you.

424
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:02,283
(Isn't this Mr. Lu?)

425
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:04,164
Dad? Dad?

426
00:25:04,684 --> 00:25:05,164
Dad!

427
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:06,404
(What happened? Why so desperate?)

428
00:25:09,523 --> 00:25:11,124
(Is this his son? How pitiful!)

429
00:25:12,924 --> 00:25:13,924
Dad!

430
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:17,124
I...

431
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,323
I...

432
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,512
(Hai Shi Business:
Yi Hua is Gluttonious)

433
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:30,364
Miss, why do you stop?

434
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:32,083
My shoelace is untied.

435
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:33,964
I'll take you back once I've tied it.

436
00:25:42,444 --> 00:25:43,763
What a coincidence! Are you a volunteer?

437
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,563
If I had known,
we could have come together

438
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:46,684
Coincidence?

439
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:50,404
I think you are feigning charity

440
00:25:50,644 --> 00:25:51,763
while harboring other motives.

441
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:54,124
I'll be straightforward, then.

442
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:56,204
If you came because you heard

443
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:56,964
about the renovation,

444
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:58,763
you'd better give up.

445
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:00,283
A rookie like you

446
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:02,404
who lives off plagiarizing others' work

447
00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:04,964
doesn't qualify to be the designer
for the renovation here.

448
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:07,283
Qualification is determined by skill,

449
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:08,644
