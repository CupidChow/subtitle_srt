=Episode 1=

20
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:49,171
Welcome to the manuscript exhibition
of Mr. Taylor,

21
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,611
the top-tier interior designer.

22
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,210
This exhibition is held
by the Yihua Group.

23
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,451
We'll interview their President...

24
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:56,210
Hurry.

25
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,410
Mr. Yi Mincai.

26
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,850
Yihua is already
the leading company in town.

27
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:03,330
But you still

28
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,490
have a bad habit
of backstabbing your partners.

29
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:07,850
Verbal assault

30
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,531
won't drag Yihua down from the throne.

31
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,890
(You)

32
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:14,730
(are not qualified to talk to me.)

33
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:19,331
(The unfinished building
shall pass the inspection)

34
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,251
(and be sold at a premium price.)

35
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:22,690
(Let me show you.)

36
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,531
(The fabrication looks authentic, huh?)

37
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:30,811
I have something on your grandson.

38
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:31,730
Can we talk now?

39
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:34,251
(You'd better agree
to the terms I proposed.)

40
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:37,211
Otherwise, the journalists
who came today

41
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,890
might have some unexpected gains.

42
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,730
Not here. Go.

43
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:16,371
Okay.

44
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,811
What are you looking at, lecher?

45
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,850
Nice moves there.

46
00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:29,971
Hey.

47
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:31,850
What are you filming?

48
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:32,931
I'm in a crisis!

49
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:33,931
They are chasing you.

50
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:35,130
It's for self-protection.

51
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:36,531
Delete the video.

52
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:37,651
Chill, I put the beauty cam.

53
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:39,410
Delete the video!

54
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,811
Give it to me!

55
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:50,570
Delete it.

56
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,610
Delete it.

57
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:52,730
Delete it.

58
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,971
Throw yourself into someone's arms

59
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:00,811
in a better place next time.

60
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,131
You tore your clothes apart

61
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,891
to snatch my phone.

62
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,170
What a clumsy thief!

63
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,131
Thief?

64
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:25,571
I'm a thief?

65
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,290
That Taylor guy is the real thief.

66
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,531
I was pointing out that

67
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,531
he stole my work.

68
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:30,531
That's why they

69
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:31,571
chased me here.

70
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,891
Give me my phone.

71
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,730
You can have it back.

72
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:39,971
But I must see you delete the video.

73
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,170
Otherwise, I...

74
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,290
I'll accuse you of harassing me.

75
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,691
This is why I recorded the video.

76
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:50,250
Whoever saw you climbing
the booth in the men's room

77
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:52,331
wouldn't believe you were harassed.

78
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,651
You...

79
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,250
You can dress yourself, right?

80
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:57,370
Put it on.

81
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,170
I...

82
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,290
Once I'm sure you want nothing from me,

83
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,451
I'll delete the video.

84
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:18,971
My business card in the pocket

85
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:20,370
has all my contact info.

86
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:22,211
Call the police if I go back on my word.

87
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,050
Return my coat.

88
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:47,131
What a small world, Mr. Lu.

89
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:51,930
You guys, guard the exits.

90
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:55,451
Don't let anyone
disturb our little conversation.

91
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,290
Mr. Yi, you brought
so many people to greet me?

92
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:02,211
Haven't you learned the lesson?

93
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:04,170
Don't be so smug.

94
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:06,571
You really think that video clip can

95
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:07,290
bring me down?

96
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:09,290
Get him!

97
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:14,730
I bet you don't know

98
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:17,531
what I did
before I established Pinshang.

99
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,011
What are you waiting for? Get him!

100
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:30,091
Hello to everyone
watching my livestream.

101
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,730
Today, we're checking out

102
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,290
Taylor's manuscript exhibition.

103
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,651
As you can see,

104
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,651
the gallery is crowded with visitors.

105
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:40,651
There you are. Get her.

106
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,370
Get both of them!

107
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:44,691
See? So crowded.

108
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,531
Hello, handsome.

109
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,091
Why do you look so serious?

110
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:53,050
There are 5000 viewers online right now.

111
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,571
Come on, face the screen

112
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,691
and say hello to our online friends.

113
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,050
This handsome young man

114
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,490
is too nervous to speak.

115
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,610
It's alright.

116
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:04,691
Over here, there's another handsome guy.

117
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,131
May I interview you briefly?

118
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:11,290
(Ten viewers, impressive.)

119
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:13,730
I'd love to. This way, please.

120
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:16,891
Handsome, want to join us?

121
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:20,691
Alright.

122
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,290
Let's stop teasing him.

123
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:22,971
Now,

124
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:24,531
let's head to Taylor's

125
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:25,771
manuscript exhibition.

126
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:33,290
There are over 20,000 viewers now.

127
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,410
Twenty thousand.

128
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:36,211
I'm not sure who's the charming one,

129
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,250
Taylor or the handsome guy next to me.

130
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,211
Please

131
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,730
give us a good interpretation
of the exhibition.

132
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,211
No problem, this way please.

133
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:58,400
(Conference Room)

134
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,290
Brave lady, you've got the guts

135
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,771
to fool Mr. Yi with your

136
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,250
ten ghost followers.

137
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,410
Mind your own business.

138
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,810
Anyway, it worked, didn't it?

139
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:12,011
Why did you help me?

140
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:15,011
You helped me in the men's room first.

141
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,290
You pissed me off by calling me a thief,

142
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:18,730
but

143
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,290
a favor received must be repaid.

144
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:23,131
It's in my nature to step forward.

145
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,810
Now we're even.

146
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,848
(Delete Video)

147
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,691
Now we're even.

148
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,850
I have to go now.

149
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,770
Mom.

150
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:49,770
Do you realize the damage

151
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,051
you did to Yihua by being careless?

152
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,490
Mom, please calm down.

153
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,370
Grandma.

154
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,130
I could have stopped Lu Cenyang.

155
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,490
But that traitor Bu Ran sided with him.

156
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:02,171
Bu Ran?

157
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,610
Do you have a brain?

158
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,211
You think you can stop him

159
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,010
by catching him

160
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,370
in the art gallery?

161
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,490
He has something on you.

162
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:12,730
How did you happen to be there?

163
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,171
Grandma.

164
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:14,850
Mom.

165
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:16,931
A few years of
overseas education made her

166
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:18,051
quite something.

167
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,411
She caused a scene
on her first day back home,

168
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:22,931
framing Taylor
for stealing her design work.

169
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,211
The exhibition

170
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:26,490
went into utter chaos thanks to her.

171
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:27,850
Seven years ago,

172
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,691
you played tricks

173
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,650
and made me the guarantor
for your student loan.

174
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,691
You want to play
the same old trick again?

175
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,730
Let me ask you, Grandma.

176
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,931
Do you know?

177
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,650
Uncle and his family
are utter hypocrites.

178
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:42,850
They cut off the loan

179
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,490
when I was about to graduate,

180
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,250
and told my mentor

181
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,291
to harass me in exchange for his "help".

182
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:48,370
Mom...

183
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,811
Don't listen to her.

184
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:57,291
If you can't settle such a minor issue,

185
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,931
there's no point in continuing school.

186
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:10,091
You've failed to tell right from wrong.

187
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,571
No wonder you still can't

188
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,811
retire at this age.

189
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,171

Mom.

192
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:20,931
I'm okay.

193
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:23,490
You just got back. Greet Grandma.

194
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,411
Go on, be good.

195
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:29,250
Look how sharp-tongued you are.

196
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:31,490
You're just like your father.

197
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:34,010
You don't get to mention my dad.

198
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:36,650
You know why he's in prison.

199
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,451
He took the blame for you.

200
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,451
And how did you treat my mother and me?

201
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:43,250
If my dad knew you were bullying us,

202
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:44,971
he'd surely regret his decision.

203
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:50,331
Your father defied and betrayed me first

204
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:52,490
and gave up on you all afterward.

205
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,091
Mom.

206
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,211
Mom.

Mom.

208
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,171
Mom, what's wrong?

209
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,691
Mom, what's wrong?

210
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:04,010
Are you feeling unwell?

211
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,051
Get her to the hospital.

212
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:05,971
Mom, answer me.

213
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:06,730
Don't let her die here.

214
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:07,730
Son, are you okay?

215
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,490
I'm okay.

216
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:09,770
Mom, wake up.

217
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,051

Please pay up.

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,051
Doctor, how is my mom?

227
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,691
Cardiogenic shock
from coronary heart disease.

228
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:56,211
Thankfully, you brought her in on time.

229
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:58,331
Or she'd be in serious trouble.

230
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,051
She is no longer
in a critical condition.

231
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:02,250
Thank you, Doctor.

232
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,490
Considering the risk of infection,

233
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,730
we suggest the patient
stay for observation.

234
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:07,530

Speak up.

What can you prove with just a common

00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,770
Grandma.

248
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:20,971
I guess you want to
deal with Lu Cenyang.

249
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:23,171
And I'm the only one in the family

250
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,730
he doesn't guard against.

251
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,250

As long as
certain people don't interfere,

00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,650
you can wait for good news.

Interesting gathering this year.

Great to meet you.

Greetings, Mr. Lin.

281

I'm Lu Cenyang from Pinshang.
Nice to meet you.

I'm Liu Xu from Haohan Stars.

Mr. Liu, pleased to meet you.

284
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,331
Pleased to meet you.

285
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:05,250
I've always found Pinshang's designs

286
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,691
cutting-edge and trendy.

287
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,610
It turns out
there's a mastermind behind it.

288
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:11,331
Let's hang out more.

289
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:12,250
Alright.

290
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,650
Alright, of course.

291
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,571
As far as I know,

292
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:17,091
all of your businesses
are deeply tied to Yihua.

293
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,971
Pinshang may not be a large company,

294
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,931
but stylization
has always been our pursuit.

295
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,691
You're quite straightforward.

296
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:24,250
But it's hard to make it

297
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:27,331
without Yihua's support
in the local market.

298
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,571
Yihua leans on capital

299
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,291
and monopolizes the market.

300
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,931
If you choose to work with them,

301
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,130
you can only

302
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,850
remain as their followers.

303
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,890
The prosperity belongs to Yihua.

304
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:39,291
But you all take the blame
if anything goes wrong.

305
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:42,091
I wonder if any of you have the courage

306
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,571
to join me in creating something new.

307
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:47,291
Well...

308
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,890
I guess I was hasty.

309
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,010
We're making friends today.

310
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:54,971
No business talk.

311
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,250
Yeah.

312
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,411
Hello, everyone.

313
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,931
Isn't this Kerry from
Ruige Building Materials?

314
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:03,331
Sorry, Mr. Liu.

315
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,770
I got delayed.

316
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,890
This is...

317
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:13,850
Mr. Liu.

318
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,490
Aren't you going to introduce me?

319
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,571
You're putting me
in an awkward position.

320
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,370
This is Mr. Lu from Pinshang,
a promising young man.

321
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,530
Hello, Mr. Lu.

322
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,370
Nice to meet you.

323
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:29,331
I heard about your ambition just now.

324
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:32,130
I'm willing to side with you.

325
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,610
I hope we can

326
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,130
join hands to stop the Yi family
from monopolizing

327
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,730
the local market.

328
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,010
Mr. Lu, excuse me for a second.

329
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:49,490
See you around.

330
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,051
We have other guests, too.

331
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,370
Kerry, have a good chat with Mr. Lu.

332
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:55,691
Communicate.

333
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,091
Mr. Lu.

334
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,691
Shall we talk about the details

335
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:02,370
over a drink

336
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,451
somewhere quieter?

337
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,330
Of course. Please.

338
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,090
Alright.

339
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:21,290
Where are you?

340
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:23,250
Come back now.

341
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:26,290
I figured out
how to deal with Lu Cenyang.

342
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,971
It's the monthly
industry summit tonight.

343
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,411
Have Zihe find a social butterfly

344
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,250
to entertain Lu Cenyang.

345
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,371
I'll make him fall from grace.

346
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:40,971
Uncle's family always plays dirty.

347
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,570
But it offers me a chance
to get close to him.

348
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,971
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Lu.

349
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,730
I admire your courage and insight.

350
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,250
You're much more pleasant
to talk to compared to those

351
00:17:56,411 --> 00:17:57,730
old and cowardly foxes.

352
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,931
The price and quality of
the building materials I can offer you

353
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:15,411
are as tempting as my figure.

354
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:18,570
Aren't you afraid of
being blacklisted by Yihua?

355
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,810
It depends on

356
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,250
whether you are worth my trust.

357
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,810
You are a lady with stunning beauty.

358
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,971
I dare not enjoy your favor.

359
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:43,131
Otherwise, I'd become
the common enemy here.

360
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:47,530
I'd like to make friends with you.

361
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:48,770
Let's drink.

362
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,371
Cenyang, so you're here.

363
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:57,371
***

364
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:58,530
I've come to admire

365
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,730
the honey trap here.

366
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,730
Don't drive me away, okay?

367
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:05,050
Hello, I'm Bu Ran,

368
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:07,050
Cenyang's friend.

369
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,851
I'm Kerry.

370
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:21,010
Ms. Bu.

371
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:23,770
A nice figure is natural.

372
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,451
You can't force it.

373
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,691
A woman's beauty comes from within,

374
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,290
not from exposure.

375
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,490
I heard that Mr. Lu is immune to women.

376
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,010
It seems Ms. Bu is an exception.

377
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,570
Of course.

378
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:47,530
(Still not leaving?)

379
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,290
(Here's my lethal strike.)

380
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:51,651
I took a fancy to Cenyang

381
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,530
the first time I met him.

382
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:56,971
His handsome face
with its distinct features

383
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,851
and his robust chest muscles

384
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,611
caught my eye.

385
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,371
I simply couldn't resist.

386
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,371
Mr. Lu, I wish to collaborate with you.

387
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,530
But this confidante of yours

388
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,050
doesn't seem to welcome me.

389
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:17,371
You know

390
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,530
I'm the only one who would

391
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,611
choose you over Yihua.

392
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,010
You can't look down on me

393
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,570
just because I'm a woman.

394
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,611
Ms. Kerry.

395
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,290
I certainly didn't think that way.

396
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,050
Then we will be one after this drink.

397
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:40,530
Kerry.

398
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:42,931
I'll take Ran home later.

399
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:45,131
(Ran)
I really can't drink.

400
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:47,490
Mr. Lu, are you rejecting me?

401
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,171
I'll get you a designated driver.

402
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,530
Cenyang says he'd
drive me home, which means

403
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,050
he doesn't want a third wheel.

404
00:20:57,851 --> 00:20:58,651
Ms. Bu.

405
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,530
Mr. Lu is so sweet to you.

406
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,490
Don't utilize his favoritism.

407
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:06,451
Mr. Lu, show me some respect
and finish this champagne.

408
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:08,371
I assure you that I'll offer

409
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,131
greater help than
Mr. Lin and Mr. Liu combined.

410
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,770
Mr. Lu is never the passive one
waiting to be chosen.

411
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,490
I drank it for him.

412
00:21:25,131 --> 00:21:26,010
See you around.

413
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,290
Kerry, Ran can't drink.

414
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:30,611
I have to take her home.

415
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,330
Excuse us.

416
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:55,330
Hey, don't...

417
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,611
Don't touch the steering wheel.

418
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,971
Hey, sit properly.

419
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,171
It's too hot.

420
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,611
Do you know how dangerous it is?

421
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:14,090
It's just a champagne. Seriously?

422
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,131
I...

423
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,570
Are you seriously so drunk?

424
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:25,090
You do look quite handsome
from this angle.

425
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:26,810
You...

426
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,691
Stop it or I'm going to be mad.

427
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,250
Hey.

428
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,810
What's wrong with you?

429
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:43,810
We will be one after this drink.

430
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,090
Calm down, I'll go get you some water.

431
00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:58,090
Don't go.

432
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:08,090
Calm down. I bet it was Kerry.

433
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:12,250
Hey.

434
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,050
Hey.

435
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,371
Hey.

436
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:22,171
Hey.

437
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,530
Slow down, be careful.

438
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,010
I need some air. It's too hot.

439
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:31,371
I have to tie you up.

440
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,131
Otherwise, you won't behave.

441
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,211
Don't move.

442
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,411
Breeze.

443
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,050
Breeze.

444
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,530
Come down from there.

445
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:43,971
Calm down.

446
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,371
Have some water.

447
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:46,490
Here.

448
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:52,851
Kiss me.

449
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,090
Come on. Give me a break!
I'm not kissing you!

450
00:23:56,371 --> 00:23:58,691
Kisses. I want kisses.

451
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:01,810
Kiss kiss.

452
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,330
Kiss kiss.

453
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,530
Don't come in. Sleep outside.

454
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:12,211
Control yourself.

455
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,250
Help!

456
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,770
Help!

457
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,131
Where am I?

458
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,891
Lu Cenyang, you hypocrite!

459
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,050
Come out!

460
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:06,971
How dare you

461
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,131
bring a girl home without permission!

462
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:11,651
Are you sure?

463
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,250
"Are you sure"?

464
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,330
Lu Cenyang, you're dead.

465
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:16,810
I will send you to prison.

466
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:17,971
Just wait

467
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,770
until you watch this.

468
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,290
You see?

469
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,090
Who forced her way in?

470
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,570
Who threw herself into my arms?

471
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,211
By the way,

472
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,490
pay for my clothes

473
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:27,371
you tore apart

474
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,530
and puked on.

475
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,050
You stayed over for one night.

476
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,090
Let's say it's 300 yuan
for a standard room.

477
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,891
And my mental distress...

478
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:35,290
I'll let you off

479
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:36,530
since you are a lady.

480
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,290
Reasonable demands, right?

481
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:51,330
How did you know I was there last night?

482
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:54,250
And how did you know
someone was setting me up?

483
00:26:56,171 --> 00:26:57,810
Was Kerry the schemer?

484
00:26:57,971 --> 00:26:59,330
Were you also trying to benefit?

485
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,371
I went there...

486
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:04,691
(I can't tell him
I'm from the Yi family.)

487
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,691
Because I saw someone

488
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,730
filming you sneakily!

489
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:08,490
You should

490
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:09,971
be grateful to me!

491
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,451
Besides, I agreed to compensate you.

492
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,451
It's your turn.

493
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:15,691
I basically saved your life.

494
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:16,411
I basically saved your life.

495
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,371
How will you thank me?

496
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:28,971
If I knew you'd do this to me,

497
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:30,971
I might as well go with Kerry.

498
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,211
Stop.

499
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:33,971
I did that because

500
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,010
I was drugged, okay?

501
00:27:35,171 --> 00:27:36,931
I knew you were drugged.

502
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,010
That's why I suffered

503
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:39,171
without complaint.

504
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,371
You saved me.

505
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,931
I can pretend nothing happened.

506
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:42,971
Hey.

507
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,050
Don't make it

508
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:45,730
sound like you're bullied, okay?

509
00:27:45,891 --> 00:27:46,371
I...

510
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,290
I haven't even dated anyone.
I've lost out big time.

511
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:53,770
That's enough.

512
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,651
Get out.

513
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:56,131
I-I still have things to say.

514
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,330
Hear me out.

515
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,211
Don't... Hear me out!

516
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,770
Are you done?

517
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,371
No matter how you put it,

518
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,651
I sacrificed a lot for you.

519
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:12,211
Let's call it even.

520
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,691
But you must promise me something.

521
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,891
As long as you don't cling to me,

522
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:16,931
go ahead.

523
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,770
Who wants you?

524
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,250
I want to join Pinshang.

525
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:25,171
Pinshang

526
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,730
is not a place just for anyone.

527
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:27,810
There is no shortcut.

528
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,050
(If Grandma knew I failed,)

529
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:35,451
(she'd let my mom die.)

530
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,010
