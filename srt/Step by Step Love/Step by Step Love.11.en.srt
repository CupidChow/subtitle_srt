=Episode 11=

20
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:51,972
(Ran, have you noticed)

21
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:54,172
(that you can't seem to stop
talking about Lu Cenyang?)

22
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:57,972
How could I possibly fall for a mean guy

23
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,491
who can upset me for quite some time
with just a few words?

24
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,571
He just rejected cooperating
with Mr. Liu for my sake

25
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:04,812
and exposed Taylor's crimes.

26
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,571
In front of my grandma,

27
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:09,652
he defended me.

28
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:13,252
He showed compassion
for the children in the orphanage.

29
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:16,571
Could that really make me fall for him?

30
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:21,891
(He has a girlfriend.)

31
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:25,291
(It's just a secret affair.)

32
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:28,851
If I did anything wrong, at most,

33
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:30,372
I saw your romantic

34
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:31,532
relationship with Ms. Yao.

35
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:32,812
I'm not blind.

36
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:35,171
The way you rushed
to the hospital just now,

37
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:36,131
doesn't that explain it?

38
00:02:36,772 --> 00:02:37,611
Let me reiterate.

39
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,212
I am not dating Ms. Yao.

40
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:40,532
We are purely business partners.

41
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:41,451
Do you understand?

42
00:02:41,772 --> 00:02:42,691
I don't need your explanation.

43
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:44,731
Boss, who you like
is none of my business.

44
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:46,291
Could it be

45
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,332
that I am jealous?

46
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:17,932
Now the meeting starts.

47
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:19,691
Please open the files
we sorted out yesterday.

48
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,412
(To Bu Ran: The account number
for the rent penalty is...)

49
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,568
(To Lu Cenyang: The account number
for the rent penalty is...)

50
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,131
Bu Ran,

51
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,891
we're in a meeting. Be serious.

52
00:03:57,836 --> 00:03:59,619
(Lu Cenyang)

53
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:55,811
Thanks to you on that day.

54
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:59,572
But you have to keep
my health condition a secret.

55
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:01,132
Normally, I don't gossip

56
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:02,251
with my colleagues.

57
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:05,132
You're really funny.

58
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,811
Are you free tonight?

59
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:11,411
Shall we grab a drink?

60
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,491
(Ms. Yao has been overseeing)

61
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:14,731
(internal operations
of the company.)

62
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,171
(Maintain a certain distance from her.)

63
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,291
When you're in good shape,

64
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,692
we can have a drink by then.

65
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:21,731
You refused my invitation.

66
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:24,772
Did the boss say something?

67
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:31,572
This is really useful.

68
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:32,811
I like it very much.

69
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:35,532
Come on, let's have a drink.

70
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:38,892
The boss can't interfere
with our friendship.

71
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,051
Alright then.

72
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,291
You are not asking me out

73
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:55,572
just to thank me, right?

74
00:05:57,371 --> 00:05:58,411
It's also because I discovered

75
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:00,452
your relationship with Mr. Lu, right?

76
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:05,371
What kind of relationship did you find
I have with Mr. Lu?

77
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:08,171
Office romance
doesn't usually go public,

78
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:10,171
let alone relationship
between a boss and a secretary.

79
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:12,452
I understand that you don't
want to go public with it.

80
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:15,772
Why do you think

81
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:18,291
that Mr. Lu and I are secretly dating?

82
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:19,772
You fainted.

83
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:20,811
I didn't tell him.

84
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:22,532
But he rushed there right away

85
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:24,452
and was very anxious.

86
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:26,532
He even warned me fiercely

87
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:28,532
as if I violated some sacred law.

88
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:31,851
A domineering boss

89
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:33,251
always has some strange reasons

90
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:34,692
for not wanting it to go public.

91
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:35,692
I understand that.

92
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,772
I promise to keep my mouth shut.

93
00:06:38,092 --> 00:06:39,532
I don't want to lose my job.

94
00:06:41,212 --> 00:06:43,171
My headache is an old problem.

95
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:45,731
Dr. Ma is my attending physician.

96
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:47,291
He must have informed the boss.

97
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:49,452
If I were to be hospitalized,

98
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:51,731
it would definitely affect many things
at the company.

99
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,171
How could the boss not be worried?

100
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:58,012
I'm just Mr. Lu's subordinate.

101
00:06:58,332 --> 00:06:59,051
Is that so?

102
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:02,012
Don't worry.

103
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:04,051
Whatever you say goes.

104
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:05,051
I'll take your word for it.

105
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:07,491
Why don't you believe me?

106
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:09,611
I can't wait for Mrs. Lu to appear

107
00:07:09,772 --> 00:07:10,371
to marry him.

108
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,291
So I won't be the one
pushed out to take the hits.

109
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:17,411
Mr. Lu has been single
for so many years.

110
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:20,572
I even suspect there might be an issue
with his sexual orientation.

111
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:22,532
Could it be?

112
00:07:23,212 --> 00:07:25,692
Which type do you think he likes?

113
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:28,731
Masculine or feminine?

114
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,731
I think it should be...

115
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,652
Isn't this the famous designer Bu Ran?

116
00:07:34,332 --> 00:07:36,652
You secured the Welfare Center Project
at such a young age.

117
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:40,012
You truly have a promising future.

118
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,811
Who is this beauty?

119
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:47,811
Aren't you going to introduce her?

120
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,212
She is my friend,

121
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:51,731
not someone you can flirt with.

122
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:54,132
I'm not saying I want to flirt with her.

123
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:56,452
A toast, shall we?

124
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:57,931
Come on.

125
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:08,251
Bu Ran,

126
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:09,892
who do you think you are?

127
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:11,171
Dare to splatter me in public?

128
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,851
Are you going crazy?

129
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:20,012
Mr. Yi,

130
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:22,652
Pinshang dealt with you a few times.

131
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:24,931
You don't even know me,

132
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:25,972
Mr. Lu's secretary.

133
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,731
Your intelligence work
is so poor, isn't it?

134
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:35,172
You are just Lu Cenyang's secretary.

135
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:37,371
I can't see what's so special.

136
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:39,332
You really think highly
of yourself, don't you?

137
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:41,531
Mr. Yi, I've heard
quite a lot of gossips

138
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:42,891
about you.

139
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,172
You are the most talked-about man
in the industry.

140
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:49,452
All the women you are interested in

141
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:51,572
will get taken care of
by the Meng Family.

142
00:08:53,572 --> 00:08:54,771
One must be quite blind

143
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:57,011
to try to become your companion.

144
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:58,371
Bu Ran,

145
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:00,771
he just called me a beauty.

146
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:03,332
Should I hurry up and buy an amulet

147
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:04,812
to ward off evil for myself?

148
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:07,172
Let's go.

149
00:09:07,332 --> 00:09:09,011
Stop! Make yourself clear.

150
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:09,932
Let go.

151
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:14,011
Believe it or not,

152
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:16,452
I'll have a colleague
from the Legal Department talk to you

153
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,332
and help you become even more famous.

154
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:24,491
Let's go.

155
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,491
I didn't expect you to be so good
at confronting people.

156
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:34,851
I just drank some wine.

157
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:36,891
Such a killjoy.

158
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:38,251
I haven't had enough.

159
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,092
In that case,

160
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:41,011
let's continue at my place.

161
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:43,292
Okay.

162
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,092
Let's go.

163
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:47,371
Cheers.

164
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:56,972
Your house is really beautiful.

165
00:09:57,932 --> 00:09:59,731
You've arranged
the inconspicuous old things

166
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,452
so elegantly.

167
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:02,332
Beautiful, isn't it?

168
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:04,572
When I studied abroad,

169
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:06,611
I designed for some friends
who couldn't afford

170
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:07,452
to decorate houses.

171
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:09,332
They didn't know
how to express their gratitude.

172
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:11,692
So I would accept these things
they didn't want.

173
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,332
Small stools,

174
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:14,771
picture frames,

175
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,092
and some old flowerpots.

176
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:18,412
These things

177
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:20,531
bear the imprint of life

178
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:23,052
as well as the friendship between us.

179
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:26,932
It took quite an effort
to bring them back.

180
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,452
I can see you really like designing.

181
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:30,491
That's why you decorated

182
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:31,812
your house so carefully.

183
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:34,212
No matter how much I love designing,

184
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:36,611
it's just as hard
to find a job back home.

185
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:41,172
There's actually a little trick
to this renovation.

186
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:42,812
I want to hear it.

187
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:46,371
I got rejected at the interview
with Pinshang.

188
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:47,891
I was quite unconvinced.

189
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:49,611
I found out the apartment
opposite Mr. Lu's was vacant.

190
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:51,371
I managed to rent it

191
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:53,812
so that Mr. Lu could see my talent.

192
00:10:54,332 --> 00:10:55,491
He couldn't afford to miss

193
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:56,651
a designer with much sentiment.

194
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:57,891
You succeeded, didn't you?

195
00:10:58,052 --> 00:10:59,572
Not at all.

196
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:02,891
Mr. Lu told me to take the opportunity
of living in a high-end community

197
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:05,172
to scope out more
high-net-worth clients downstairs.

198
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,332
He wished me prosperity.

199
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:11,092
Mr. Lu trusts you a lot now.

200
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:14,052
He's entrusted you with the most valued
projects of the company.

201
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:17,212
I believe you'll definitely
make your mark in the future.

202
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:19,531
I hope so.

203
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:21,212
I just hope

204
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:23,251
he won't stand by me one moment

205
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:24,692
and turn his back the next.

206
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,572
Being fickle, changing like the weather.

207
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:29,212
Ms. Yao,

208
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:32,292
you just said his orientation
was questionable.

209
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:35,651
I was just kidding.

210
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:38,371
Mr. Lu's orientation is normal.

211
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:41,812
He just doesn't fall for someone easily.

212
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:43,412
Why?

213
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:45,972
Because once he has someone he likes,

214
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:48,851
he gains a vulnerability
that adversaries can exploit.

215
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,851
That's why he doesn't easily
show his feelings.

216
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:53,292
I see.

217
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:55,172
He has it tough too.

218
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:57,371
You two live next door.

219
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:59,611
Has he extended any neighborly courtesy?

220
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:01,131
Don't mention it.

221
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,092
The first time I went to work,
I had a flat tire.

222
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:04,172
I hoped to hitch a ride.

223
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:06,092
He told me to take a taxi by myself

224
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:08,131
and quickly drove off by himself.

225
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:11,531
It sounds like something he would do.

226
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:15,371
Next time his car breaks down,
you should also tell him to take a taxi.

227
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:17,212
I will have him run behind my car.

228
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:18,812
Come on.

229
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:19,452
Cheers.

(Industry Competition: Data, Trends,

231
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:39,212
As soon as I got back,

232
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:41,011
the female client got very angry.

233
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:42,212
I just kept apologizing.

234
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:43,771
I kept apologizing.

235
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:45,292
That made me so mad.

236
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:47,172
I really was...

237
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:48,531
When I went back, I wanted to...

238
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:50,292
Bu Ran.

239
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:54,131
Ms. Yao, let's continue to drink.

240
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:56,332
Get up. It's cold on the ground.

241
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:57,972
My drink...

242
00:12:58,452 --> 00:12:59,572
My drink.

243
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:00,611
Get up.

244
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:01,531
My drink.

(Voice call)

248
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:27,572
What took you so long?

249
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:43,212
Come in.

250
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:49,172
I just wanted to test

251
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,692
Bu Ran's depth of character,

252
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:52,692
I didn't expect she got drunk so easily.

253
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:54,092
Wait for a sec.

254
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:55,332
I will take you home in a while.

255
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:56,212
No need.

256
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:57,891
Hello, Sir.

257
00:13:58,292 --> 00:13:59,092
I'm coming down.

258
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:01,292
The car I called for is here.

259
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:03,412
Carry her to the bed.
Don't let her catch a cold.

260
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:04,292
I'm leaving.

261
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:05,172
Take care.

262
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:06,212
I'm off.

263
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:14,972
Ms. Yao,

264
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:18,172
we had a great chat today.

265
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,251
It was satisfying to vent about Mr. Lu.

266
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:23,851
You may think Mr. Lu
is good at business,

267
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,932
but he has a stupid side.

268
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:29,651
Not just one side,

269
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,851
but many sides.

270
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:34,731
Like a wooden fish that only
makes noise when knocked.

271
00:14:57,572 --> 00:14:58,412
Ms. Yao,

272
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,692
thank you for being willing
to be my friend.

273
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:05,572
All these years,

274
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,212
I just

275
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:11,651
went all out to pursue a goal alone.

276
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:16,891
No wonder Mr. Lu wants me
to cooperate with everyone on the team.

277
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,452
I simply don't know how to make friends

278
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:23,531
or how to cooperate with everyone.

279
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,332
Although...

280
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:30,972
But...

281
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,332
If I can't make it
to the groundbreaking ceremony,

282
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,932
I would feel very regretful.

283
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,371
I also want to make friends properly.

284
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:51,932
I also want to put my heart into it.

285
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:55,371
But what should I do?

286
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:07,895

289
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:11,251
Good morning, Boss.

290
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:12,972
It's not very early now.

291
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,051
Remember, you have to
reduce the rent as promised.

292
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:17,932
Do your ears work intermittently?

293
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:20,091
You heard very clearly
when it comes to rent reduction.

294
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:23,612
Why is it so little today?

295
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,011
I had a little alcohol last night.

296
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:29,612
I overcooked the porridge.

297
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,731
You can't drink much, right?

298
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:35,091
Who are you looking down on?

299
00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:36,811
I can drink a bit.

300
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:38,932
It's just that I'm not used to drinking.

301
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:41,531
You have the talent
to tell bare-faced lies.

302

You're cut out for marketing.

303
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:44,731
Keep working out
in the Marketing Department.

304
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:51,251
Today is the groundbreaking ceremony
for renovation of the Welfare Center.

305
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:52,771
There'll be many distinguished guests.

306
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:54,531
Don't embarrass me today.

307
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:58,011
Can I go there?

308
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,811
Go change into something more formal.

309
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:01,011
We'll head out together.

310
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:02,011

Bu Ran,

351
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:13,051
you'll inevitably interact with Ms. Hua.

352
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:16,172
If Ms. Hua lifts a finger,
the construction will be affected.

353
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:18,612
You have to listen to her instructions.

354
00:21:18,932 --> 00:21:20,811
If you want to finish
on schedule with good quality,

355
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:23,051
you must remember her admonitions.

00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:29,051
as the representative of the contractor,

00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:31,491
please say a few words to everyone.

359
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:34,771
Director, I grew up here.

360
00:21:35,412 --> 00:21:37,172
I'm about to say goodbye to my old home.

361
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:38,571
It's hard to part with it.

362
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,251

00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:44,251
please make a speech on my behalf

from a designer's perspective.

366
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:48,692
Tell everyone our intentions and will.

00:21:57,331 --> 00:21:58,771
Yes, Bu Ran.

369
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,372
Bu Ran, please say a few words.

370
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,491
Thank you for your encouragement.

371
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:27,452
Actually, when I first came
to measure this place,

372
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:29,331
I came with a naive mindset

373
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:30,771
to work

374
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,652
on an awesome project.

375
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:35,571
But when I stepped into the orphanage,

376
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,372
I didn't see an opportunity

377
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:40,571
but the innocent smiles of the children.

378
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:43,491
I felt ashamed.

379
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:45,212
On their faces,

380
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:48,291
you can always see positivity
and optimism.

381
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:52,132
They help each other
and love each other.

382
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,412
They used magical lollipops

383
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:59,491
to inspire me to return to my original
aspiration in learning spatial design.

384
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:02,692
For me,

385
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,251
this is an opportunity

386
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:06,652
filled with endless possibilities
and challenges.

387
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,652
For the children,

388
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,652
this is their home,

389
00:23:12,972 --> 00:23:14,932
carrying the future and warmth.

390
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,251
I realized

391
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:19,531
that good spatial design

392
00:23:19,852 --> 00:23:21,412
could make its users

393
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:23,612
find the missing pieces of happiness.

394
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:27,251
I hope you can continue to support
the renovation of the Welfare Center.

395
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:31,251
Let's give this place
a new life together.

396
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:34,852

402

Bu Ran, the magic has worked.

403
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:28,091
I really like the new classroom.

404
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:29,172
Do you like it?

405
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:31,172
Yes.

406
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:32,852
Uncle Lu is quite amazing.

407
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:34,731
He used the best materials for us.

408
00:25:34,892 --> 00:25:37,251

about the moldy walls

410
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:40,291
Uncle Lu, Bu Ran,

411
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,172
we want to play games in the classroom.

412
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:43,771
Can you play with us?

they have to give me a kiss, okay?

- Okay.

Bu Ran,

463
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:25,852
you must come and help then.

464
00:28:26,091 --> 00:28:26,692
No problem.

465
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:27,372
Okay.

466
00:28:28,612 --> 00:28:29,932
We should also take a look then.

467
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:31,212

Mr. Lu could be so childlike.

472
00:28:37,612 --> 00:28:38,251
Indeed.

473
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:39,452
Really, Mr. Lu.

474
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:40,972

take more pictures next time.

You...

478
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:55,852

how cute these children are.

482
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:14,852
Why do I feel your face

483
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:16,331
looks bigger in this photo?

484
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:18,692
Take a look.

485
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:20,412
No way.

486
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:21,531
I was in the front.

487
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:22,412
Let me see.

488
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:32,051
When you are not in a photo,

489
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:34,172
your face is quite big in reality too.

490
00:29:34,692 --> 00:29:35,972
You're talking nonsense.

491
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:44,972
I have a very important proposal
to review.

492
00:29:45,132 --> 00:29:46,212
Go to the company and find it.

493
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:47,412
Then bring it to my house.

494
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:53,412
What are you needed for?

495
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,452
I have a very important proposal
to review.

496
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:57,731
Go to the company and find it.

497
00:29:57,892 --> 00:29:58,892
Then bring it to my house.

498
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:03,932
What's the matter?

499
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,172
Going back to the company.

500
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:09,892
Why are you going back
to the company at this hour?

501
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:11,412
The boss is ruthless. No choice.

502
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,612
Being a boss is really something.

503
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:22,612
You have to make me get the proposal.

504
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:30,491
You opened the door way too quickly.

505
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:32,091
If you complained a bit louder,

506
00:30:32,251 --> 00:30:33,852
I could wait for you downstairs.

507
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:38,412
I was just rapping to kill the time.

508
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:43,892
Are you making tea?

509
00:30:44,972 --> 00:30:46,852
The fragrance of your tea
can even be smelled downstairs.

510
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:49,251
Well, I shouldn't let your effort
be in vain.

511
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:51,091
You've had your fill at the Old Pal's.

512
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:52,892
You should come back for some tea
to freshen up.

513
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:56,731
You might as well say

514
00:30:56,892 --> 00:30:58,932
that you felt bad about sending me
to get the proposal.

515
00:31:03,331 --> 00:31:04,771
How did you know I went to Old Pal's?

516
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:07,852
Well...

517
00:31:08,011 --> 00:31:10,132
Your daily routine is so predictable.

518
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:12,452
Want some tea?

519
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:29,571
Nice tea set.

520
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:33,172
Finely crafted.

521
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:34,652
And the patina is quite thick.

522
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:38,051
I'm too lazy to use them
when I have tea alone.

523
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,412
I feel a bit guilty to them.

524
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,531
If you like them, I'll give them to you.

525
00:31:46,212 --> 00:31:47,652
Tea sets need to be maintained.

526
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:51,612
You're too lazy to use them,
so you want me to maintain them for you.

527
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:54,212
Is that how you see me? Always looking
to take advantage of others?

528
00:31:54,531 --> 00:31:55,892
A gift is a gift.

529
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,452
When you run errands for me,

530
00:31:57,612 --> 00:31:58,932
just do it willingly.

531
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,091
No gains without pains.

532
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:05,811
How can I simply accept such valuable

533
00:32:05,972 --> 00:32:06,972
tea sets without a reason?

534
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:09,692
(Am I being too obviously nice to her?)

535
00:32:10,892 --> 00:32:13,251
If you think it's too valuable,

536
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:18,531
take a look at these design drawings

537
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:19,372
and find faults.

538
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,452
Give me a report
before you get off work tomorrow.

539
00:32:22,612 --> 00:32:23,652
I was wondering.

540
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:25,251
Something's behind it.

541
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:27,412
You want me to offend
the colleagues in the Design Dept.?

542
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:28,852
I won't do it.

543
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:30,531
Good night.

544
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,892
(I wanted to give her something.)

545
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:38,692
(How come it made her angry?)

546
00:32:49,412 --> 00:32:50,811
Only I will read the report.

547
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:52,731
If the suggestion is satisfactory to me,

548
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:54,452
I'll transfer you to Design Dept.

549
00:33:04,932 --> 00:33:05,571
Boss,

550
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:10,531
I don't think the good tea
