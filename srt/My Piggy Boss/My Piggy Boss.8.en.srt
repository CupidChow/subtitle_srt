It's the inheritance left by your grandfather.

190
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,420
It's about this much.

191
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,280
How come I never knew?

192
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,130
We were afraid you wouldn't work hard after knowing it.

193
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,450
Keep a low profile.

194
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,860
Don't flaunt our wealth.

195
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,590
I haven't decided whether I should donate it all in the future.

196
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,750
Just donate your body.

197
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,440
Don't listen to your dad.

198
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,740
You're our only daughter.

199
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,350
The two billion will surely be yours in the future.

200
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,270
So, you must think about it carefully.

201
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,650
Don't get yourself

202
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,600
some random CEO boyfriend.

203
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,840
I'll make an explanation for Mr. Zhu.

204
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,480
Mr. Zhu is not an ordinary trust fund baby.

205
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,230
He's a man of great enterprise.

206
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,070
He's a self-made entrepreneur.

207
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,130
He paved his own way

208
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,600
and founded Dingtian Optoelectronics on his own.

209
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,760
It became an enterprise

210
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,490
that takes up 30% of Yiwu's colored lighting market.

211
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,170
Right. Besides, he's very creative.

212
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,850
Anyway, I can't say enough about his strengths.

213
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,490
But he has only one weakness.

214
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,290
As a trust fund baby, he's also a man of great enterprise?

215
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,250
That won't do.

216
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,510
Right.

217
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,490
Isn't it good to be ambitious?

218
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,070
It's okay for a trust fund baby to be a playboy,

219
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,070
but he can't be ambitious.

220
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,380
It's okay for a trust fund baby to love partying,

221
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,740
but he shouldn't prove himself.

222
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,680
It's okay for a trust fund baby to...

223
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,000
Stop it.

224
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,010
Ordinary people may only

225
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,790
spend over a million a year

226
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,840
if he squanders money.

227
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,400
But if you start up a company,

228
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,200
it's super easy for the next three generations to be poor.

229
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,800
Yes.

230
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,410
Xiaozhu, what's his weakness you just mentioned?

231
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:12,970
What time

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,800
is it now?

233
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Uncle, Auntie.

234
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,570
I still have work to do in the company.

235
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,250
I have to go.

236
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,740
See you next time, okay?

237
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,290
Goodbye.

238
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,850
See you next time.

239
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,430
He ran away just like that.

240
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,710
Mom, have some fruit first.

241
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,400
I'll pass.

242
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,160
Promise us

243
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,910
you won't be with him.

244
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,960
Don't worry.

245
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,820
I won't be with him.

246
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,730
Besides, he won't like me.

247
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,790
[CEO Office]

248
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,800
What are you doing?

249
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,150
Mr. Zhu.

250
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,240
You scared me.

251
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,950
What's up?

252
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,990
Finish it in an hour.

253
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,870
I need it for tomorrow's meeting.

254
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,660
It's too urgent.

255
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,050
You can get it back to me before you get off work.

256
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,140
Thank you, Boss.

257
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,240
Where are the others?

258
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,270
They haven't come yet,

259
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,870
so I thought I'd organize the documents first.

260
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,910
I'll come back

261
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,440
after they come.

262
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,740
You go first.

263
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,930
You go first.

264
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,560
Okay.

265
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,740
I've finished organizing the documents.

266
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,840
I'll go home if there's nothing else.

267
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,520
Okay.

268
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,670
Do you want to go together?

269
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,100
It's okay. You can go first.

270
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,160
The sun is setting.

271
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,520
My pet bag happens to be in the office.

272
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,630
If you don't mind...

273
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,590
I know what to do.

274
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,800
I could go home in time before you found me.

275
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,690
There's no need for an outsider to worry about me.

276
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,200
Outsider?

277
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,910
You don't have to say that.

278
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,380
I'll get going then.

279
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,560
Wait.

280
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,280
What?

281
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,050
These days, I...

282
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,280
[Hongguang Technology's stock price reached new high.]

283
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,310
Make an appointment with Ms. Hou for me in the next couple of days.

284
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay.
