It'll be too late if you can't find your true love before you turn 27.

164
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,740

and you kissed me.

169
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
You even confessed your love to me at twilight.

170
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,159
The vibe was so great.

It's only been a few days,

172

yet you started pursuing someone else as soon as you didn't get the result you wanted.

173
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,010
Just like your company, all you know is making money.

174
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,930
But have you ever thought that

175
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,380
this relationship was utilitarian in the first place?

176
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:50,980
Just

177
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,480
be a doormat.

178
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,590
You only need to have a clear conscience.

179
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,590
They have the foundation for love.

180
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,870
They are in the same league.

182
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,920
If he can't find his true love, he'll be a pig forever.

183
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,640
Is it wrong for him to pursue true love bravely?

184
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,950
Why does he have to cultivate

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,160
a hopeless relationship with you?

186
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,780
Why is it so hard to like someone?

187
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,660
I've been keeping a low profile for 24 years.

188
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,860
Finally, this day has come.

189
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,730
The electronic firecrackers project

190
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,290
planned and mainly run by me

191
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,120
has finally been launched.

192
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,659
Let's raise our glasses to celebrate this happy occasion.

193
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,730
Who are you talking to?

194
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,600
You came at the right time.

195
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,580
Come on. Let's celebrate the new phase in my work.

196
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,560
And let's celebrate that my life has come to a dead end.

197
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,100
What happened?

198
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,280
Tell me, the winner in life, about it.

199
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,180
Did something happen

200
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,190
to your relationship with Zhu Xiaoyang?

201
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,560
I guess it's over.

202
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,110
Why?

203
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,370
We agreed to give it a try,

204
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,900
but it stopped all of a sudden.

205
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,160
Give it a try? What's that nonsense coming out of a scumbag?

206
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,630
It was me who said it.

207
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,960
Nice move. Playing hard to get.

208
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,250
I didn't expect that although you're inexperienced in love,

209
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,600
you have quite a few moves.

210
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
But

211
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,660
Zhu Xiaoyang has been avoiding me on purpose lately.

212
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,180
Then take the initiative.

213
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,970
How?

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,720
It's time for me to get to work.

215
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,480
I've already come up with a full plan

216
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,000
of getting Zhu Xiaoyang back.

217
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,320
I,

218
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,050
Dingtian's senior product manager,

219
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,140
has been focusing on colored lights for 10 years

220
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,500
and romance for 20 years.

221
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,830
No one knows how to light up

222
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,520
a heart better than me.

223
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,080
What's wrong with you?

224
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
Go away.

225
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,960
First,

226
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,520
imitate.

227
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,240
Since he likes someone like Hou Hongguang,

228
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,840
you can't imitate her.

229
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,640
You have to surpass her.

230
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,760
This way, you'll attract his attention.

231
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,350
Is this the song?

232
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,620
I think it went like this.

233
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,480
Is Hou Hongguang also so tone-deaf?

234
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,160
I don’t know about that.

235
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,520
Is this the song?

236
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,920
It seems to be this one.

237
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,520
Is there a thief in the house?

238
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,480
Xiaoyang.

239
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,760
Are you familiar with this song?

240
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,920
No.

241
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,720
Well,

242
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,870
this dress...

243
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,160
The first move was too shallow indeed.

244
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,770
You have to correct it in time to succeed.

245
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,680
I have another move.

246
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,340
[Imitate Surpass]

247
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,200
Make him jealous.

248
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,360
Hello, are you new here?

249
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,100
Yang Xiaozhu.

250
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,830
I joined the company together with you.

251
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,030
I sat next to you during the newcomer training, remember?

252
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,670
You're so humorous.

253
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,610
You're so funny.

254
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,360

You can ask me if you have any questions.

257

I made this.

I'm from the IT department.

259
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,330
You said you wanted to ask me out to see a movie this weekend?

260
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:15,800
Sure.

262
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,520
You need to work overtime this weekend.

263
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,480
But Boss, I have a date.

264
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,720
Go ahead then.

266
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,920
Is it true that we'll go to a movie this weekend?

267
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,880
No.

268
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,050
Yang Xiaozhu.

269
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,340
He didn't stop you from going on a date?

270
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,360
That's not good.

271
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,700
I only have one last move left.

272
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,790
What's that?

273
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,160
Ask him directly what his relationship with Hou Hongguang is.

274
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,200
What if the answer is too hurtful?

275
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,660
It's still better than being entangled in it every day, right?

276
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,670
You sent me away when you were going to the meeting last time.

277
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,800
Did you go on a date with Hou Hongguang?

278
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,900
I did meet her,

279
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,110
but it wasn't a date.

280
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,960
Do CEOs have meetings at coffee shops?

281
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,860
Were you stalking me?

282
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,130
If you don't want others to know,

283
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,270
the only way is not to do it.

284
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,350
It just so happens.

285
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,120
Murphy's Law.

286
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,180
Unfortunately, I saw it by accident.

287
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,640
She wanted to see me

288
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,010
before the formal meeting to see if we were on the same page.

289
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,950
It would be too obvious if we met in the meeting room.

290
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,730
Do you have to meet somewhere so cozy like a coffee shop?

291
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,720
No matter who I meet, I can only meet them in the daytime.

292
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,920
The word cozy is not for me.

293
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,340
Why do you think I can't find a girlfriend?

294
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,800
And why do you care so much about me meeting her?

295
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,560
So why did you send me away?

296
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,510
You're just an assistant.

297
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,240
There are things you are in no position to hear.

298
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,840
I can't stay up any longer.

299
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm going back.

300
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,020
Aren't you leaving?

301
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,160
I need to finish Hongguang Technology's proposal.

302
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
This is our only hope.

303
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,010
Turn grief into power.

304
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,560
By the way,

305
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,490
you haven't told me the result yet.

306
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,690
I listened to your nonsense

307
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,840
and asked Zhu Xiaoyang

308
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,520
if he's dating Hou Hongguang.

309
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,940
And?

310
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,460
He grandly said it's a trade secret.

311
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,810
I'm only an assistant,

312
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,760
so I'm not qualified to attend such a secret meeting.

313
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,020
So you want to work overtime

314
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,650
and take his place as Dingtian Optoelectronics' CEO?

315
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,560
Then,

316
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,270
you can have a meeting with Hou Hongguang in the restaurant,

317
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,230
right?

318
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Maybe.

319
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,340
Good luck then.
