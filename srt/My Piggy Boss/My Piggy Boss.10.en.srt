Most of your Hongguang Technology's clients

83
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,500
are actually business clients

84
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,770
and luxury brands in high-end shopping malls.

85

They'll also have higher requirements for lamps.

So our plan this time

00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,019
is to make offline co-branded products with them.

88
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,650
Your lamps can have a collaboration with artists

89
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,530

103
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,550
