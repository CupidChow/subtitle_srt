190
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,450
Can you understand?

191
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,610
Yes.

192
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,000
Mr. Zhu, take a look at this part first.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you think it's okay, just hum.

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,200
If not, hum a piggy song.

195
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,510
You're indeed a pig.

196
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,480
He left?

197
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,680
What are you thinking? Go to work.

198
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,030
Didn't you...

199
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,080
Didn't you fall into the lake?

200
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,650
I fell down accidentally.

201
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,060
Am I seeing a ghost?

202
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,090
Mr. Wang.

203
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,420
You'll have no superstition with your heels on the ground.

204
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,170
Mr. Wang, does what you said last time still count?

205
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,850
[All recordings]

206
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,630
As long as you come back, I'll promise you anything.

207
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,960
Let alone 6%,

208
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,120
even 5% is okay.

209
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,900
Alright.

210
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,800
Stop it.

211
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,120
I see.

212
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,370
You two

213
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,450
deceived me together.

214
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,490
We didn't.

215
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,350
Mr. Wang,

216
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,900
I can't respect you enough.

217
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,600
It's good for us to work together and achieve a win-win result.

218
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
As for the current loan,

219
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,620
we can still follow the agreement we signed.

220
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,020
But if we pay it back as per the agreement,

221
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,530
I hope the interest rate charged on later loans

222
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,760
can be 6%.

223
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,280
Fine.

224
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,000
Why didn't you record what he said just now?

225
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,390
Record it.

226
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,220
Okay.

227
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,500
How come you got it done?

228
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:01,660
What?

229
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,210
What are you unhappy about?

230
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,910
I wanted to travel with my boyfriend

231
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,590
with my severance pay

232
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,300
and find another...

233
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,980
Wait.

234
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,500
You have a boyfriend? Since when?

235
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,780
Come on.

236
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,310
You have one. Why can't I have one?

237
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,660
I don't have a boyfriend.

238
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,360
You haven't defined your relationship with Zhu Xiaoyang?

239
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,290
What relationship?

240
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,250
We're just colleagues.

241
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,880
It's written clearly in the labor contract.

242
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,600
Is Zhu Xiaoyang stringing you along?

243
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,150
He did everything with you

244
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,300
but said nothing?

245
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,840
We didn't do everything.

246
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,580
We just kissed.

247
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,810
[CEO Office]

248
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,690
When did that happen?

249
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,220
And it was me who kissed him.

250
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,310
Everyone,

251
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,340
[CEO Office]

252
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,520
to celebrate surviving the crisis,

253
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
let's take the afternoon off.

254
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,240
Okay.

255
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,460
Yes!

256
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,720
[CEO Office]

257
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,900
Shuishui, Yang Xiaozhu.

258
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,330
You two stay here.

259
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,130
Why didn't you take off your shoes?

260
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
Is it necessary?

261
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,400
You're right.

262
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,390
What do you think, Mr. Zhu?

263
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,780
Do you have any instructions on your employees' private lives?

264
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,190
Did you fix the toilet?

265
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,080
What?

266
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,660
Mr. Zhu, how do you know our toilet is broken?

267
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,690
Isn't it normal for a boss to care about his employees?

268
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,020
Oh.

269
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,440
It's not fixed.

270
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,710
How can I live here?

271
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,000
What?

272
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,070
I have a good eye for talent.

273
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,080
To keep my company's important strength,

274
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,400
I should care about my employees.

275
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,190
I do have a way

276
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,170
to improve your quality of life

277
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,990
and ease your financial burden.

278
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,240
I won't do anything illegal.

279
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,660
Here.

280
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,720
Wow.

281
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,000
This is the house where my family usually lives on weekends.

282
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,540
Although it's not a big house,

283
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,320
it's enough for me to live alone.

284
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,700
It's not a big house?

285
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,120
My room is over there.

286
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,440
There are 2 guest rooms.

287
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,480
Let me show you.

288
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,930
This room is quite clean.

289
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,930
The housekeeper cleans it regularly.

290
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,210
No one lives here.

291
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,380
It's just

292
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,940
a bit cramped.

293
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,580
Is this how you rich people feel about space?

294
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,900
It's not cramped at all.

295
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,540
Do you want to move in?

296
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,500
Then we'll be living together.

297
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,240
It's more convenient.

298
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,370
I don't want to escape at dawn

299
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,230
and find somewhere to hide.

300
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,490
Where will I live?

301
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,610
The master bedroom is twice the size of this room.

302
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,720
And...

303
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,130
And what?

304
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,740
We agreed not to give up halfway.

305
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,760
Does it still count?
