Because I wanted to turn on colorful lights for all the kids in the world.

They never decorated the house for festivals.

But a family living in the building opposite us

81
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,240
always decorated their balcony

82
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,500

83
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,800
Colorful lights can bring not only happiness to ourselves

If we don't solve the problem of you becoming a pig after sunset,

the company will go bankrupt.

116

Are you trying to say hi?

Right.

During that meeting, you had diarrhea and went to the men's room 3 times.

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,350
It was not gastroenteritis.
