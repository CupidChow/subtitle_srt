You're okay?

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,280
Then why did you scream just now?

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,410
I had a nightmare.

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,750
I fell down.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,110

Oh.

in the women's bathroom of this floor.

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,590
Someone also saw you

45
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,010
sneaking out of the bathroom.

46
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,100

50
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,050
It was a coincidence.

I heard a man in the room.

Now that I think about it, maybe it wasn't a scream of pain.

If that's the case, I suggest you give up.

Why?

93
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,400
The 448 patent investigation is to

94
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,960
waste our time and energy

95
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,120

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,630
we will be blacklisted.

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,770
we won't be able to export the western markets anymore.

100
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,200
You should keep a low profile for now.

I didn't.

I didn't. It wasn't me.

133
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,890
Then why does the whole company

I didn't expect you to want to take a shortcut

137
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,990
by clinging onto the big shots.

138
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,850
First,

139
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,460
I didn't leak the company's secrets.

140
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,210
It's already on the WEC's website.

141
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,670
It's public information.

142
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,570
Second,

143
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,040
I don't care if you're a dragon, a phoenix, or a pig.

144
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,330
It has nothing to do with me.

145
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,250
If you want me to clarify,

146
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,740
I can only tell my coworkers

147
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,360
everything that happened truthfully,

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,890
so they know what kind of person their boss is.

149
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,000
Let go!

150
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,290
What do you want to say?

151
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,090
You broke into your single female subordinate's house while naked.

152
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,159
Don't tell anyone about last night.

153
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,460
This is my bottom line.

154
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,140
If you tell anyone, I'll...

155
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,260
It really is you?

156
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,810
Are you really Zhu Xiaoyang?

157
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,850
It's so magical.

158
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,750
I've never heard of this before.

159
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,450
So, this is your secret?

160
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,840
I thought it was something else.

161
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,360
How about this? I'll keep the secret for you.

162
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,050
Promise me three conditions.

163
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,870
No?

164
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,820
If you don't, I'll open the door now and throw you out.

165
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,320
First,

166
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,980
you're not allowed to yell at me.

167
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,880
If I do a good job, you should praise me.

168
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,900
If I don't do well, you should encourage me.

169
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,760
Second,

170
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,080
don't deduct my money if I'm late for work.

171
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,409
That's because you set the time too early.

172
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,020
Third,

173
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,020
I'm already working as the CEO's assistant now.

174
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,980
You have to give me a raise.

175
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,320
You nodded?

176
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,960
That means you've agreed.

177
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,770
I'm not working overtime today.

178
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,120
I'm going home early.

179
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,400
Zhu Xiaoyang, eat up.

180
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,580
He has a name. His name is Losty.

181
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,200
Be honest with me.

182
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Are you in a relationship with the big boss?

183
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,120
No.

184
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,420
Why are you so excited?

185
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,980
Piggies shouldn't interrupt when adults are talking.

186
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,910
Let me tell you, these big bosses are not disciplined.

187
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,580
They love playing around.

188
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,260
Xiaozhu, don’t be fooled.

189
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,640
The HR told me today

190
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,990
about all the romantic things the boss does at night.

191
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,440
Romantic?

192
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,919
I turn into a pig at night.

193
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:33,940
What is it?

194
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,210
Elaborate.

195
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,140
Have you heard?

196
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,539
Zhu Xiaoyang has been flirting with the female boss of Hongguang Technology for a long time.

197
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,480
They stayed in the same hotel on the last business trip.

198
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Ms. Hou, Hou Hongguang.

199
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,230
Really?

200
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:48,950
That's intense.

201
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,640
It's true.

202
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,610
So intense.

203
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,180
Let me tell you something more shocking.

204
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,750
I heard that Ms. Hou

205
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,840
has Mr. Zhu call her queen in private.

206
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,520
The one I know is more interesting than yours.

207
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,320
I heard that every night,

208
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,650
Mr. Zhu puts down his pride

209
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,450
and becomes Ms. Hou's prisoner.

210
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,330
Haven't you realized that our boss never replies at night?

211
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,010
Right?

212
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,660
Seems like it.

213
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,230
You're right.

214
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,290
We've never seen him at night, right?

215
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,700
About not replying to messages,

216
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,530
actually...

217
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,920
Why would Zhu Xiaoyang do this?

218
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,650
He just wants Ms. Hou's shares.

219
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,310
Now, he's flirting with you.

220
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,060
Xiaozhu, you have to be careful.

221
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,060
What would I want from Yang Xiaozhu?

222
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,490
Her fixed investment fund?

223
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,930
Anyway,

224
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,170
this kind of boss will ruin the company sooner or later.

225
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,850
Plus, the festive atmosphere is fading.

226
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,590
The lights don't sell at all.

227
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,610
Yes.

228
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,600
Xiuhu Plaza used to have a zodiac theme ever year,

229
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,760
but there's nothing this year.

230
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,360
There's no festivity at all.

231
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,600
Speaking of this,

232
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,680
I have an idea for a new product.

233
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,560
It's called electronic firecrackers.

234
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,140
Electronic firecrackers?

235
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,240
Fireworks are banned everywhere.

236
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,080
Electronic firecrackers are environmentally friendly and follow the regulations.

237
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,030
It's actually just a shining triode.

238
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,840
It'll have a huge market for New Year and Spring Festival.

239
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,100
Shuishui, why are you so talented?

240
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,110
Well,

241
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,240
Zhu Xiaoyang should transfer me to the marketing department.

242
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,800
I might be able to revive Dingtian.

243
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,950
Difficulties are not difficulties.

244
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,180
They are opportunities.

245
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,240
Thousands of ships sail past a sunken boat.

246
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,120
Thousands of trees bloom before a sick tree.

247
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,540
Today's dead end may be tomorrow's entrance.

248

As long as you stand before the wind,

249
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,600
even a pig can fly.

250
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,020
There's a high chance for Dingtian to lose the U.S. market.
