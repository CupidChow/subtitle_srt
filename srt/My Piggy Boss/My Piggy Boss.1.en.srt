00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,540
Okay, I'll save you.

189
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,100
Okay, I'm hanging up.

190
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,110
[Under repair]

191
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,080
Postpartum care for sows is very complicated.

192
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,150
[Postpartum care for sows]

193
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,070
Within six hours of being born, the piglet should...

194
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,110
My hair falls out in clumps.

195
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,659
It's all because of that Pig Boss

196
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,120
making me

197
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,520
-This is Yang Xiaozhu's house?
-go to work at 6 a.m.

198
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,080
My hairline is receding

199
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,290
-She lives with Shuishui?
- to the back of my head.

200
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,010
You'll be fine if you sleep early.

201
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,650
Why sleep when you're alive?

202
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,240
You'll have a deep slumber when you're dead.

203
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,900
Why should young people waste time on sleeping?

204
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,620
Ah!

205
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,210
This is...

206
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,690
What is she doing?

207
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,020
Why are you so filial to me?

208
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,390
What are you doing?

209
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,550
I've never killed a pig before,

210
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,960
but I have experience in killing fish and chicken.

211
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,380
I guarantee I can kill this in one go.

212
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,780
This is a pet pig.

213
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,030
You can't even take care of yourself and you want a pet?

214
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,180
You chose such a stupid pet too.

215
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,550
-Who said it’s stupid?
-Who said I’m stupid?

216
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,910
Pigs are smart.

217
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,760
So, when Zhu Xiaoyang calls me a pig,

218
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,960
I don't mind at all.

219
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,510
What are you going to do now?

220
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,610
I'll do the paperwork first and then find a new job.

221
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,600
That works. You have food saved up,

222
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,480
so you won't starve to death.

223
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,890
Why are you so dirty?

224
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,410
Let me give you a bath.

225
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
No.

226
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,340
Don't be afraid.

227
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,600
I'll be gentle. It won't hurt.

228
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,450
How can you wash my hair with body wash?

229
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,390
Don't touch around!

230
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,840
Hey.

231
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,230
Lavender.

232
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,670
It's quite comfortable.

233
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,340
Right.

234
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,490
I don't know if you're a boy or a girl.

235
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,390
No.

236
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,970
Oh.

237
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,180
A boy.

238
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,260
I want to go home. Somebody save me.

239
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,490
Stop it. My clothes are all wet.

240
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,740
Forget it. I'll wash too.

241
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,560
No.

242
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,020
I'm not clean anymore.

243
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,470
How can you feed pork chop rice to Piggy?

244
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,700
Isn't this animal abuse?

245
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,340
I think it's starving to death.

246
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,720
Pigs should eat pig slop.

247
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,530
Why don't we give it a name?

248
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,450
Call it...

249
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,210
Zhu Xiaoyang.

250
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,100
This name is not bad.

251
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,310
You're quite accurate with your names.

252
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,870
But since you're a lost piggy,

253
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,370
why don't we call you Losty?

254
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,310
Losty. Look, it responded.

255
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,230
Losty.

256
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,070
-Losty.
-Losty.

257
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,460
Losty, you're so cute.

258
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,040
Let me go.

259
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,270
Good boy.

260
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,570
I have to go to work at 4:30 a.m. tomorrow.

261
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,020
Uh.

262
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,090
Good night.

263
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,830
Ah!

264
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,960
Zhu—
