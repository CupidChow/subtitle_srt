[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,400
I can explain.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,820
What can I explain?

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,610
[My Piggy Boss]

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,610
[Episode 4]

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,200
Here's your coffee, Mr. Zhu.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,600
Xiaozhu.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,420
I want coffee too.

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,800
Don't you have hands? Get it yourself.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,960
Who are you?

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,890
Why are you sitting here?

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,620
I haven't asked you who you are.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,180
You appeared at a girl's place without your shirt on early in the morning

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,640
and asked her to get you coffee shamelessly.

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,100
I'm Yang Xiaozhu's boss, the CEO of Dingtian Optoelectronics.

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,650
She's my assistant. It's reasonable for her to get me a cup of coffee.

17
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,960
I'm her fiancé.

18
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,820
Was your marriage decided by your parents 30 years ago

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,900
when you were still wearing diapers?

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,740
They got drunk at a dinner

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,350
and arranged your marriage

22
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,920
to end this topic as soon as possible?

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,280
Anyway, it was decided by our parents.

24
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,510
Thanks to the lottery-based admissions,

25
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,920
you went to the same primary school and junior high school.

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,630
You went to school and went back home together every day.

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,570
When your classmates joked about your relationship,

28
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,170
you thought it was your first teenage romance.

29
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,160
However, senior high school

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,500
and college admissions were based on grades.

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,289
You two separated immediately.

32
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:16,870
Your values, horizons, and circles were different.

33
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,870
You were even in different cities.

34
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,289
You didn't speak for 10 years.

35
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,789
Then, to find a reasonable excuse

36
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:22,940
for not having a girlfriend,

37
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,880
you suddenly remembered the marriage

38
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,210
arranged when you were kids, which no one admitted.

39
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,630
So you came to her place and harassed her for no reason.

40
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,860
You even judged her CEO, who came to her for work.

41
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,940
Am I right?

42
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,289
I see.

43
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,710
You knew we were going on a date today,

44
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,070
so you came to stop us, right?

45
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,030
Why are you still thinking about this?

46
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,210
You need to work overtime today.

47
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:43,970
What?

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,050
You don't need to.

49
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,570
Oh, thank you, boss.

50
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,180
Shuishui, don't go.

51
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,300
Xiaozhu.

52
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,180
Mr. Zhu.

53
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,170
Bye.

54
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,480
Xiaozhu, let's go to a picnic.

55
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,250
I know a place where no one will disturb us.

56
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,910
You need to work overtime.

57
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,770
You need to work overtime today.

58
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,980
Why are you going with us?

59
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,440
Where are we going now?

60
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,230
Why am I like your driver?

61
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,370
My personal drivers

62
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,700
have at least an MBA degree.

63
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,150
What's your educational background?

64
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,480
How dare you look down on this profession?

65
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:32,050
Is it me or you who looks down on it?

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,530
With your driving skills,

67
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,579
you can't even pass the interview.

68
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,829
That's true.

69
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,250
Xiaozhu, how can you side with the outsider?

70
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,770
I'm being honest.

71
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,460
Oh no, I got carsick.

72
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,880
Don't throw up in my car. It's a new car.

73
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,090
Pull over!

74
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:51,890
Gosh!

75
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,340
Sir, can you be reasonable?

76
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,370
This is a public road. How can you charge me?

77
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,530
[Fee: 5 yuan]

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,320
I know 5 yuan is not too much.

79
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,600
It's not about money.

80
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,420
How about giving me a discount?

81
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,580
Mr. Zhu, will you reimburse it?

82
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,250
Xiaozhu, what are you doing?

83
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,960
Mr. Zhu, it's done.

84
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,750
Do you want some water?

85
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,550
No, thanks.

86
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,270
Milk?

87
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,050
No.

88
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,480
Juice?

89
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,850
No, no.

90
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,200
Although we chose this place at random, it's good.

91
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
The scenery is good.

92
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,060
What's good is not the scenery

93
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,750
but us being together, right?

94
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,850
Why do I find this mountain creepy?

95
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,720
Don't talk nonsense.

96
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,870
Third wheel.

97
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,540
Xiaozhu, sit here.

98
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,300
You must be thirsty. Have some water.

99
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,240
Here.

100
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,150
It's too hot.

101
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,160
As a girl, you shouldn't drink too much cold water.

102
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,269
Or you'll have a cold womb.

103
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,529
And it'll be hard for you to get pregnant.

104
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,570
I don't want it. I suddenly don't feel thirsty.

105
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,830
I won't be thirsty for the rest of my life.

106
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,580
Where is Zhu Xiaoyang?

107
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,100
He's so elusive.

108
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,800
Xiaozhu, how about we go back first?

109
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,030
What about Zhu Xiaoyang?

110
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,130
Forget about that third wheel.

111
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:38,680
Let's go.

112
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,060
This place is indeed a little creepy.

113
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,530
Let's go. Hurry up.

114
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,950
What's your problem?

115
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,980
What?

116
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,750
You could scare me to death, you know?

117
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,690
Sir.

118
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,660
Sir, would you mind taking a video of us?

119
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,950
Don't ask him. I'll take it for you.

120
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,930
Third wheel.

121
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,940
Let's go.

122
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,100
Come on.

123
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,460
How do you want me to shoot it?

124
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,860
Please shoot a video of us

125
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,550
with the mountain as the background.

126
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,070
Okay.

127
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,370
Pupu, lead the song.

128
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:16,880
Okay.

129
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,820
Pupu?

130
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,710
I didn't push you. He did.

131
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,110
I saw you push me.

132
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,350
Tao, look.

133
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,640
What?

134
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,390
Is there a man taking pictures

135
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,610
of 2 old people?

136
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,370
Why can't I see anything?

137
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,050
They're standing too close to the edge of the cliff.

138
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,850
Look.

139
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,620
It's too dangerous.

140
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,550
Oh my God! Look! The 2 old people fell off the cliff!

141
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,430
Don't scare me.

142
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,180
Where?

143
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,080
Sir, are you still filming us?

144
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,300
Is it a murder?

145
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,310
The middle of nowhere is the best place to dispose of dead bodies.

146
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,750
Well...

147
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,800
I just remembered I have something to do. I need to go back.

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,460
I have a meeting with Mr. Wang.

149
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,640
I'll call you. Say hi to your parents for me.

150
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,600
Mr. Wang.

151
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,540
Miss, can you take a video of us?

152
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,220
Sure.

153
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,990
Pupu, she'll help us.

154
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,880
What a coincidence! Her name is also Pupu?

155
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,960
Yes. We're cosplaying as the characters in that drama.

156
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,990
It's great.

157
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,130
Thank you, Miss.

158
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,410
We have this.

159
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,120
Ham sandwich.

160
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,990
Mr. Zhu, are you okay with this?

161
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,610
You are not yourself today.

162
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,000
Did it remind you of your ex?

163
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,550
Is it the nice girl your mom mentioned?

164
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,680
The one who didn't treat you as a monster like others did?

165
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,070
Yang Xiaozhu.

166
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,540
Do you know "The Metamorphosis"?

167
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,060
Yes. The reality show in which urban kids

168
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,030
are sent to the countryside.

169
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,030
No.

170
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,040
I'm talking about "The Metamorphosis" written by Kafka.

171
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,610
As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams,

172
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,140
he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.

173
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,350
After someone loses all their economic value,

174
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,090
they'll also lose their social connections.

175
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,240
Even their family will leave them.

176
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,530
I yell at you in the office,

177
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,030
but you still respect me.

178
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,200
The underlying reason is because of my economic value.

179
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,020
But what if I'm a pig?

180
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,750
You will definitely

181
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,170
treat me as a pig.

182
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,590
You mean

183
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,550
you're afraid of being killed and eaten?

184
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,910
It's like talking to a brick wall.

185
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,280
Don't worry. There will be someone

186
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,980
who won't kill you

187
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,490
and will smile at you

188
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,360
no matter if you're a CEO or a pig.

189
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,620
I hope so.

190
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,159
If you can't get over that girl,

191
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,080
just get her back.

192
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
You know nothing.

193
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,840
Why do you think so?

194
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,570
You scared your fiancé away just now.

195
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,480
It was you who scared him away.

196
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,470
Did he drive the car away?

197
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,680
Can you smile?

198
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,250
No one will dare to give us a ride after seeing your fierce look.

199
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,680
I'm tired. Do I still need to smile?

200
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,260
The CEO of the Christmas light manufacturing company

201
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,370
with the biggest market share in Yiwu

202
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,080
ended up sitting on the street.

203
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,700
The modifier is too long.

204
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,460
It doesn't sound impressive.

205
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,520
I can't believe you said that.

206
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,880
It's about time again.

207
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,240
Come into my arms.

208
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,720
Don't even think about it.

209
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,520
Zhu Xiaoyang, time to sleep.

210
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,770
[I'm a pig from outer space]

211
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,770
[Don't kill me. I'll repay you]

212
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,520
[You can understand what I'm saying?]

213
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,810
[Not only can I speak, but I can also do magic tricks]

214
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,380
[I don't believe you]

215
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,800
[Rose. Rose. Rose]

216
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,580
[You're the first one to give me roses. I'll let you go]

217
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,200
[You're the only butcher in the town]

218
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,200
[Can you let my family go as well?]

219
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,380
[My uncle and aunt are in the slaughterhouse in the west of the town]

220
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,120
[Pigs' heads from the west of the town are so delicious]

221
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,130
[The combination of planting and pig breeding brings a fortune]

222
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,430
[My other aunt and cousin are in the pigsty in the east of the town]

223
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,700
[Fresh Pork]

224
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,900
[But I need to support my family]
