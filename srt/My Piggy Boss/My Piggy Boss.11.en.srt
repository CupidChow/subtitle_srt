00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
When we were dancing,

184
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I recalled what we looked like at the university ball.

185
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,350
The way you looked at me at that time.

186
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,760
You liked me at that time, right?

187
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,390
That was many years ago.

188
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,720
Let me ask you.

189
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,870
If

190
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,240
I were a pig,

191
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,100
would you still like me?

192
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
What did you say?

193
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,960
If I were a human being during the day

194
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,160
and a pig at night,

195
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,240
would you still like me?

196
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,530
It's such a weird question.

197
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,390
Is it the kind of pig from a slaughterhouse?

198
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,180
It's a teacup pet pig.

199
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,410
It's very cute.

200
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,720
Do you think I have time to take care of pets?

201
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,150
Yes.

202
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
But there is a person who likes me

203
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,070
and is willing to take care of me

204
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,240
regardless of whether I'm a human being or a pig.

205
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,040
Who said that? I like you so much.

206
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,610
No matter you're a human being or a pig,

207
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,560
I like you.

208
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,720
Besides,

209
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,850
your feeling was wrong.

210
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,810
I haven't changed.

211
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm still so self-righteous

212
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,840
and weird.

213
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,390
But there's a person who dares to criticize me

214
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,140
and is willing to tolerate me.

215
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,340
And that person isn't you either.

216
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
I know who it is.

217
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,420
You were wrong too.

218
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,400
I'm very perceptive.

219
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,080
My feeling is always right.
