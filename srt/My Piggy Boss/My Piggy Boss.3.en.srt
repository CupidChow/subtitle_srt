00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,770
Hello, madam.

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,760
Have a seat.

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,000
Are you Yang Xiaozhu?

5
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,350
Here's five million yuan. Take it.

[Episode 3]

8
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,290
Oh, my. This is amazing.

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,240
I'm sorry, madam.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,240
It's all my fault.

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,020
I didn't stay in my place.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,290
I took advantage of Mr. Zhu.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,560
Don't worry. I'll leave your son tomorrow.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,080
No, no.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,210
I'll leave this city.

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,470
I will never appear in front of him again.

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,870
Who told you to leave?

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,040
This is the deposit.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,120
You can treat it as

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,340
your living allowance or the money for pig feed too.

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,540
That kid

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,500
eats a lot after turning into a pig.

23
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,200
Don't make yourself suffer.

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,630
I don't understand.

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,370
I'm giving you money to not leave him.

26
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,460
If you're willing to take care of him,

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,180
all the assets of Wuguang Group will belong to you two.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,400
Madam,

29
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,770
this is too casual.

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,200
Xiaozhu, you don't know.

31
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,450
This is the fate of our family.

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,640
His father,

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,640
Chairman Zhu,

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,729
used to be the director of a private slaughterhouse.

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,080
In order to support this family,

36
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,220
he butchered pigs every day.

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,950
Not only did he butcher all the domestic pigs,

38
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
but he also went deep into the forest

39
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,200
and killed all the wild boars of Nanshan Mountain.

40
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,320
So,

41
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,770
this angered the alien pigs.

42
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,870
That year,

43
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,270
I just gave birth to Xiaoyang.

44
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,440
On a rainy night,

45
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,960
an alien pig suddenly came to our house.

46
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,600
Your husband killed too many pigs.

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
He's sinful.

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,250
You must pay for it.

49
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,210
The toxin on our planet

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,920
will infect your newborn son.

51
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,690
From now on, he will turn into a pig every day at sunset

52
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,320
and turn back into a human only at sunrise.

53
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,500
If he can't complete the mission before he turns 27,

54
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,500
he will transform directly into a pig

55
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,680
and never be a human again.

56
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,400
Mission? What mission?

57
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,310
Find his true love

58
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:52,579
and get his true love's kiss.

59
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,210
Hahaha.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,640
Your son will forever be a pig at night.

61
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,910
Twenty-seven years old?

62
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,920
Why 27?

63
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,400
Is all of this true?

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,680
Of course.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,600
Xiaoyang is a sensible kid.

66
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,330
He never worries us.

67
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,280
But

68
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,280
who would like a boy who disappears

69
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,810
whenever the sun goes down?

70
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes,

71
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,960
except one person.

72
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,410
How was it today?

73
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,329
I'm happy.

74
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,940
What about you?

75
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,560
Me?

76
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,840
Are you leaving again?

77
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,329
I heard it from someone.

78
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,480
I didn't expect it to be true.

79
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,840
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,550
You feel like Cinderella.

81
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,260
What happened next?

82
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,240
That silly boy didn't dare to pursue her anymore.

83
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,980
It ended without results.

84
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,860
If you help him, you'll also be helping us.

85
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,409
Child, let me ask you. If your love can save someone,

86
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,010
will you love him?

87
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,600
Look how pitiful he is.

88
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,390
He'll be 27 soon.

89
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,120
Xiaozhu,

90
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,159
you're both young. You have a long way to go.

91
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,640
Why don't you give yourself one more chance?

92
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,040
Love is everflowing.

93
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,920
It changes every moment.

94
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,200
You might not love him today, but you might tomorrow.

95
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,400
Xiaoyang is my only child.

96
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,990
If you can help him become a human,

97
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,090
I'm willing to do anything.

98
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,610
I promised your mom

99
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,360
to give it a try out of the kindness of my heart.

100
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,350
You can't have any improper thoughts about me...

101
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,630
Or think about kissing me,

102
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,450
and such.

103
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,830
Forget it. We'll talk about it tomorrow when you become a human.

104
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,520
Shuishui, I'm back.

105
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,290
Honey, you're back.

106
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,630
Welcome home.

107
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,150
Who are you?

108
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,920
Are you playing a lover's trick again?

109
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
I know we haven't seen each other for a long time.

110
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,560
We need some excitement.

111
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,200
Shuishui,

112
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,040
there's a thief!

113
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,480
Shuishui!

114
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,520
Don't shout.

115
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,540
What thief?

116
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,430
I'm your fiancé.

117
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,760
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,980
I'm on a business trip.

119
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,030
I'm free for two days.

120
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,960
I missed you, so I wanted to see you.

121
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,980
Okay, let me go in first.

122
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,590
I'll get it for you.

123
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,020
This one.

124
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,250
Don't close the door.

125
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,750
Yang Xiaozhu,

126
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,440
you have a boyfriend?

127
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,080
Shuishui said

128
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,590
you're involved with another man.

129
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,630
Is it true?

130
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,670
He's not an ordinary man.

131
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,900
He's our big boss.

132
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,250
He's handsome and rich.

133
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,720
Big boss?

134
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,700
Yes.

135
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,760
Handsome and rich.

136
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,080
What step are you at?

137
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,409
She's merely at the point of meeting the parents.

138
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:43,010
What?

139
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,310
I didn't meet them.

140
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,200
How did you know?

141
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,310
Nothing from the company can escape me, Shuishui.

142
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:53,270
I heard that the last girl

143
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,280
who got invited to dinner by Mrs. Zhu

144
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,210
started vomiting and had diarrhea after going home.

145
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,740
She stayed in bed for seven days and seven nights before resigning and returning to her hometown.

146
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,900
Did his mother poison her food?

147
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,910
She got food poisoning from the meal before that.

148
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,910
Xiaozhu, did she bully you?

149
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,760
What? You got bullied?

150
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
Who are you?

151
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,280
Call me Tao from now on.

152
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,230
My identity has changed recently.

153
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm a multi-hyphenate

154
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,600
from Hangzhou now.

155
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,370
I'm a quality man with rising careers across multiple fields,

156
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,210
such as education and e-commerce.

157
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,560
More importantly, I'm Xiaozhu's

158
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,660
fiancé.

159
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,040
Let me make it clear.

160
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,020
This was just a joke our parents made when we were little.

161
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,690
What do you mean? That's our parents' friendship.

162
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,620
We'll get married sooner or later.

163
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,120
Shuishui, what does that man do?

164
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,990
How dare he steal my girlfriend?

165
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,750
This is the guy. He's our big boss, Zhu Xiaoyang.

166
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,220
He's handsome and he's only worth a few billion.

167
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,280
Oh.

168
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,920
Just so-so.

169
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,740
Humph.

170
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,940
It's inevitable to feel inferior when compared to me.

171
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,270
Is this a pig?

172
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,370
For me?

173
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,120
Let's grill it. We'll have a picnic tomorrow.

174
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,000
A picnic?

175
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,050
I found a remote place

176
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,470
with beautiful scenery.

177
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,770
We haven't had a date in a long time.

178
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,360
Wait, when have we ever had a date?

179
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,150
How have we not?

180
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,870
Didn't we go home together after school back in the day?

181
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,830
That counts?

182
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,430
Why not?

183
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,250
Those were the best memories of my youth.

184
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,550
Two people's memories are called memories.

185
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,080
One person's memories are called fantasies.

186
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:18,880
I'm going to eat it.

187
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,740
Don't touch me.

188
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,140
I'm going to eat it.

189
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,080
Wow, great!

190
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,990
Let's celebrate our rare dinner.

191
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,540
Let's have a drink.

192
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,250
Okay.

193
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,480
Let's drink.

194
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,750
You're still here?

195
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,020
Yes.

196
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,299
The joy of commoners is really simple.

197
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,480
I

198
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,010
keep such a low profile in the company.

199
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,690
Whenever our boss, Mr. Wang,

200
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,240
sees me,

201
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,160
he calls out, "Tao, Tao."

202
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,600
I'm a core staff.

203
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,020
It's too tiring.

204
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,730
But when I say I'm going to resign,

205
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,410
Mr. Wang tries so hard to make me stay.

206
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,920
"Tao,

207
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,320
you can't go. The company won’t go public if you leave."

208
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,440
Look.

209
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,350
He shamelessly gave me a car.

210
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,350
Oh, my. Is this your new car?

211
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,890
He was waiting for you to say that.

212
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,600
It's just a cheap car. What's there to brag about?

213
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
I came here as soon as I got the new car.

214
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,090
I’ve planned it out.

215
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,750
There are many fun things around Yiwu.

216
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,490
It’s beautiful.

217
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,850
I have to work.

218
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,990
You're too ambitious.

219
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,900
It's also for our future.

220
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
My future. You're not included.

221
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,070
Yes, I am.

222
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,360
My car

223
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,440
and my heart are both included.

224
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,700
Oh, my. So disgusting.

225
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,560
Shuishui, go sleep in your room.

226
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,500
Hush.

227
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,860
Don't shout.

228
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,920
Baby,

229
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,880
let's go to Daciyan tomorrow.

230
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,240
I'm not your baby.

231
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,170
We'll take my new car,

232
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,060
okay?

233
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,200
New car?

234
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,270
Your key is cracking at its seams

235
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,830
and you're still bragging?

236
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,400
Yang Xiaozhu,

237
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,080
you promised my mom to take care of me.

238
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,010
Come and save me.

239
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,360
Yang Xiaozhu!

240
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,210
Stop playing.

241
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,280
Go back and sleep.

242
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,860
Xiaozhu.

243
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,640
Let's sleep too.

244
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,490
You're both young.

245
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,720
You have a long way to go.

246
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,450
Love is flowing.

247
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,180
It changes every moment.

248
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,110
You don't love him today,

249
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,190
but you might tomorrow.

250
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,820
Why don't you give yourself one more chance?

251
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,310
Good night.

252
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,240
Oh.

253
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,160
Why is she sleeping here?

254
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,320
Stinky pig, you're disturbing my girlfriend's sleep.

255
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,090
I'm going to stuff you here.

256
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,110
[Hm?]

257
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,300
[What's moving?]

258
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,410
Open the door!

259
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,550
Yang Xiaozhu, open the door!

260
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,660
I order you to open the door!

261
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,040
I'll count to five.

262
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,660
I'll fire you if you don't open the door.

263
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,400
Coming.

264
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,040
Five.

265
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,360
Four.

266
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,230
Three.

267
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:07,760
Two.

268
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,120
Hey.

269
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,760
Who's knocking so early in the morning?

270
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
What time is it? It's time for work.

271
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,350
I can explain.
