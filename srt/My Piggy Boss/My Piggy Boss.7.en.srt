00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,790
Ah.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,800
Oh my god.

4
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,020
I actually moved in and started living with Zhu Xiaoyang.

5
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,220
What was I thinking?

00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,040
Come and have breakfast.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,160
The nanny made it.

10
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,720
The nanny makes

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,090
breakfast and dinner on weekdays and three meals on weekends.

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,650
The recipes are also prepared

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,880
using fresh seasonal ingredients under the supervision of professional nutritionists,

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,740
taking into account both health and tastefulness.

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,690
This is awesome.

16
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,920
It's really great.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,520
Xiaozhu, try this bun.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,170
Why did Shuishui start living here too?

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,670
I can't see her spend thousands to live in

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,120
a house that's been soaked in water, right?

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,350
Thank you for taking me in, Mr. Zhu.

22
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,150
I can never repay your kindness.

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,510
How about this?

24
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,740
I'll rent you an apartment.

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,400
The company will pay for it.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,020
A one-bedroom apartment.

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,200
The company's financial condition has just improved.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,440
It's not good to add unnecessary expenses like this,

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,480
right, Mr. Zhu?

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,240
You might as well put this money into the electronic firecrackers industrial line

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,009
and let me, the product manager, have some work to do.

32
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,170
You are idle indeed.

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,580
Exactly.

34
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,770
My tendons are so stiff.

35
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,090
I guess it's because we spend too much time in front of the computer at work.

36
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,950
Is it possible that it's because we're getting old?

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,120
That's also one of the reasons.

38
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,840
Mr. Zhu, do you want to join us?

39
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,650
No.

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,259
You spend a lot of time in front of your computer too.

41
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,640
Pay attention to the condition of your neck and shoulders.

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,940
You're not young anymore.

43
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,970
It's time to start exercising.

44
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,120
I'm only 26. Thank you for your concern.

45
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,480
He's one year older than us.

46
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,480
His bones must be stiffer than ours.

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,610
Pretty impressive.

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,900
I was in a dance club in college.

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,460
That's it?

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,490
I can do it too.

51
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,090
Cramp!

52
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,620
What's wrong?

53
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,930
I'm having a butt cramp.

54
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,990
Call an ambulance!

55
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,230
I can't move.

56
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,250
Carry her away.

57
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,090
Ridiculous!

58
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,200
By the way, I forgot to tell you that

59
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,800
the family doctor would be here every weekend.

60
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,280
Mr. Zhu.

61
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,460
I'm afraid I can't live in this room anymore.

62
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,860
I'm not afraid of insects or heights.

63
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,170
I'm not afraid of getting myself dirty or tired.

64
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,570
But I'm afraid of ghosts.

65
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,500
You ran into a ghost in your room?

66
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,390
It kept following me in broad daylight,

67
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,920
but it disappeared whenever I turned around.

68
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,400
That was me.

69
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,480
Why were you following me?

70
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,579
I wanted to ask you

71
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,660
if we should continue our relationship.

72
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,770
We agreed to give it a try.

73
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,680
The relationship was neither real nor fake.

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,490
It was a true love's kiss after all.

75
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,280
If we pay too much attention on the goal, that would be too utilitarian.

76
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,540
So...

77
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,530
What do you think of me?

78
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,290
I don't know.

79
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,020
What about you?

80
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,100
Do you really want to date me

81
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,680
or did you simply do it to

82
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,510
solve the problem?

83
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,940
I just feel

84
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,430
happy and relaxed

85
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,440
when I'm with you.

86
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,540
Maybe it's because you know my secret.

87
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,470
Or it's simply because I'm with you.

88
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,110
What about you?

89
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,800
How do you feel

90
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,100
when you're with me?

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,159
It feels like

92
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,480
working.

93
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,130
I didn't mean that.

94
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,960
It's just every time I'm with you,

95
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,610
I feel like it's an order from Mrs. Zhu.

96
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,560
Wait.

97
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,630
You mean

98
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,110
you like me?

99
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,100
Since we can't explain it clearly,

100
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,520
we'll know after we give it a try.

101
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,230
So he confessed his love to you?

102
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,100
Kind of.

103
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,570
Did you say yes?

104
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,610
Well, it might not be up to me.

105
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,320
[CEO Office]

106
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,260
Assistant Yang.

107
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,100
What?

108
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,940
What do you mean what?

109
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,800
[CEO Office]

110
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,900
We'll have a meeting in 10 minutes.

111
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,960
Okay, got it.

112
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,210
Why is he still calling you "Assistant"?

113
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,880
It seems you two are even more aloof than before.

114
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,860
But every time he calls me by my full name,

115
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,120
nothing good happens.

116
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,390
He can give you a nickname.

117
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,520
For example, Piggy.

118
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,250
I think this name suits him better.

119
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,550
You're right.

120
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,200
I see.

121
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,400
It's inappropriate to disclose office romance.

122
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Otherwise, it'll be hard to manage.

123
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,370
Really?

124
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,720
It's more exciting to have a secret relationship.

125
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,360
For example, a glance during a meeting,

126
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,930
a kiss in the pantry,

127
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
or when you're on a business trip...

128
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,070
Enough. Stop it.

129
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,730
Why did he still turn into a pig?

130
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,080
Was it his problem or mine?

131
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,440
Or was it because of that alien pig?

132
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,430
Yang Xiaozhu.

133
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,430
Yes.

134
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,440
Our only chance to save the company

135
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,960
is this 448 patent investigation hearing.

136
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,800
Go get ready.

137
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,140
We'll go to Huacheng next Monday.

138
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,520
Okay, I'll book the flight and hotel right away.

139
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,550
Mr. Zhu will be flying business class,

140
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,410
and I'll be flying economy class.

141
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,730
Mr. Zhu, we are in the company.

142
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,040
You really can't do this.

143
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,860
Upgrade your ticket to first class too.

144
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,520
You have my special approval.

145
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,540
I don't think it's a good idea

146
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,040
to favor me so blatantly.

147
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,320
We'll be flying across time zones.

148
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,580
Without you by my side,

149
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,520
I'm worried things may go wrong.

150
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,830
There'll be an industry banquet after that.

151
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,230
Remember to bring a gown.

152
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,440
Welcome to take this flight.

153
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,220
Why is it economy class?

154
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,310
Sorry, Mr. Zhu.

155
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,440
I booked the wrong tickets.

156
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,160
Please take your seats.

157
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,920
Do not block the aisle and prevent other passengers from boarding.

158
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,960
How could you make such a stupid mistake?

159
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,950
Everyone in economy class can be seen clearly.

160
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,420
What should I do?

161
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,200
You want me to turn into a pig in public?

162
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,640
How am I supposed to explain that?

163
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,620
You want me to say I'm a magician?

164
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,919
It's all my fault.

165
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,000
Stop yelling.

166
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,520
Do you want everyone on the plane to hear it?

167
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,400
It can't be helped.

168
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,220
And I don't care.

169
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,500
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,400
Are you really asleep, or pretending to be?

171
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,850
Out of sight, out of mind.

172
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,580
We have plenty of time.

173
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,040
Let's think of a solution.

174
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,320
I'm only a pig. Don't count on me.

175
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,990
Well, I'm a human who even booked wrong flight tickets.

176
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,930
You shouldn't have counted me to book the flight tickets.

177
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,080
Aren't you the assistant to CEO?

178
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,240
Aren't I the CEO?

179
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,360
Mr. Zhu.

180
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,310
Mr. Zhu.

181
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,260
Mr. Zhu.
