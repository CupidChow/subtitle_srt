Drink up.

45
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:42,840
Dude,

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,040
you have such an amazing dad!

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,870
Why didn't you mention it?

48
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,510
I didn't know either.

49
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:50,760
Wait.

50
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Will he really give you that much money?

51
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,280
Not chicken wings?

52
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,200
Listen up, everyone.

53
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,400
He wouldn't dare refuse now.

54
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,280
He's afraid his precious son finds out.

55
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,480
Three million!

56
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,560
I wouldn't see that much money
in eight lifetimes!

57
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,750
Man, truth be told,

58
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,150
I think three million is too little.

59
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:16,800
What?

60
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,190
How so?

61
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,240
Whatever historical issues aside,

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,910
you're his real son, right?

63
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,220
Yes.

64
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,910
Then you and that official heir of his

65
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,470
should have equal status.

66
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,000
By all accounts

67
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,000
your rich dad's money should be split

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,680
fifty-fifty.

69
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,240
No, no.

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,080
Dude,

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,800
three mil is plenty of money!

72
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,630
It's more than you can spend
for a lifetime!

73
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,960
Look how small-minded you are!

74
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,310
Man, listen to me.

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,190
He's trying to hush things up now

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,470
not just because
he fears his son will find out.

77
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,710
He's definitely scared
you'll demand more.

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,400
Think about it, makes sense right?

79
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,080
I'm just too kind-hearted!

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,840
Exactly!

81
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,430
Dear father,

82
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,960
looks like three million won't be enough.

83
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,120
You'll need to compensate me more.

84
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,680
You make a pretty good point!

85
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,400
Here.

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,960
Cheers.

87
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,080
Drink.

88
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,590
Wow.

89
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,310
Humidifier?

90
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,030
No wonder it didn't feel so dry today.

91
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,680
Hey.

92
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,910
The logistics department went all out.

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,240
Logistics?

94
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,470
What are you thinking?

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
It's not in their budget.

96
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,940
Huh?

97
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,800
Then where's this humidifier from

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,000
The lady who
came to our ward three months ago,

99
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,120
the one who later
passed from lung infection,

100
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,800
remember her?

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
She has a son.

102
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,240
He's tall and handsome.

103
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,840
Heard he's some business owner.

104
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,870
Mr. Ai. Do you know him?

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,310
To show gratitude

106
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,950
for our care of his mother,

107
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,240
he donated a humidifier to every office

108
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,360
in the Rehabilitation Department

109
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,800
Who's he really doing this for?

110
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,950
I don't believe
he has no ulterior motive.

111
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,980
Hey,

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:33,950
Wu Ya.

113
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
Is he the one

114
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,430
who sent you flowers before?

115
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,800
What?

116
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,800
You're applying for hospital dormitory?

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,480
Why?

118
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,800
Keeping some distance between two people

119
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,430
is good for relationship development.

120
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,270
Helps maintain novelty, too.

121
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,360
Tell me the truth.

122
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,160
Are you saving money to get married?

123
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,680
It must be.

124
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,310
Living alone,

125
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,390
he can rent a smaller place, right?

126
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,510
Ms. Duan, please stop asking.

127
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,000
I want to move in as soon as possible.

128
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,800
Please put in a good word fro me.

129
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,310
Alright, I understand.

130
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,480
It's ready.

131
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,950
Eight seconds, right?

132
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,510
Here's one for you.

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,390
Eight.

134
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:31,920
Seven.

135
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,720
Six.

136
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,600
Five.

137
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,560
Xiaozhou.

138
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,270
I'm moving into the hospital dormitory.

139
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,920
Since our lease
is about to expire anyway,

140
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,310
I was thinking

141
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,800
we could switch to a smaller place.

142
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,720
No, you...you don't have to.

143
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,310
It's not like I'm being considerate.

144
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,950
It's just my department...

145
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,390
What about it?

146
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,630
You know how my
overtime keeps increasing.

147
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,310
My daily commute takes 1-2 hours,

148
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,190
and traffic jams make it unpredictable.

149
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,000
Several times,

150
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,950
I was late for morning rounds.

151
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,120
The director didn't look happy.

152
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,800
Should we maybe

153
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,600
move closer to the hospital?

154
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,160
The director suggested it to me.

155
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,480
Said there's an available bed

156
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,390
and asked me to consider it.

157
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,120
I can't play dumb, can I?

158
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,040
I see...

159
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,310
It's way over eight seconds.

160
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,950
Eat it.

161
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,800
Overcooked? Let me make you a fresh one.

162
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,360
Here.

163
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,680
Eight.

164
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
Why do I feel like

165
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm being abandoned?

166
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,120
Exactly.

167
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm climbing the social ladder
and dumping you.

168
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,630
Don't you dare be so dramatic.

169
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,750
You can't joke about such things.

170
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,560
Don't scare me.

171
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,360
Just kidding.

172
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,480
Here, it's ready.

173
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,600
Have something light.

174
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,360
Dad.

175
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,630
During my trip to France,

176
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,390
I met some young contemporary artists.

177
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,070
They're quite interested in

178
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,070
entering the Chinese market.

179
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,190
So,

180
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,750
my initial plan is

181
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,630
maybe after this June,

182
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,360
I'll get their representative works

183
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,480
and see if we can organize an exhibition.

184
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,480
Good.

185
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,360
You handle it.

186
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:16,830
Dad.

187
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
Any instructions?

188
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,800
What should I do first?

189
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,680
No special instructions.

190
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,510
The company affairs are yours now.

191
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,950
You make the decisions.

192
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:31,950
Thanks, Dad.

193
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,480
I'll get back to work.

194
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,790
Everything alright?

195
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,380
Yes.

196
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,240
Dad.

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,630
Why is one of Qin's paintings missing?

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,550
You put it away?

199
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,550
I,

200
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,510
I thought

201
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,030
I could put up another painting

202
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,720
for a change of mood.

203
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,220
Oh.

204
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,360
In that case,

205
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,240
I can take it back for you.

206
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
The preservation conditions here

207
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,670
might not meet the requirements.

208
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,000
It's perfectly safe here.

209
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,840
I'll have someone hang it
in the bedroom this afternoon.

210
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,670
I'm right here.

211
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,840
Why ask someone else?

212
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,390
I'll do it.

213
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,750
I need to take a nap.

214
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,120
Off you go.

215
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,440
Sure, Dad.

216
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,200
Okay.

217
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:39,870
Who are you?

218
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,550
Hey!

219
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,200
I'm talking to you!

220
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,270
Hey!

221
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:45,910
Mr. Ai.

222
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,390
Stop right there. Who are you?

223
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,550
Dad, you know him?

224
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,750
Sorry, this is a private club.

225
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,270
Hey, Mr. Ai, are we in the wrong place?

226
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,360
Get out!

227
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,320
Hey, look!

228
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:05,870
What?

229
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,440
Do we two look alike?

230
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,550
No.

231
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:10,670
Yes.

232
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,200
Man,

233
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,000
it's unbelievable!

234
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,390
You're just like twins.

235
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,600
What are you doing?

236
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,480
Dad.

237
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,390
You know him?

238
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,550
The three days aren't up yet.

239
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,870
Why are here?

240
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,910
Three million is too little.

241
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,750
Then how much do you want?

242
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,000
How much can he get?

243
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,320
I want the same.

244
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,910
What did you say?

245
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,440
Dad, who is he?

246
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,870
Okay, you can leave for now.

247
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:50,790
Hey, Dad.

248
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,200
Your son's talking to you.

249
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,480
I said leave.

250
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,120
Go.

251
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,030
Alright?

252
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:55,840
Dad.

253
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,670
Dad, who is he really?

254
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
Tell him.

255
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,240
Having another brother is a good thing.

256
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,240
If you keep talking.

257
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,030
I'll make sure you get nothing.

258
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,080
You hear me?

259
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,790
Leave.

260
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,200
No, wait.

261
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,720
I said get out!

262
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,150
No.

263
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,750
Well.

264
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,790
You won't talk? Then I will.

265
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,390
Your dad is my dad too.

266
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:11,960
Ma Xiao...

267
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,270
After college, he was assigned to

268
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,030
the cultural center
in my mom's hometown.

269
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,270
He dated my mom.

270
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,720
- Ma Xiaowei. -She then had me!

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,360
Don't listen...

272
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,320
Later your mom

273
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,270
- Don't listen. - went painting.

274
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,840
Don't listen to him.

275
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,750
When our dad saw

276
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,440
your grandpa had power and influence,

277
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,000
- he wanted the big city! - Ma Xiaowei!

278
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,870
- Ma Xiaowei! - Then later,

279
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,390
he abandoned my mom!

280
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,200
Ma Xiaowei!

281
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,120
Ridiculous right?

282
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,750
Get out now!

283
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,150
Out!

284
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,550
Is what he said true?

285
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,360
Let me explain okay?

286
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,600
-Let me explain. -Dad, Dad.

287
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,200
Okay?

288
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,870
Since my brother is here today,

289
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,720
let's lay all cards on the table.

290
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,320
Why does he get to live large,

291
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,000
while my mom just gets
a few thousands yearly?

292
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,600
You kept in touch with them.

293
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,840
You maintained contact.

294
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
You gave them money.

295
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,960
How could you do this to my mom?

296
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:07,790
Hey, man.

297
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,550
There's an order to everything.

298
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,440
Shut up!

299
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,270
My mom was his first love.

300
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,320
It's unforgettable.

301
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,270
Shut up!

302
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,320
I... I...

303
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,390
I never betrayed your mother.

304
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,870
Let me explain.

305
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,120
Okay?

306
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,550
Dad.

307
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,390
You kept the communication.

308
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,080
Is it because you can't forget that woman?

309
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,510
No, I never...

310
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,320
No.

311
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,510
Ai Zhonghua.

312
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,510
How could you do this to my mom?

313
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,510
How could you do this to me?

314
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,510
Linjiang.

315
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,510
It's not what you think.

316
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,270
- All these years were just an act?
- No.

317
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,910
So you had another family outside?

318
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,320
It's not what you think.

319
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,550
I can't stand this anymore.

320
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,870
Linjiang.

321
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,030
Dad! Dad! Dad!

322
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,200
- Don't go. I'm here. - Linjiang.

323
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,720
- I'll take care of you. - Linjiang!

324
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,200
Give me a bigger share of the money.

325
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,910
- You're... - Let go!

326
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:01,790
Mr. Ai!

327
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,240
Mr. Ai!

328
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,150
I didn't do anything.

329
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,670
Help! We need help here!

330
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,390
Mr. Ai!

331
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,270
Mr. Ai!

332
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,600
Let me ask you.

333
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,750
If the old man dies now,

334
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,750
can I still get half the estate?

335
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,550
Yes.

336
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,030
I already checked for you.

337
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,440
As long as there's no will,

338
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,510
it's 50-50 split.

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,390
Really?

340
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,240
Are you sure?

341
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,240
Suspected heart attack.

342
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,790
Nearest green channel center

343
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,080
is about 1km away.

344
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,480
Call 120! Quick!

345
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,910
Man, call 120!

346
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,670
Heart relief pills!

347
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:57,550
Here.

348
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,630
Baodan.

349
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,120
Xue Xiaozhou.

350
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,720
Look what you've done.

351
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,480
Mr. Ai is admitted to the ICU

352
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,750
because of Ma Xiaowei.

353
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,550
They're resuscitating him now. Happy?

354
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,120
Let's go.

355
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,440
Hu Manli.

356
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,670
What's going on?

357
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,240
If anything happens to

358
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,320
Mr. Ai today,

359
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,030
I'm telling you...

360
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,510
I... I didn't...

361
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,910
What exactly happened?

362
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,150
Chen.

363
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,720
Ms. Hu

364
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,870
You finally came.

365
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,000
How's Mr. Ai?

366
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,750
Heart attack.
Still unconscious after CPR.

367
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,200
Currently under observation in ICU.

368
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,020
[ICU]

369
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,440
Insurance salespeople?

370
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,030
Why are you here?

371
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,910
So eager to do business?

372
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,960
Can we see Mr. Ai?

373
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,910
No.

374
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,910
Don't you know ICU

375
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,910
doesn't allow outsiders?

376
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,360
He won't even let me in.

377
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,870
Call the police!

378
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:50,790
We did.

379
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,840
When police came

380
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,550
and heard he's Mr. Ai's son,

381
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,600
they said it's family dispute

382
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,720
and told us to work it out.

383
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,630
Where's Linjiang?

384
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,960
His phone's turned off.

385
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,270
Nobody knows his whereabouts now.

386
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,120
This critical moment shows

387
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,510
which son is actually reliable.

388
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,670
Exactly.

389
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,000
All you bystanders step back.

390
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,480
Go away.

391
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,790
Get out!

392
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,750
How annoying.

393
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,030
Ms. Hu,

394
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,670
there's another situation now.

395
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,390
I'm afraid this Ma Xiaowei

396
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,120
won't be satisfied with 3 million.

397
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,120
What does he want?

398
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,600
He's now guarding outside ICU

399
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,960
blocking everyone from seeing Mr. Ai.

400
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,150
If anything happens to Mr. Ai,

401
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,720
without leaving a will...

402
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,670
So that's his scheme.

403
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,480
Now.

404
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,120
List all possible places

405
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,080
where his son might be.

406
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,480
We must find Ai Linjiang now

407
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,790
to take charge of this crisis.

408
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,000
Understood.

409
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,720
I've sent you several addresses

410
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,550
of places Mr. Linjiang frequents.

411
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,510
Let's search separately

412
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,000
If we find him?

413
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,270
Tell him to come here immediately!

414
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,510
He won't come.

415
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,590
He has to.

416
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,550
Mr. Ai deceived him for so long.

417
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,920
He'll never forgive him.

418
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,070
Mr. Ai is lying in bed now.

419
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,750
What are you saying?

420
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,440
Hu Manli.

421
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,160
The day you assigned me
Mr. Ai's case was

422
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,680
my dad's death anniversary.

423
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,510
I'm sorry.

424
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,880
What I said that day

425
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
was indeed too harsh.

426
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,550
But you insisted I deceived you.

427
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,550
That made me angry too.

428
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
Three years ago, he had a car accident

429
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,960
and was critically injured.

430
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,110
Before dying,

431
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,240
he asked to see me.

432
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,310
Said he needed to talk to me.

433
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,790
I didn't go.

434
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,720
Why didn't you go?

435
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,070
Why should I?

436
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,510
What could he possibly say anyway?

437
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,270
Nothing but that same "I'm sorry".

438
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,510
Can his sorry

439
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,750
undo all the harm he caused?

440
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,440
And no matter what he says,

441
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
I'll never forgive him.

442
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,070
Whether forgiveness comes is uncertain.

443
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,200
The key is your dad is gone.

444
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,110
You'll never hear him again.

445
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,400
That's why you've regretted it till now.

446
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,310
Deep down,
you actually want to forgive him.

447
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,550
Hating someone is easy.

448
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,550
But forgiving takes courage.

449
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,510
Hu Manli, you don't understand anything.

450
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,000
You don't know how much

451
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,350
I used to idolize my dad.

452
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,480
How good he was to me.

453
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,310
I just feel like

454
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,750
all my memories before

455
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,440
were just an illusion.

456
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,000
I'll never forgive him.

457
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,200
Never.

458
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,160
The reason you're in such pain

459
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,880
is precisely because your dad loved you.

460
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,750
When there's a knot in your heart,
undo it.

461
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,920
Your dad's "I'm sorry",

462
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,160
you need to find it yourself.

463
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,270
Understand?

464
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,270
My ride's here.

465
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:48,960
I'm leaving.

466
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,960
Call me later.

467
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,200
Ten years ago
when he was with that woman,

468
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,350
he stopped being my father!

469
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,640
He doesn't deserve to be my dad!

470
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,830
I'm not his son!

471
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,920
I won't forgive him!

472
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,590
I'll never forgive him!

473
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,400
Dad, is this your new office?

474
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,790
It'll all be yours someday.

475
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,000
Son,

476
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,110
remember:

477
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,750
All dad's hard work

478
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,510
is for your future.

479
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,270
I'll take responsibility for my mistakes.

480
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,000
Hello, need a driver?

481
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,200
No, no, thanks.

482
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,510
Mr. Ai!

483
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,160
Mr. Ai!

484
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,750
Your father had a heart attack.

485
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,000
He's in the hospital now.

486
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,880
What kind of trick is this?

487
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,640
A sympathy play?

488
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,550
Save it.

489
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,440
No, I-I-I'm not lying!

490
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,720
You can call Chen

491
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,790
to confirm it yourself.

492
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,400
I'll arrange

493
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,640
the best doctors for his treatment.

494
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,550
I'll fulfill all my obligations,

495
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,920
but that's all between us.

496
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,830
- Hello? - No, Mr. Ai,

497
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,750
Are you the owner of car 0081?

498
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,640
Here, come here.

499
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,480
It's okay, I'll take him.

500
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
I'll cancel the order.

501
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,510
Thanks, thank you.

502
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,110
Xue Xiaozhou!

503
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,920
What your father needs now
isn't a doctor!

504
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,160
I'm sorry.

505
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,000
You... your father...

506
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,550
I know exactly what he wants.

507
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,640
But many things require reciprocity.

508
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,160
He never gave it to me.

509
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,110
How could I give it to him?

510
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,070
You simply don't understand!

511
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,830
You're completely trapped in
your own imagination!

512
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,590
If you don't go to the hospital tonight

513
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,640
and don't sign those papers,

514
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,350
your father might...

515
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:48,790
You'll

516
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,000
never get to hear his explanation.

517
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,200
I know this feeling.

518
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,880
My father called for me before he died.

519
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,640
I...

520
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,350
I didn't go.

521
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,070
To this day, I still live with that pain.

522
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:09,880
Your father...

523
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,310
Do you

524
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,830
want to hear my story?

525
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,030
Okay... I understand.

526
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,070
Xiaozhou found Mr. Linjiang.

527
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,440
He refuses to come back.

528
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,350
Doctor.

529
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,750
Who's Ai Zhonghua's family?

530
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,880
Me! I'm his son!

531
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,270
Sign the critical condition notice.

532
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,160
Critical condition notice...

533
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
My dad's condition is critical?

534
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,750
No.

535
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,000
We still need to treat the patient.

536
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
This is an unexpected incident notice,

537
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,070
meaning we should prepare ourselves.

538
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,400
Doctor, I'm the patient's subordinate.

539
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,510
I'd like to know

540
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,790
Mr. Ai's current condition.

541
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,480
The patient is currently stable

542
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,480
with standard treatment.

543
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,160
If all goes well,

544
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,640
he should wake up tomorrow.

545
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,550
The prognosis is quite optimistic.

546
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,350
That's good.

547
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,590
Dude.

548
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,480
Dude.

549
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,070
You can't sign this document

550
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,200
Why? Why?

551
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,200
Only when the old man

552
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,310
is gone

553
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,480
can we get half the inheritance.

554
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,240
How can you say that?

555
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,480
He's my biological father!

556
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:39,920
Exactly.

557
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,310
Did he ever treat you as his son?

558
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,200
If he wakes up,

559
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,750
forget half the inheritance.

560
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:45,790
You might

561
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,310
lose even the original three million.

562
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,310
Xiaowei,

563
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,240
three... three million?

564
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,590
Ma Xiaowei.

565
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,000
Sign it now.

566
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,830
The doctor said

567
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,310
Mr. Ai will wake up tomorrow.

568
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,270
Three million!

569
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:56,640
Don't.

570
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,640
You can't sign it.

571
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,750
Are you sure?

572
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:02,960
I won't sign.

573
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,070
You crappy notice says you're

574
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,510
not responsible for anything.

575
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,000
What if you kill my dad?

576
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,640
Exactly.

577
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,000
It's just a formality.

578
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,070
Then guarantee

579
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,350
you can cure him.

580
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,640
How can I guarantee that?

581
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,030
See? He can't guarantee.

582
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,440
Right, I think your hospital

583
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,790
just wants my dad's money.

584
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,030
We're going home!

585
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,750
Let's go home.

586
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,240
Ma Xiaowei!

587
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,880
Are you trying to kill Mr. Ai?

588
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
What are you saying?

589
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,310
He's your boss's real son!

590
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,510
You dare drive us away?

591
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,590
Hear that? Xiaowei says no treatment.

592
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:28,830
Right.

593
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,310
Find someone!

594
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,640
Get Mr. Ai discharged!

595
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,270
Doctor.

596
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,480
Can you treat him first?

597
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,200
Family will sign when they arrive.

598
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,440
Well...

599
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,070
It's a matter of life and death.

600
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,030
Doctor, let me tell you.

601
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,510
You can't treat recklessly.

602
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,160
If anything goes wrong,

603
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,440
you'll be held responsible.

604
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:44,720
Right.

605
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Ma Xiaowei, you bastard!

606
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,590
What are you doing?

607
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,160
Hit me?

608
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,960
Stop it!

609
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,030
What are you all doing?

610
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,270
Stop arguing! Quiet! This is a hospital!

611
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,110
Don't fight!

612
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,960
Stop fighting!

613
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,110
What's all the noise?

614
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,750
What are you doing?

615
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,590
No fighting!

616
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,110
Doctor, I'll sign.

617
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,030
I'm Ai Zhonghua's son.

618
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,680
What are you doing?

619
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,720
Why are you here?

620
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,640
I'm signing it.

621
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,680
Go back.

622
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,270
What are you doing?

623
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,350
How dare you come here?

624
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:05,960
What are you doing?

625
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,720
My dad became like this because of you!

626
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,350
And now you come to sign this thing.

627
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,720
I think you're
deliberately trying to kill him!

628
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,200
Right.

629
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,640
I did this to him?

630
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,920
Ma Xiaowei,
we'll settle our score later!

631
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,960
Right now I'm here to sign this!

632
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,750
No way!

633
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,030
Sign it, I dare you.

634
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,880
Listen up everyone

635
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,480
Nobody harms my father.

636
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,640
I'll stand guard here today.

637
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,030
If I say no treatment, then no treatment.

638
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,550
Exactly.

639
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,310
Stop it!

640
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,960
This is a hospital!

641
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,510
We won't tolerate your nonsense!

642
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,480
Family disputes, is it?

643
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,960
Take it outside!

644
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,830
Let me tell you.

645
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,880
Now is the critical recovery period.

646
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,240
Miss this window,

647
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,550
you face the consequences!

648
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,270
Move aside!

649
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,440
This is ridiculous!

650
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:44,750
What?

651
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,830
What now?

652
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,350
Bring it on.

653
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,680
Mr. Ai, calm down!

654
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,200
Wanna fight?

655
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,750
Calm down, Mr. Ai.

656
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,350
Ma Xiaowei.

657
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,920
You'd better pray that Mr. Ai

658
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,920
can wake up.

659
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,640
What do you mean by that?

660
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,200
He's my biological father

661
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,880
Of course I want him healthy.

662
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,680
And safe and sound.

663
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,590
No, you don't.

664
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,440
You want something bad to happen,

665
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,920
so you can get half the fortune.

666
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,750
You... you...

667
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,200
Don't talk nonsense.

668
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,400
That's your assumption.

669
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,310
I never meant that!

670
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,440
Your clever scheme isn't wrong.

671
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,960
But if things really

672
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,400
come to that point.

673
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,790
You'll need to prove your relation
with Mr. Ai.

674
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,350
Right? What will you need?

675
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,590
A DNA test.

676
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,480
To run a DNA test,

677
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,030
you need Mr. Ai Linjiang's approval.

678
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,350
If he disagrees,

679
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,160
you can't get tested.

680
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,750
Listen, don't try to scare me.

681
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,880
You're his man.

682
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,640
You side with him.

683
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,110
I graduated from law school.

684
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,160
If you don't believe me,

685
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,070
we can make a bet

686
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,400
to see if I'm telling the truth.

687
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,400
You'd better pray Mr. Ai stays safe.

688
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,720
And in good health

689
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,960
When he's awake,

690
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,510
he might still spare you some change

691
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,070
for your mother's sake.

692
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,270
Otherwise, you won't get a single cent.

693
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,640
Xiaowei.

694
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,270
Alright.

695
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,030
Sign if you want to.

696
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,240
Do whatever you please.

697
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,240
But let me make this clear.

698
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
If anything happens to my father,

699
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,000
I won't let you off the hook. Let's go!

700
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,510
Just you wait!

701
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,720
Call the doctor! We'll sign.

702
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,480
Okay.

703
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,750
It's already dawn.

704
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,240
How did you finally convince
Ai Linjiang?

705
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,680
I'll never know

706
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,270
what my father wanted to tell me
before he died.

707
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,110
Even just an "I'm sorry"

708
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,270
or calling me "son" once.

709
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,200
I might

710
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,030
not have suffered this much.

711
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,830
Mr. Ai.

712
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,960
Don't you

713
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,000
want to hear your father

714
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,510
tell you the truth himself?

715
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,510
Your story is moving,

716
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,070
but it doesn't move me.

717
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,960
The truth is already clear.

718
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,310
My father,

719
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,240
for all these years,

720
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,350
has kept ties with his first love,

721
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,160
even with shady dealings

722
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,200
I didn't know about.

723
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,480
What if he maintained contact

724
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,830
out of responsibility?

725
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,720
Don't speak for him.

726
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,440
I'm not speaking for him.

727
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,070
When I first heard Mr. Ai's story,

728
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,960
I thought it was fake too.

729
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,880
I thought he made it up.

730
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,680
It thought it was to
make excuses for himself.

731
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,510
I was furious too.

732
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,440
But I'm just an outsider.

733
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
I know nothing.

734
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,590
Only you know

735
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,790
whether he played
the perfect husband and father

736
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,480
for 30 years,

737
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,160
or

738
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,030
he genuinely cared for you both.

739
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,720
Only you know the truth, Mr. Ai.

740
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,400
Let me ask you.

741
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,440
What if it's really as I suspect?

742
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,960
Then go hear his confession.

743
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,790
Even the most wicked villain

744
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,880
deserves the right to repent.

745
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,510
Seriously, Mr. Ai, don't end up like me.

746
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:07,960
In the days to come,

747
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,880
you'll keep thinking over and over

748
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,270
about the days you spent together.

749
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,160
Were they real

750
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,070
or just fake?

751
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,790
Take my advice.

752
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,240
Go to the hospital.

753
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,400
Listen to Mr. Ai.

754
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,200
Let him explain.

755
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,030
Don't regret it for life.

756
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,510
Not bad.

757
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:37,720
You've improved.

758
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,830
Mainly thanks to what you said.

759
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,000
Really?

760
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,350
I've said so many reasonable things.

761
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,830
Which one?

762
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,310
The one about

763
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,790
apologies needing to be reclaimed.

764
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,550
Have you reclaimed yours?

765
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,310
Me?

766
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,270
Still working on it.

767
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,640
Not that fast.

768
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
I'm back.

769
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,540
Yes.

770
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,030
Baodan.

771
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,310
What are you doing?

772
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,350
Looking for something.

773
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,880
Looking for what?

774
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,110
Ya, you asked me before.

775
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,160
After my mom had the accident

776
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,200
if I regretted
dropping out to care for her.

777
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,710
Why bring this up suddenly?

778
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,320
Everyone thinks I did it

779
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,230
because I'm a good son.

780
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,710
But actually no.

781
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,320
I didn't do it for my mom,

782
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,440
or not entirely for her.

783
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,760
Mostly I did it for myself.

784
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,190
For yourself?

785
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,030
After my dad passed away,

786
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
I felt so much pain.

787
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,280
To put it simply,

788
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,960
I was utterly devastated.

789
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,550
I felt like

790
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,550
I had nothing left.

791
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,630
I had to exhaust myself

792
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,360
by taking care of my mom

793
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,880
just to forget the pain.

794
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,710
I was using this to numb myself.

795
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,320
Otherwise,

796
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,070
I might have...

797
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,400
Xiaozhou,

798
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,070
even though you keep saying

799
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,110
You won't forgive your father,

800
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,880
you actually love him dearly.

801
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,230
Don't you?

802
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,000
My dad asked someone

803
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,510
to buy me is game console from Japan.

804
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,230
After he bought it,

805
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,550
we both became

806
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,840
totally addicted to this racing game.

807
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,920
We played it every single day,

808
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,760
day and night.

809
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,400
Later because of this,

810
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,440
my mom kept scolding my dad.

811
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
But dad always protected me.

812
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,840
They went back and forth.

813
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,190
Anyway...

814
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,280
It was pretty happy times.

815
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,760
But soon after, they separated.

816
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:19,670
What?

817
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,280
Test if it still works.

818
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,070
It's been so long.

819
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,880
Probably won't work.

820
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,110
Just give it a try.

821
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:36,920
Here, hold this.

822
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,510
Take it.

823
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,760
Steady.

824
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,840
Careful.

825
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,960
It still works.

826
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,510
What?

827
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,550
I'll play with you.

828
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,360
No...never mind.

829
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,800
Consider it remembering your dad.

830
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,460
Wait.

831
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,550
What's wrong?

832
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,670
Wait a minute.

833
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,550
Your parents split up 13 years ago.

834
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,920
But this game's last login was

835
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,150
three years ago.

836
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,070
On your birthday.

837
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,670
Xiaozhou.

838
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,960
I guess

839
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,000
after your parents separated,

840
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,670
every year on your birthday,

841
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,510
your dad would launch this game.

842
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,880
He was using this method

843
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,400
to quietly think of you.

844
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,800
I'm waiving inheritance rights

845
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,070
to that apartment.

846
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,440
The agreement.

847
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,070
Xiaozhou.

848
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,630
Thank you for understanding

849
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,670
Once I receive

850
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,550
the down payment, I'll transfer

851
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,440
the 500K immediately.

852
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:35,880
No need.

853
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,920
Wait till the company turns profit.

854
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,190
I'm not selling for the money.

855
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,150
My dad...

856
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,480
Anyway, the sale proceeds

857
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,880
must go to company operations.

858
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,110
This is clearly stated in the agreement.

859
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,590
After the transaction,

860
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,840
I'll show you transfer proof.

861
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,670
Get the contract notarized by lawyer.

862
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,590
Then arrange sale immediately.

863
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,360
This needs urgent handling

864
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,800
before he changes his mind.

865
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,000
Alright.

866
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:30,920
by the way

867
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,150
is everything arranged with Li Fendou?

868
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,960
It's all scheduled.

869
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,150
But what if Professor Ding
doesn't cooperate?

870
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,510
He will.

871
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,110
He's a scholar.

872
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,230
What scholars want is respect.

873
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,320
As long as we show enough respect,

874
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,510
he'll give us

875
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,670
whatever we want.

876
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,030
Thank you.

877
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,630
Just a small 42nd birthday party.

878
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,880
Some noodles at home would suffice.

879
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,760
Why must we go out?

880
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,920
This is the first birthday

881
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,360
we celebrate together.

882
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,030
You have to follow my arrangements.

883
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,110
No objections allowed.

884
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,800
Isn't this Li Fendou's place?

885
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,590
Why are we here?

886
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Ms. Qiu!

887
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,960
Mr. Li!

888
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,960
I didn't know you are today.

889
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,880
Just finished a lunch meeting.

890
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,510
And this is?

891
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,630
Let me introduce you.

892
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,630
This is my partner, Ding Zhiyuan.

893
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,320
Hello.

894
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,710
Professor Ding!

895
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,000
Hello!

896
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,280
I've long heard of your reputation.

897
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,510
I contacted you the other day.

898
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,000
Ms. Qiu said you're busy.

899
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,550
But look!

900
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,000
I caught you red-handed today!

901
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,070
As they say, planned meetings
aren't as good as chance encounters.

902
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,630
Let's have a proper drink today, okay?

903
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,320
Allow me!

904
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,710
That won't do.

905
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,150
Today is Professor Ding's birthday.

906
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,880
Don't you dare steal my guest.

907
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,320
Birthday, huh?

908
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,280
Perfect.

909
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,280
Wang, come here!

910
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,280
Coming!

911
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,150
Clear out the best private room for me.

912
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,920
And order the finest cake.

913
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,190
It must arrive within half an hour.

914
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,590
Yes, Mr. Li.

915
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,880
Mr. Li, really, there's no need.

916
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,710
Professor Ding...

917
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,070
I understand.

918
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,360
Birthdays should be for couples' time.

919
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,630
But I must show my respect.

920
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,960
Don't worry,
I'll leave after arranging everything.

921
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,710
Won't be in the way.

922
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,710
How could we accept this?

923
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,110
Exactly. You're the host treating us.

924
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,440
Guests shouldn't make the host leave.

925
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,800
That'll be inappropriate.

926
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,630
Mr. Li, how about...

927
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:30,630
You...

928
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,320
Join us?

929
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,360
Ms. Qiu.

930
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,510
I shouldn't be a third wheel.

931
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,590
Don't be silly.

932
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,360
We'll have plenty of couple time.

933
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,320
Right, Zhiyuan?

934
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:44,710
Right.

935
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,630
Yes.

936
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,630
See?

937
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,880
Let's eat together.

938
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,550
That'd be wonderful!

939
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,150
If Professor Ding doesn't mind,

940
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,670
let's celebrate together!

941
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,150
Tea first, alright?

942
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:54,710
Alright!

943
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,150
Here.

944
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,400
Let's go.

00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,480
