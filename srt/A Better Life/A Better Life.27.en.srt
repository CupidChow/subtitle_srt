00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,440
What do you mean?

197
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,870
Back at the entrance of the firm,

198
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,790
you called me

199
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,150
blissfully ignorant.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,150
I succeeded

201
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,840
simply because I joined in

202
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,840
at the right timing.

203
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,600
It was not much about my capability.

204
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,200
I was angry. It didn't mean a thing.

205
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,360
You were right.

206
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,080
During the decades,

207
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,550
I was indeed lucky.

208
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,870
I ran in an elevator

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,670
and thought I made it by myself,

210
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,440
omnipotent.

211
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,000
I crossed the line

212
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,390
and thought I was wronged.

213
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,030
In that case,

214
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,270
anyone in insurance

215
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,150
during the period

216
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,840
can hit it big.

217
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,390
Impossible.

218
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,670
You made it

219
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,320
for the right timing,

220
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,360
and for you are better than others.

221
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,510
Thanks.

222
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,910
But this time.

223
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,270
I really think I'm wrong.

224
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,750
Selling the house

225
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,960
isn't just for payment.

226
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,750
I want to get up

227
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,960
on my own,

228
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,120
washing away the past,

229
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,150
and start all over again.

230
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,240
Don't worry about me.

231
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,510
I had nothing

232
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,030
but I became Insurance Star.

233
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
I can now

234
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,870
start from scratch too.

235
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,120
Daer cried on the way.

236
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,030
He wouldn't tell a thing.

237
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,600
Then,

238
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,790
I called Manli and

239
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,670
learnt the whole thing.

240
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,480
Manli could do anything

241
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,360
for personal gains,

242
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,630
stooping so low.

243
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,750
Now it's on the up and up,

244
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,750
she suffered even more.

245
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,240
You can't be sure.

246
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,200
Probably there's a misunderstanding.

247
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,000
I know her.

248
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,390
She looks snobbish,

249
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,360
but she won't break the law.

250
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,320
I think there's

251
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,030
a story behind.

252
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,630
Of course, it doesn't

253
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,960
matter now.

254
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,870
I just think it's a special time

255
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,510
for the kid.

256
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,910
So I want him to stay

257
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,360
for a while.

258
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,840
How long is that?

259
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,840
Zhiyuan.

260
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,870
I also need to be looked after.

261
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,550
I don't want to neglect him.

262
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,510
You won't.

263
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,670
He goes to school during day,

264
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,790
and has dinner at night.

265
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,630
He does his homework

266
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,600
and goes to sleep.

267
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,960
Lisu.

268
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,510
Look.

269
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,440
We'll going to have a baby.

270
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,320
Though you're not Daer's mom,

271
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,510
the baby

272
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,550
in your belly

273
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,870
is still Daer's sibling.

274
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,510
Daer could stay here

275
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,960
to get to know them a little earlier.

276
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,790
The room downstairs faces north.

277
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,790
It's a bit cold.

278
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,630
Will he mind?

279
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,030
No...

280
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,080
Thanks.

281
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,080
I'll go to prepare.

282
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,240
Daer.

283
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,080
Daer.

284
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,240
Li Fendou.

285
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,960
You know him?

286
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,390
No.

287
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,000
But this professor influencer.

288
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,840
Ding Zhiyuan, I know him.

289
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,200
Li Fendou is something.

290
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,670
He has a humble background

291
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,630
but he's sharp.

292
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,030
Running a stall,

293
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,200
he made money and bought houses.

294
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,080
Then he purchased buildings

295
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,000
in the right time.

296
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,000
Now he's worth a lot.

297
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,840
You mean...

298
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,320
I'm informed

299
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,750
he's consulting

300
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,670
inheritance.

301
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,600
This is our chance.

302
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,440
Follow up on his case.

303
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,390
I see.

304
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,200
I'll read the autobiography.

305
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,960
And, Qing.

306
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm familiar already with

307
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,240
the family office's work.

308
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,110
Now you assigned a new task.

309
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,400
I want to request

310
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,830
a team of my own.

311
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,790
OK.

312
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,480
Tell the human resources to

313
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,200
recruit.

314
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,110
I have my candidate.

315
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,740
[Nursing Home Example]

316
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,160
Hello?

317
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,000
Is that Tianyang Nursing Home?

318
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,590
Check here.

319
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,480
Sign at the bottom if everything's OK.

320
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,590
Madam.

321
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,240
Anything wrong?

322
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,590
Can we raise the price?

323
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,750
Well.

324
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,350
I bought this house

325
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,550
for 12,000,000.

326
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,070
If I sell it at 9,000,000,

327
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,510
I'll suffer a huge loss.

328
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,720
You know the market.

329
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,030
This is the best we can do.

330
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,920
I know a guy sold a first-floor house.

331
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,200
The same layout.

332
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,270
9,500,000.

333
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,920
But you want a one-time payment.

334
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,960
We'll have to lower the price.

335
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,720
Is that right?

336
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,480
How about this?

337
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,030
Eight is a lucky number.

338
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,400
Let's make it 9,080,000.

339
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,590
Madam, if you're still considering,

340
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,720
we should call it a day.

341
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,350
No...

342
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,070
But you'll also

343
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,440
keep the furniture.

344
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,350
These pieces are

345
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,070
costly.

346
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,720
I know you have a kid.

347
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
New ones will give out chemicals.

348
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
It's bad for the kid.

349
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,680
Right.

350
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,270
These pieces of furniture.

351
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,440
All designer brands.

352
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,750
I've been maintaining them.

353
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,000
The chair.

354
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,590
A whole piece of marble.

355
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,880
Not pieced together.

356
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,880
Look, steady.

357
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,350
A bit dear.

358
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,920
Fine, a little expensive.

359
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,750
Should we raise a bit?

360
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,070
OK.

361
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,310
Another 50,000.

362
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,510
We are really in need.

363
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,550
80,000 is really a bargain.

364
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,200
Right?

365
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,720
He's right.

366
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,350
60,000.

367
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,590
Not a penny more.

368
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,240
- But…
- OK!

369
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,680
That's...

370
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,310
Deal.

371
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,240
Thank you.

372
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,160
OK.

373
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,310
Please sign.

374
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,880
I'll make a supplementary

375
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,110
agreement on furniture.

376
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,440
OK.

377
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,920
Sign where?

378
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,750
Here.

379
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,000
OK.

380
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,680
This way.

381
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,000
OK.

382
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,590
Thank you.

383
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,240
OK.

384
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,750
Bye.

385
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,310
See you, sir.

386
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:27,720
Thanks.

387
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,200
Bye.

388
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,270
What's next?

389
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,790
I'll pay

390
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,350
Blue Ocean

391
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,830
and pay up mortgage.

392
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
I'll use the rest

393
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,880
to accommodate Dad.

394
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,680
What about you?

395
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,110
Me?

396
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,400
Let's see.

397
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,780
[Employment Contract]

398
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,070
What?

399
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,440
For me?

400
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,030
It's not right.

401
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,880
I was banned.

402
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,920
I can't sell.

403
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,110
You won't sell.

404
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,590
You'll join the family office.

405
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,110
I said

406
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
the last thing I need

407
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,640
is sympathy.

408
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,110
It's not sympathy.

409
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,720
I need you to work with me.

410
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,920
Work with you?

411
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,550
Funny.

412
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,160
Always working together.

413
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
Running in circles.

414
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,510
Come on.

415
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,440
Let's ally.

416
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,270
No.

417
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,510
Why not?

418
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,640
I don't have the energy.

419
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,000
Look at my dad.

420
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,240
I need to look after him

421
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,790
and his recovery.

422
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,750
Go find a helper.

423
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,790
Leave it to the professional.

424
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,110
I asked around.

425
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,000
They charge nearly 10,000 a month.

426
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,640
I can't afford it.

427
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,030
Manli.

428
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,030
I'm sincerely offering

429
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,030
you a job.

430
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,350
Full welfare

431
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,640
and a base pay.

432
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,960
Extra bonuses come with

433
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,070
any new projects.

434
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,830
You get to decide the ratio.

435
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,920
You'll earn a lot.

436
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,880
Forget it.

437
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,030
I don't want others to look after Dad.

438
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,350
Then,

439
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,240
I have an idea.

440
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,680
At Tianyang, we design zones

441
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,830
catering to various needs.

442
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,200
Just now it's self-care zone.

443
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,000
So it focuses on good environment.

444
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,640
This is nursing zone

445
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,790
where people with reduced mobility

446
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,110
and elders who need care live.

447
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,310
So it addresses

448
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,110
recovery functions.

449
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,160
This way.

450
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:38,880
Here.

451
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,920
This bed is imported.

452
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,680
It syncs moments of your back and knee,

453
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,480
reducing deviation of body.

454
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,160
And it restricts angles to

455
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,960
reduce pressure on your chest

456
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,880
and stomach.

457
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,200
Mr. Xue.

458
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,030
You said the client had

459
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,200
a cerebral hemorrhage.

460
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,590
Right?

461
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,270
Yes.

462
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,680
You've come to the right place.

463
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,790
We have professional recovery equipment

464
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,920
and doctors.

465
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,070
They'll guide your recovery.

466
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,200
An elder used to live here.

467
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,880
After a year of recovery,

468
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
he moved to the self-care zone.

469
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,510
If you're interested,

470
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,790
we can talk to him.

471
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,310
OK.

472
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,200
No, thanks.

473
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,440
Thanks...

474
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:18,960
Excuse me.

475
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,200
A moment.

476
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,880
You don't like it here?

477
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,440
I like it.

478
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,920
It doesn't like me.

479
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,830
With my dad's conditions,

480
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,640
it'll be 20,000 a month.

481
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,440
I calculated.

482
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,030
After you pay Blue Ocean

483
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,790
and mortgage,

484
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,000
you then buy an annuity product.

485
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,270
Your dad can live here,

486
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,680
and you get to work at TSI.

487
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,640
There's no place like home.

488
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,960
But you don't have

489
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,270
a home.

490
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,830
I'll rent.

491
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,310
I'll pass on a nursing home.

492
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,590
But what about your dad?

493
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,350
He needs care

494
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,350
and recovery.

495
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,400
He needs help.

496
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,270
You'll help him?

497
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,880
Yes.

498
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,000
You won't work?

499
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,590
Having a helper costs money too.

500
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,160
My pay might not cover the bills.

501
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:07,750
I'll do it.

502
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,640
Have some senses!

503
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,510
Listen.

504
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,160
You got fired

505
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,350
and banned from insurance.

506
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,590
Why did you work so hard

507
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,000
to get back into the business?

508
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,240
For money. Why else?

509
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,310
Because you love your job.

510
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,880
Your passion.

511
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,880
You can have the best of both worlds.

512
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,310
Why will you give up?

513
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,720
He's my dad.

514
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,440
He needs my care.

515
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,750
I can't bear to push him

516
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,640
into a nursing home.

517
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,070
My dad

518
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,480
didn't do anything big.

519
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,160
But he gave me his all.

520
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,680
I can't treat him this way.

521
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,590
Manli.

522
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,200
Dong?

523
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,750
Ms. Zhou.

524
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,560
[Homage to...]

525
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,000
Honey.

526
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,920
They're here to see you.

527
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,880
Manli.

528
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,830
The one who

529
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,640
sells insurance?

530
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,920
Yes.

531
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,480
This is...

532
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,830
I'm Xue Xiaozhou.

533
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,400
Her colleague.

534
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,510
I also do this job.

535
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,440
We met before.

536
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,000
I can't recall.

537
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,240
It's OK.

538
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,000
After her last year's checkup,

539
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,920
I asked Sun Jie about it.

540
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,920
She said Zhou's in the early stage.

541
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,240
Yes.

542
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,270
She got oblivious.

543
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,480
So I told Sun Jie

544
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,350
I should move in

545
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,510
and take care of her.

546
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,790
Turned out I

547
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,550
hurt her instead.

548
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,720
Hurt her?

549
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:56,790
How so?

550
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,590
You need to be careful

551
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,400
and professional

552
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,880
to look after patients with AD.

553
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,270
I thought

554
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,920
as long as I

555
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,200
watch over,

556
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,030
keep an eye on her,

557
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,270
nothing will happen.

558
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,510
But her memory failed so bad

559
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,550
that one time

560
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,400
she didn't recognize her granddaughter.

561
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,920
The girl cried nonstop.

562
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,510
She finally recalled days after.

563
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,830
Then,

564
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,110
the doc advised us to get treatment

565
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,920
at institutions.

566
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,350
I need to thank you.

567
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,270
You guys got her

568
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,750
a EverTogether plan.

569
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,880
It comes with

570
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,400
access to living in a nursing home.

571
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,680
So I brought her here.

572
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,310
I'm OK...

573
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
You're Dong.

574
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,400
You're Manli.

575
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,350
You're...

576
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,110
Xue Xiaozhou.

577
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,750
Xiaozhou.

578
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,310
Xiaozhou.

579
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,110
Oh.

580
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,310
I remember.

581
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,440
Sun Jie should've told me.

582
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,400
If I hadn't bumped into

583
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,960
you here,

584
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,160
she might've forgotten me.

585
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,000
She knows your situation.

586
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,590
She didn't want Sun Jie to worry you.

587
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,000
But don't worry.

588
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,880
This neighborhood is excellent.

589
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
We're warmly received

590
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,350
and moved in smoothly.

591
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,480
Every morning,

592
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,880
helpers guide the patients

593
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,750
to recover their touch senses.

594
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,310
There's classes in the afternoon.

595
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,440
The helper and I both watch her closely.

596
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,030
She's on diet and medicine regularly.

597
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,270
Now she's much better.

598
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,750
You don't know.

599
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,440
Nursing homes these days are amazing.

600
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,110
I've sold

601
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,830
many health care products,

602
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,110
but I lost touch

603
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,960
with the latest health care values.

604
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,160
This isn't your fault.

605
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,590
Chinese always want their children

606
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,720
for help.

607
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,920
These values

608
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,680
are essentially good.

609
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,920
But time has changed.

610
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,200
Our life routines

611
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,200
changed.

612
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,480
The elders' needs changed.

613
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,680
That's why there's nursing homes

614
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,000
to solve your problem.

615
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,240
Manli.

616
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,270
Ms. Zhou.

617
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:32,960
Here.

618
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,640
Ms. Zhou.

619
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,110
You've been knitting since you moved in.

620
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,830
They're for her?

621
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,160
Yes.

622
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,960
Put them on

623
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,400
when it's cold.

624
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,590
You remember.

625
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,350
You give a pair to me every year.

626
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,400
Pretty. I love them.

627
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,750
Thanks.

628
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,310
You're welcome.

629
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,880
Isn't it nice here?

630
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,480
Your dad should take a look

631
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,880
to see if he likes it here.

632
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,750
It's indeed nice.

633
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,960
I'll talk to Dad.

634
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,000
When he moves in, where do you live?

635
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,440
Me?

636
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,830
Anywhere's OK.

637
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,510
When you go to TSI,

638
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,440
I'll apply for a dorm for you.

639
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,750
You can do that?

640
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,160
Yes.

641
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,590
Dad.

642
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,750
I've

643
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,790
met some troubles.

644
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,960
Guess you've known.

645
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,440
Next,

646
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,640
I want

647
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,880
you to live in a nurse home.

648
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,240
If you agree,

649
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,640
shake it.

650
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:13,720
Dad.

651
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,550
Nursing homes nowadays are nice.

652
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,510
I just got back.

653
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,400
They're different from

654
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,880
those from before.

655
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,480
In there,

656
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,880
you'll recover better

657
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,590
guided by professionals.

658
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,310
OK?

659
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,200
It's not I want to leave you alone.

660
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,510
You...

661
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,030
I see...

662
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,550
You're on my side no matter what.

663
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,240
Right?

664
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:55,830
I know.

665
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,440
Don't worry.

666
00:31:59,510 --> 00:31:59,920
Dad.

667
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,830
If you feel bad there,

668
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,440
I'll get you home right away.

669
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,310
Mr. Hu.

670
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,680
I'll also help.

671
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,510
Mr. Zhao?

672
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,640
We have a vacant room

673
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,830
in this apartment, right?

674
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,920
Storage, you say.

675
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,070
Can I use it too?

676
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,270
I'll pay extra 200.

677
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,070
No problem.

678
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,960
I'll handle the stuff inside.

679
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,160
It's locked.

680
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,590
OK.

681
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,550
I'll come to you for keys.

682
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,240
OK?

683
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,750
Sure...

684
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,510
OK...

685
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,350
Thanks...

686
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,070
Thanks.

687
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:34,920

Didn't I tell you to wait?

709
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,710
You've got all here?

710
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,710
I mailed some to Ning's

711
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,920
and sold some in flea market.

712
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,840
I told you.

713
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,480
Don't mind me.

714
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,550
Just text me the address.

715
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,710
I'm your leader now.

716
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,840
I want to know how it feels

717
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,480
to care for a subordinate.

718
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,280
Do sound like a leader, Director Xue?

719
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,840
Let me.

720
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,030
I'm a man.

721
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,960
I have more strength.

722
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,360
Can I boss my leader around?

723
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,190
A man at your age is still growing.

724
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,960
Don't hurt yourself.

725
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,590
Manli.

726
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,920
Still growing?

727
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,710
Can I be taller?

728
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,230
In your dreams.

729
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,510
Where's the dorm?

730
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,710
You'll know.

731
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:11,840
Mysterious.

732
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,230
Get in.

733
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,030
Careful.

734
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,440
It's OK.

735
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,320
Here.

736
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,150
Come on.

737
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,150
Look.

738
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,070
Nice?

739
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,840
Someone lives here.

740
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,230
It's a dorm.

741
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,710
They just moved out I guess.

742
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,070
It's smelly.

743
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,000
Open the windows.

744
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,230
Guess they didn't have good hygiene.

745
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,590
Two rooms.

746
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,070
Dingding lives here.

747
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,070
I'll take this.

748
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,400
Dingding lives here too?

749
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Of course.

750
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,360
I wanted to rent a one-room apartment.

751
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,320
A bunk bed.

752
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,400
It'll be hard, I know.

753
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,280
I brought him to visit my dad.

754
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,230
I could see

755
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,440
he wanted to live with me.

756
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,030
I told him.

757
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,510
I'd get him after this.

758
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,670
I need a bunk bed here.

759
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,880
What about this bed here?

760
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:49,880
What did you say?

761
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,280
I said...

762
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,030
What?

763
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,760
Isn't it

764
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:58,960
smelly?

765
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,150
I'll open the windows.

766
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,920
Why is Baodan here?

767
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,190
Hold on.

768
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,800
You rented this house.

769
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,840
Yes.

770
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Why lie?

771
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,760
I was afraid you'd turn me down.

772
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,190
Of course I would.

773
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,230
It doesn't matter.

774
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,230
You said

775
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,400
in old days,

776
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,360
you could be my mom.

777
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,400
But it's present days now.

778
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,670
What's the difference?

779
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,480
No need to panic if you're innocent.

780
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,150
You make it sound easy.

781
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,190
So do you have

782
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,440
a thing for me now?

783
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:50,920
Yes.

784
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,800
I fancy you, OK?

785
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,960
A lot.

786
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,670
I might eat you

787
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,840
up someday.

788
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,550
Oh, you speak

789
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,190
what's on your mind.

790
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,230
Only listen to nice words.

791
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,230
Don't worry.

792
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,400
You're the last man

793
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,280
I want in this world.

794
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,760
Hey, I'm helping you.

795
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,230
Don't be so harsh.

796
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,510
OK, I'm sorry.

797
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,030
You know me.

798
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,590
I don't like pity.

799
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,670
It's not pity.

800
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,880
Never.

801
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
There's two rooms.

802
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,360
It'll be a waste on my own.

803
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,440
I wanted a roommate.

804
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,550
But then,

805
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,670
I was like,

806
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,800
"Why don't I

807
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,150
come to you?"

808
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,190
Win-win.

809
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,480
Look.

810
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,440
One-room house would

811
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,000
cost 4,000.

812
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,880
We can split the bills here.

813
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,800
2,500 each.

814
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,400
Cheap.

815
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,480
Dingding can live here too.

816
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,480
When you get busy,

817
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,110
I can look after him,

818
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,070
and tutor him.

819
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:58,920
Win-...

820
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,360
triple-win.

821
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,960
One two three, yes.

822
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,670
We've lived together before.

823
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,400
Go get Dingding.

824
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,710
We're together again.

825
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,190
How nice.

826
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,840
Boss, you should know

827
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,070
the poor fears being looked down upon.

828
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,760
I never look down upon you.

829
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,880
In that case,

830
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,070
it'll be rude to decline.

831
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:49,710
Right?

832
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,440
OK.

833
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,760
Send me the rental agreement.

834
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,280
OK.

835
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,550
I won't take your advantage.

836
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,190
Don't decline.

837
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,440
OK, I won't.

838
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,440
I take the smaller one.

839
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,480
You have the main.

840
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,320
No.

841
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,800
I have the smaller one.

842
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,760
The bunk bed.

843
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,670
You can't put it in here.

844
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,800
Where will Dingding sleep?

845
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,880
I want the smaller one.

846
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,190
Good for sleep.

847
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:17,320
You rented here.

848
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,880
I take the main room?

849
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,190
Let's keep it that way, OK?

850
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,800
You're the boss.

851
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,760
You have to listen.

852
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,480
OK.

853
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,110
I'll pay more of the rent, OK?

854
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,480
OK, whatever you say.

855
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,710
Thank you.

856
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
It's

857
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:44,880
settled then.

858
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,110
