[Episode 26]

41
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,070
Look.

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,350
The client has verified the writing.

43
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,000
You signed the Risk Disclosure.

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,040
You did it for him.

45
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,870
It's severely against the rules.

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,400
The client instructed me to do so.

47
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,840
And he said.

48
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,120
he won't come to me even if he loses.

49
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,200
Hu.

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
You were wrong.

51
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,790
His business was booming

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,680
so he promised that.

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,870
We checked.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Ma's business is declining.

55
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,560
So he wants this money

56
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,840
to save his company.

57
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,680
Sure.

58
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,470
Even if I was wrong,

59
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,030
4 million,

60
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,910
I have to pay it all?

61
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,680
Yes.

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,910
In a month.

63
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,430
You're crazy.

64
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,190
I didn't lose the money.

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,430
Calm down.

66
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,960
Mr. Zhao.

67
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,120
Since you asked me to mediate,

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,310
there must be room

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,120
for a talk.

70
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,080
We think

71
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,590
you can't put all the blame

72
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,150
on the salesperson.

73
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,910
Go check if there's anything wrong

74
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,190
with the company rules too.

75
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,470
We wanted a mediation

76
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,120
because we want damages ASAP.

77
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,120
It doesn't mean conceding.

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,310
You're driving me to death.

79
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,560
Calm down.

80
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,630
I can't.

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,240
Let me be clear.

82
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,190
I don't have money. I won't pay.

83
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,560
Hu Manli.

84
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,190
If you keep this up,

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,910
I'll take it to court.

86
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,000
Go ahead.

87
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,840
No money.

88
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,360
We can both be getting nowhere.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,680
I'm telling you.

90
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,280
I don't provoke troubles,

91
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,030
but never flinch when trouble comes.

92
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,840
Don't bluff.

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,280
Just you wait.

95
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,910
Here's the thing.

96
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,120
It's Monday.

97
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,800
Students need to wear the red uniforms.

98
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,840
Daer got them wrong.

99
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,280
Points were taken from his class.

100
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,710
And English teacher said

101
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,430
he didn't finish homework.

102
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,400
It's soon the mid-term exams.

103
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,470
He's doing very bad.

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,590
He must get himself together.

105
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,040
Sorry.

106
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,920
I've heard all of your messages.

107
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,630
I'll talk to him.

108
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,950
And tell him that

109
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
I'll be late tonight.

110
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,480
He should go home

111
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,800
by himself, OK?

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,070
Thank you.

113
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:22,950
Come in.

114
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,160
Your teacher came to me.

115
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,310
Monday.

116
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,430
Wrong uniforms?

117
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,920
How old are you?

118
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,190
13.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,750
Take care of your matters.

120
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,120
I have to watch over

121
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,600
your uniforms?

122
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,270
Isn't it exhausting?

123
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,240
Don't nag me.

124
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,040
OK, I'll leave.

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
What happened?

126
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:57,920
Why so upset?

127
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,600
OK.

128
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,800
Why didn't you hand in English work?

129
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,160
You just progressed.

130
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,480
And then

131
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,310
you're feeling proud?

132
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
Why shake your head?

133
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,270
Don't get angry.

134
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,120
I'll work harder.

135
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
You always say this.

136
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,950
But there's always next time.

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,000
Sorry.

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,830
Yes.

141
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,310
I have responsibility.

142
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,870
I've been handling Grandpa's matter.

143
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,040
I didn't look after you.

144
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,600
Mom.

145
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,920
I'll be careful at school.

146
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,270
I won't make you worry.

147
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,270
I won't, soon.

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,920
You're about to be a teenager.

149
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,950
When you have a girlfriend,

150
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,830
you might ignore me.

151
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,830
I won't matter to you.

152
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Here you go again.

153
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,270
I don't want a girlfriend.

154
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,430
Having you at home alone is a hassle.

155
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,480
Get the door.

156
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,630
Hi, your takeaway.

157
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,630
Enjoy.

158
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,070
Thanks.

159
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,270
Mom.

160
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,950
When did you order Pizza Hut?

161
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm starving.

162
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,510
If I ordered now,

163
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,950
you'd be starved.

164
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,600
Wash your hands.

165
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,310
Go.

166
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,830
A little dirt never killed.

167
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,430
Your hair's longer.

168
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,360
Have a haircut some time.

169
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,750
After this,

170
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,240
catch up on your homework.

171
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,310
You have to print for me.

172
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,600
Print what?

173
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,390
English papers of weekend.

174
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,240
It's in the parents' chat group.

175
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,480
You didn't finish

176
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,070
because I didn't print?

177
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,070
You should've told me.

178
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,750
You were caught up at the hospital.

179
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,270
I didn't want to worry you.

180
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,310
After this,

181
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,840
teach me how to print.

182
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,910
I'll do it myself.

183
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,790
Never mind.

184
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,360
Our printer is full of bugs.

185
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
In another case like that,

186
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,720
remind me, OK?

187
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,670
It's fine.

188
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,150
I can deal with you,

189
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,440
I can deal with a printer easily.

190
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,480
I don't want to burden you.

191
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,670
I'll take care of things like this.

192
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,960
You focus on Grandpa.

193
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,750
Didn't we agree?

194
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,240
We support this family together.

195
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,030
You're young.

196
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,870
Not many you can support.

197
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,080
Then you step in.

198
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,720
But I'll deal with school matters.

199
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,360
OK?

200
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,440
Is food enough?

201
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,360
Yes.

202
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,280
[I'll be late tonight...]

203
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,150
Mr. Xue.

204
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,670
- Need help?
- Congrats.

205
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,510
Let me do it.

206
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,390
No, thank you.

207
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,080
Thanks...

208
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,870
Congrats.

209
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,790
Congrats...

210
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,320
Got no work to do?

211
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,080
Get to work.

212
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,360
Director Xue.

213
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,320
Congrats on your promotion.

214
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,510
Thanks.

215
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,960
We'd like to throw

216
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,510
a party

217
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,270
for your big event.

218
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,670
Six o'clock.

219
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,670
Book a place.

220
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,000
And text Director Xue the details.

221
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,550
OK.

222
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,870
You don't have to.

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,080
I used to your manager.

224
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,320
I have things to do.

225
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,080
Tomorrow.

226
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,120
I'll be busy too.

227
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,750
Later.

228
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,320
What's with this?

229
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,440
You still have a grudge against me?

230
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,840
Feeling guilty?

231
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,510
Director Xue.

232
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,960
I was a small picture thinker.

233
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,480
I made a mistake.

234
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,960
Thinking I was a loser.

235
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:24,750
Right?

236
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
You want the truth?

237
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,670
I used to think you're naive,

238
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,670
picking up orders tailing Manli.

239
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,000
Didn't expect,

240
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,960
of us three,

241
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,440
you're the real mugger crocodile.

242
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,270
Mr. Xue.

243
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,360
Amazing.

244
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Mugger crocodile.

245
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,750
Doesn't sound like a nice word.

246
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,080
Then play the pig to eat the tiger?

247
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,320
Who's the tiger?

248
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,390
Manli.

249
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,870
You get onto 18th floor.

250
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,600
while Manli got sued and broke.

251
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,750
That's when you dump her.

252
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,270
What do you mean?

253
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,630
Still playing dumb?

254
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,000
Take a curtain call, Mr. Xue.

255
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,440
Here we are.

256
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,630
You must be hungry.

257
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,480
I'm not.

258
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,550
I've prepared your room.

259
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:39,670
Here.

260
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,750
Your back OK?

261
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,480
Head.

262
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,600
OK.

263
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,240
OK.

264
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
Watch TV?

265
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
Starts so slow.

266
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,600
Sports?

267
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,550
Watch poker?

268
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,320
OK?

269
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,510
Dad.

270
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,790
Take this.

271
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,200
Shake it

272
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,510
when you need me.

273
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,150
I can hear you out there.

274
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,600
I leave the door open.

275
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,670
Shake it to find me.

276
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,150
Put it here.

277
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,550
Have water?

278
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:23,870
OK.

279
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,390
Come on.

280
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,550
Any water?

281
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,320
I'll wipe you.

282
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,270
I'll be off.

283
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,270
Call me if you need.

284
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,720
Package at the door.

285
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,360
Why are you here?

286
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,120
You forgot something?

287
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,030
How long

288
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,550
will you hide it from me?

289
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,480
What?

290
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,440
My dad's calling me.

291
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,480
He's discharged today.

292
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,320
Coming.

293
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,030
Dad.

294
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,270
What do you want?

295
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,240
Mr. Hu, how's your recovery?

296
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,360
He came to visit

297
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,600
you especially.

298
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,240
Rest well.

299
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,790
Tell me if you need anything.

300
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,670
I know...

301
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,630
He wants me to get you water.

302
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,440
Mind your own business.

303
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,550
OK?

304
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,390
Call me.

305
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,200
I'm just out there.

306
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,030
Manli.

307
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,840
You know there's a

308
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,750
lawsuit coming so you

309
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,550
parted ways with me?

310
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,910
No way.

311
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,150
I was just bored of you.

312
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,200
Don't be dramatic.

313
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,080
Can't you tell me the truth?

314
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,600
Don't yell.

315
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,440
My dad could

316
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,480
hear you.

317
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,200
Why would you hide it

318
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,080
from me?

319
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,600
I studied law.

320
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,120
I can't defend you

321
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,200
but I have classmates,

322
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,000
mentors.

323
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,390
So many ways.

324
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,200
I've consulted.

325
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,790
I won't win.

326
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,750
I signed it myself.

327
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,840
Your career is taking off.

328
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,200
Don't get involved.

329
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,750
I only know this.

330
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,000
You helped me,

331
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,270
and I'll help you.

332
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,960
Simple.

333
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,150
You're just simple-minded.

334
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,630
How could you achieve something?

335
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,150
I don't want that.

336
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,480
I want to help.

337
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,790
I don't need you.

338
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,550
Then who? Him?

339
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,120
Who?

340
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,080
I came to Dare the other day,

341
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,440
and saw Zhiyuan going upstairs.

342
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,750
Think straight, Manli.

343
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,150
He has a wife.

344
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,440
He came

345
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,550
because I needed him to

346
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,630
fix the trouble

347
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,080
his family brought upon me.

348
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,200
Then what about the lawsuit?

349
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,270
What's the plan?

350
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,390
Not your business.

351
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,120
We have to share weal and woe.

352
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,270
It's my business too.

353
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,550
Come on, damages of millions.

354
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,790
You'll pay?

355
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,440
I don't have the money,

356
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,510
but I can borrow.

357
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,510
Borrow?

358
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,270
Like you did to get a bubble tea?

359
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,550
This is millions.

360
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,680
Listen to that.

361
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,110
I don't think you ever borrowed money.

362
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,550
At least I could try

363
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,550
do something.

364
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,110
Xiaozhou.

365
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,880
you might think you have a status now.

366
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,640
People listen to you.

367
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,110
You're wrong.

368
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,200
Once you borrow from someone,

369
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,480
you guys turn into enemies.

370
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,920
Thanks for your kindness.

371
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,440
Leave me alone, OK?

372
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,440
Dad, coming.

373
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,070
Yes.

374
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,590
I want to know when I'll get the 2nd

375
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,440
commission of Mr. Ai's plan?

376
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,960
After New Year?

377
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,550
No, I'm just asking.

378
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,270
Thanks.

379
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,790
Mr. Fang.

380
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,920
It's been ages.

381
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,590
This is Xiaozhou.

382
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,830
Mr. Fang.

383
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,310
Thanks for coming.

384
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,750
My pleasure.

385
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,750
Your dad must be proud

386
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,920
seeing you make a name for yourself.

387
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,750
You flattered me.

388
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
I'll go straight to the point.

389
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
I want to know

390
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,110
how the company's doing.

391
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,510
Well, you've gone to

392
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,750
the wrong guy.

393
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,550
To be frankly,

394
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,160
that woman fired me

395
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,720
a year ago.

396
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,160
Fired.

397
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,200
I know.

398
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,790
That's why I came to you.

399
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,000
How so?

400
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Before his death,

401
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,160
Dad would

402
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,790
give Mom money every month.

403
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,240
Since my parents' accidents,

404
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,550
she hadn't transferred the money again.

405
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,550
I sent my lawyer to her.

406
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,030
She said no money in the firm's account.

407
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,590
I could verify if I wanted.

408
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,110
Of course she said that.

409
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,680
So what's truth

410
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,480
about the company?

411
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,030
No money in the firm.

412
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,240
But she has it.

413
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,680
All these years,

414
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,160
she made excuses to

415
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,750
transfer money to her person accounts.

416
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,270
A lot.

417
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,440
I couldn't stand it

418
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,550
so I raised my doubts.

419
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,400
Then,

420
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,960
she kicked me out

421
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,070
with another excuse.

422
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,550
Hello?

423
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,160
Hello?

424
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,830
Hi.

425
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,830
- Go on.
- Hello?

426
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,000
Hello?

427
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,550
Is that Ms. Hu Manli?

428
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,510
Yes.

429
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:04,960
Hello.

430
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,030
This is Xinxing Bank credit department.

431
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,680
Please pay up your monthly bill ASAP.

432
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,200
Or your credit reporting...

433
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,110
Are you at Golden Triangle?

434
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,160
You speak standard Mandarin.

435
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,310
Ms. Hu.

436
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,000
Ms. Hu.

437
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,110
This is Xinxing Bank credit department.

438
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,350
I'm not a scammer.

439
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,070
OK, I am.

440
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,440
How much do you make?

441
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,350
I want to apply.

442
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,000
Ms. Hu.

443
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,880
Your auto deduction failed.

444
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,830
You can check on our app

445
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,550
to verify.

446
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,400
Nonsense.

447
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,310
I set deduction on auto mode.

448
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,720
Shoot.

449
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:56,960
She was right.

450
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,720
What's this?

451
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,340
[Failed]

452
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,160
Frozen?

453
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,960
Who gave the rights?

454
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,480
Why did you do that?

455
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,920
Sorry.

456
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,440
We had official letter from the court

457
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,640
for pre-action freezing.

458
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,920
You can contact the court for details.

459
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,880
Court?

460
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,440
Ms. Hu?

461
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,030
How can I help you with?

462
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,830
In three months,

463
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,550
according to the agreement signed by

464
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,830
Mr. Xue and the institution.

465
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,070
We'll pay the first batch of loan.

466
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,200
We're in need of

467
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,880
5 million.

468
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,240
What is it?

469
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,440
Xiaozhou is here.

470
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,790
Invite him in.

471
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,160
You should go now.

472
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,680
OK.

473
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,720
Xiaozhou.

474
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,510
Sit.

475
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,680
Anything to drink?

476
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,680
No.

477
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,440
I'll speak

478
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,880
my mind.

479
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,790
My dad died without a will.

480
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,160
According to law,

481
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,070
I have half of the shares.

482
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,640
Xiaozhou.

483
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,880
I never denied that.

484
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,550
You're welcome at our company.

485
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,480
But

486
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,680
Zhig's condition.

487
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,160
You know about that.

488
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,240
3 million

489
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,590
and you can have all my shares.

490
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,510
What happens to Zhig later

491
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,880
has nothing

492
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,200
to do with me.

493
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,440
Xiaozhou.

494
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,440
What's wrong?

495
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,200
If you need,

496
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,440
I can help.

497
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,270
None of your business.

498
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,030
Just tell me yes or no.

499
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,830
Of course I want the shares.

500
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,510
But I don't have money.

501
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,030
Your personal accounts?

502
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,920
All my money is in the firm.

503
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,030
I can check if it's really in the firm.

504
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:03,880
OK.

505
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,680
Go on.

506
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,000
Anytime.

507
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,070
OK.

508
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,000
You said

509
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,350
Zhig is in a bad state,

510
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,640
really really

511
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,790
bad.

512
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,000
I can't force anything out of you.

513
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,070
You ever thought

514
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,680
if the parents

515
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
who bought your packages

516
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,750
know about Zhig's situation?

517
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,880
And if they think

518
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,680
you could run away with money any time?

519
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,720
What would they say

520
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,720
and do?

521
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,440
What would be next?

522
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,070
What do you want?

523
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,000
You threaten me.

524
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,680
No, I just might

525
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,440
run my mouth.

526
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,720
You'd ruin Zhig.

527
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,310
3 million.

528
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,160
Zhig is yours.

529
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,310
OK.

530
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,310
I need time.

531
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,000
3 days.

532
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,030
3 days?

533
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,590
How the hell

534
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,550
could I get that money then?

535
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,440
I'm not informing,

536
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,550
not discussing.

537
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,110
Xiaozhou.

538
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,200
You've pushed me this hard.

539
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,550
One month.

540
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,400
That's the best I can do.

541
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,070
At least a month.

542
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,160
A month it is.

543
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,880
Mr. Zhao.

544
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,640
We've known each other so long.

545
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,480
You know what I'm like.

546
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,590
Right?

547
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,200
Give me time.

548
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,400
I need time to borrow anyway.

549
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,830
Right?

550
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,750
Manli.

551
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,920
Think you could just ignore my calls

552
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,440
and texts?

553
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,030
Sorry, I was wrong.

554
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,880
Give me some time.

555
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,680
No more delaying.

556
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,350
In 10 days,

557
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,640
transfer to the designated account.

558
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,310
Hello?

559
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,000
I've got the money.

560
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,750
3 million, problem solved.

561
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,920
Where did you get it?

562
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,350
I'll make it short.

563
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,480
I sold my shares

564
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,830
to Lisu.

565
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,960
She said she didn't have any.

566
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,480
The firm didn't have any,

567
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,550
for Lisu transferred some of the assets

568
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,160
to her own accounts.

569
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:16,830
All in all,

570
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,680
3 million in a month.

571
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,880
She promised.

572
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,200
A month.

573
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,310
A month.

574
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,070
You sure?

575
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,350
What?

576
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,750
Too long?

577
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,030
No.

578
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:34,790
What is it?

579
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,440
A month.

580
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,720
I'll wait for your news.

581
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,350
Manli.

582
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,880
You're keeping other things form me?

583

No.

584

Tell me the truth.

585
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,880
I'm really OK.

586
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,000
You've got money now.

587
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,070
Problem solved.

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,750
In fact,

589
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,920
it's not that serious.

590
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,310
The firm sued me

591
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,160
just to put on a show

592
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,680
for the headquarters.

593
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,160
20 years I worked for them.

594
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,310
They have to give me credit.

595
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,880
They won't drive me to a dead end.

596
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,920
Now I've got money.

597
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,790
It's even better.

598
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,070
I have people spying on the firm.

599
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,680
Don't worry.

600
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:46,880
Really?

601
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:47,830

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,230
I go to Blue Ocean.

777
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,030
Visitor?

778
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,670
I've been working here. I want Mr. Jin.

779
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,670
Let them fetch you.

780
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,150
You can't go in without a badge.

781
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:47,960
Your badge.

782
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,150
OK. Yours.

783
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,880
Manli.

784
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,550
Chunlu.

785
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,510
Mister.

786
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,190
Badge.

787
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,710
Mister.

788
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,590
She's with me.

789
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,670
OK, get in.

790
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,510
Let's go.

791
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,320
- Thanks.
- OK.

792
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,190
Coming.

793
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,760
Grandpa.

794
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,360
Mom's out.

795
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,630
Don't worry.

796
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,000
What else?

797
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,070
This?

798
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,070
This?

799
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:29,880
This.

800
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,190
How to use?

801
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,440
Hold a sec.

802
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,630
I'll google it.

803
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,880
Very soon.

804
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,150
Hello?

805
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,400
- Manl...
- Xiaozhou.

806
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,070
Where's Manli?

807
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,800
You want her?

808
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,590
She's out for business.

809
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:03,920
OK.

810
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,400
Hold on.

811
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,670
What is it?

812
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,030
Um.

813
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,760
Can you do me a favor?

814
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,360
Mr. Jin.

815
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,230
Thanks.

816
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,230
Mr. Jin.

817
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,320
You want me to save you again?

818
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,480
Since you let me in,

819
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,800
I know

820
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,920
you still see me as a friend.

821
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,880
I didn't commit it.

822
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,190
but I

823
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,590
take the blame.

824
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,110
Didn't commit,

825
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,000
but took the blame.

826
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,000
Come on.

827
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,920
Sit.

828
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,280
What's your plan?

829
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,320
If I were unattached,

830
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,320
I wouldn't see a problem.

831
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,670
But I have a family.

832
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,710
Dad had a cerebral hemorrhage.

833
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,630
He's still lying on bed.

834
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,800
My son's young.

835
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,630
I need to look after him.

836
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,960
Now the firm

837
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,840
froze my account,

838
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,920
and wanted to seize my house.

839
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,920
It's driving me to death.

840
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:32,760
Mr. Jin.

841
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,230
Please tell the firm

842
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,670
to give me more time.

843
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,880
I'll definitely pay.

844
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,550
You still think you're wronged?

845
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,360
You worked here for 20 years.

846
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,510
With the slightest possibility,

847
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,760
I wouldn't have punished you hard.

848
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,880
Even the chairman agrees to

849
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,840
make an example

850
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,030
of you.

851
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,030
I can't save you.

852
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,670
Mr. Jin.

853
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,590
The chairman always listens to you.

854
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,000
You nominated me for Insurance Star.

855
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,590
The chairman disagreed at first.

856
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,400
But you defended me.

857
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,150
Without Insurance Star,

858
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,760
he wouldn't be so mad.

859
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,510
Let me tell you.

860
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,360
During the last meeting,

861
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,920
I put in good word for you.

862
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
The Customer Service

863
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,110
showed complaints against you.

864
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,550
The Training Dept.

865
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,110
showed people signing for you

866
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,550
during training sessions.

867
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,800
And the Claims, Underwriting.

868
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,000
No one was on your side.

869
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,280
The chairman flared up,

870
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,190
questioning me

871
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,070
why I recommended a person like you.

872
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,630
Any personal gains?

873
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,920
I'm sorry.

874
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,670
I didn't know.

875
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,230
Once you succeed,

876
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,550
millions wait for your mistakes.

877
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,070
I've told you this.

878
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,070
Did you listen?

879
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,360
You were ahead of yourself.

880
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,400
You always said it doesn't matter.

881
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,030
You were wrong.

882
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,760
All these showed how low

883
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,480
you could stoop.

884
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,320
Now you're brought down,

885
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,710
who will support you?

886
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:15,920
Do as stipulated by law.

887
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,510
This is final

888
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,230
decision of board of directors.

889
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,070
How could this be?

890
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,030
Exactly.

891
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,440
How could this be?

892
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,230
Think about it.

893
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,280
The firm takes 10% your responsibility.

894
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,280
This is the last thing I can do for you.

895
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,590
The rest

896
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,070
depends on yourself.
