I'm here to congratulate.

77
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,470
It's a third marriage.

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,630
But we can't skip the routines.

79
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,960
Look.

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,080

You won't have nightmares because of

85
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,680

Vintage.

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,590
It's costly.

89
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,800
But you're worth it.

90
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,560
Unload.

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,190
OK.

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,870
I don't need them.

93
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,150
Take them away.

94
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,120
You bought my unwanted bags,

95
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
took the man I ditched.

96
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,840
You're nice.

97
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,240
I should repay you.

98
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,080
Right?

99
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Ms. Qiu marries the third time.

100
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,680
Get some of her lucky vibe.

101
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,800
Grab the candy.

102
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,360
Come on.

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,630
Don't stand on ceremony.

104

Hu Manli.

Are you done?

106
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,520
Not even close.

107
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,030
I made a red envelope

108
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,280
with the rest 5,000.

109
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
Go on, take it.

00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,750
Third, third is a good one.

111
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,680
Have more kids.

112
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,120
Come.

113
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,590
Embarrassed?

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,430
Ask your husband to take them.

115
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,160
Prof. Ding, come out for gifts.

116
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,630
Come on.

117
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,830
- Third marriage…
- I take them!

118
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,630
I take…

119
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,510
You win this time.

120
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,560
Lisu.

121
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,920
Live happily after.

122
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,630
Go back.

123
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,630
Nothing to watch.

124
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,720
You're so late.

125
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,870
She's disturbing us.

126
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,510
Leave.

127
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,120
Get rid of her.

128
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,560
We're here to congratulate.

129
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,270
Take gifts.

130
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,240
We'll leave soon.

131
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,160
Go back.

132
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,720
Go.

133
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,120
No worries.

134
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,160
We'll leave soon.

135
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,240
Go home.

136
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,190
Qiu Lisu.

137
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,720
You should see her face.

138
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,600
I should've taken a pic.

139
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,360
You're really something.

140
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,560
That's insulting.

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,950
A spittoon?

142
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,600
That'll disgust her for sure.

143
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,830
She deserves it.

144
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,750
She pissed me off first.

145
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,160
She ruined my yard sale.

146
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
There's consequences.

147
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,040
You don't let anyone off the hook.

148
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,950
You're going to learn a lesson.

149
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,630
It's in my genes.

150
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,750
My mom had cancer when I was 10.

151
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,920
She was dying.

152
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
She held my hand and said,

153
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,630
"Life is about

154
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,430
putting on a show.

155
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,600
Keep up appearances.

156
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,120
Or you'll get laughed at."

157
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,310
I remember it until now.

158
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,630
What now?

159
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,070
You sent your gifts

160
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,600
and avenged yourself.

161
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,310
What's next?

162
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,190
I have money.

163
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,720
Mom, I like your car.

164
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,240
Really?

165
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,560
Congrats, Ms. Hu.

166
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,430
Thanks.

167
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Hold it.

168
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:21,870
OK.

169
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,480
We have a car!

170
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,720
How about a photo?

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,040
Yes. One sec.

172
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,120
How do I look?

173
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,430
Perfect.

174
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,040
Come on.

175
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,480
Dingding.

176
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,750
Here.

177
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,560
Look at the camera.

178
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,680
Excellent.

179
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,190
Ready, cheese.

180
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,390
Nice car.

181
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,510
Original paint.

182
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,120
Get a cab for us.

183
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,680
No cheese.

184
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,310
Sure.

185
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,920
Come on.

186
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,720
Car!

187
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
It's generally fine.

188
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,750
The ornaments are tacky.

189
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,720
As long as the car is fine.

190
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,800
You can

191
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,160
throw it away.

192
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,430
What are you doing?

193
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,830
Don't touch anything in the car.

194
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,040
You don't sell?

195
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,720
Not to you.

196
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,070
I won't buy.

197
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,920
Away from my car.

198
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,070
Funny.

199
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,480
Why did you put it here then?

200
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,600
Madam.

201
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,800
I tried but

202
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,240
this is the best

203
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,430
we can offer.

204
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,190
It can't be higher.

205
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,070
You're kidding.

206
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,870
This is too low.

207
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,240
Here's the thing.

208
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,070
This is an old car.

209
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,120
Big mileage.

210
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,800
That's a fair price.

211
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,360
Everyone knows the prices

212
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,390
in flea market.

213
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,120
I needn't lie.

214
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,390
How about this?

215
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,950
You should go back

216
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,000
and take your time.

217
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,920
Come to if when you decide.

218
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,360
OK I'll sell.

219
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,750
Such hassle to drive around.

220
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,870
I'll draft a contract.

221
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,030
They look professional.

222
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,790
Ms. Duan.

223
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:49,790
Mr. Kang.

224
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,720
Wu Ya.

225
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,000
You're here.

226
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,750
Xiaozhou.

227
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,720
This is Xiaozhou.

228
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,320
Ms. Duan.

229
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,120
Kang.

230
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,870
This is Xiaozhou I mentioned.

231
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,720
He studied at my department.

232
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,150
Talented young man.

233
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,750
He's working in insurance.

234
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,750
Xue.

235
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Hello.

236
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,600
You are one of us now.

237
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,390
Welcome.

238
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,120
Hi.

239
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,960
How should

240
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,440
we play today?

241
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,720
Wu Ya says

242
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,790
Xue was at the tennis club.

243
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
A good player.

244
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,720
Kang, test it out.

245
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,000
How about a round?

246
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,080
Come on.

247
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,960
OK.

248
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,550
Here.

249
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,200
Get changed.

250
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:35,550
Go.

251
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:37,910
Hey.

252
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,720
Here.

253
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,720
Remember what I

254
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,440
told you.

255
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,840
Rest assured.

256
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,600
Kang's warming up.

257
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,390
Let's go.

258
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,150
Go!

259
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,440
You first.

260
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:07,750
OK.

261
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,240
Nice.

262
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:08,870
Nice.

263
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,270
Bravo.

264
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,150
Nice.

265
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,840
Xiaozhou

266
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,390
is being obvious.

267
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,840
Did you tell him anything?

268
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,000
No.

269
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,790
That's how he plays.

270
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,200
Mr. Kang is a tricky opponent.

271
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,120
You're doing bad.

272
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,270
Tennis club they say?

273
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:53,910
You

274
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,000
have to run.

275
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,270
Run.

276
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,960
OK, running.

277
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,000
That's it.

278
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,240
At court,

279
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,000
go in full swing.

280
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,670
Don't think I'm old for you.

281
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,910
I'll tell you.

282
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,030
How about this?

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,910
I give you two points.

284
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,150
And I'll still win.

285
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,320
Again.

286
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,080
Xiaozhou plays nice.

287
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,080
No.

288
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,910
He lacks stamina.

289
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,750
Shall we take a break?

290
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,150
He might faint.

291
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,630
Really?

292
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,670
He's doing just fine.

293
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,670
It's OK.

294
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,910
He's no child.

295
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,030
He'll stop if he feels uncomfortable.

296
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,720
Take a break.

297
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,390
A break.

298
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,360
Mr. Kang.

299
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,790
Are you OK?

300
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,240
Sure, it's fine.

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,440
Break time.

302
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,240
Mr. Kang.

303
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,270
You OK?

304
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,630
Yes.

305
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,390
Good, good.

306
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:19,790
Kang.

307
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,270
Have water.

308
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,630
You sweat too much

309
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,270
after exercise.

310
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,510
Drink this to refill your energy.

311
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,720
Young men.

312
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,750
They're better than me.

313
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,630
Mr. Kang, are your legs OK?

314
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,270
Sorry.

315
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,550
Young talent.

316
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,120
Formidable.

317
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,360
Take it easy next time.

318
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,150
I know.

319
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,510
Mr. Kang.

320
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,440
You're such a good player

321
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,840
for your age.

322
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,630
Oh you have water.

323
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,390
Mr. Kang.

324
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,200
Mr. Kang.

325
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,360
Let's take a break.

326
00:13:59,390 --> 00:13:59,960
Take a break.

327
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,630
OK.

328
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,440
Yes, you should.

329
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,000
Take a break.

330
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,080
Good for your health.

331
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,510
You guys go on.

332
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,200
Mr. Kang.

333
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,510
Duan.

334
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,720
They left.

335
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,720
Take your belongings.

336
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,120
Bye.

337
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,080
So.

338
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,960
We'll play?

339
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,600
Did I

340
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,670
do wrong?

341
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,910
I don't know what was with you.

342
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,390
Didn't I tell you?

343
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,080
Let him win.

344
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,910
Weren't you doing fine at first?

345
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,600
Why did you suddenly...?

346
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,030
Why?

347
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
I, I tried.

348
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,870
But he was pushing me.

349
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,750
Nagging all along.

350
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,080
I was pissed.

351
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,360
So Kang stopped.

352
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,080
Everyone's fetching water for him.

353
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,000
You?

354
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,510
Drink on your own?

355
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,360
I gave it to him after.

356
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,000
Xue Xiaozhou.

357
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,320
You have to talk back?

358
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,270
I wanted you to butter him up.

359
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,030
Now?

360
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,150
You upset him,

361
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,600
a lot.

362
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,960
No way.

363
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,910
He's a superior.

364
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,390
Could he be that petty?

365
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,720
He called me formidable.

366
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,240
Right?

367
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,630
Are you stupid?

368
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,030
He was being polite.

369
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,870
You couldn't see?

370
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,080
Would he fall out with you

371
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
in public?

372
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:32,750
I...

373
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,840
We used to eat together

374
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,120
after playing.

375
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,360
If he were pleased just now,

376
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,550
he would invite us.

377
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,870
But he probably wouldn't.

378
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,630
So be it.

379
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,750
And you said,

380
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,150
"He's a good player

381
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,600
for his age."

382
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,670
That's how you talk?

383
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,200
That hurts.

384
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,840
You embarrassed me.

385
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,720
I wanted to run away.

386
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,150
But I was complimenting him.

387
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,630
Don't mention seniors' age.

388
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,390
You don't know that?

389
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,390
I'm off.

390
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,510
Ya.

391
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,790
Ya.

392
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,320
Calm down.

393
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,360
I was wrong.

394
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,600
I was inexperienced.

395
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,750
I apologize.

396
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,270
OK, I'll apologize to Mr. Kang.

397
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,840
Don't.

398
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,200
If you do that,

399
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,240
it'll only make him look petty.

400
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,750
How could you do that?

401
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,000
And if you said something wrong,

402
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,390
good heavens...

403
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,360
So.

404
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,440
What do you want?

405
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,270
I'll listen to you.

406
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,960
Play with Kang next week.

407
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,480
Lose, completely.

408
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,310
And don't make him see it.

409
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,400
Make it natural.

410
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,480
OK?

411
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,310
This is so fake.

412
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,680
Xiaozhou.

413
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,720
Relationship needs

414
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,750
maintenance.

415
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,350
You sell insurance.

416
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,880
If you don't butter people up,

417
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,350
why do they place orders?

418
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,750
Don't want such dishonest practice.

419
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,880
This is socializing.

420
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,830
Dishonest? Come on.

421
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,200
I know you care about me.

422
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,070
I want to try in my own way.

423
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,590
Give me time, OK?

424
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:50,830
Ya.

425
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,310
There there.

426
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,000
Hungry?

427
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,920
I'll order takeaway.

428
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,590
No.

429
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,420
[Mr. Zheng, it's been long.]

430
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
[Got any free time?]

431
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,060
[See you tomorrow.]

432
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,510
What?

433
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,720
Someone paid the bills for me?

434
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,550
Yes.

435
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,640
Days ago,

436
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,830
Doc Wu Ya transferred 20,000.

437
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,440
Got it.

438
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,110
Ai Zhonghua.

439
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,680
Ai Linjiang.

440
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,720
Linjiang, it's been long.

441
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,240
A small gift.

442
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,440
Do take it.

443
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,240
Manli.

444
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:33,920
Thanks.

445
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,200
Sit.

446
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,830
Your mom passed away so suddenly.

447
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,720
I called your dad.

448
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,200
He's in health care center, right?

449
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,070
Yes.

450
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,790
My parents have supported each other.

451
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,070
Now Mom's gone.

452
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,880
My dad must feel bad.

453
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,640
He does.

454
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,270
The center is nice.

455
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,960
He should get some rest there.

456
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,400
That's good.

457
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,030
I don't think

458
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,270
you should live long.

459
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,400
You must live happily.

460
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,720
Ke Ming was lucky

461
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,240
to have a good husband

462
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,000
and a talented son like you.

463
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,830
No regrets.

464
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,160
I would kill for such luck

465
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,720
like hers.

466
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,640
Thank you,

467
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,720
Manli,

468
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,000
for your kindness.

469
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,200
I don't drink.

470
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,070
Didn't you know?

471
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,790
It's not liquor.

472
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,920
Medicine.

473
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,350
Can't get it anywhere else.

474
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,240
From one of my connections.

475
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,640
Mr. Ai.

476
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,000
There's a small change

477
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,790
about my work.

478
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,440
Thought you should know.

479
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,110
Changed your job?

480
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,720
Where to?

481
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,590
Secret.

482
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,790
When I settle down,

483
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,310
I'll tell you ASAP.

484
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:00,960
OK.

485
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,960
Keep in touch.

486
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,200
I sure will.

487
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,790
We've known each other so long.

488
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,350
I would come to you if anything's up.

489
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,350
When I first met you,

490
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,790
you were just 20.

491
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,790
Back then...

492
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,350
Hey, you, stop.

493
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,200
Where are you going?

494
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,110
I made an appointment.

495
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,350
You can't go in there.

496
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,880
I called.

497
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,270
Sir, please leave.

498
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,270
You can't go in.

499
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:24,830
Who are you?

500
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,720
I made an appointment.

501
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,110
Sorry.

502
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,550
Be right back.

503
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,480
It's OK.

504
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,270
Leave.

505
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,030
Five minutes.

506
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,720
No.

507
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
My boss isn't available.

508
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,030
We'll call the police.

509
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,270
Please leave.

510
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,000
Sorry.

511
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,640
What's wrong?

512
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,790
I'm um...

513
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,640
Mr. Ai.

514
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,590
He wanted to go up.

515
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,200
He slipped in when we were away.

516
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,440
From some insurance firm.

517
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,270
He just won't go.

518
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,830
Mr. Ai, hello.

519
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,400
I am

520
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,310
a broker from TSI.

521
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,400
Get off me.

522
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,680
It's OK.

523
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,440
We TSI

524
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,000
have various

525
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,510
products.

526
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,310
Come to me

527
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,270
if there's need.

528
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,030
We are different

529
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,920
from others.

530
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,640
We...

531
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,830
Hold it there.

532
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,110
Yes.

533
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,790
TSI?

534
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,350
You know it?

535
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,550
Never heard of it.

536
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,350
That's the problem.

537
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,640
Tough Shields...

538
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,030
I've worked in this business

539
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,440
for nearly 20 years.

540
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,400
Never heard of it.

541
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,640
What Shields?

542
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,510
You mean...

543
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,350
Are you working with

544
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,200
an artist lately?

545
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,640
Spy!

546
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,960
I'm not!

547
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,240
Not a spy.

548
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,920
I know her.

549
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,640
She's Hu Manli.

550
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
We were colleagues.

551
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,030
Smart.

552
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,030
I left my info

553
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,240
at front desk,

554
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,070
everything.

555
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,790
Mr. Ai.

556
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,960
Does everyone

557
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,200
remember others'

558
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,350
personal info?

559
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:53,830
No...

560
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,440
Something's off.

561
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,790
I'm not...

562
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,510
You done?

563
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,070
Security.

564
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,270
- TSI…
- Security!

565
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,880
Google it!

566
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,000
It's real.

567
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,440
I'm a...

568
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,960
Hu Manli, how could you?

569
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,400
Move.

570
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,640
Despicable.

571
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,550
I'm not a bad guy.

572
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,640
I can walk on my own.

573
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,310
I've checked.

574
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,440
TSI exists.

575
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,680
He's really

576
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,400
a broker.

577
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,790
My bad.

578
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,110
It's just you run an art company.

579
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,830
So many articles.

580
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,160
Can't be too careful.

581
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,400
Can't just let anyone go in.

582
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,350
Especially some

583
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,110
lousy broker.

584
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,350
Who did you call lousy?

585
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,310
Hey, you.

586
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,030
Can't do business.

587
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,720
And you called Ling for help.

588
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,440
Do you think everyone's idle

589
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,790
like you?

590
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,590
Sorry.

591
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,070
If you can't do it, leave.

592
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,830
Can I go?

593
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,030
Yes.

594
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:37,750
Hello?

595
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,270
What is it, Mr. Ma?

596
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,070
Manli.

597
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,030
I want to ask.

598
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,310
Was Yuan Lang your colleague?

599
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,270
Yes.

600
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,880
At Blue Ocean.

601
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,270
He tries to sell products to Wei,

602
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,640
saying he's superior than you.

603
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,480
A director.

604
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,160
Said he could do better than you.

605
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,240
Did Wei buy anything?

606
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,480
No.

607
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,440
Wei never trusts the insurance business.

608
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,440
And now you're banned.

609
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,880
He doesn't

610
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,590
believes anyone easily.

611
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,750
So Wei,

612
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,550
didn't buy any insurance before.

613
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,440
No.

614
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,310
I see.

615
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,790
Thanks, Ma.

616
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,310
TSI.

617
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
[Hospital]

618
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,110
Xiaozhou.

619
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,510
Off work?

620
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,070
What are you doing here?

621
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,640
Picking you up.

622
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,270
Ya.

623
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
About yesterday.

624
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,590
I was wrong.

625
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:39,920
I'm sorry.

626
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,110
Trust me.

627
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,110
I'll secure a deal

628
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,350
in my own way.

629
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,920
Give me time.

630
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,920
Xiaozhou.

631
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,350
You said things like this before.

632
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,270
I think you need to change.

633
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,400
I will.

634
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,680
What's wrong?

635
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,400
Bad mood?

636
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,510
I'm fine.

637
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,640
Let's go home.

638
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:11,640
Let me.

639
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,640
You look tired.

640
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm OK.

641
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,640
He spoke up for me in front of Jin?

642
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,000
No way.

643
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,350
Why should I lie?

644
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,110
Ms. Hu.

645
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,830
Why do you bring him up?

646
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,240
A friend told me

647
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,400
he's selling insurance for TSI now.

648
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,590
I'm curious.

649
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,110
Insurance?

650
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,720
No wonder.

651
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,160
What?

652
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,030
He took exams as a CPA.

653
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:47,790
Why?

654
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,310
He said

655
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,440
the insurance

656
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,510
needs healthy development.

657
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,680
And

658
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,400
he needs to prepare for the new age.

659
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,200
Well, he sure thinks

660
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,510
like the management.

661
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,000
He's a good kid.

662
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,680
But certificates

663
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
aren't everything in our business.

664
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,160
Good kid?

665
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,240
He was ruthless to me.

666
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:16,960
Mr. Chen.

667
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,960
Take a look at the proposal.

668
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,160
I'll look through.

669
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,720
Call it a day.

670
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,200
OK.

671
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,920
Um, Manli.

672
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,680
I'm not defending him.

673
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,750
But he wasn't

674
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,960
the mastermind.

675
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,790
He was used.

676
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,550
I know.

677
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,720
You do?

678
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,440
He was abandoned then.

679
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,480
Expected of you.

680
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,070
Know everything crystal clear.

681
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,240
Such a shame for Xiaozhou.

682
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,920
Hey, Xu.

683
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,680
I heard because of him,

684
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,070
you won't have a raise.

685
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,750
You still speaking up for him?

686
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,400
I've been doing this for 30 years

687
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,750
and seen sorts of people.

688
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,070
Xiaozhou's different.

689
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,200
Every time there was a claim,

690
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,680
if he had ever consulted me a bit,

691
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,000
he would mention me in the report.

692
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,400
He takes everything

693
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,960
he deserves,

694
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,590
and won't take anything he doesn't.

695
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,920
He's too honest,

696
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,680
ended up

697
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,960
hurting you.

698
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,110
He was

699
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,680
kicked out too.

700
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,000
Alright, I see your point.

701
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,550
Thanks.

702
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,440
No need, keep in touch.

703
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:35,960
Yes.

704
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,880
Can't do business.

705
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,110
You called Ling for help.

706
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,400
Do you think everyone's idle

707
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,750
like you?

708
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,310
If you can't do it, leave.

709
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,510
Here.

710
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,750
This is that lady's notebook.

711
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,480
You tried to secure deals

712
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,310
with this?

713
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,200
Lucky she didn't know.

714
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,350
Or she'd be mad.

715
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,640
I'm desperate.

716
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,480
Out of choices.

717
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,110
OK, drop it.

718
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,270
It got me all screwed up.

719
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,680
I'll mail it to her.

720
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,480
Thought she blocked me.

721
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,350
Who is it?

722
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,590
That lady. Look.

723
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,540
[Let's meet. Something important.]

724
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,680
So are you going?

725
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,310
I...

726
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,070
She messed with me today, hard.

727
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,440
If I'll go since she asked,

728
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,750
who do you think I am?

729
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,720
I won't go.

730
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,110
Hey, listen.

731
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,030
You should meet her.

732
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,640
You work in the same business.

733
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,960
You'll meet sooner or later.

734
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,750
You don't want an enemy.

735
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,310
What if she bullies you

736
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,920
when you guys meet again?

737
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,350
Return this to her in person.

738
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,110
Be nice.

739
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,590
End this nicely.

740
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,720
OK.

741
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,830
Do as you say.

742
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,830
Don't think.

743
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,480
So awkward to see her.

744
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,680
I'll text her back.

745
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,350
What do you want?

746
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You're here, sit.

747
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,110
Order whatever you like.

748
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,830
Straight to the point.

749
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,920
You joined TSI?

750
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,240
Good for you.

751
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,110
Not everyone gets in.

752
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,960
None of your business.

753
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,590
I care about you.

754
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,510
You called me a spy.

755
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,240
Why dwell on yesterday?

756
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,200
What?

757
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,000
The old woman ditched you?

758
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,070
Here you are.

759
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Where did you get this?

760
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,280
Bet you peeked.

761
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,110
Sorry.

762
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,840
For what?

763
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,190
I visited Linjiang

764
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,630
because I'd seen your book.

765
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,670
I did wrong.

766
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,840
I apologize.

767
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:39,920
I'm sorry.

768
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,760
I was

769
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,880
wondering how

770
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,630
I bumped into you there.

771
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,840
Since you hate me,

772
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,480
why return it to

773
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,710
and be honest with me?

774
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,150
Hating you doesn't mean

775
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,400
I'll play dirty to you.

776
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,190
It's different.

777
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,280
Though I hate you too,

778
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,760
I respect you for

779
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,440
that speech.

780
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,710
Leaving.

781
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,070
Hold on.

782
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,880
Want to cooperate?

783
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,030
On what?

784
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,480
I have clients.

785
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,280
You work in the business.

786
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,110
We should make deals together.

787
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,360
No.

788
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:28,920
Why?

789
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,550
I made you banned.

790
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,150
You smeared my name.

791
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,550
We have grudges against each other.

792
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,590
We won't last.

793
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,070
Totally wrong.

794
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,150
Sit.

795
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,190
We have a common enemy.

796
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,400
Qiu Lisu.

797
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,030
She ruined my family

798
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,880
and abandoned you.

799
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,760
Right?

800
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,920
We both hate her.

801
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,150
That makes us friends.

802
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,960
We work together,

803
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,670
having each other's back,

804
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,670
to slap her hard.

805
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,710
How nice.

806
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,190
No, thanks.

807
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,960
Why?

808
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,550
We're different.

809
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,840
How?

810
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,710
Don't you sell insurance

811
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,920
like me?

812
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,960
I want to be decent.

813
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,550
So I'm indecent?

814
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,280
I should go.

815
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,800
Young man.

816
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,630
It's not easy to sell insurance.

817
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,960
You need my help.

818
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,710
Or you're getting nowhere.

819
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,440
Don't look down on me.

820
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,150
I can do whatever you can.

821
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,550
All clients on this book,

822
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,510
I introduce them to you.

823
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,440
See if you can secure a deal.

824
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,590
I'll never sell insurance if you do.

825
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,590
Bet?

826
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,070
What if I do?

827
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,320
Oh yeah?

828
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,710
OK.

829
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,150
I'll leave you alone.

830
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,070
You said it.

831
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,760
And,

832
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,000
if you fail,

833
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,360
you work with me.

834
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,760
OK?

835
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:09,800
Scared?

836
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,840
You agreed?

837
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,630
Yeah?

838
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,110
I'm surprised.

839
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,480
Thought you hated her.

840
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,360
She said

841
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,190
I couldn't even make

842
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,440
one deal.

843
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,800
Too insulting.

844
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,150
I must prove myself.

845
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,880
She should know

846
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,150
I can sell insurance decently.

847
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,760
I believe in you.

848
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,400
Eat up.

849
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,510

850

Stay strong.

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,760
What?

853
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,670

You crazy?

00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,980
♫Dawns broke, I held fast♫

977
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,100
♫Cars fled, dreams fled♫

978
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:11,580
♫Every route left dead♫

979
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,100
♫Love left, hate stayed♫

980
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,980
♫Voice gone, tears paid♫

981
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,620
♫Grew strong, moved on♫

982
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,620
♫Why dwell when it's gone♫
