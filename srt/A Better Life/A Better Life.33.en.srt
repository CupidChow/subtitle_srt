00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,120
What's this?

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,230
Want me to

43
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
work overtime?

44
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,790
No, you don't have to do anything.

45
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,640
The annuity is...

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,840
My gift for you.

47
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,480
Me?

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,870
A premium of 1 million.

49
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,150
Paid in a decade.

50
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,000
Hold on.

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,310
Am I your client now?

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
You said it was a gift.

53
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,750
Wouldn't I pay the premium?

54
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,520
Premium of the first year

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,870
is on this card.

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
When you sign,

57
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,030
you pay with this.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,310
OK.

59
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,400
You pay for the first year.

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,590
The rest nine?

61
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,680
Would you still pay?

62
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,360
Yes.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,960

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,150
I'll transfer the premium every year.

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,680
Let me remind you.

67
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,190
1 million in a decade.

68
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,360
Giving me that money for no reason?

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,710
You're out of your mind?

70
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,750
You said it.

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,030
You wanted life insurance from me.

72
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,030
You...

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,710
forgot?

74
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,590
Me?

75
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,800
Did I say that?

76
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,590
Yes.

77
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,190
I forgot.

78
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,750
I did not.

79
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,680
I was just joking.

80
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,190
I'm not.

81
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,910
I made you lose your job.

82
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,710
and got you banned from the industry.

83
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,960
Now I can make up to you.

84
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,960
I

85
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,520

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,520
It was Chen and Ling's fault.

89
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,400
Nothing to do with you.

93
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,470
But take it back.

94
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,080

95

you just

96
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,910
pay me what I deserve.

97
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,480
I won't deduct your commission.

98
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,310
Do take this card.

99
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,950
You force me?

100
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,870
You know me.

101
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,750
At work,

102
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,560
I don't want to be indebted.

103
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,070
OK?

104
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,480
Money affects friendship.

105
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,800
And relationships

106
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,390
affect money and feelings.

107
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,750
You understand me?

108
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,000
I do.

109
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,360
But

110
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,390
I don't think so.

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,830
It's Ning. What happened?

112
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,950
I'll call her back.

What's this?

117
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,560
No way.

118
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,310
Off my mind...

119
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,750
This is the end of this session.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Take a break.

121
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,720
Take a look.

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,040
Thanks.

123
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:21,750
Pleasure.

124
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,830
Help me read into it.

125
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,720
Am I over-thinking?

126
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,750
What's there to think?

127
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,390
He likes you.

128
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:38,950
You can't see?

129
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,000
For what?

130
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,800
Which part of me does he like?

131
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,870
Don't be so harsh on yourself.

132
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,310
Feelings

133
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,390
are subtle.

134
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,160
Look.

135
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,360
Even Zhiyuan falls for you again.

136
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,000
Now.

137
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,950
You have two admirers.

138
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,870
Dress up.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,870
Back to the prime of life.

140
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,270
See if you get another admirer.

141
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,720
Stop, you nut-head.

142
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,040
You're driving me crazy.

143
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,510
Do I need a man?

144
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,600
I can't thrive on my own?

145
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,270
OK, on your own.

146
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,000
So.

147
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,240
What do you think

148
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,510
of Xiaozhou?

149
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,750
Unwanted attention.

150
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,870
If he really means that, I'm doomed.

151
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,240
If we can't make money together,

152
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,040
I don't need him.

153
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,480
You guys could make a good TV romance.

154
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,950
Why do you

155
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,600
turn it into a bad soap opera?

156
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,630
No making money

157
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,390
is a thriller to me.

158
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,000
Let me ask you this.

159
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,310
You like him?

160
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,680
I want truth.

161
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,120
If you lie,

162
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,720
no more orders your whole life.

163
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,040
He's only a younger brother to me.

164
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,480
Really?

165
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,480
You're only 40.

166
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,000
So many date younger boys now.

167
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,190
Consider him.

168
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,360
Quit your jibber-jabber.

169
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,270
I'll be off.

170
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,480
I have to follow up on Fendou's plan.

171
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,680
I need to find an apartment.

172
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,000
Lots of work.

173
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,120
Isn't it nice to live with him?

174
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,310
Why move again?

175
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,800
He's like this.

176
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,630
Can I stay?

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Awkward.

178
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,560
And Dingding.

179
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,310
I can't leave him

180
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,920
in that woman's place forever.

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,750
Now.

182
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,310
House price is falling.

183
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,120
But rent is going up.

184
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,040
Any decent houses

185
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,720
cost

186
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,160
5,000 a month.

187
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,870
OK.

188
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,680
I'll go back to work.

189
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,630
Will you guys live with me?

190
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm alone.

191
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,080
Here.

192
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,150
Yuki.

193
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,630
You moved back home?

194
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,870
That's good.

195
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,360
I'm listening.

196
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,480
Mr. Li.

197
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,390
Is Ke in?

198
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,150
Yes, she's in the back garden.

199
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,440
Manli.

200
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm counting on you.

201
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,960
Call me.

202
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,600
Who were you talking to?

203
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,910
Manli.

204
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,000
Hu Manli?

205
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,790
What's she like?

206
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,390
Mr. Li.

207
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Is it what I think it is?

208
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,390
What do you mean?

209
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,510
I'm just trying to talk.

210
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,240
I won't help unless you tell the truth.

211
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,200
Actually,

212
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,910
I just

213
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,150
think, sometimes,

214
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,510
she makes me think of your mom.

215
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,510
Sharp-eyed.

216
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,630
I approve.

217
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,510
What did you approve?

218
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,480
Stop your nonsense.

219
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,270
Dad.

220
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,320
I think you could get

221
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,240
together.

222
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,200
Don't you want an heir?

223
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,240
She's young.

224
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,480
She'll have a baby for you.

225
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,080
No.

226
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,390
Two.

227
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,150
Oh my.

228
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,790
I'm a genius matchmaker.

229
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,000
You're a genius lunatic.

230
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,550
What babies?

231
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
I admire her hard work.

232
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,000
I respect her.

233
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,360
Appreciation.

234
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,080
Li.

235
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,910
I know exactly what's on your mind.

236
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,790
Don't worry.

237
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,120
You can count

238
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,550
on me on this.

239
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,630
OK...

240
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,000
Keep in touch.

241
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,270
Bye.

242
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,440
Ding Daer.

243
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,360
Here's the thing.

244
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,000
Call your parents.

245
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,150
I'll call your mom.

246
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,480
Don't, Miss.

247
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,910
She's busy.

248
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,030
Very busy.

249
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,670
Please leave her alone.

250
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,000
Don't be afraid.

251
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,390
I'm just trying to solve the problem.

252
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,150
You and Xiaojun never

253
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,270
get along.

254
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,910
His parents insisted.

255
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,870
They want a public apology.

256
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,840
I'm

257
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,750
trying to protect you.

258
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,390
I hope parents on both sides

259
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,080
could talk.

260
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,600
We can downgrade

261
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,750
and resolve this.

262
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,440
Then.

263
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,270
Can I ask my dad?

264
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:50,790
OK.

265
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,910
Tell him tonight.

266
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:53,960
Yes.

267
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,440
Go back to class.

268
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,390
Ms. Qiu.

269
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,750
Time to eat.

270
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,750
Coming.

271
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,360
Dingding, come eat.

272
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,150
I'm good.

273
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,840
Ate at my classmate's home.

274
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,790
When will Dad be back?

275
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,910
The day after tomorrow. What's up?

276
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,960
Thanks.

277
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,270
You're back.

278
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,720
You're gone the whole day.

279
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,360
Where did you go?

280
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,200
I was with Ning.

281
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,270
Qing asked me

282
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,910
to visit insurance firms.

283
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,750
We'll discuss on plans we'll distribute.

284
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,200
She implied

285
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,600
she'd retire in a few years.

286
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,840
She'd give the firm to me or Ling.

287
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,320
That's good.

288
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,840
Anything else?

289
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,600
Um...

290
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,440
You haven't plucked my gray hair.

291
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,550
It's good.

292
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,480
You look mature.

293
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,240
No, you have to pluck.

294
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,910
What for?

295
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,320
You might turn bald.

296
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,670
Better to sport gray hair.

297
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,030
Nice. You scold me again.

298
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,080
Want scolding?

299
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,120
Once you scold me,

300
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,000
I feel your care.

301
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,000
Can you

302
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,720
scold me every day?

303
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Only if you

304
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,750
pay.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,870
OK, I want membership.

306
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,630
Nut-head.

307
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,270
You free tomorrow?

308
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,600
What's up? I'll accompany you.

309
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,120
Dine with a client.

310
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,150
Who?

311
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,510
You'll see.

312
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,870
Did you eat?

313
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,600
Let's get takeaway.

314
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,200
I ate. You go ahead.

315
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,750
Then.

316
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,200
Good night.

317
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:50,750
Dad.

318
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,750
Isn't this a birthday

319
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,870
gift from Mom?

320
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
It is.

321
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,840
Get rid of it.

322
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,270
Nothing fancy.

323
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,790
I'll keep

324
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:03,910
it.

325
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,080
Hello?

326
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,240
Lisu.

327
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:23,910
What's up?

328
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,030
How's the baby?

329
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,390
You only called

330
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,630
because you miss the baby?

331
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,840
They are in your belly.

332
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,480
If they're good,

333
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,870
you're good.

334
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,630
I'm missing you.

335
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,200
We're good.

336
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,030
Still,

337
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,670
we should be careful.

338
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,240
Don't wear yourself out.

339
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,200
Sleep early.

340
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,030
Don't make yourself

341
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,360
feel fatigue.

342
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:58,870
It's late.

343
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,440
Rest up.

344
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,670
Wait.

345
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:03,750
What?

346
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,240
I want to ask for a favor.

347
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,480
What is it?

348
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,920
It's Daer.

349
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,790
He argued with a boy at school.

350
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,200
I talked to his teacher on the phone.

351
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,960
I planned

352
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,750
to handle it after I came back.

353
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,200
But the teacher said

354
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,240
that boy's parents insisted

355
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,400
I go tomorrow.

356
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,070
But I'm only home the next night.

357
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,830
I'm out of

358
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,720
options now.

359
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,880
So I want your help.

360
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,000
Go to school for me, OK?

361
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,720
Lisu?

362
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,750
You there?

363
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,590
Since it's about Dingding,

364
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,550
why not ask Manli?

365
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,110
She's in misery.

366
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,350
You don't want to burden her, right?

367
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,920
I'm carrying baby.

368
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,750
Won't you care about me?

369
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,790
Here you go again.

370
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,480
Don't put words in

371
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,830
my mouth, OK?

372
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,030
I'll go.

373
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,640
Never mind.

374
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,720
I'll tell the teacher

375
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,270
to wait until I'm back.

376
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,720
Zhiyuan.

377
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,720
I was being sensitive.

378
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,160
I apologize.

379
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,110
I'm your wife

380
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,070
and Daer's stepmother.

381
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,240
He lives with us now.

382
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,790
I should also

383
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,640
look after him.

384
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,720
Thanks.

385
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,480
Xiaozhou.

386
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,640
Didn't expect.

387
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,030
I did.

388
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,000
I asked Manli to get you here.

389
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,550
You're the client?

390
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,000
Sit.

391
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,160
What do you want?

392
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:36,960
Order yourself.

393
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,350
My treat.

394
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,880
We should wait until Manli's here.

395
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,880
She texted me.

396
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,830
She couldn't make it here.

397
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,750
Pick.

398
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,160
We'll be on our own.

399
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,480
Pick what you like.

400
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,200
I'm not picky.

401
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,510
Miss.

402
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,590
Coming.

403
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:02,960
So.

404
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,550
Two combo meals.

405
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,880
Miss.

406
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,790
Two of this.

407
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,400
OK.

408
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,720
Thanks.

409
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,350
Please wait.

410
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,880
So

411
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,720
any problems with your dad's proposal?

412
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,310
Or...

413
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,110
No.

414
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,880
I want to thank you.

415
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,680
Dad told me

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,200
what you said touched him.

417
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,480
Did it?

418
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,590
It's just my

419
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,270
job.

420
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,640
What?

421
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,830
A gift.

422
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,830
For me?

423
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,590
I made it myself.

424
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,030
I...

425
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,110
I can't take this.

426
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,960
Why?

427
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,200
You can't gift friends

428
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,440
with these hearts.

429
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,000
Xiaozhou.

430
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,270
You're not a friend.

431
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,440
Xiaozhou.

432
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,830
I like you.

433
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,830
Thanks.

434
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,680
Well.

435
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,590
I don't deserve.

436
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,550
You so do.

437
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,550
I

438
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,350
have nothing to say.

439
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,830
I'll say.

440
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,640
You're a boy and I'm a girl.

441
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,550
You're single, and I am too.

442
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,160
Give me a chance.

443
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,000
How's that?

444
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,440
Ms. Li.

445
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Call me Ke.

446
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,720
Relationships

447
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,240
aren't business.

448
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,110
It's not about giving a chance.

449
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,070
For me,

450
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,070
you're my client's daughter.

451
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,270
That's all.

452
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,880
For now.

453
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,030
I can wait.

454
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:08,640
You...

455
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,590
Don't talk.

456
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,920
Listen.

457
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,960
When I first met you,

458
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,640
Manli took you to pick clothes.

459
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,030
I was impressed

460
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,070
because of your looks.

461
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,000
But soon

462
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,270
I found.

463
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,070
Your aloof temperament is even better.

464
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,830
I asked Manli.

465
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,440
She said you had a girlfriend.

466
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,110
OK.

467
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,550
I won't steal you.

468
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,480
I quit.

469
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,720
Then.

470
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,240
She told me

471
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,310
you had long broken up with that girl.

472
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,880
Well, this is my chance.

473
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,680
What else did she say?

474
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,960
She said you were actually nice.

475
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,720
Don't open yourself to people.

476
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
But once you accept me,

477
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,590
you must make a good boyfriend.

478
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,510
She told you that?

479
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,400
So.

480
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,720
She

481
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,270
encouraged you to

482
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,510
chase after me.

483
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,880
What was her attitude?

484
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,030
What attitude?

485
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,070
How hard did she encourage?

486
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,310
What?

487
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,400
We're talking about us.

488
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,750
Why keep mentioning her?

489
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,960
Sorry.

490
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,160
I remember I have an emergency

491
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,000
to handle.

492
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:28,920
Xiaozhou.

493
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,510
I know you don't like me now.

494
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,550
You're avoiding me.

495
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,790
It's OK.

496
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,240
I won't give up.

497
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,920
You can reject me.

498
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,550
I can chase after you.

499
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,550
Life's too short.

500
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,000
It's lucky to run into people you like.

501
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,640
I won't let you slip away.

502
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,590
Yuki.

503
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,310
I rejected you

504
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,160
because we aren't fit for each other.

505
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,590
And there's an important reason.

506
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,070
What?

507
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,680
I have someone I like.

508
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,440
I so do.

509
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,240
Excuse me.

510
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,790
I'm really sorry.

511
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,030
Thanks.

512
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,720
He said he liked someone.

513
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,550
He rejected you.

514
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,680
You weren't upset?

515
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,400
Come on.

516
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
I like

517
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,550
and chase him, but he rejected.

518
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,160
It's his loss totally.

519
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,350
What else do you want from me?

520
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,640
Nothing.

521
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,240
Manli.

522
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
I want to know

523
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,400
what you think of my dad.

524
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:12,960
Your dad?

525
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,070
He's nice.

526
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,070
Really?

527
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,480
Consider being

528
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,510
my stepmother.

529
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,350
Hey.

530
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,550
Don't just matchmake people.

531
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,000
Your dad loves your mom.

532
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,350
If he knew,

533
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,070
he'd scold you.

534
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,790
[Xue Xiaozhou]

535
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,030
But he thinks you're nice too.

536
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,960
If he doesn't mean it that way,

537
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,480
I won't ask you in the first place.

538
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,960
I don't mean it that way.

539
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,200
Especially the way you talk about.

540
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,310
My dad is worth your feelings.

541
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,550
Consider.

542
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,590
I won't.

543
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,750
I won't remarry.

544
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,510
Dine with him and see if you like him.

545
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,040
[Xue Xiaozhou: Let's talk.]

546
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,440
I can have coffee.

547
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,440
No dining.

548
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,830
How about...

549
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,830
No more suggestions.

550
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,510
Or I won't have coffee either.

551
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,510
Actually.

552
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,110
It's normal for some quarrels.

553
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,000
The point is.

554
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,400
Someone

555
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,070
sent a screenshot to Xiaojun.

556
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,720
His parents found out

557
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,000
and called it school bullying.

558
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,350
We're caught in between.

559
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,350
I know.

560
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,200
If this blows up,

561
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,550
no one benefits.

562
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,510
I can see

563
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,920
you're a sensible parent.

564
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,110
We do this to protect the kids.

565
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,400
Now.

566
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,030
We should ask Daer to delete the post.

567
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,790
Then he apologizes in a class meeting.

568
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,160
We could

569
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,110
try to solve this

570
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,400
within the class.

571
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,000
I see.

572
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,640
I'll talk to him.

573
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,350
Daer.

574
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,200
We've talked.

575
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,030
You are

576
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,000
both good kids.

577
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,920
Don't make things difficult for him

578
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,030
for trivia.

579
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,160
Here.

580
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,590
In today's class meeting,

581
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,400
you can apologize before everyone.

582
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,880
Apologize

583
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,680
and get it over with.

00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,440
apologize?

586
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,110
He cheated.

587
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,440
I just told the truth.

588
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,240
Was I wrong?

589
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,590
He threatened me.

590
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
Why should I apologize?

591
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,160
Never mind.

592
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,270
Don't be mad, madam.

593
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,070
Even if Daer refuses,

594
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,510
I'll forgive him.

595
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,160
You repel me.

596
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,160
You only play nice before adults.

597
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,920
Daer, look at him, broad-minded.

598
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,200
He makes a stance.

599
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
You still won't apologize?

600
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,310
He's acting.

601
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,240
He always bullies slimmer ones like me.

602
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,070
I don't, madam.

603
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,830
He dislikes me.

604
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,640
Lying.

605
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,830
Ding Daer.

606
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,790
I know you're in a bad mood because

607
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,200
your parents divorced.

608
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,270
Don't take it to heart

609
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,880
if I had a slip of the tongue.

610
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,440
Still

611
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,350
acting?

612
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,400
I'll hit you.

613
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,350
Ding Daer.

614
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,830
Look at you.

615
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:10,880
Listen.

616
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,720
Apologize now.

617
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,400
No way.

618
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,200
It's OK.

619
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,000
He's impulsive.

620
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,160
Don't push him too hard.

621
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,830
I'll persuade him later.

622
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,110
No, miss.

623
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,750
He was doted on by his mom and

624
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,000
needs discipling.

625
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,270
He'll be ruined this way.

626
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,920
Wait for me.

627
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,240
Ding Daer.

628
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,590
Ding Daer.

629
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,310
Stop.

630
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:41,920
Stop.

631
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,680
His parents made clear

632
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,510
their attitude.

633
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,000
As long as you apologize publicly,

634
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,240
it's over.

635
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,750
If you don't,

636
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,880
they see it as school

637
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,350
bullying

638
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,750
and hype things up.

639
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,400
No, he bullies me.

640
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,790
So I couldn't help but

641
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,790
talk bad about him with classmates.

642
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:07,960
Trust me.

643
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,160
The whole class doesn't like him.

644
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,960
He's got no friends.

645
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,680
You can apologize now,

646
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,550
or,

647
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,070
when this escalates,

648
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,510
his parents go to your mom.

649
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,240
You mom will have to clean up the mess.

650
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,750
She's got a lot to handle.

651
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,310
You want to trouble her more?

652
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,110
You don't want that.

653
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,750
You're on purpose.

654
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,070
Why do this to me?

655
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,680
To my mom?

656
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,200
Because you keep reminding me

657
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,920
how right and great

658
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,110
she is.

659
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,830
She's always

660
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,400
better than me.

661
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,350
I'll change your mind with facts.

662
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,440
Your dad chose me

663
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,640
because I'm better.

664
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,510
You've gone too far.

665
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,590
Ding Daer.

666
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,750
If you want to save trouble

667
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,590
for your mom,

668
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,680
do as I say.

669
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,070
Think it through

670
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,200
before class ends today.

671
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,160
Or

672
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,640
when this blows up,

673
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,510
your great

674
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,000
mom might fail to handle.

675
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,030
Ke.

676
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,110
Finished?

677
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,640
Soon...

678
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,480
Two minutes.

679
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,030
Come here.

680
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,480
What?

681
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,160
Should I apply this after?

682
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:28,830
This...

683
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,350
How to use?

684
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,830
It's anti-aging.

685
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,830
Apply after you wash your face at night.

686
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,240
I'll wait until tonight.

687
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,550
Should I use this now?

688
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,200
Dad, one step at a time.

689
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,790
You can't apply them all together.

690
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,200
You wanted me to look younger.

691
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,110
So I could, um...

692
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,160
I'm worried about

693
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,270
my wrinkled face.

694
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,400
OK, this one first.

695
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,750
Dad.

696
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,350
I brought you up

697
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,240
to Manli today.

698
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,750
What did she say?

699
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,720
She declined.

700
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,030
Don't be upset.

701
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,160
It's hard for a man to chase a woman.

702
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,270
But I'll help

703
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,750
you succeed bit by bit.

704
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,790
It's never possible to begin with.

705
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,400
Don't pester her.

706
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,880
You gave up just like that?

707
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,680
It's not like you.

708
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,270
Ke.

709
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,830
Listen.

710
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,790
When a man

711
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,000
likes a woman,

712
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,550
he wants to date her.

713
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,510
But if a man appreciates a woman,

714
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,510
he'll respect her.

715
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,880
I'll be friends with her,

716
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,720
that's all.

717
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,110
Dad.

718
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,720
Did you read some

719
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,750
bossy president novels?

720
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,070
Play hard to get.

721
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,550
Where did you go?

722
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,830
Got something to do.

723
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,830
Why did you ask me on a date with Yuki?

724
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,030
She's nice and rich.

725
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,750
If you end up with her,

726
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,880
I, your big sis, will be at ease.

727
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,200
Sis.

728
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,400
I'm just a younger

729
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,550
brother to you?

730
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,070
Or what?

731
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,720
You even call Dingding big brother.

732
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,920
You really want to call me aunt?

733
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,240
Did Yuki say I had something I like?

734
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,070
She did.

735
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,920
You won't ask who it is?

736
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,550
It's your privacy.

737
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,400
I'm not interested.

738
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,020
[Zhiyuan]

739
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,030
It's because of him?

740
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,310
Give it back.

741
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,550
You're avoiding me

742
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,960
because you want to remarry him?

743
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,070
Want to be a mistress.

744
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,350
Have some senses.

745
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,960
You know what you're talking about?

746
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,720
He's not with you?

747
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
It's 9.

748
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Where could he be?

749
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,440
I have to find him.

750
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,150
I'll ask Jia to have the car.

751
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,760
OK.

752
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,400
Dingding's missing.

753
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,070
What happened?

754
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,800
I don't know.

755
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,960
Zhiyuan told me.

756
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,400
Don't panic.

757
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,190
He could be with his classmate and

758
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:20,960
didn't tell you.

759
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,710
No, he never does this.

760
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,150
What to do?

761
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,880
Call his head teacher

762
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,070
to confirm the situation.

763
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,440
Then.

764
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,230
Think of places he could be at.

765
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,360
We'll find him.

766
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,110
Don't panic.

767
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,480
Dad.

768
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,230
Manli's son went missing.

769
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,320
Do something.

770
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,550
Don't worry.

771
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,280
I'll make a call.

772
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,110
Get me a car.

773
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,480
I'll go find him.

774
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,280
Ask Wang to tag along.

775
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,960
Keep calm.

776
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:03,800
Anyone there?

777
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,030
I'll check.

778
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,190
No.

779
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,150
No.

780
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,030
Did you find him?

781
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,230
I didn't either.

782
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,920
Where did he go?

783
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,550
We went to 2nd floor just now, right?

784
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,670
Yes...

785
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,110
I'll check again.

786
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,110
Thank you.

787
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Call me if

788
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,030
find anything.

789
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,030
What did you find?

790
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,070
Nothing. You?

791
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,360
Let's get in.

792
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
Turn right in the front.

793
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:58,800
OK.

794
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,760
I've searched everywhere

795
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,070
possible.

796
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,670
Where could he be?

797
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,030
I've called the police.

798
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,320
They're going through CCTV footages.

799
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,150
They'll

800
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,480
keep us posted.

801
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,880
My dad called a friend in traffic police

802
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,550
and they'd inform us if there's any

803
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,760
car accidents involving kids.

804
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,800
Where are you going?

805
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,510
No...

806
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,280
I told him before

807
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
to watch the lights.

808
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,840
Even if it's green,

809
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,320
he'd have to watch the road.

810
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,030
Sit.

811
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,840
No...

812
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,510
Sit.

813
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,880
- It's OK…
- Sit...

814
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,440
It's OK.

815
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,000
Water?

816
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,030
Have water.

817
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,800
No...

818
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,110
Manli.

819
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,070
I've got no calls.

820
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,480
Dingding must be OK.

821
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,510
Don't worry.

822
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,510
The CCTV footages cover everywhere.

823
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,670
He'll be traced.

824
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,840
He's a big boy.

825
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,630
It was highly unlikely a human

826
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,510
trafficker.

827
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,110
Don't let imagination run wild.

828
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,440
First,

829
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,150
we need to calm down.

830
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,360
Think where he could be.

831
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,030
Don't miss any leads.

832
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,190
Stop.

833
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,710
Who are you?

834
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,630
Why are you sneaking around?

835
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,070
What's up?

836
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I went to the wrong door.

837
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,960
Wait...

838
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,840
Where did you live?

839
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,710
What do you do?

840
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,760
Madam, I'm not a bad guy.

841
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,320
I,

842
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,440
I used to live here.

843
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,230
I just

844
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,400
want to see here.

845
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,960
You lived here?

846
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,030
The room facing north was my bedroom.

847
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,510
When the weather is nice,

848
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,960
you could see the Bundle.

849
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,960
At this hour,

850
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,630
what could you see?

851
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,070
Nothing.

852
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,230
I don't know about myself.

853
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,280
Kiddo, it's late.

854
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,510
Go home.

855
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,920
Your parents would be worried.

856
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,110
Madam.

857
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,190
Can I see my room?

858
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,840
I'm just seeing.

859
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,360
This is amazing.

860
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,480
Amazing.

861
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,880
Come on.

862
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
He can fly, you know?

863
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,630
Fly?

864
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,550
Which do you like?

865
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,000
This.

866
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,710
This?

867
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,110
This is amazing too.

868
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,630
Pretty.

869
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,440
Pretty?

870
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,480
Yes.

871
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,280
Though the house is a bit expensive,

872
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,110
we like the furnishing.

873
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,320
Elegant and practical.

874
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,550
So we keep it that way.

875
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,630
I see.

876
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,070
Mom designed it herself.

877
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,480
Your mom is pretty amazing.

878
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,880
Who's this?

879
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,150
The previous owner's son.

880
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,110
Manli.

881
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,590
You're going to a parent meeting,

882
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,630
not a date.

883
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,670
I don't dress up for men.

884
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,280
In a parent meeting, you know,

885
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,030
you either compare good grades

886
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,190
or your mom's good looks

887
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,190
if you haven't got any.

888
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,190
I guess you were insulting me?

889
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,880
I don't look like

890
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,510
I'm almost 40, do I?

891
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,670
Like you haven't been born.

892
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,190
I warn you.

893
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:49,760
I'll

894
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,840
be checking with his English teacher.

895
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,510
If Dingding didn't progress...

896
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,800
Madam, I was wrong.

897
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,110
Tell me now.

898
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,110
How old do I look?

899
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,480
I think you're born in 90s.

900
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,510
1890.

901
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,360
Do you have a death wish?

902
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,630
No, my big brother.

903
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:11,840
My big bro.

904
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,880
- You're both doomed.
- Mom!

905
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,230
Weaklings.

906
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,510
Defeated like that.

907
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,360
Up...

908
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,400
This used to be his home.

909
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,840
Talk to him.

910
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,150
I'll do it.

911
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,800
Kiddo.

912
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,400
It's late.

913
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,280
Should I get you a cab home?

914
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,360
You'll worry your

915
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:56,880
parents.

916
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,630
Home.

917
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,070
I want to go home.

918
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But I don't have one.

919
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,150
What to do?

920
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,760
Comfort him.

921
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,280
Big brother.

922
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,280
Don't cry. Have milk.

923
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,030
Attagirl.

924
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,030
I should persuade him.

925
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:30,960
Go comfort him.

926
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,070
I'll find a solution.

927
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,280
Hello?

928
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,190
OK... I'll be right there.

929
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,760
Found him, Mandu Gardens.

930
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,150
Where?

931
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,030
I'm on my way.

932
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:55,630
Careful...

933
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:58,880
Take it slow.

934
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,360
