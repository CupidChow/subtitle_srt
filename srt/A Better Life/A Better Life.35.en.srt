Episode 35

41
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,200
Ms. Qiu

42
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,280
You!

43
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,040
What's wrong with you?

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,710
It's nothing.

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm fine.

46
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,200
Be careful.

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,040
Take it slow.

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,070
Here.

49
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:15,910
Be careful.

50
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,240
Ms. Qiu,

51
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,400
have some soup.

52
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,400
Thank you.

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,840
Ms. Qiu,

54
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,960
today will be my last day.

55
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,800
Auntie,

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,150
I told you before,

57
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,710
our company has been expanding recently,

58
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,590
hence, we're having some cash flow issues.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,590
I promise you,

60
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,280
next month,

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,120
next month I will definitely

62
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,120
pay you the past two months' salary

63
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,430
Please don't leave yet.

64
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,710
About the salary,

65
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,750
just transfer it to me via WeChat.

66
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,240
My father-in-law is sick.

67
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,630
He's been urging me to go home.

68
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,590
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,560
Ms. Hu,

70
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,800
you should've come earlier.

71
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,750
Let me give you an overview

72
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,710
of our neighborhood

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,630
Originally,

74
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,430
this was the family compound
of a Design Institute

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,960
The residents here

76
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,280
are mostly elderly.

77
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,120
There are engineers and old professors.

78
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,280
They need physical care

79
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,190
but they also have high expectations
for their mental care

80
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,590
Their standards are high

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,960
So,

82
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,240
I believe they quite match
your company's positioning.

83
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,870
That's great, Director Qin.

84
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,800
Just call me Manli.

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,030
Alright.

86
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,750
Sorry for calling the neighborhood committee
without notice.

87
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,510
I didn't expect you to agree so quickly.

88
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,600
I really appreciate it.

89
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,240
At first,

90
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,800
we were afraid of scams, too.

91
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,040
Not long ago,

92
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,830
there was a scam case here.

93
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,510
An old professor

94
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,870
signed a reverse mortgage contract

95
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,560
with some sort of company for elderly care.

96
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,560
He ended up getting scammed.

97
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,750
The court case is still going on.

98
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,430
We don't even know if he'll get the house back.

99
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,950
Please don't worry.

100
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,950
We're a legitimate company

101
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,630
and we only work with licensed nursing homes.

102
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
All our projects are filed with the government.

103
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,270
Alright,

104
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,750
we also did our background check.

105
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,510
Otherwise, we wouldn't have let you in.

106
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,720
Director Qin!

107
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,830
Director Qin.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,070
Are you here for an inspection?

109
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,560
Cai,

110
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,630
let me introduce you to someone.

111
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
This is Hu Manli from
The Blue Ocean Life Insurance.

112
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,160
Hello, Ms. Hu.

113
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,600
This is Cai, right?

114
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,560
Hi Mr. Cai, nice to meet you.

115
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,240
Nice to meet you, too.

116
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,870
From now on,

117
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,920
she'll come to the neighborhood

118
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,600
to do some promotional events.

119
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,680
Alright.

120
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,040
You can set it up over here
when the time comes.

121
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,600
Just make sure it doesn't block the residents.

122
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,190
How about here?

123
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,750
It's fine.

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,120
It looks good.

125
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,560
Cai,

126
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,510
please coordinate with her.

127
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,160
Mr.Cai,

128
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,630
I'm going to have to trouble you
for a few days.

129
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,480
No worries.

130
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,040
It's my job to serve.

131
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,390
As long as it's Director Qin's request,

132
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,830
we'll make sure to follow through properly.

133
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,070
Thank you.

134
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,750
It's nothing.

135
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,950
Chunlu, you're coughing.

136
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,310
Maybe it's the bad weather lately.

137
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,360
My throat started hurting last night.

138
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,680
Drink some hot water.

139
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,630
I left in a rush today
and forgot to bring it.

140
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:50,920
No worries.

141
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,040
I'll take some medicine
when I get home tonight.

142
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,950
Can I get some hot water from you?

143
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,680
Yes, of course.

144
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,750
Did the auntie not cook today?

145
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,480
She went back to her hometown for a while.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,680
I'm done.

147
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,680
I still have matters to attend to.

148
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm heading upstairs.

149
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,190
Zhiyuan, wait a moment.

150
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,310
Today the doctor

151
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
took a 4D ultrasound photo of the baby.

152
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,160
It came out really clearly.

153
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,000
Look.

154
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,630
Here's the little nose and mouth.

155
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,070
Who do you think the baby looks like?

156
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,680
The doctor

157
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
asked if I'd bought any clothes yet.

158
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,750
So I tested him.

159
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,680
I said I really wanted to buy pink clothes.

160
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,750
And then the doctor

161
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,240
smiled a little

162
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,800
and nodded.

163
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,480
What he meant was

164
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,310
I'm having a daughter.

165
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,560
Zhiyuan,

166
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,870
you're going to have a daughter.

167
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,040
Pregnancy must have been hard for you.

168
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,310
Thank you.

169
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,040
Do you really want to thank me?

170
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,070
Then could you give our daughter

171
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,800
a gift?

172
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,120
I've said this before...

173
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,870
There's no rush about the annuity.

174
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,750
Let's talk about it after the baby is born.

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,360
No.

176
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,550
I want Zhig to appear on The Philosopher's Talk.

177
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,360
That decision

178
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,960
isn't mine to make.

179
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,320
But you could fight for it.

180
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,670
With your current popularity

181
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,270
you can make it happen, right?

182
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,510
Then tell me.

183
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,790
Honestly,

184
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,790
is the company not doing well lately?

185
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,510
No.

186
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,670
Lisu,

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,120
you have to tell me the truth

188
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,150
so I can help you.

189
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,200
The company

190
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,600
is indeed facing some cash flow problems.

191
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,080
But I believe

192
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,270
if you're willing

193
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,960
to promote us on The Philosopher's Talk

194
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,790
we can quickly

195
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,440
get through this crisis.

196
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,510
If the company

197
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,360
really reaches that point,

198
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,360
don't be afraid.

199
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,630
You still have me.

200
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,270
Zhiyuan,

201
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,150
what do you mean?

202
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,510
Are you going to let it collapse?

203
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,630
I've said it.

204
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,080
You and the baby have me.

205
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
I'll take responsibility.

206
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,910
You can pay for your ex-wife's father's

207
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,030
nursing home.

208
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,440
Why won't you help me?

209
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,480
I didn't say I wouldn't help.

210
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
These are two different things.

211
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,600
So are you helping or not?

212
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,750
Don't pressure me like this!

213
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,790
You're the one pressuring me!

214
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,840
The company now owes institutional money.

215
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,360
If we don't repay it, we're finished.

216
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,510
Let me be clear.

217
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,480
Your book club,

218
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,910
all the praise and admiration you received,

219
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,720
your spotlight,

220
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,240
will all be gone!

221
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,600
Do you really think I care about any of that?

222
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,840
If you didn't care,

223
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,750
would you have divorced Hu Manli to be with me?

224
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,910
So that's how you see me...

225
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,910
Once the baby is born,

226
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,670
let's get a divorce.

227
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
I'm going bankrupt

228
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,960
and you want to divorce me?

229
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,630
I'm telling you!

230
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,030
I won't divorce you! Don't even think about it!

231
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,670
Don't even...

232
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,120
Don't even think about it...

233
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,320
Don't even...

234
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,440
Manli

235
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,630
There are only three days left
for this campaign.

236
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,510
But we haven't found anyone to do
the trial stay.

237
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,550
What should we do?

238
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,840
It's mainly because the resident
of this community

239
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,270
have been scammed before.

240
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,080
So we have to rebuild the trust.

241
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,790
We need to get through this phase.

242
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,480
Leave this to me.

243
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,750
You go take care of your mom.

244
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,390
Doesn't the caregiver get off at 7?

245
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,550
Alright.

246
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,440
Here,

247
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,550
Manli.

248
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,000
This is for you.

249
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,120
Remember to drink it when you get home.

250
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,790
Don't be sick because of me.

251
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,150
It's okay. Thank you.

252
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,790
I'm leaving now.

253
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,320
See you tomorrow.

254
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,670
See you tomorrow.

255
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,440
Mr. Cai.

256
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,270
Goodbye.

257
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,270
Mr. Cai,

258
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,440
I'll leave this here.

259
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,240
Alright.

260
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm heading off. See you tomorrow.

261
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,390
Ms. Hu,

262
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,200
about this

263
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,630
is it true that you can live here
for a month for free?

264
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Mr. Cai,

265
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,870
don't tell me that even you think
that we're scammers?

266
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,720
So it's really free?

267
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,030
Of course it is.

268
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,630
Can someone like me stay too?

269
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,600
What's your situation?

270
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,550
Why are you so surprised?

271
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,750
Are you looking down on me?

272
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,870
I used to live in this neighborhood, too.

273
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,030
No, it's just...

274
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,120
Director Qin told me that

275
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,910
this community was built for the families
of the staff in the design institute

276
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,910
I didn't expect you to live here too.

277
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,910
That's old news.

278
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,600
I sold the house long ago

279
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,670
I used the money to help my son

280
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,080
buy a marital home.

281
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,080
Now I retire at home.

282
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,150
It's pretty boring.

283
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,390
But my son is successful.

284
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,600
He earns a lot of money.

285
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,080
My grandchildren

286
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,910
already have a nanny taking care of them.

287
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,670
My wife passed away quite early.

288
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,390
My son is afraid that I'll get lonely

289
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,240
and wanted me to live with him.

290
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,390
But I think that

291
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,960
the young folks have different habits
from us.

292
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,720
It's more comfortable living on my own.

293
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,270
Yes, yes.

294
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:51,910
So,

295
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,440
I live alone.

296
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,720
But living alone

297
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,080
has its downsides too.

298
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,240
Where there's nothing to do

299
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:57,960
at home

300
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,390
Other than watching TV

301
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,510
there's nothing else to it.

302
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,840
It makes me feel dumb just staring
at the screen all day.

303
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,120
That's why I decided to work as a
security guard.

304
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,390
Never would I imagine

305
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,240
that after looking for so long

306
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,270
the best candidate was right under my nose

307
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,150
yet I didn't notice.

308
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:14,840
Yes.

309
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,600
Mr. Cai, I'm telling you.

310
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,320
This elderly care project

311
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,720
is a very scientific approach to nursing homes.

312
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,630
We want to break

313
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,200
people's perception
of traditional nursing homes.

314
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,440
How about giving it a try?

315
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,750
You will not regret it.

316
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,510
I'll help you get checked in.

317
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,120
No...

318
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,600
I was just joking.

319
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,360
My son has a home, yet I won't live with him.

320
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,440
And live in a nursing home?

321
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,720
If my son found out, he'd scold me to death!

322
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,840
It's alright.

323
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,150
Talk it over with your family first.

324
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,630
If you're ever interested,
just let me know anytime.

325
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,150
How about that?

326
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,630
Alright. I was just joking.

327
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,440
I'll head out first.

328
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,120
Alright.

329
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,630
See you tomorrow.

330
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,840
See you tomorrow.

331
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,870
Don't worry about this stuff.

332
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,600
Thank you.

333
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,870
Zheng Jianhua's contract is being processed.

334
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,440
It should be delivered to the office next week.

335
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,030
Very well.

336
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,510
Five ex-wives with six kids...

337
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,790
if we can get hold of this case

338
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,750
It'll be a real milestone.

339
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,270
Yes.

340
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,790
By the way, Ms. Li,

341
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,320
the basic insurance policy

342
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
that our company is handling has expired.

343
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,360
Do you think I should

344
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,510
go talk to the insurance company

345
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,240
about renewing it?

346
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
No need. Cancel it.

347
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,150
Cancel it?

348
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,790
But why?

349
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,030
Originally, TSI slogan is that we focus
on annuities.

350
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,720
We brought in the basic insurance policies

351
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,030
mainly to attract clients.

352
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,320
But now,

353
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,600
this type of insurance

354
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,790
no longer aligns with our company's
development strategy.

355
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,150
That may be true,

356
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,080
but keeping this type of insurance

357
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,600
doesn't hurt us, does it?

358
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,910
The board has decided that

359
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,510
all employees in the company

360
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,030
must meet their sales target every quarter.

361
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
If we were to maintain such insurance,

362
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,550
our salespeople will try to exploit it.

363
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
Some might even

364
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,670
buy health insurance for themselves.

365
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,670
Besides,

366
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,440
at TSI, we serve high-end clients.

367
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,630
The image we project externally

368
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,120
must be highly professional.

369
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,320
But professionalism isn't just about
the size of the policy.

370
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,750
If not size, then what?

371
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,320
It's about our understanding of the insurance,

372
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,030
the solutions we provide to clients

373
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,600
and also the follow-up services we offer them.

374
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,750
Sharing such vision externally is fine

375
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,870
I have no problem with that.

376
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,480
But internally,

377
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,630
these are just empty talk.

378
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,270
When it comes to sales,

379
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,120
the fundamentals never change.

380
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,510
Money is the smartest thing.

381
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
Where it flows,

382
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,080
we follow

383
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,000
That's the smartest move.

384
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,910
We have to be profit-oriented.

385
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
The Changning District

386
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,600
The one in Changning District...

387
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,150
Today's the last day.

388
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,200
Still no one has signed up for a trial stay.

389
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,240
Chunlu,

390
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,790
once we're done here,

391
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,320
please take these back to the office.

392
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,030
I need to visit my dad.

393
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,750
I received several messages from his caregiver.

394
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,750
She said he's been acting up all day.

395
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:27,960
Alright.

396
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,510
Is he okay?

397
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
He's acting like a child now.

398
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,080
It should be fine.

399
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,720
Alright.

400
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,390
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

401
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:35,910
Thank you.

402
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,200
I'll help you pack up.

403
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,720
Alright.

404
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,750
Let's put all these away.

405
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,360
Okay.

406
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,670
Ms. Hu.

407
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,390
- Mr. Cai
- Everyone's gone.

408
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,440
Once we finish today,
we're going to wrap things up.

409
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,320
Thanks for all your hard work these past
few days.

410
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,030
I didn't help that much.

411
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
You still haven't found a candidate?

412
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,030
No.

413
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,440
The residents in this community

414
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,670
are way too cautious.

415
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,240
Probably because they've been scammed before.

416
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,870
Even a legitimate operation like ours
are being implicated.

417
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,510
Yeah.

418
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,590
Well, I'll be the good guy then.

419
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,590
How about I help you complete this task?

420
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,160
I told you before,

421
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,270
we're promoting this project

422
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,790
not just to complete some task.

423
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,720
Yeah, I know.

424
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,400
I went home one day

425
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,400
and I casually mentioned it to my son.

426
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,590
He was quite happy about it

427
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,880
and said he'd had this idea for a long time.

428
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,310
Just that he didn't know how to bring it up
with me.

429
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,790
Didn't you say your son would scold you?

430
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,310
This time he didn't

431
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,030
He said he's too busy

432
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,110
making money.

433
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,720
He can't take care of me,

434
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,550
and he feels guilty about it.

435
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,830
Turns out

436
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,310
he's been secretly looking into

437
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,830
several retirement communities.

438
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,160
And they're all quite nice.

439
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,880
He just didn't dare to tell me,
afraid I'd scold him.

440
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,440
and say that he's unfilial.

441
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,960
You've raised a good son.

442
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,830
He's promising.

443
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,440
He keeps up with the trend.

444
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,590
He'll definitely have a bright future.

445
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,110
So, how do I go about the procedure?

446
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,830
Get a physical check-up.

447
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,160
If everything's fine,

448
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,310
you have to go through the process,
and you can check in.

449
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,510
A physical check-up?

450
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,440
Yes.

451
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,110
If that's the case...

452
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,750
Alright.

453
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,750
Where should I get it done?

454
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,440
As long as it's a report from a facility
certified by the government,

455
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,350
We'll accept it.

456
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,510
Mr. Cai,

457
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,070
if you're interested,

458
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,720
why don't you fill out the form first?

459
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,480
Here, Mr. Cai.

460
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,920
Come, sit down while you fill it out.

461
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,310
Here's a pen.

462
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,200
Here, take a seat.

463
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240
Come, sit down and fill it out.

464
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,270
Fill in your name.

465
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,350
Gender.

466
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:41,590
Here you go.

467
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,070
Dad!

468
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,750
Have another bite.

469
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,590
I'm here.

470
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,160
Why were you looking for me?

471
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,960
What's so urgent?

472
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,440
Are you not feeling well?

473
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,640
Ms. Hu,

474
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,680
he talks about you all day.

475
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,270
He's not doing his rehab seriously,

476
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,510
and he's not eating properly either.

477
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,960
What's going on with you?

478
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,680
Didn't I tell you

479
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,830
I'm busy this month

480
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,590
Once I get through this, things will be fine.

481
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,160
Sorry

482
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,830
and thank you.

483
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,400
It's okay.

484
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,030
You two talk it out.

485
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,350
Okay, thank you.

486
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,790
What are you getting?

487
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,680
Here.

488
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,790
Why are you giving me money?

489
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,680
Go

490
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,510
and buy

491
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,070
a piece of cream cake.

492
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,240
You made me take a long ride

493
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,550
all the way from Puxi to Pudong

494
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,680
just to give me money

495
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,270
to help you buy a cake?

496
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,270
You can't eat it.

497
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,070
Your blood sugar level just got better.

498
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,160
Don't mess around.

499
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,440
I'm asking you to buy it for yourself.

500
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,350
It's for you.

501
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,720
Why would I eat a cake?

502
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,880
Today...

503
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,880
is your 40th birthday.

504
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,790
Have you forgotten?

505
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,000
What day is it today?

506
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,640
You're right.

507
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,110
Even I have forgotten it.

508
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,200
This is

509
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,240
a big deal.

510
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,830
I remember it clearly.

511
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,830
40 years old.

512
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,440
What's there to celebrate at 40? I'm old.

513
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,270
In my heart,

514
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,240
yo...you'll always be my little girl.

515
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,350
Other people might forget,

516
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:30,750
But I...

517
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,750
I...

518
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,160
I can't forget, right?

519
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,240
40 years old and still a young lady.

520
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,110
You're making me cry.

521
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,830
You really are...

522
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,880
Happy birthday to you...

523
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,640
Happy birthday to you...

524
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,590
Alright, stop crying.

525
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,590
Dad's the only one who's good to me.

526
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,640
I'll give you a kiss.

527
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,640
No, it's not.

528
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,640
It's not?

529
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
It's alright.

530
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,270
One, two, three.

531
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,110
Happy birthday!

532
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,750
Mom, don't turn on the light.

533
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,680
Happy birthday to you,

534
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Happy birthday to you,

535
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,590
Happy birthday to you,

536
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,590
Happy birthday to you.

537
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,510
Ms. Hu Manli,

538
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,000
welcome to the forties.

539
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,680
From now on, you're someone who's heading
into your fifties.

540
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,270
Dear bestie,

541
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,510
mind your words, will you?

542
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,680
Look,

543
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,200
we made this cake specially for you.

544
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,270
Make a wish!

545
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,680
You blew really hard!

546
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,200
Happy birthday!

547
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,270
Thank you.

548
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,590
This is my birthday gift for you.

549
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,790
Thank you.

550
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,720
You've really raised a thoughtful son.

551
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,880
He told me about your birthday

552
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,480
a week in advance,

553
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,160
and asked me to order this customized pizza
for you.

554
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,240
He said that

555
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,480
this is your favorite flavor.

556
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,720
He even told me to keep it a secret

557
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,000
because he wanted to give you a surprise.

558
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:16,880
Are you touched?

559
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,510
So this is my favorite flavor?

560
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,750
I think you're just craving it.

561
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,350
Next time, don't surprise me like that.

562
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,750
I'm getting older, and my heart can't take
surprises like that.

563
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,440
You're stubborn as always.

564
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,550
Who else would remember your birthday but us?

565
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,240
Am I right, Daer?

566
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,750
Plenty of people remember my birthday!

567
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,480
Like who?

568
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,920
The bank? Beauty salons? Insurance companies?

569
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,400
and even food delivery sites,
am I right?

570
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,030
Who said so?

571
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,880
My dad remembers my birthday!

572
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,640
And also...

573
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,160
And also my dad!

574
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,160
My dad sent you a birthday message, didn't he?

575
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,200
He told me about it.

576
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,160
You're a smart one, aren't you?

577
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,030
Come, take a seat.

578
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,240
Did your little brother get you anything?

579
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm an only child.

580
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,270
I don't have a little brother.

581
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,480
Xiaozhou wouldn't forget it, would he?

582
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,000
Quickly eat your pizza.

583
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,400
Then go finish your homework.

584
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,880
Seriously?

585
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,960
He didn't even send a "Happy Birthday"?

586
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,030
It makes sense.

587
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,440
I was very harsh the last time we spoke.

588
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,590
He probably never wants to see me again.

589
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,480
What's wrong?

590
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,880
Happy birthday.

591
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,590
What a beautiful cake.

592
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,000
It is.

593
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,920
I don't even know where to put the candles.

594
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,000
Then don't ruin it.

595
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,510
I already made a wish just now

596
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,590
and blew out the candles.

597
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,240
Alright then. Take it home and eat it
with Ding.

598
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,200
Thank you.

599
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,480
Oh, right.

600
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,160
Your birthday present.

601
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,750
There's a present too?

602
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,680
Thank you.

603
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,310
All you say is "Thank you"?

604
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,400
Are you not going to open it?

605
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
You really

606
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,510
went all out,

607
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,240
and tore them into pieces.

608
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,110
I worked really hard to put them back together.

609
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,720
Hu Manli,

610
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,070
I've figured it out.

611
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,160
I'll use

612
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,640
the method that you like to interact with you.

613
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,680
You think

614
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm not mature enough.

615
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,590
It's okay.

616
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,000
I'll work on it.

617
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:55,960
You said

618
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,240
you don't want to be in a relationship
right now.

619
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,880
That's fine too.

620
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,240
I can wait for you.

621
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,030
A year or two,

622
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,000
if not, then three years.

623
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,400
And even if it takes 5 years

624
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,240
I'll always be by your side.

625
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,480
Xiaozhou,

626
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,440
I'm 11 years older than you.

627
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,350
And I'll only keep aging.

628
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,790
You're already old.

629
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,400
Mind your words, will you?

630
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,510
It's my birthday today.

631
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,350
Or else you'll never close a deal in your life.

632
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,350
You're scolding me again.

633
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,400
The moonlight's so pretty tonight.

634
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,790
Maybe you should scold me a bit more.

635
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,070
That'll cost you.

636
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,000
Hu Manli, I still want to say this.

637
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm sorry.

638
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,070
In the past,

639
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,110
I've caused you quite a bit of trouble.

640
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,590
I also want to thank you
for teaching me so much.

641
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,350
No,

642
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,590
I should be the one thanking you.

643
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,920
During the hardest time in my life,

644
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,030
It was you who helped me through it.

645
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,510
Because of you,

646
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,350
when I look back into the past,

647
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,640
I can still smile.

648
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,000
We're still friends, aren't we?

649
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,720
I really like the present.

650
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,070
Thank you.

651
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,350
Good friend.

652
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,720
Let me ask you a question.

653
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,830
Go ahead.

654
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,550
Why did you decide to return to Blue Ocean?

655
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,400
Because...

656
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,640
I want to do the right thing.

657
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,240
I understand.

658
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,160
Ms. Hu,

659
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,200
there's something wrong with Mr. Cai's
medical report.

660
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,550
What is it?

661
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,160
Did he fail one of the health indicators?

662
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,480
The report is fake.

663
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,240
No way.

664
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,750
The underwriting department

665
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,110
hasn't confirmed it with me yet.

666
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,310
Ms. Hu,

667
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,680
you need to look into this carefully.

668
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,510
Insurance fraud is not a minor offense.

669
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,440
Right.

670
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,750
I'll investigate it.

671
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,030
I'll go find Mr. Cai right away.

672
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,510
Mr. Cai.

673
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,830
Ms. Hu.

674
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,920
You're here.

675
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,750
Are you here to notify me to get ready
to move in?

676
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,830
Mr. Cai,

677
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:24,830
the company says that there's a problem
with the medical report you provided.

678
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,720
What is it?

679
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,110
It hasn't been that long.

680
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,790
It's only been a year or two.

681
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
I'm in good health.

682
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,200
I walk over 10,000 steps a day
in the neighborhood.

683
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,110
Everyone knows that.

684
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,720
Mr. Cai,

685
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,590
our underwriting department

686
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,480
can access

687
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,030
your hospital records

688
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,310
Your health isn't as good as you said it is.

689
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,240
And it's not a small issue.

690
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,830
Concealing information to get insured,

691
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,550
can have serious consequences.

692
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,680
Insurance fraud is illegal.

693
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,550
It's just free accommodation,

694
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,790
do you have to make a big deal out of it?

695
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,240
I wasn't doing it for the free accommodation.

696
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,880
I only wanted to help you.

697
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,350
I appreciate your good intentions.

698
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,590
How about this?

699
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,310
Please come with me to the company

700
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,920
to explain the situation.

701
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,790
Let's try to minimize the consequences

702
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,000
and resolve the matter.

703
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm not going.

704
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,070
I didn't deceive you.

705
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,160
I don't need to explain anything.

706
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,160
Mr. Cai,

707
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,830
I don't know

708
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,110
why you choose to deceive me.

709
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,830
But during this time,

710
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,310
we've spent quite a bit of time together.

711
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,350
I know what kind of person you are.

712
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,750
You're honest and genuine.

713
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
If you're going through something difficult,
you can tell me.

714
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,680
Maybe I can help you.

715
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,110
It's stomach cancer.

716
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,440
How can you help me?

717
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,510
What did the doctor say?

718
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,680
It's incurable.

719
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,960
I can only live for at most one
or two years.

720
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,680
Take it slow.

721
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,920
You too.

722
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,590
Be careful.

723
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,200
It's okay.

724
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,160
Here.

725
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,070
This is it.

726
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,550
Please come in.

727
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,550
There's no window in this room

728
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,440
and the basement has poor ventilation.

729
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,440
Your health condition is not suitable
for living here.

730
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,070
Please have a seat.

731
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,030
Please sit.

732
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:22,920
Take a seat.

733
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,590
I've already lived here

734
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,440
for over 20 years.

735
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,590
I don't mind another year or two.

736
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,800
Ms. Hu,

737
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,880
I didn't go to the company to explain myself

738
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,110
mainly because I'm afraid that others
will find out about my illness,

739
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,440
and I'll lose my job.

740
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,070
Does your son know about your illness?

741
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,070
He'll know sooner or later.

742
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,550
You should tell him.

743
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,960
What good would that do?

744
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,590
He's not god.

745
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,880
Can he cure my illness?

746
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,440
Telling him will only add to his burden.

747
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,960
In the end, he'll lose both money and hope.

748
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:07,760
This at least

749
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,190
I know.

750
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,440
Don't say that.

751
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,000
If you're sick, you should treat it first.

752
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,630
Medical treatment is so advanced nowadays.

753
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,440
As long as the cancer cell hasn't spread,

754
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,550
there's still hope.

755
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,110
Ms. Hu,

756
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,710
I don't have social insurance.

757
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,510
Every penny I spend on treatment,

758
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,320
comes out of my own pocket.

759
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,030
To have lived until today...

760
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:29,800
Honestly,

761
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,280
I'm kind of proud of myself.

762
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,440
My children

763
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,840
are all married and have their careers now.

764
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,670
They even have kids of their own.

765
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,070
Even if I die now,

766
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,440
I'd be at peace.

767
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,800
But I feel aggrieved.

768
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,230
I've been struggling in Shanghai
for over 20 years.

769
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,000
Yet I didn't manage to make any money.

770
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,630
I've been living in this basement
the whole time.

771
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,030
All I hoped for

772
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,110
before I die

773
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,760
is to live in

774
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,800
a room with a window.

775
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,710
That would be enough for me.

776
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,840
So I...

777
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,320
So you deceived us.

778
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,550
You're good to your son

779
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,630
but cruel to strangers...

780
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,710
Say whatever you want.

781
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,630
I'm already

782
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,030
on the verge of death.

783
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,880
I don't care what others think of me.

784
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,510
All my life

785
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,880
I've worked honestly

786
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,030
and lived with integrity.

787
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,800
I should be considered a good person, right?

788
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:24,550
But...

789
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,800
how did I end up like this?

790
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,280
Everything is fake.

791
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,320
Before I die...

792
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,880
if only

793
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,920
I could enjoy a few good days.

794
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,630
Even criminals who are to be executed,

795
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,510
get to eat a good last meal,

796
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,590
don't they?

797
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,400
To tell you the truth,

798
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
when you first came to our neighborhood
to promote your project,

799
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,110
When I saw your

800
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,800
nursing home poster,

801
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,920
I was captivated by it.

802
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,710
Such a nice room.

803
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,880
A sunny bedroom with windows,

804
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,150
and lush greenery outside.

805
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,590
I thought to myself right then,

806
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,230
if I could just

807
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,000
spend one night in a room like that

808
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,110
and die the next day,

809
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,550
I'd have no regrets.

810
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,920
Mr. Cai,

811
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,280
you can tell me about your thoughts.

812
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,510
Telling even the Emperor wouldn't help.

813
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,230
A person's entire life

814
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,800
it's all for one word:

815
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,230
Money.

816
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
If you don't make money,

817
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,840
all your efforts

818
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,510
will be wasted

819
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,110
and your whole life will have no meaning.

820
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,800
Today,

821
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,190
I want to share a story with all of you.

822
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,840
"The Last Window of Life"

823
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,800
Everyone has dreams.

824
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,070
Some people

825
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,710
hope to achieve fame and success;

826
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,550
Some

827
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,110
wants to earn big money

828
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,400
And some people,

829
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,030
just want to be safe and healthy.

830
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,630
A few days ago,

831
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,880
I heard of a heartbreaking dream.

832
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,880
It's about someone

833
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,030
who struggled in this city for over 20 years,

834
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,880
living in a basement

835
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,760
for half a lifetime.

836
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,230
He has a terminal illness.

837
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,070
His dream

838
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,760
is that in the time he has left

839
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,150
he could live in a room with a window.

840
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,070
Alright, no problem.

841
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,960
I'll go welcome him in a bit.

842
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,710
Mr. Zhang has instructed it.

843
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:55,480
Come in.

844
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,110
Okay.

845
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,230
You owe me a meal.

846
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,670
It's settled then.

847
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:08,880
Alright, you're welcome

848
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,710
Goodbye.

849
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,000
Xiaozhou,

850
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,710
if your father could see what
you've achieved today,

851
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,920
he would be so proud of you.

852
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,000
Come, have a seat.

853
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,480
Say,

854
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,670
why are you here?

855
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,710
I believe you've heard

856
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,030
about Zhig's situation.

857
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,670
Xiaozhou, you know a lot of people.

858
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,480
Your dad's company needs your help.

859
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,590
Just two million yuan

860
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,360
and the institution won't sue the company.

861
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,190
This amount is only a drop in the bucket,

862
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,800
for your clients.

863
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:53,920
Qiu Lisu,

864
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,070
you still owe me money, remember?

865
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,360
You said 3 million a month.

866
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,230
In the end, I only received
three hundred thousand yuan.

867
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,400
I haven't even asked you to pay that back.

868
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,760
If I had any other way,

869
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,150
I wouldn't be here begging you.

870
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,510
As long as you help Zhig get through
this crisis,

871
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,760
I'll pay you back.

872
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,710
I think you're quite pitiful,

873
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,190
really.

874
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,000
Are you going to scold me on behalf of Hu Manli?

875
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:19,960
It's fine.

876
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,550
I've heard worse throughout the years.

877
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,280
Go ahead and scold me.

878
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,400
This has nothing to do with her.

879
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,320
It's just that you want too much.

880
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You want money,

881
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,190
love,

882
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,630
reputation,

883
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,110
and to prove to the world that Qiu Lisu
is capable.

884
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,510
You think you deserve to have it all.

885
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,510
Isn't living like this

886
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,360
truly exhausting?

887
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,840
Xue Xiaozhou

888
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,800
you can say that I have no morals.

889
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,070
I chose this path,

890
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,670
so I don't care what others think.

891
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,440
But you cannot deny my ability,

892
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,510
my value.

893
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,670
When your dad was at his lowest,

894
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,440
I was the one who stuck with him through it.

895
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,670
After he passed away,

896
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,190
I was the only one who support Zhig alone.

897
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,800
Even until now,

898
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,150
I know you hate me

899
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:13,840
and loathe me,

900
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,150
but I can still stand here

901
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,920
to be you

902
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,510
What dignity,

903
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,440
what pride,

904
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,440
if I can save the company

905
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,320
I'm willing to give it all up.

906
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:27,920
Fine then.

907
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,880
Let's

908
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,670
talk business.

909
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,550
Alright.

910
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,070
Our house

911
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,030
were taken by you.

912
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,150
You took it to fill the company's hole.

913
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,150
My dad's inheritance was used up too.

914
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,880
Now you're asking me for two million yuan?

915
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,440
Fine, what about next time?

916
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,440
Three million yen?

917
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,670
And the time after that, 5 million?

918
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,760
Qiu Lisu, have you ever

919
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,800
considered this.

920
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,320
If a company

921
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,840
has to rely on constant infusion

922
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,150
just to survive,

923
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,400
Shouldn't you consider

924
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,440
pulling the plug?

925
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,550
That way, you'd be free too.

926
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,030
You're not going to help?

927
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,920
Ding Zhiyuan is going to divorce me.

928
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,550
Actually, both of them

929
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,840
have been thinking of reconciling.

930
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,670
For a women like that,

931
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:32,590
is it really worth it?

932
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,030
Everyone

933
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,400
eventually has to pay

934
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,230
for their choices.

935
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,230
I still have matters to attend to.

936
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,320
Lingling,

937
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,960
see her out for me.

938
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:51,400
Madam,

939
