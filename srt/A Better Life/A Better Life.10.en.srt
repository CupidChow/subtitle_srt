00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,000
I need to confront him.

196
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,720
Count of three.

197
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,600
One,

198
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,080
two...

199
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,870
And.

200
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,600
I'll talk to you

201
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,750
later.

202
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,870
She's mad now.

203
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,000
I,

204
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,720
tomorrow,

205
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,790
we talk this out.

206
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,960
Ding Zhiyuan,

207
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,840
such a bastard.

208
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
He lived off you

209
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,150
all these years.

210
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,840
Now you drove you away.

211
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,720
What a jerk.

212
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,080
Why are you here?

213
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,440
I

214
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,750
wanted to visit him.

215
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,790
Thought

216
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,240
he might've finished my

217
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,870
medicinal liquor.

218
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,440
I'd bring him some more.

219
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,150
I didn't know you guys separated.

220
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,510
You're a fool.

221
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,030
I was so mad.

222
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,510
Sorry, Dad.

223
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,720
I embarrassed you.

224
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,670
It's not your fault.

225
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,630
I just feel bad for you.

226
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,120
You sell insurance all these years.

227
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,550
You forgot to get any protection

228
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,790
for your own marriage.

229
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,510
Where to get that protection?

230
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,270
You're right.

231
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,910
Polices keep your money,

232
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,600
but no people.

233
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,360
What did you just say?

234
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,390
You're a fool?

235
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,790
After that.

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,360
Polices keep your money, but no people.

237
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,270
Degong,

238
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,960
I think you did something right today.

239
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,000
Really?

240
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,320
I'll come back tomorrow.

241
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,030
You wish. Think you work here?

242
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,200
Just this once.

243
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,000
OK, OK.

244
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
That jerk.

245
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,270
I mean, you...

246
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,910
Why did you call him?

247
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,150
I didn't.

248
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,750
I,

249
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,120
I am worry.

250
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,360
Don't talk, OK?

251
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,870
I'll get you a cab home.

252
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,270
Talk on the phone later. Now go.

253
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,000
He's walking to us.

254
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,870
I know. Go.

255
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,240
How do you...

256
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,750
Don't worry. Don't come to me.

257
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,440
OK.

258
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,600
Your dad tricked and canceled on me.

259
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,910
You were behind all of this.

260
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,630
You didn't have to go this low

261
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,670
to make me cooperate.

262
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,390
You misunderstood.

263
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,440
Let me explain.

264
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,390
Xiaozhou.

265
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,440
Hungry? I'll treat you to something.

266
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,960
There's a nice restaurant nearby.

267
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,600
Let's go.

268
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,270
Good boy.

269
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,150
Don't touch me.

270
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,720
Sit down.

271
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,000
My treat.

272
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,360
Order whatever you like.

273
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,630
You go on.

274
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,390
This is the last time.

275
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,000
You're not thinking clearly.

276
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,630
Don't make decisions when you're mad.

277
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,390
Eat first.

278
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,440
Miss?

279
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,030
Menu.

280
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,440
OK.

281
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:55,840
Thanks.

282
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,390
Check out the menu.

283
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,600
What do you like?

284
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,670
Manli, you need money.

285
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,630
So do I.

286
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,360
It's me who can't have an order now.

287
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,790
I'm being bullied at the company.

288
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,510
Who's bullying you?

289
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:12,870
Tell me.

290
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,720
I'll screw them up.

291
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,750
Listen.

292
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,870
I met various events working with you.

293
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,270
Book meeting with a VIP.

294
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,550
Detective to get a con man.

295
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,670
Being fooled by your dad.

296
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,390
OK.

297
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,550
Now.

298
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
I'm the last.

299
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,600
And they want me to

300
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,000
apologize in this.

301
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,870
I am the last.

302
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,320
Funny?

303
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,840
Pretty cute.

304
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,910
Wear it then.

305
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,200
You won't lose a thing.

306
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,240
Hey, the material feels nice.

307
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,670
What's wrong with you?

308
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,910
Stop making fun out of it.

309
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,000
You don't have to wear this.

310
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,720
Hey, you won't be mad if I wear this?

311
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,870
Do you dare?

312
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,390
You want me to

313
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,200
post photos in this,

314
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,790
or videos,

315
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,080
or take a walk in the mall?

316
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,750
Whatever.

317
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,030
Put it on now if you dare.

318
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,360
OK, I will.

319
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,750
Go on.

320
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,270
Hey, you're serious?

321
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,030
Take it off.

322
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:33,550
Off.

323
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,440
- Fits me?
- Don't!

324
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,080
You.

325
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,600
Hey.

326
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,360
Why is she wearing that?

327
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,510
Miss.

328
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,630
Coming.

329
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,670
What's this?

330
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,600
Pho.

331
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,670
Pho, is it nice?

332
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,440
Yes.

333
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,790
Xiaozhou.

334
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,720
We'll have this, OK?

335
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,510
Coming.

336
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,670
I'll have this.

337
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,360
This one?

338
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,720
Go check the menu.

339
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,120
OK.

340
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,600
Here.

341
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,390
Which one is it?

342
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,510
This.

343
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,550
This?

344
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,360
Yes, Pho.

345
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,960
This looks nice.

346
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,600
Take a look.

347
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,030
Take a look.

348
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,360
Five flavors.

349
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,320
Check them out.

350
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,200
Which one?

351
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,670
Whatever.

352
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,200
No whatever.

353
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,030
Th-that one.

354
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,120
OK, two portions of this.

355
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,750
Two?

356
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,120
Don't make mine too spicy.

357
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,030
Anything else?

358
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,270
Anything else?

359
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:21,790
No.

360
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,670
OK.

361
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,360
- Thanks…
- Coming.

362
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,240
You done? Sit down.

363
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,960
Sit.

364
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,840
What's wrong with you?

365
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,000
I've put it on.

366
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,000
Now about my dad,

367
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,360
can you forgive me?

368
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,240
OK, take it off first.

369
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,120
Embarrassing.

370
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,270
I've found a solution

371
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,550
to Ms. Zhou's policy.

372
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,630
It's up to you

373
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,600
to take her order or not.

374
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,750
Thanks.

375
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,960
We think

376
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,320
Ms. Zhou should

377
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,000
have an increasing death benefit

378
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,750
with 1 million.

379
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,390
Such low rate.

380
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,320
Anything higher?

381
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,150
It also says

382
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,840
I can only withdraw all the money

383
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,240
after the insured died.

384
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,750
Manli, the annuity product I bought

385
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,270
from you has a higher rate.

386
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,670
When it expired,

387
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,960
money was transferred automatically.

388
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,600
This.

389
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
It's not...

390
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,240
Be patient.

391
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,870
Hear him out.

392
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,360
On surface,

393
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,320
it isn't perfect policy for Ms. Zhou.

394
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,270
But pay attention to the beneficiary.

395
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,390
We suggest

396
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,630
the beneficiary be

397
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,840
Ms. Sun's daughter and Dong.

398
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,200
What does it mean

399
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,550
to have two beneficiaries?

400
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,630
Generally,

401
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,600
after you pass away,

402
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,150
all the money

403
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,750
will go to your third generation

404
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,240
and Dong.

405
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:24,870
Mom.

406
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,000
I still want an

407
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,150
education annuity for my daughter.

408
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,150
What about Dong?

409
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,840
Calm down, everyone.

410
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,840
You don't know what you want.

411
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:37,750
Jie,

412
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,630
you don't want somebody

413
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,790
swindling everything out of Ms. Zhou.

414
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,750
Yes.

415
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,150
Dong is not a swindler.

416
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,870
Yes, yes, Mom.

417
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,790
I trust you on that.

418
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,120
I know he's

419
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,270
serious about you.

420
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,720
But I have to be honest with you.

421
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,390
People change.

422
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,080
They divorce.

423
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,000
That's right.

424
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,550
Just between us.

425
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,400
My husband cheated on me,

426
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,960
and we separated.

427
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,640
I can't figure out why.

428
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,030
We dated of our free will.

429
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,590
Why did he change

430
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,590
and leave so decisively?

431
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,550
Here's my opinion.

432
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,680
You're happy with Dong now

433
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,720
and hope to spend your lives together.

434
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,070
So you want an insurance plan for him.

435
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,880
But in case,

436
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,720
just in case,

437
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,880
you guys break up

438
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
after you get the plan,

439
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,550
you'll be losing both him and the money.

440
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,000
Can you take it?

441
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:50,790
Well.

442
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,680
I was worried about that.

443
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,550
You know?

444
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,070
So much younger.

445
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,200
Ms. Sun.

446
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,680
That's why we set the beneficiaries

447
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,720
Dong and Ms. Zhou's third generation.

448
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,350
You can divide between yourselves.

449
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,000
And as long as Ms. Zhou is still around,

450
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
she can change the beneficiary anytime.

451
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,160
He said a lot.

452
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,310
Let me summarize.

453
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,920
He means

454
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,960
you're the one

455
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,270
in charge of this plan.

456
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,160
Yes.

457
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,640
This is good.

458
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,310
Mom.

459
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,880
If he ever leaves you,

460
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,030
we change the plan.

461
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,000
Dong isn't someone like that.

462
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,920
I know him.

463
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,270
Just in case...

464
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm worried

465
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,720
if I'm gone,

466
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,440
what is he going to do?

467
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,680
Ms. Zhou.

468
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,200
Look, with this EverTogether plan,

469
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,030
we just want you to live a long life.

470
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,550
The longer you live,

471
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,880
for 120 years,

472
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,680
the more money he gets.

473
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
120.

474
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,070
Aren't I a monster then?

475
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,830
There's a condition.

476
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,160
If Dong wants to be

477
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
a beneficiary,

478
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,830
you guys need to get married.

479
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,240
It's required by law.

480
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,720
Or we can't approve the plan.

481
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,590
Yes, he's right.

482
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,720
If you buy insurance for your mistress,

483
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,720
you transfer assets during marriage.

484
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,350
People will point fingers at us.

485
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,070
We were just planning.

486
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,440
Why look at me?

487
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,920
I agree. As long as you're happy.

488
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,640
Hear that?

489
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,830
She wants you happy.

490
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,030
How was that?

491
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,510
Just so-so.

492
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,030
Don't be mad at me anymore.

493
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,440
Look, you've got your order.

494
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,270
And I've put that shirt on.

495
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,510
About my dad.

496
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,510
I told him to ignore you.

497
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,550
He acted on his own.

498
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,310
None of my business.

499
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,720
But

500
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,960
why is your dad on your book too?

501
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,960
He's my client of course.

502
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,160
A reference when I go through plans.

503
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,720
Guess your dad helps you

504
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,310
trick people a lot.

505
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,790
You set me up.

506
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,920
I split commission with you.

507
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,590
Can't you let go of my dad's matter?

508
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,720
Who split with whom?

509
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,030
I have the certificate.

510
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,750
The commission goes to my card.

511
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,750
Anything to do with you?

512
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,920
What do you mean?

513
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,960
You won't split?

514
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,920
I warn you.

515
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,750
We have an agreement.

516
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,440
Legally effective.

517
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,790
You can sue me, anytime.

518
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,200
Hey, don't joke on that.

519
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,400
Didn't you say?

520
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,550
The court is full of people.

521
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,960
Even if you win the case,

522
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,750
when it's executed,

523
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,030
I will have spent all the money.

524
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,590
We'll see.

525
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,400
Xue Xiaozhou.

526
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,640
You stoop so low too.

527
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,720
Too?

528
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,640
Like you?

529
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,590
You couldn't do this without me.

530
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,640
I admit.

531
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,590
But it's already done.

532
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,160
What can you do?

533
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,790
You're acting.

534
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,110
You returned my secret book.

535
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,790
I knew that

536
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,830
you have principles, moral standards.

537
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,440
You're not a traitor.

538
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,590
I am.

539
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,200
Feels nice to be played?

540
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,440
I knew I was right.

541
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
Sorry.

542
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,590
I'll avenge you

543
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,720
on my dad.

544
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,830
Xiaozhou.

545
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,030
Tell me when commission arrives.

546
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,590
Anything missing?

547
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,270
Medicine chest.

548
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,880
Just one night.

549
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,960
Can I catch a cold?

550
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,720
Weather changes.

551
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,590
You need it.

552
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,440
Let me see.

553
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,270
Cold pills...

554
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,680
Just one day.

555
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,510
You made me look like I'm moving.

556
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,830
Can't be too careful.

557
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,070
I was the one preparing.

558
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,400
Let's go.

559
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,790
Up. OK.

560
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,880
Put on your shoes.

561
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,720
Hold on.

562
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,110
I'll check the gas.

563
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,000
Thought you did.

564
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,550
Check twice.

565
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,830
Let's go.

566
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,240
Go.

567
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:16,960
OK.

568
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,960
Zhiyuan, Li Fendou runs this club.

569
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:40,960
Li Fendou?

570
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Fendou used to run stalls

571
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,310
with his wife.

572
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,160
He had those harsh days.

573
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,310
When he got rich, he bought shops

574
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,240
and buildings.

575
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,960
Then he educated himself on books.

576
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,350
So he opened this club,

577
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,240
getting all classy and elegant.

578
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,030
He just wants to talk to

579
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,960
scholars like you.

580
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,960
Ms. Qiu.

581
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,000
Here.

582
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,750
Zhiyuan.

583
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,590
I heard

584
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,000
your grades are among the top 100.

585
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,880
I was lucky.

586
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,750
You're modest.

587
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,510
His dad is a professor.

588
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,270
What's it called?

589
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,000
Life father, like son.

590
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,270
Done?

591
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:38,960
OK.

592
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,240
Got this.

593
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,510
Let me.

594
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,590
Thanks.

595
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,400
His dad didn't come.

596
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,960
Busy with work.

597
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,640
Are professors all like that?

598
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,110
They work on weekends?

599
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,510
Let me tell you.

600
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,790
My husband, Shiyan's dad.

601
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,240
It's his boss's birthday today.

602
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,030
Then?

603
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,510
He said, "My girl has a class event,

604
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,270
I have to go."

605
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,720
So he did.

606
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,200
Good parent.

607
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,400
It's hard.

608
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,960
He has to come, right?

609
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,000
He has to.

610
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,550
Dad.

611
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,070
Here.

612
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,350
Mom.

613
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,590
Mom.

614
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,720
Dad's here.

615
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,510
Slower.

616
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,590
I've got a lot of stuff.

617
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,680
All your favorites.

618
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,070
Prof. Ding.

619
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,720
Hi.

620
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,510
Hello.

621
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,590
I'm Shiyan's mom.

622
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,200
Shiyan and Dare are such good friends.

623
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,400
And.

624
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,070
We're all your fans.

625
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,310
Your book is amazing.

626
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,350
Shiyan is your little fan.

627
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,590
We're your middle-aged fans.

628
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,160
Mom.

629
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,440
Thank you.

630
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,400
Can I add you on WhatsApp?

631
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,680
May I?

632
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,590
Sorry.

633
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,030
Here's my number.

634
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:53,750
OK.

635
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,590
It's done.

636
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,270
Nice.

637
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,000
Since he's here,

638
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,270
I'm off.

639
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,720
Bye.

640
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,400
Thank you.

641
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,070
Welcome.

642
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,310
So suddenly?

643
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,320
[Dad, you're not coming to camp?]

644
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
[Inappropriate.]

645
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,860
[But you're my dad.]

646
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,270
I

647
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,000
have to thank you for this.

648
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,440
I came

649
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,270
because of my son.

650
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,720
That's enough.

651
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:21,920
How is it?

652
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,440
I've convinced Mr. Li.

653
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,510
What did you say?

654
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,160
I said

655
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,070
something came up at his class,

656
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,830
he has to be responsible.

657
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,830
Is Li mad?

658
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,110
Not that I could see.

659
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,830
I mentioned to his assistant

660
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,070
if the rent could be reduced,

661
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,960
he ignored.

662
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,790
Hu Manli just

663
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,110
keeps ruining my plans.

664
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,550
Great.

665
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,400
Come on.

666
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,350
Here.

667
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,160
Yummy.

668
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:57,830
Have some meat.

669
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,000
OK. There you go.

670
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,510
Manli.

671
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,680
You're only 39.

672
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,070
You gave birth to Ding young.

673
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,000
We should be of same age.

674
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,590
Ding's 13.

675
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,240
I gave birth to him at 26.

676
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,240
People don't have babies this young now.

677
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,110
Yes.

678
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,680
Right.

679
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,200
I'm curious.

680
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,070
How did you meet Prof. Ding?

681
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,920
How?

682
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,310
Classmates, right?

683
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,510
Weren't you?

684
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,440
Met him when I was selling insurance.

685
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,640
Really?

686
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,270
You could really do that?

687
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,030
Who asked whom out first?

688
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,240
So gossipy.

689
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,030
No need to ask.

690
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,000
Dad must've pestered Mom.

691
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,640
Hey.

692
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,920
What?

693
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,070
Mom is pretty and earns a lot.

694
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,000
She must've had a bunch of admirers.

695
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,070
Could Dad have chance

696
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,000
if he didn't try hard?

697
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,960
Have meat.

698
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,590
Everyone,

699
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,440
buy insurance from my mom.

700
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,550
She's amazing,

701
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,960
only selling to big bosses.

702
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,920
Stop.

703
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,790
OK.

704
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,110
I'm so embarrassed.

705
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,200
It's fine.

706
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,030
I like Ding's character.

707
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,200
Outgoing.

708
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,830
Only a harmonious family

709
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,200
raises

710
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,880
such a kid.

711
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,960
Yes.

712
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,880
So you mean I have a bad character

713
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,440
because you and Dad always fight?

714
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,510
Nosy.

715
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,030
Eat.

716
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,270
Eat up.

717
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,920
Look at Ding.

718
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,880
So sweet.

719
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,640
He unscrewed the cap for his mom.

720
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,720
OMG.

721
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,920
My son just knows how to piss me off.

722
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,640
But you said.

723
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,000
Do it, yourself.

724
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,200
That's all you remember?

725
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:40,750
Mrs. Chen.

726
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,110
Have some juice.

727
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,920
Thanks.

728
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,000
Ding Daer, you driving

729
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,350
a wedge between me and my mom?

730
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,680
No.

731
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,510
Come on.

732
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,640
Have some.

733
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,160
Have meat.

734
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:51,790
Bro.

735
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,590
Thanks.

736
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,270
Ding Daer.

737
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,440
Someone wants your dad.

738
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,440
The meat really is salty.

739
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,880
Want this?

740
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,640
Fruits.

741
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,240
How come you're here?

742
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,640
Zhiyuan.

743
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,590
You left in a hurry.

744
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,550
Forgot your earbuds.

745
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,960
You'll lose sleep

746
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,110
without them.

747
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,790
Who's she?

748
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,000
Sorry.

749
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
I came uninvited.

750
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,550
I'm Prof. Ding's friend.

751
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,200
How do you know

752
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,880
he wears earbuds during sleep?

753
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,720
Stop.

754
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,200
What is that question?

755
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,160
Make her go.

756
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,270
He's a kid.

757
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,310
Sorry.

758
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,030
Let me introduce.

759
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,350
Qiu Lisu.

760
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,240
Zhiyuan's girlfriend.

761
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,030
We separated some time ago.

762
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,590
Thank you

763
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,550
for giving me him today

764
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,440
to be a, father.

765
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,310
You're welcome.

766
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,720
Parents will always be parents.

767
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,070
Ding.

768
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,790
Have fun while you're here.

769
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,960
Meat is burnt.

770
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,720
Look.

771
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,310
Don't you want it?

772
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,200
Quick, pick it up.

773
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,790
Meat is ready.

774
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,030
Have some.

775
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,750
Your bowl?

776
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,550
Bring the fruits.

777
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,880
That's right.

778
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,240
I have my bowl.

779
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,440
This is ready too.

780
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,030
Careful.

781
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,000
Now.

782
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,400
Leave.

783
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,590
Come on.

784
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,350
How sweet.

785
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:06,920
Get me some.

786
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,200
Have veggies.

787
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,270
Get me some pizza.

788
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,270
Grapes are sweet.

789
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,000
Have some.

790
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,550
How should I pay?

791
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,640
On the phone.

792
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,160
OK.

793
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:28,960
Here.

794
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,030
Done. Please check.

795
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:35,880
OK.

796
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,160
I've charged you 3,999.

797
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,350
Wait a moment.

798
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,310
I'll get you a new bag of cat food.

799
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:41,920
Thanks.

800
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,270
You won't react to me?

801
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,280
[Last family trip. We separated.]

802
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,030
Zhiyuan.

803
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,680
I wanted

804
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,590
to give them to you quietly.

805
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,590
The kid

806
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,590
dragged me to that whole crowd.

807
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,920
I didn't ask you to come back.

808
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,270
I wanted you to camp with your kid.

809
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,720
What should I do?

810
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,240
Sitting there, being laughed at.

811
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,960
It's OK.

812
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,880
I don't want her to flaunt you.

813
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,680
Lisu, I'll get this straight.

814
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,550
Manli and I separated,

815
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,720
but I'm still a father.

816
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:56,830
In the future,

817
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,830
I'll have to meet Manli.

818
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,240
So

819
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,000
I don't this to happen again.

820
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,400
OK?

821
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,920
Sure.

822
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,440
No next time.

823
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,590
By the way.

824
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,710
You stood Mr. Li up.

825
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,630
What to do then?

826
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,630
He's mad?

827
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,710
No.

828
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,960
I made up an excuse for you.

829
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,110
Shall we treat him to dinner some time?

830
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,280
As an apology?

831
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,510
I'll pass on that.

832
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,230
We just can't seem to meet up.

833
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,440
That means

834
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,590
we are destined be strangers.

835
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,760
But...

836
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,550
OK, that's all.

837
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,590

no fancy cream can save me.

864
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,960

What about your admirer' flowers again?

868
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,630
As usual.

869
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,760
I'll distribute them to patients.

870
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,510
OK.

00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,670
A whole month.

873
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,400
Never the same flowers.

874
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,000

875
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,840
Seriously.

876
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,360
Aren't you touched?

877
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,400
So sleepy

878
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
after my night shift.

879
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,590
I'll go home to sleep.

880
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,590
Bye.

881
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,070
Bye.

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,590
So cute.

885
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,110
You bought it?

886
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,880
Arrived last night.

887
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,840
Wanted to surprise you.

888
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,840
Do you like it?

889
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,920
Yes.

890
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,800
But it's costly.

891
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,510
Why did you spend such a fortune?

892
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,190
I had my first commission.

893
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,000
30,000!

894
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,590
Even got extra after paying my bills.

895
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,360
Really?

896
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,550
You made it.

897
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,920
You really did.

898
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,630
The worst days

899
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,400
are gone.

900
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,230
Name it.

901
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,710
Name.

902
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,510
Should we

903
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,190
name it Baodan (policy)?

904
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,190
Baodan?

905
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,110
Yes.

906
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,630
You bought it with your

907
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,070
first policy's commission.

908
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,440
Cats bring fortunes.

909
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Hope Baodan

910
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,440
brings you more policies.

911
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,800
Such utilitarianism?

912
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,710
It's called hope.

913
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,550
OK, Baodan then.

914
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,030
Call her mom.

915
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,880
It's a cat.

916
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,280
No, it's our kid from now on.

917
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,760
Baodan.

918
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,400
She'll give you something yummy.

919
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,280
Come on.

920
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,840
Did it call you Mom?

921
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,590
It's meow.

922
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,320
Not Mom.

923
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:10,920
I don't care.

924
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,510
It'll be our mom onwards.

925
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,400
No.

926
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,710
Onwards,

927
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,510
you're its mom.

928
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm its dad.

929
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,030
We're a happy family.

930
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:20,550
Hold it.

931
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,030
Let me see.

932
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,710
Baodan.

933
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,320
You're looking for me?

934
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,590
What is it?

935
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,880
About the last job,

936
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,110
I quit.

937
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,590
Why?

938
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,760
Salary is low.

939
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,320
OK.

940
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,230
I'll find another one for you.

941
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,000
No need.

942
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,670
I can't make a fortune

943
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,360
working for others.

944
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,590
I'm

945
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,360
about to invest in some business with

946
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,280
my friends.

947
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,280
So

948
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,840
I want some

949
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,590
starting capitals.

950
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:05,590
How much?

951
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,590
30,000?

952
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,800
Three million.

953
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,070
How,

954
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,440
how much?

955
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,800
You heard it right.

956
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,760
Three million.

957
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,880
I visited your gallery.

958
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
All the stuff there is

959
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,440
worth millions.

960
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,880
Don't think three million

961
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,110
matters to you.

962
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,710
We're just art agents.

963
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,320
We only earn commission.

964
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,590
You won't give it to me?

965
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:46,840
OK.

966
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,030
I'll go to your son.

967
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,030
See if my brother has the money.

968
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,670

00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,340
♫That world feels close just the same♫

973
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,740
♫If I dare to face the dawn♫

974
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,460
♫Do you know this face you'd drawn♫

975
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,260
♫Gray spirals looped in endless chase♫

976
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,060
♫Tracing tears not words they trace♫

977
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,820
♫How many times must this repeat♫

978
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,340
♫Sighs pull my gaze to retreat♫

979
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,180
♫Sleepless nights, risks untold♫

980
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,980
♫None of it for my own soul♫

981
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,420
♫Winds blew, rains poured♫

982
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,300
♫Umbrellas broke, we soared♫

983
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,380
♫Sky fell, ground shook♫

984
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,900
♫Through dusk till dawn I stood♫

985
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,860
♫Cars passed, dreams drowned♫

986
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:05,260
♫Every stop's chain unbound♫

987
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,300
♫Moon watched, stars blazed♫

988
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,180
♫Lamps died, connections phased♫

989
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,300
♫Held hands, laughed then cried♫

990
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,580
♫Hearts froze, parts died inside♫

991
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,220
♫Tried hard, spoke true♫

992
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,220
♫Now I'm someone I never knew♫

993
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,220
♫Love came, hate stayed♫

994
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,740
♫I arrived, you frayed♫

995
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,100
♫Voice cracked, tears burned♫

996
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
♫Life lost, lessons earned♫

997
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,700
♫Grew up, let go♫

998
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,700
♫Why cling to old sorrow♫

999
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,060
♫How many loops replay♫

1000
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,740
♫Sighs steal my gaze away♫

1001
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,260
♫Lost nights, bold bets♫

1002
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,900
♫Nothing for my regrets♫

1003
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,300
♫Winds raged, storms crashed♫

1004
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,980
♫Dawns broke, I held fast♫

1005
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,100
♫Cars fled, dreams fled♫

1006
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:11,580
♫Every route left dead♫

1007
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,100
♫Love left, hate stayed♫

1008
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,980
♫Voice gone, tears paid♫

1009
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,620
♫Grew strong, moved on♫

1010
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,620
♫Why dwell when it's gone♫
