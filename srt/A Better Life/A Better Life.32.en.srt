40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Episode 32

41
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,640
You and Mom worked

42
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,400
yourselves to the bone to make money.

43
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,590
Before long,

44
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,870
we moved into a bigger house,

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,350
had a car,

46
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,760
a helper, and a nanny,

47
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,430
but

48
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,510
Mom was gone.

49
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,280
Keke,

50
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,760
why do you think

51
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,950
your mom worked so hard?

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,190
She did it just for you.

53
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,910
I don't need it!

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,870
I don't need my mom to get stomach cancer
from drinking and socializing!

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,360
I don't need her to be sick

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,710
and put off going to the doctor.

57
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,150
I don't need her that when the cancer was found,

58
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,590
it was already late-stage and spread.

59
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,840
I want to go back to when I was little,

60
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,280
when the whole family squeezed
into one bed at night.

61
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,150
Mom would be doing needlework,

62
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,840
you were keeping the accounts,

63
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,800
and I was lying on the bed doing homework.

64
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
That was what home felt like for me.

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,680
I know we can never go back to that,

66
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,080
and that’s why

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,910
I wanted to open this little shop.

68
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,470
I just want to fill

69
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,960
that missing piece in my heart, in my own way.

70
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,360
Yuki, don't be sad.

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,960
I'd like to say a few words for your father.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
As a child,

73
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,520
there are a lot of things you just can’t understand,

74
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,120
you know?

75
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,000
The things your dad worries about

76
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,280
might not make sense to you right now.,

77
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,470
but no matter what,

78
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,800
his intentions were good.

79
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,560
He did it all because he loves you,

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,000
okay?

81
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:34,750
Dad,

82
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,030
if you do care about me,

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,430
then you must respect how I want to live my life.

84
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,910
I really want to respect the life you want,

85
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,360
but do you even know what kind of life

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,000
that is?

87
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,630
That’s a fairy tale!

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,430
Does that exist in real life?

89
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,310
Well, Disney does,

90
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,520
but only if you pay for a ticket.

91
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,030
What life is this?

92
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,560
Dealing

93
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,150
with landlords like that every day?

94
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,030
Is that life for you?

95
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,750
I’ve worked hard my whole life,

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,190
and now my daughter wants
to run a grocery shop?

97
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,150
After everything, we’ve come full circle.

98
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,710
What’s the point of all my struggle then?

99
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,750
There's no point!

100
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,910
This is your own problem.

101
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,800
I live to make my life

102
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,070
more meaningful!

103
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,190
Keke,

104
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
can your small shop

105
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,750
even earn money?

106
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,680
Is it meaningful when you're not

107
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,950
making money and the landlord

108
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,040
bothers you daily?

109
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,510
Li Yuke,

110
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,750
you don't know what it means to be poor!

111
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,360
Stop being so dramatic with me!

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,870
Don't worry.

113
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,600
I won't spend any more of your money.

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
Even if I have to deliver food,
deliver packages,

115
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,750
or do e-hailing,

116
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,480
I’ll still live the life I want!

117
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,600
I can't communicate with you!

118
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,430
Mr. Li!

119
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,360
Mr. Li.

120
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,560
Fine.

121
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,240
Let’s say you manage to do e-hailing

122
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,560
and deliver food.

123
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,240
At the end of the day,

124
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,120
you’re covered in sweat, exhausted n your bed.

125
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,430
Where’s your freedom?

126
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,430
What about your poems and dreams?

127
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,600
At that point, the struggles

128
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,750
that you faced

129
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,750
will be pointless!

130
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,600
Mr. Li.

131
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,600
Hey, Mr. Li!

132
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,270
Mr. Li!

133
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,560
Calm down.

134
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,750
Sit down. Your father was just anxious.

135
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,000
He does love you. He'll think it through.

136
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,390
I'm sorry.

137
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,390
I still screwed this one up.

138
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,070
So can you sleep at night?

139
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,000
I can't.

140
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
The thought of not getting the job done

141
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,120
will keeps me awake at night.

142
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,720
It's so hard.

143
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,480
Then I'll support you.

144
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,040
Dummy,

145
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,310
At my age, I can still work
as a maternity nanny.

146
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,950
What can you do?

147
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,160
Well, food delivery.

148
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,720
Food delivery?

149
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,430
E-hailing,

150
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,360
packge delivery,

151
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,560
and food delivery

152
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,360
are called the Ironman Triathlon.

153
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,720
With someone like you

154
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,040
who won’t sleep at night

155
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,160
and can’t get up in the morning,

156
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,560
I wonder who’ll supporting who.

157
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,480
Then you take care of me.

158
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,480
That’s called mooching off an elder.

159
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,870
I don’t care. I’m sticking with you.

160
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,000
Looks like no matter how hard I try,

161
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,950
I can’t get rid of you.

162
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,800
Mr. Li,

163
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,680
about the trust...

164
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,680
The more Keke acts up,

165
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,120
the more I have to think about her future!

166
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,430
This kid...

167
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,560
I understand.

168
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,430
Then I'll meet up

169
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,870
with a couple lawyers of other firms.

170
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,240
Mr. Li,

171
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,070
Coco is your daughter after all.

172
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,240
Please don’t take it too hard on her.

173
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,040
Today’s incident reminds me

174
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,800
of something from over ten years ago.

175
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,830
I went to the west for a real estate deal,

176
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,680
but the deal fell through,

177
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,310
and they kidnapped me.

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,920
They threw me in a pigsty

179
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,510
and fed me pig food for days,

180
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,000
threatening to kill me
if I didn’t sign the deal.

181
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,800
It’s a society of law.

182
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
You should've called the cops.

183
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,070
What for?

184
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,310
Back then, people were ruthless.

185
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,800
It was Keke’s mother

186
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,480
who single-handedly barged in

187
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,120
and saved me with just her words.

188
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,720
Your wife was a true heroine.

189
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,680
This story could be made into a movie.

190
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,270
Today, I saw her shadow

191
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,270
in Hu Manli.

192
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,240
In the end,

193
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,080
I’m still thinking about my late wife.

194
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,720
If only she were alive,

195
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,440
she could help me with some ideas.

196
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,600
Lu Manli.

197
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,510
I thought about it.

198
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,720
I don’t want to give up

199
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
on the Li Fendou deal.

200
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,200
But I offended them today.

201
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,960
You did it for his own good.

202
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,910
Once he cools down,

203
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,840
he’ll understand.

204
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,630
As long as the deal isn’t finalized,

205
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
there’s still hope for us.

206
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,870
Next,

207
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,600
I’ll keep researching
the Li family’s background

208
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,320
and see if I can find another breakthrough.

209
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,030
As for you, find opportunities

210
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,510
to have them attend

211
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,120
our company’s

212
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,840
VIP events.

213
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
What kind of events?

214
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,390
I’ve sent them to your phone.

215
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,600
It’s just some financial seminars,

216
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,870
and family values workshops.

217
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,840
You just need to find the right moment

218
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,550
to invite them to these events.

219
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,150
First, it’ll help us maintain
our relationship with them.

220
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,630
Second, it’ll give them

221
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,600
a chance to improve
their father-daughter bond.

222
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,960
I really didn’t expect this.

223
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,120
At first, I encouraged you to become a leader

224
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,960
because you seemed lacking in confidence.

225
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,320
But now,

226
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,240
you’ve progressed so quickly,

227
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,600
you’re even

228
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,150
assigning tasks to me

229
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,360
like a real professional.

230
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,120
When you praise a superior

231
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,030
or flatter them,

232
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,000
make sure you think carefully.

233
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,510
You were even mocking me at first.

234
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,870
Watch your wording.

235
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,720
Sorry,

236
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,550
slip of the tongue.

237
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,150
It is too hot?

238
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,550
My retirement pay

239
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,720
went up.

240
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,480
Your retirement pay went up?

241
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,550
How much did the government raise it this year?

242
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,960
It raised

243
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,390
for 120 bucks.

244
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,440
That's a lot!

245
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,270
Hu Degong,

246
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,270
looks like you’ll be supporting me!

247
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,790
I'll support you.

248
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
Let Dad support you.

249
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,360
You'll support me?

250
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm telling you,

251
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,320
don't think about anything else right now.

252
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,910
Focus on your physiotherapy,

253
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,550
okay?

254
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,790
Don't cut slack.

255
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,240
Okay.

256
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,360
Who is it?

257
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:25,960
Wait for me.

258
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,320
Take the receipt.

259
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,030
Who paid for my dad’s expenses
for another year again?

260
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,600
His name

261
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,550
is Ding Zhiyuan.

262
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,120
You're here.

263
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,600
Are you busy?

264
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,600
I'm going to Huangshan

265
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
for a closed-door symposium.

266
00:11:59,270 --> 00:11:59,870
Any thing?

267
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,550
The nursing home told me

268
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,440
you paid

269
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,670
for my dad's nursing home fees for a year.

270
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,030
It's nothing.

271
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,000
It's just a token of appreciation

272
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,200
for the kids' grandpa.

273
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,000
It's inappropriate.

274
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,030
It's not.

275
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
I've already paid it.

276
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,480
Just leave it.

277
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,790
Let me put it this way.

278
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,510
If we were divorced

279
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,720
and you were still single,

280
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,480
maybe I could accept it.

281
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,440
But right now, it’s inappropriate.

282
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,720
As for the refund,

283
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,840
it’s a bit tricky now

284
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,510
since they've already processed the payment.

285
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,240
I’ll try to talk to them again.

286
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,150
Manli,

287
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
I want to do this.

288
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,270
Please, just leave it.

289
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,790
I appreciate the gesture,

290
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,510
and thank you on behalf of my dad too.

291
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,080
No.

292
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,030
I don’t need your thanks,

293
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,840
or anyone’s.

294
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,480
I’m doing this

295
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,270
because he’s the kids' grandfather,

296
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,030
your father.

297
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,030
I’m doing this

298
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,550
because

299
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,080
I regret it.

300
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,080
I'll leave you to it.

301
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:09,840
I'm leaving.

302
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,320
Manli.

303
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,440
Don't go, I...

304
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,270
I've got something to tell you.

305
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,200
Manli,

306
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,030
I'm sorry.

307
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,510
I know my mistake.

308
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,630
I really do.

309
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,270
But I also know

310
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,000
that nothing

311
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,080
I say now will help.

312
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,360
I’ve already

313
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,960
caused you and the kids

314
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,390
irreparable harm.

315
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,910
But I’m begging you,

316
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,790
give me a chance to make it up to you.

317
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,120
I used to mock the way

318
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,030
you handled problems with money.

319
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,960
I even called you materialistic.

320
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,000
But now,

321
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,270
I’m not even worthy of calling myself that.

322
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,630
I waited until your most difficult time

323
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,030
and tried to use a bit of money

324
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,240
to ease my guilt.

325
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,270
I’m like someone taking advantage
of your pain,

326
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,840
but it’s the only thing I can do.

327
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,510
Manli,

328
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,510
I'm begging you,

329
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,870
please accept my repentance.

330
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,670
Are you just repenting now?

331
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,240
What else can I hope for

332
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,270
besides repentance?

333
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,080
I’m not in a position to ask
for your forgiveness,

334
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,510
let alone a second chance.

335
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,240
I heard everything you said.

336
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,390
But what do you want me to do?

337
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,240
Isn’t this how it started with her too?

338
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,200
Mutual feelings,

339
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,510
convincing yourself it didn’t count,

340
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,910
that emotional attraction

341
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,550
isn’t cheating?

342
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,600
Ding,

343
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,840
I want to know,

344
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,960
what do women mean to you?

345
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,240
What do you take us for?

346
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,720
Clothes?

347
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,670
Wear them when you like,

348
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,670
take off when you don’t?

349
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,150
You need to remember,

350
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,120
you’re a husband,

351
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,440
and a father of two.

352
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,960
You have responsibilities on your shoulders.

353
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,630
I accept your apology,

354
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,390
but I can’t accept anything else.

355
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,600
I have my boundaries.

356
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,550
If you have feelings, keep them

357
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,750
to yourself.

358
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,390
If the nursing home money can’t be refunded,

359
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,390
I’ll write you an IOU and pay you back

360
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,240
as soon as possible.

361
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,550
Manli.

362
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,030
Within the constraints of endless joy,

363
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,510
I felt the freedom to embrace.

364
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,030
of embrace.

365
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,830
You kept pouring new wine

366
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,720
into my clay jar,

367
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,680
each with a different color,

368
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,550
a different fragrance.

369
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,110
You're back so late. Where did you go?

370
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,200
I had dinner with Zhong Ning.

371
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,030
I just saw Zhong Ning's social media post.

372
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,270
She went out to eat with her son.

373
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,920
Are you hiding something from me?

374
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Where exactly did you go?

375
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,110
What do you think

376
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,750
he meant by that?

377
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,960
If he regrets it

378
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,310
and wants to remarry you,

379
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,830
what will you do?

380
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Are you crazy?

381
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,310
No, don't avoid the question.

382
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,070
Answer me.

383
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,960
It's impossible.

384
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,880
What do you mean?

385
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,200
How could he remarry you?

386
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,350
Or you won't accept it?

387
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,550
A kid like you won't know.

388
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,830
What do you mean I won't?

389
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,400
I'm trying to help you understand

390
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,590
so you don't make a mistake.

391
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,960
I just have mixed feelings.

392
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,030
I’ve done a lot

393
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,720
for this man in the past.

394
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,400
I guess I was a good woman.

395
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,590
But tell me,

396
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,440
which man would love a woman just because

397
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,480
she’s good to him?

398
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,720
Not a single man

399
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,000
has ever been crazy about me,

400
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,480
and not one

401
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,880
has given me passionate love.

402
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,400
I feel like I’ve failed

403
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,110
as a woman.

404
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,030
Wait, do you really think Ding Zhiyuan

405
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,200
can give you some kind of grand,

406
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
passionate love now?

407
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,680
No,

408
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,440
this has nothing to do with him.

409
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,750
It’s just that today,

410
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,110
for once, my identity as a woman
was acknowledged.

411
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,400
Feeling out of place too, right?

412
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,960
Thinking that words like romance, love

413
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,640
don’t seem to fit me.

414
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,750
I used to think the same.

415
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,400
I told myself

416
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,070
those things can’t make money

417
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,200
or get results,

418
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,030
so what’s the point?

419
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,160
But today I realized

420
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,790
it’s not that I don't want them,

421
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,790
it’s that I can’t.

422
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,550
So I convinced myself that I don't want

423
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,270
to have them.

424
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,070
But what woman

425
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,960
doesn't want a romantic love?

426
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,350
Then,

427
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,480
let say,

428
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,030
if someone said they could give you

429
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,110
a romantic relationship right now,

430
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,270
would you be tempted?

431
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,720
So what if I do?

432
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,680
If you do,

433
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,030
start a new romance

434
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,590
with this new person.

435
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,750
Start again?

436
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,790
Ii'm old now.

437
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,070
I just want to live my life in peace.

438
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,550
He went to the nursing home

439
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,350
to pay the bill for Hu Manli's father?

440
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:22,960
Yes.

441
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,350
I went there myself and checked.

442
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,440
Hu Manli’s father is indeed

443
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,480
in that nursing home.

444
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,880
I asked a friend,

445
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,200
and it’s true.

446
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,830
Wait for me here.

447
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:34,960
Okay.

448
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,480
Who is it?

449
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,590
Zhiyuan.

450
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,960
Why are you here?

451
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,960
Didn’t I tell you

452
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
I’m leaving early tomorrow,

453
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,830
so I won’t be home tonight.

454
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,030
I was at home and thought of something

455
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,960
I wanted to discuss with you.

456
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,070
Can’t it wait

457
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,720
till I get back?

458
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,240
I went to a postpartum care center today.

459
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,270
After I give birth, I’d like to stay there.

460
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,750
If you want to go,

461
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,070
you can just book it.

462
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,550
I’m a high-risk pregnancy because of my age,

463
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,350
so I'd stay for two months.

464
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,070
But the place

465
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,480
is a bit expensive.

466
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,160
Understandable.

467
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,160
Your health comes first.

468
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,680
Lately

469
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,920
I’ve been a bit tight on cash,

470
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,440
and I was thinking...

471
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,270
How much short?

472
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,310
200 thousand.

473
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,550
Can you help me?

474
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,240
Your 200 thousand...

475
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,070
I put all my money

476
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,880
into investments.

477
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,240
Really?

478
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,110
What kind of investments?

479
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,830
Show me the account.

480
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,550
Wait,

481
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,110
what do you mean by that?

482
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,350
You don’t trust me?

483
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,160
Fine, fine.

484
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,270
If you want to go to the postpartum center,
we’ll go.

485
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,160
I’ll figure something out

486
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,510
about the money.

487
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,920
Did you really invest the money,

488
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,110
or did you give it to others?

489
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,400
Can you stop being so passive-aggressive

490
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,680
and suspicious all the time?

491
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,310
Okay, fine.

492
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,680
I’ll tell you the truth.

493
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,640
A friend of mine

494
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,880
needed the money urgently,

495
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,310
so I lent it all to him.

496
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,350
Who?

497
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,550
You don't know him.

498
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,310
Well, I'll know them once you say the name.

499
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,830
Does it have to be this way?

500
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:12,790
Fine.

501
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,790
I’ll call him right now

502
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,400
and let you see for yourself, okay?

503
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,270
But think it through,

504
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,480
if I make this call,

505
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,440
the trust between us

506
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,200
will be gone

507
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,160
Okay.

508
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,920
I believe you.

509
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,440
You should

510
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,440
stop overthinking everything.

511
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,830
Focus on your pregnancy.

512
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,880
Why is Mr. Jin

513
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,110
looking for me?

514
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,240
Ms. Hu,

515
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,110
you'll find out when you meet Mr. Jin.

516
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,110
Here, have some tea.

517
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,240
Thanks, Mr. Jin.

518
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,400
ast time on the forum,

519
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,830
you really pissed off Professor Zeng,

520
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,510
but I didn’t interrupt you.

521
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,240
Do you know why?

522
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,680
Why?

523
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,510
Professor Zeng’s research is very theoretical

524
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,960
and high-level,

525
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,680
but in practice,

526
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,400
it really needs

527
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,160
people like you, the sales reps,
to implement it.

528
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,960
o honestly, his kind of research

529
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,240
doesn’t hold much value.

530
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,680
Thank you for your recognition.

531
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,400
Drink the tea.

532
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,640
Sure.

533
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,030
Take a look at this.

534
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,790
The company just set up a new

535
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,880
eldercare services department

536
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,000
to handle market promotions
and outreach activities.

537
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,440
Annuities,

538
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,960
priority admission to nursing homes?

539
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,510
These kinds of insurance products
have been around for years.

540
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,510
My dad is already living
in the Tianyang Nursing Home.

541
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,110
Why create

542
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,830
a whole new department just to promote this?

543
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,240
Shanghai has already entered

544
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,960
a stage of deep aging.

545
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,030
Seniors over 60 now make up

546
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,510
nearly 40% of the population.

547
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,070
So we plan to go all in

548
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,680
on the silver economy

549
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,110
and shift traditional ideas about eldercare.

550
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,400
Interested?

551
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,350
Me?

552
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,200
Thank you for thinking of me,

553
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,270
Mr. Jin,

554
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,400
but

555
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,270
this is a bit sudden.

556
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,270
No rush to decide.

557
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,480
Take your time.

558
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,880
But let me be upfront.

559
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,830
This is an internal position.

560
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,790
If you accept it,

561
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,400
I hope that

562
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,200
you'll fully commit

563
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,240
and give up

564
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,400
selling insurance for good.

565
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,510
Give up selling insurance?

566
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,160
I don’t think I can do that just yet.

567
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,640
To be honest,

568
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,110
I’ve got elderly parents and kids to support.

569
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,070
My responsibilities are heavy.

570
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,070
The income from selling insurance

571
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,440
is still really important to me.

572
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,590
Understood.

573
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,590
Once you're on board, I can talk to HR

574
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,750
and help you apply
for a better salary package.

575
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,960
I’m sorry, Mr. Jin.

576
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,510
How should I put it...

577
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,590
A lot has changed

578
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,270
in my personal life

579
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,750
recently,

580
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,480
It has just started settling down.

581
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,400
Emotionally,

582
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,640
I’d really love to work with you,

583
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,590
but now,

584
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,350
I just don’t have the energy or strength

585
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,350
to start something new.

586
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,030
I get it.

587
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:16,880
I really get it.

588
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,310
If you ever run

589
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,160
into any difficulties in life,

590
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,270
you’re welcome to come to me.

591
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,270
Thanks, Mr. Jin.

592
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,110
Where are you?

593
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,750
I've got a new idea

594
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,790
for Li Fendou's case.

595
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,270
Manli!

596
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,240
Chunlu.

597
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,720
Thank you about last time.

598
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,440
Manli,

599
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,440
have you forgiven me now?

600
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,830
Let's have coffee sometime

601
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
when we're free.

602
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,510
Sure!

603
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,590
That’s why I think

604
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,960
he doesn’t even know

605
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,750
what he really wants.

606
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,240
Sure,

607
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,350
but Li Fendou isn’t like an ordinary parent.

608
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,720
I’m worried you two might fall out completely.

609
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,480
And how is that any different now?

610
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,590
I just spoke with Secretary Yan,

611
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,590
he said Li Fendou’s free

612
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,400
and is willing to give us half an hour.

613
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,440
Let’s go.

614
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:09,960
Okay.

615
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,400
We reviewed all the assets under your name

616
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,110
and our suggestion

617
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,400
is to set up a holding company,

618
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,680
directly distributes benefits
to the beneficiaries.

619
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,640
The specific structure is shown
in the diagram.

620
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,200
Hold on,

621
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,270
how is this proposal

622
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,960
any different from the last one?

623
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,960
It’s the same.

624
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,790
Am I just wasting my time entertaining you?

625
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,350
Mr. Li,

626
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,680
would you say what you really want

627
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,750
is for your daughter

628
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,400
to give you

629
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,110
an heir?

630
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,920
Yeah.

631
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,480
Wrong.

632
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,270
What?

633
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,550
Did I pay you to teach me right from wrong?

634
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,440
Can you do this?

635
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,590
If you can't do it, get out!

636
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,590
Please calm down.

637
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,480
I think what you truly want is

638
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,750
for your daughter, Yuki,

639
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
to live a peaceful and safe life,

640
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:14,880
right?

641
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:15,920
Of course!

642
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,000
So all this talk about professional managers

643
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,750
or sons-in-law taking over

644
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,550
are all nonsense!

645
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,880
You’ve seen how things are with Keke.

646
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,400
She’s fine standing up to me,

647
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,270
but if I’m gone,

648
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
those wolves outside

649
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,400
will tear her apart!

650
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,350
Mr. Li, look.

651
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,750
It's been half a year since you first started

652
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,790
considering family succession.

653
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,750
You've seen all kinds

654
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,720
of family office companies

655
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,750
in the market,

656
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,830
yet none of them have satisfied you.

657
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,200
Do you know why?

658
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,030
Why?

659
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,640
Because they’re not capable,

660
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,240
of course!

661
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,510
If you can’t do it,

662
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,750
I’ll get foreign companies.

663
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,960
The money’s in my hands!

664
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,790
I can find someone better!

665
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,680
Do you think Yuki is really that unreliable?

666
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,310
Without your protection,

667
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,440
she’ll end up in a miserable situation?

668
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,920
I think

669
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
you’re just feeling guilty.

670
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,510
You missed out on most of your daughter’s

671
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,830
growing-up years,

672
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,030
and now you want to make up for it

673
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,200
in an unreasonable way.

674
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,920
But I can assure you,

675
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,750
no family office in the market

676
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,400
can fulfill your demands.

677
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,880
If you can't do it, then get out!

678
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,160
Stop wasting my time here!

679
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,510
There's no point in more talks!

680
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,070
Stop spewing nonsense!

681
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,920
Please calm down.

682
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,160
I’m embarrassed to admit it,

683
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,030
but I only started learning about family trusts recently.

684
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,030
All the terms

685
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,160
about equity structures and clauses

686
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,830
are giving me a headache.

687
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,200
I feel just like you.

688
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,550
Why make things so complicated?

689
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,440
Isn’t it all just to sell a product?

690
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,640
Exactly!

691
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,200
Listen to her!

692
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,240
Keep going.

693
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,960
Mr. Li, please sit down.

694
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,880
Let’s talk.

695
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,030
A few days ago, a client came to me

696
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,200
with three million and asked

697
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,000
about insurance.

698
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,750
She wanted safety

699
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,750
and high returns.

700
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,880
After going in circles,

701
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,440
I realized her real demand

702
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,400
was to protect her money from
her gambling-addicted son-in-law.

703
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,150
Right now,

704
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,150
you’re just like her.

705
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,510
How am I like her?

706
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,480
Why do a family trust with just three million?

707
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,710
My scale is nothing like that!

708
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,670
You all want to give

709
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,630
your kids 100% security.

710
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,630
Sure,

711
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,360
your funds are ten times hers,

712
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,710
and you’ve got enough legal terms

713
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,590
for a family trust to fill several books.

714
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,440
But still, it won’t meet your needs.

715
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,760
Why?

716
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,400
Because no plan can match

717
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,070
a parent’s love for their child.

718
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,000
We realized it too late,

719
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,230
and in the end,

720
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,110
that client bought something else.

721
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,230
Xiaozhou was a bit rude earlier,

722
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,920
but he’s just anxious.

723
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,590
I hope you can understand.

724
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,550
Sorry, Mr. Li.

725
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,030
I was too impulsive

726
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,590
just now,

727
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,590
but I just wanted to clarify things with you.

728
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,920
Family trusts

729
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,920
are often called the hand that reaches out
from the grave.

730
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,070
You don’t need

731
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,440
to regret the past neglect
toward your daughter.

732
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,230
A good trust can ensure that,

733
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,070
even a hundred years from now,

734
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,360
and Yuki will always feel

735
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,360
her father’s love

736
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,280
and protection

737
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,110
in another way,

738
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,590
Mr. Li,

739
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,630
if you have time,

740
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,360
please listen.

741
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,480
Sit down.

742
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:17,960
Go ahead.

743
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,110
Alright, then. Mr. Li, let me continue.

744
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,920
This is the structure of the holding company,

745
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,670
so the trustor would be you,

746
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,510
Mr. Li Fendou.

747
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,480
Congratulation, Xiaozhou.

748
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,920
We did it.

749
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,840
We succeeded.

750
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,550
Xiaozhou.

751
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,150
Hu Manli,

752
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,110
thank you.

753
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,360
I...

754
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,150
I'm speechless.

755
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,030
If you don't know what to say,

756
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,230
then keep it for later.

757
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,280
There are many people here.

758
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,280
Let go.

759
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,150
No need to thank me.

760
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,190
Your persistence paid off.

761
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,230
I told you

762
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,800
that rich people like it when you're

763
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,440
straightforward.

764
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:50,760
Let's

765
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,480
find a place  to celebrate. My treat.

766
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,710
I want your handmade food.

767
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,230
You think I'm not tired enough?

768
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,190
Fine then.

769
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,030
My superior has already spoken,

770
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,960
I've got no choice.

771
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,030
Let’s go. I’ll show you something special.

772
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:17,960
Hou much?

773
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,590
That'll be 560 bucks.

774
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,070
Okay.

775
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,230
It's through.

776
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,670
Thank you. Come again.

777
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,880
Let's go.

778
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,510
Well well, business is good.

779
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
Mr. Li, what brings you here today?

780
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,880
Secretary Yen couldn't get you to come,

781
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,400
so I had to come here myself.

782
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,190
What is it?

783
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
I gave the big family trust deal

784
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,670
to your dear friend, Hu Manli.

785
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm kind enough to you, right?

786
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,550
Now, you should show me some kindness.

787
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,510
So, how do you want it?

788
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,360
Come home for dinner tonight.

789
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,400
The car is waiting for you downstairs.

790
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,440
It's not ready yet? I'm hungry.

791
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:08,440
Almost.

792
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,280
It smells great.

793
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,070
Hu's mandarin fish is a success.

794
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,360
It's not burnt?

795
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,880
Anything else?

796
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:30,880
I'll take it.

797
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,710
Bowl and chopsticks.

798
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,150
Okay.

799
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,760
It's ready to eat.

800
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,110
I'm full.

801
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,840
I can't eat any more.

802
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,280
I told you, if you can’t eat it,

803
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,590
don’t force yourself,

804
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,630
but you insisted on finishing.

805
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,440
Did you make this yourself?

806
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,190
You’ve had a meal I cooked before!

807
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,800
Well, I never tried Hu's mandarin fish.

808
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,000
This fish is tasty, right?

809
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,440
Yes.

810
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,630
It looks simple,

811
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,440
but every step,

812
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,670
from the ingredients to the heat

813
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,840
is crucial.

814
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,480
I experimented a lot

815
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,800
before I perfected it.

816
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,840
I figured out

817
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,000
when it will be crispy outside, tender inside,

818
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,400
and when to pour the sauce

819
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,320
for the best flavor.

820
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,960
Ding used to love it the most.

821
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:26,630
Okay,

822
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,510
forget about him.

823
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,480
I'll make some barley tea to help
with digestion, okay?

824
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,230
No, don't move!

825
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,510
Just sit down.

826
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,070
Let me

827
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,110
get something.

828
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,800
A present for you.

829
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,670
For me?

830
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,280
What is it?

831
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:12,920
Take a guess.

832
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,320
A bag?

833
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,590
Jewelry?

834
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,110
This is light.

835
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,590
Could it be a cheque or money?

836
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,510
You'r so materialistic.

837
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,960
Open it and take a look.

838
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,840
How domineering, boss.

839
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,630
Open it up.

840
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,590
What is this?

841
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,710
You want me

842
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,840
to work more overtime?

843
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,070
No! You don't have to do anything.

844
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,760
This annuity insurance is something

845
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,360
I made for you.

846
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,920
