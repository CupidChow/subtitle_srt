Who?

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,760
Such attitude.

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,590
Newbie.

00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,590
What's that face?

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What's wrong?

You don't like that?

49

Spit it out.

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,560

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,630
Just two cents.

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,150

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,310
You can't?

She doesn't eat fish.

Hello, where's my desk?

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,630
Yichang, deal with it.

It's your first job.

93
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,630
But there's no such thing.

94
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,120
Isn't that deceiving?

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,430
Don't talk like a green hand.

96
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,150
Deceiving?

97
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,310
Come on, it's leading.

Just wondering.

104
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,360
Anyone interested in insurance?

105
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,830
I'm...

106
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,310
OK.

107
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,720

108
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,430
Sure.

109
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,360
Hello?

110
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,160
Was it a bad signal?

111
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,510
Hello?

112
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,510
What are you doing? Out.

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,390

114
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,950
This is the door.

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,000
This way.

116
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,600
Hello?

117
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,240
Manli.

118
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
You think my order is small?

119
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,360
Don't want it?

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,680
What is it?

121
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
I get it.

122
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,800
You're successful now.

123
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,870
Right?

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,680
Making big money.

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
You don't need your old customers.

126
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,310
But think about it.

127
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,160
It's been years.

128
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,920
Our whole family buys from you.

129
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,070
Look, my mom.

130
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,430
She only trusts you.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,800
Now you sent a girl

132
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,510
who doesn't know a thing.

133
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,560
What do you mean?

134
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,950
Ignoring us?

135
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,040
You're mistaken.

136
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,950
What's she called?

137
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,480
Wang.

138
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,800
...

139
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,360
Wang Chunlu.

140
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,390
Said she's your disciple.

141
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,800
I've seen her badge.

142
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,750
Won't be a problem, right?

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,070
No.

144
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,830
I had an emergency.

145
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,680
I couldn't come.

146
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,870
The annuity you wanted is canceled.

147
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,190
So I sent her

148
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,000
in case you were waiting.

149
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,430
Didn't expect you to misunderstand.

150
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,120
Canceled?

151
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,390
What happened?

152
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,510
Is there other insurance we can buy?

153
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,160
We can accept lower rate.

154
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,830
No, not really.

155
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,310
Here's the thing.

156
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,270
Buy some short-term product.

157
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,920
I'll inform you when

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,160
there's insurance fit for you.

159
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,040
Hey.

160
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,310
Keep in touch.

161
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,040
Bye.

162
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,390
Hold on.

163
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,720
I bought it because of my mom...

164
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:05,630
Hello?

165
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,680
Manli.

166
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
How are you doing?

167
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,040
I had an order.

168
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,800
The customer is great,

169
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,830
introducing their friends.

170
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,720
Really?

171
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,750
Congrats.

172
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,790
Manli.

173
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,080
Sorry.

174
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:58,870
Why?

175
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:00,910
Chunlu.

176
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,000
Why did you meet clients alone?

177
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,720
Sorry, I'm...

178
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,440
I need money.

179
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,550
You know about me.

180
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,120
My mom had a stroke.

181
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,240
The bills.

182
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,440
And I need to hire a caretaker.

183
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,120
Exactly.

184
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,000
That's why I

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,360
came to you.

186
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
But you'll take 70%.

187
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,630
You used to

188
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,240
let us or the consultants

189
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,510
draft clients' programs.

190
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,320
I...

191
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,840
thought it was a matter of time.

192
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,200
You have clients

193
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,720
because you've worked long.

194
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,750
So...

195
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,510
Hey.

196
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,000
I had disciples

197
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,270
who betrayed me.

198
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,790
I swore I'd never have one

199
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,790
until I met you.

200
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,000
I know your conditions.

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,240
You love your family.

202
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,720
I wanted to help.

203
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,240
Never expect you to think of me like that.

204
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,670
Sorry, Manli.

205
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,440
I was wrong.

206
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,670
That's all. Get off.

207
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,080
Please give me another chance.

208
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,270
I won't do it again.

209
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,080
Leave.

210
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,390
I gave you my trust.

211
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,750
Off.

212
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,670
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,390
Thought I was smart.

214
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,320
Still ended up bad.

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,910
How about other colleagues?

216
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,720
Listen, Zhong Ning.

217
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,080
I looked through my contacts.

218
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,910
Here's um...

219
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,240
acquaintances that are brokers.

220
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,080
From other firms.

221
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,750
I'll send your number to them.

222
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,670
Tell them you want to buy insurance.

223
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,030
See if they'll come to you.

224
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,870
You want me to pretend to be a client

225
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,750
to find work partners for you?

226
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,600
They all try to take me while I'm down.

227
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,910
Had to take measures.

228
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,270
You sure?

229
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,910
They might be honest

230
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,790
this time.

231
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,960
In time,

232
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,120
they might be just like Chunlu.

233
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,080
Just my two cents.

234
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,720
Two years.

235
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,600
You take some random job for two years.

236
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,550
Start over

237
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,000
when the ban is lifted.

238
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,670
Too long.

239
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,030
Only got about

240
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,960
100 thousand buck cash.

241
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,670
No way.

242
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,840
Thought you were a top one broker.

243
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,630
Such little cash?

244
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,440
I bought a house, car.

245
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,910
Spent all of it.

246
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,910
Unluckily,

247
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,870
I had my big orders half latter of this year.

248
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,240
With commissions and bonuses,

249
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,670
I might make billions.

250
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,270
Now it's all gone.

251
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,670
You did the job.

252
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,630
Why can't you get the money?

253
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,200
They fired you.

254
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,790
No compensation?

255
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,840
We're brokers.

256
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,840
Work partners with the firm.

257
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,270
No compensation whatsoever.

258
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,320
No income once a broker stops working.

259
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
How fragile.

260
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,270
We're still working class

261
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,790
with no safety net.

262
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,320
Human flesh

263
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,240
can't stand hurricanes.

264
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
[European Aviation Center Camp]

265
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,720
This is bad.

266
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,720
School is charging for camps now.

267
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,720
Like it?

268
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,440
Yes.

269
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,390
New car.

270
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,270
Does Mom know?

271
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,720
Borrowed it.

272
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,870
Needed rides sometimes.

273
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,240
Big screen.

274
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,440
For playing games?

275
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,750
I thought so.

276
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,240
I didn't try.

277
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,320
Dingding.

278
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,670
Isn't your class over at 5?

279
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,790
How come you're so late?

280
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,870
Didn't Dad tell you?

281
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,360
Took me out for dinner.

282
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,750
You ate?

283
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,870
What did he say?

284
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,150
You're not asking about the dinner?

285
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,150
Can't be something fancy.

286
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,790
My cooking is better.

287
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,630
He doesn't talk big like you.

288
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,270
What did he say?

289
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,790
The same old stuff.

290
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,200
I shut my ears.

291
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,390
Anything else?

292
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,030
Mom.

293
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,630
Did you guys fight again?

294
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,840
No.

295
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,200
He's away from home.

296
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,840
You know, distance.

297
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,750
So we don't talk often.

298
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,510
Really?

299
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,750
But distance makes hearts grow fonder.

300
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,510
Where did you learn that?

301
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,550
It's a new console.

302
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,240
Where is it from?

303
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,790
Lisu gave me during dinner.

304
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,960
Qiu Lisu.

305
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,320
You know her?

306
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,200
Yes.

307
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,600
You guys ate together?

308
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,630
Dingding.

309
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,510
Why don't you

310
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,320
return this console, hmm?

311
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,080
You guys weren't related.

312
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,600
Yes, we are.

313
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,440
She's Dad's vendor.

314
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,200
She sends Dad gifts.

315
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,910
Normal.

316
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,870
It's not.

317
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
It's bad.

318
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,080
But I took it.

319
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,080
No next time, OK?

320
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,320
[Manli]

321
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,200
Hello?

322
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,270
Ding Zhiyuan.

323
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,960
Why didn't you tell me

324
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,830
about the dinner?

325
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,200
Lisu came

326
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,480
as a friend.

327
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,550
I kept my promise.

328
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,200
Didn't tell him the divorce.

329
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,070
And.

330
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,400
The console

331
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,680
is just a symbol of kindness.

332
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,070
Kindness?

333
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,590
He should be busy with studies.

334
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,750
She's putting up an act, you know.

335
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,110
I didn't want to say it,

336
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,680
but...

337
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,510
Do you know she keeps a man outside?

338
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,830
The guy made me lose my job.

339
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,350
Now she wants to ruin your son.

340
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,000
Careful, will you?

341
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,400
Said they didn't fight.

342
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,720
I'll text Professor Ding,

343
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,030
inviting him for dinner.

344
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,000
You know

345
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:46,790
what to do.

346
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,640
What?

347
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,550
You want your dad home?

348
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,830
Of course.

349
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,000
He's my dad.

350
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,750
Where else could he be?

351
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,030
Don't do it.

352
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,440
We didn't fight.

353
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,790
I'm having a hard time at work.

354
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,720
Bad mood.

355
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,480
Hey.

356
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,750
Are you going to the school camp?

357
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:14,960
No.

358
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,400
Heard they're going to visit

359
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,640
an aviation center.

360
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,550
Aren't you obsessed with that kind of stuff?

361
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,880
Too expensive.

362
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,030
When did you start

363
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,200
caring about money?

364
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,400
Don't worry about it.

365
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,480
Your classmates all signed up.

366
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,510
Won't you feel excluded?

367
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,590
Focus on your work.

368
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,480
I don't care how they see me.

369
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,240
I won't go even if it's outer space.

370
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,310
Wow, talk like a big man.

371
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,270
I don't have orders now.

372
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,680
But I have savings.

373
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,720
100 thousand's nothing.

374
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,350
Really?

375
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,440
Don't overdo yourself.

376
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,920
And it's all because of you.

377
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,920
All I want

378
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,350
is you doing well at studies.

379
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,000
I signed you up.

380
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,920
Give me good grades, OK?

381
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,030
Here you go again, exchanging.

382
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,880
You don't like it?

383
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,160
I do, immensely.

384
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,000
Thanks.

385
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,720
Zhiyuan.

386
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,110
Have fruits.

387
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,400
Hu Manli was fired.

388
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,270
Did you know?

00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,750
Yes.

584
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,680
So many dishes.

585
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,160
Wash your hands.

586
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,030
Is it takeaway?

587
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,920
Of course not.

588
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,510
Look what I got you.

589
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:24,880
What?

590
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,310
See?

591
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,750
This cake is super hard to buy.

592
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,510
How did you do it?

593
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,000
Forget something?

594
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:40,790
Yeah right.

595
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,510
One sec.

596
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,200
Don't forget

597
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,070
the filter.

598
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,830
It's on.

599
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Smile.

600
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,920
Ready?

601
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,240
Cheese.

602
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,880
Look.

603
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:00,680
Okay?

604
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,400
Nice.

605
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,160
Eat.

606
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:10,960
Hands.

607
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,510
What are you

608
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,310
giggling about?

609
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,400
So many likes.

610
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,070
I won.

611
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,160
Eat up.

612
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,310
Here.

613
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,830
You free this weekend?

614
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,880
Yes, what is it?

615
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,920
The docs want to

616
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,200
play tennis.

617
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,960
Didn't you play it at school?

618
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,030
Come.

619
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,830
I don't know them, forget it.

620
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,550
You'll do once you come.

621
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,830
Kang.

622
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,400
Duan's husband.

623
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,640
Duan

624
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,480
taught me at college.

625
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,070
You know her.

626
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,310
I asked her.

627
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,160
She said it's OK.

628
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,000
It's your team building.

629
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,110
I'll be odd.

630
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,240
Hey,

631
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,590
use your brain.

632
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,110
This is not about tennis.

633
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,920
It's just an excuse.

634
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,030
You get to

635
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,480
know more people.

636
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,750
Why?

637
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,160
You sell insurance.

638
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,790
You need connections.

639
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,640
Kang has many friends.

640
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,550
If you get orders from him,

641
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,830
they'll cover you for a year.

642
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,110
Don't you see that?

643
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,400
I do.

644
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,830
I do now.

645
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,240
But I don't know him.

646
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,240
It'll be

647
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,160
awkward.

648
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,960
What to say?

649
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,880
That's where tennis comes in.

650
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,000
Play a few rounds,

651
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,880
won't you be

652
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,640
friends?

653
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,200
You lose to him on purpose

654
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,880
and butter him up.

655
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,590
He says something nice.

656
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,440
And then,

657
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,550
you're friends.

658
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,830
You have things to talk about.

659
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,960
Lose to him on purpose?

660
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,550
Such a drama.

661
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,790
I've made myself clear.

662
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,720
You're going or not?

663
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:07,750
I'll go.

664
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,000
Of course I do.

665
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,030
Why not?

666
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,200
I'll go and lose.

667
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,550
Satisfied?

668
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,510
Eat.

669
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,400
Zhiyuan.

670
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,790
What's on your mind?

671
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,480
Nothing.

672
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,270
Here's the thing.

673
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,830
Wang Xue found me

674
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,000
and showed me this.

675
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
Manli probably blocked me

676
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
so I didn't see.

677
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,400
Xue didn't know we broke up.

678
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,240
Thought we had a

679
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,310
financial crisis.

680
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,200
So?

681
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,240
So what?

682
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,030
Zhiyuan.

683
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,320
Are you

684
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,030
worried about her?

685
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,840
That hurts.

686
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,630
Worried?

687
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,190
Big misunderstanding.

688
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,550
You don't have to lie.

689
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,000
We should be honest.

690
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,710
No, I shouldn't meddle with her life.

691
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,480
But,

692
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,440
she's Ding Daer's mom.

693
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,360
They live together.

694
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,070
If she runs into trouble,

695
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,800
Daer's going to suffer.

696
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,800
I see.

697
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,800
I thought

698
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,550
I'd give her some cash.

699
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,190
But,

700
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,630
the thought of

701
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,360
her being hysterical seeing me

702
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,550
gives me a headache.

703
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,670
I must've upset you.

704
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,000
Actually,

705
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,320
I don't care about her.

706
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,510
I worry about

707
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,960
my kid.

708
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,510
Kid.

709
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,760
Right.

710
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,670
You guys have a kid.

711
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,960
You can never be severed.

712
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,880
I'm the outsider.

713
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,550
Don't say that.

714
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,360
You're the closest to me now.

715
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,400
That's sweet.

716
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,480
I'll help her.

717
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,960
You?

718
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,360
You don't want to meet her.

719
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,760
I'll go.

720
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,150
That'll be harder.

721
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,920
She'll lose it seeing you.

722
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,800
I can prepare myself.

723
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,400
Zhiyuan.

724
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,400
For you,

725
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,880
I can endure

726
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,190
anything.

727
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,360
I don't know how to thank you.

728
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Right now,

729
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,510
you being with me

730
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,320
is the biggest thanks.

731
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,480
Thanks.

732
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,590
Manli,

733
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,190
you selling all these?

734
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,440
Yeah, they take up space.

735
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,880
You don't like them now?

736
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,320
Hermès?

737
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,440
Which one do you like?

738
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,360
How much?

739
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,880
I don't make plans.

740
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,760
I buy.

741
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,110
Manli.

742
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,400
How much is it?

743
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,280
Sharp eyes.

744
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,670
It's nearly new.

745
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,760
I hardly used it.

746
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,630
It cost about 20 thousand.

747
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,840
Big sale now.

748
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,840
70% off?

749
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,510
50 of course.

750
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,510
That was in old days.

751
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,590
Now it's all 70%.

752
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,110
Looks good on me.

753
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,510
Give me a good bargain.

754
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,590
Take your time.

755
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,190
Discounts when you buy others.

756
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,070
The color suits you.

757
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:17,920
Open it.

758
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,510
Everyone,

759
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,480
sorry.

760
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,230
This is the end of today.

761
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,230
My boss'll buy all the bags here.

762
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,190
What's up?

763
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,550
Who are you?

764
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,960
Manli.

765
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,480
Aren't you broke?

766
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,590
I'm here to save you.

767
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,000
Broke?

768
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,280
That's why she's selling.

769
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,590
No wonder.

770
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,280
Two odd characters.

771
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,800
I'll take care of them.

772
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,360
Sorry.

773
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,710
OK.

774
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,630
We'll be off.

775
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,710
Text me.

776
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,590
OK.

777
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,280
Sorry.

778
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,400
Talk soon.

779
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,880
Talk on WhatsApp.

780
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,400
Sorry.

781
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,710
We'll leave.

782
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,280
Sure. Sorry.

783
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,230
Bye.

784
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,960
Call me.

785
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,550
OK.

786
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,630
Gotta run.

787
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,480
Sorry.

788
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,190
So sorry.

789
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,150
What do you want?

790
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,230
50 thousand.

791
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,550
All of them.

792
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,480
Enough?

793
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,630
80, for your sake.

794
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,840
Jia.

795
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,190
They look quite new.

796
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,840
Easy on

797
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,920
your snipping.

798
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:15,960
More.

799
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,840
100 thousand.

800
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,480
You can buy all of them brand new.

801
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,760
Know your place.

802
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,280
100 thousand.

803
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,400
Then you pretend you didn't

804
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
play dirty.

805
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,590
You.

806
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,960
Dirty.

807
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,230
You mean me and Zhiyuan being together?

808
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,550
We

809
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,280
are in love.

810
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,510
Love

811
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,070
is the most wonderful in the world.

812
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:58,920
Of course.

813
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,670
Thank you

814
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,110
for your generosity.

815
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,510
Never seen

816
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,800
anyone shameless like you.

817
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:11,510
Hey.

818
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,000
Jia.

819
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,480
You can be feisty.

820
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,230
But I warn you.

821
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,360
You need money.

822
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,030
Without a man,

823
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,190
you still have to live.

824
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,000
Get lost with

825
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,510
your money.

826
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,920
I'm doing just fine.

827
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,190
I don't need you.

828
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,230
Manli.

829
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,440
You sure?

830
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,320
You can save your face.

831
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,360
What about the kid?

832
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,880
Here's the money.

833
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,760
One minute.

834
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,070
Take it

835
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,440
or I'll go.

836
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,030
Think.

837
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,070
30 seconds.

838
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,150
You're generous.

839
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,960
I'll drop the act.

840
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,800
Thanks.

841
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,190
That's more like it.

842
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,710
Manli.

843
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,400
I want to be

844
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,480
friends with you.

845
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,230
Come to me

846
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,710
if anything's up.

847
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,030
I will.

848
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,030
OK?

849
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,760
Put these

850
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,150
away.

851
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,000
Can't wear them.

852
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,070
OK.

853
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,900
♫If I close both eyes tonight♫

854
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,780
♫Back to that wishing summer night♫

855
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,540
♫Wind brushes your shaking frame♫

856
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,340
♫That world feels close just the same♫

857
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,740
♫If I dare to face the dawn♫

858
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,460
♫Do you know this face you'd drawn♫

859
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,260
♫Gray spirals looped in endless chase♫

860
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,060
♫Tracing tears not words they trace♫

861
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,820
♫How many times must this repeat♫

862
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,340
♫Sighs pull my gaze to retreat♫

863
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,180
♫Sleepless nights, risks untold♫

864
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,980
♫None of it for my own soul♫

865
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,420
♫Winds blew, rains poured♫

866
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,300
♫Umbrellas broke, we soared♫

867
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,380
♫Sky fell, ground shook♫

868
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,900
♫Through dusk till dawn I stood♫

869
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,860
♫Cars passed, dreams drowned♫

870
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:05,260
♫Every stop's chain unbound♫

871
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,300
♫Moon watched, stars blazed♫

872
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,180
♫Lamps died, connections phased♫

873
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,300
♫Held hands, laughed then cried♫

874
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,580
♫Hearts froze, parts died inside♫

875
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,220
♫Tried hard, spoke true♫

876
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,220
♫Now I'm someone I never knew♫

877
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,220
♫Love came, hate stayed♫

878
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,740
♫I arrived, you frayed♫

879
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,100
♫Voice cracked, tears burned♫

880
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
♫Life lost, lessons earned♫

881
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,700
♫Grew up, let go♫

882
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,700
♫Why cling to old sorrow♫

883
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,060
♫How many loops replay♫

884
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,740
♫Sighs steal my gaze away♫

885
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,260
♫Lost nights, bold bets♫

886
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,900
♫Nothing for my regrets♫

887
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,300
♫Winds raged, storms crashed♫

888
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,980
♫Dawns broke, I held fast♫

889
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,100
♫Cars fled, dreams fled♫

890
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:11,580
♫Every route left dead♫

891
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,100
♫Love left, hate stayed♫

892
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,980
♫Voice gone, tears paid♫

893
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,620
♫Grew strong, moved on♫

894
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:24,480
♫Why dwell when it's gone♫
