A Better Life

40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Episode 25

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,400
Hello.

42
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,430
I'm the court clerk from
Jiangcheng District Court in Shanghai.

43
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,560
Blue Ocean is suing you.

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,150
During your tenure
as an insurance sales agent for them,

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,230
you caused the company

46
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,640
a loss of four million
due to regulatory violations.

47
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,710
The company demands you repay this loss.

48
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,870
Where did you get this car?

49
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,680
The company assigned it to me. Nice?

50
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,080
Feel it out.

51
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,310
Here, ma'am.

52
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,080
They're treating you well.

53
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,470
Careful.

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,710
Look.

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,750
Like it?

56
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,710
Feel these seats.

57
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,470
There's even a big sunroof.

58
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,960
They call it a panoramic sunroof.

59
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,470
This screen...

60
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,630
Is it touchscreen?

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,400
Right, see.

62
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,590
It's touchscreen.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,120
TSI's really treating you well.

64
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,630
Hello, hi.

65
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,680
Yes, I'm Xue Xiaozhou.

66
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,960
Inquire about a large insurance policy?

67
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,240
Okay.

68
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,910
Add me on WhatsApp.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,520
Okay, thanks.

70
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,750
Wait a moment, I need to make a call.

71
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
No problem, no rush.

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,240
Hello, hi.

73
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,590
May I ask if this is Mr. Niu?

74
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,630
Yes.

75
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,750
Right.

76
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,080
It's about the family trust matter.

77
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,430
Okay.

78
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,190
Alright.

79
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,310
Anytime.

80
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,310
All up to you.

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:03,910
Yes.

82
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,840
I'd still recommend you
set up a family trust.

83
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,400
Doesn't have to be large.

84
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,560
Why don't you add me on WhatsApp?

85
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,870
I'll send you the materials later.

86
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,190
Alright.

87
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,480
Yes, this phone number.

88
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,190
Thanks.

89
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,630
Gosh.

90
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,560
After the
New Forces in Business interview,

91
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,800
so many people came to consult me.

92
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,720
Really sorry about that.

93
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm happy for you.

94
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,720
You're practically
a star insurance agent now.

95
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,750
So,

96
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,510
when do you plan to join TSI?

97
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,040
Join?

98
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,870
My company asked me to build a team.

99
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,920
I saved a position for you.

100
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,310
Only thing is,

101
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,040
officially you'd have to be my assistant.

102
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,390
I'd be your assistant?

103
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,360
So you're saying
you want me to work for you?

104
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,680
It's only in name.

105
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,070
I'd still be taking orders from you.

106
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,630
No.

107
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:03,920
Offended?

108
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,600
I can't go.

109
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,430
Why not?

110
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,430
You've seen my situation.

111
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,750
My dad can't be left alone now.

112
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
How could I have time and energy
to handle those matters?

113
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,240
So that's what you're worried about.

114
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,000
Well... how about this?

115
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,830
Focus mainly on taking care of Mr. Hu,

116
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,870
and treat our work as secondary.

117
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,310
After all,
the work is just between us two.

118
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,870
We can plan and schedule our time.

119
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,390
Charity case now?

120
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,390
So you mean I don't have to work

121
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,430
but still get paid?
Is that what you mean?

122
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,190
No! That's not what I meant.

123
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,720
-I know what you mean. - I'm saying...

124
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,630
I know.

125
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,920
You're someone who understands gratitude.

126
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,510
The problem is with me, you know?

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,870
I have my pride.

128
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,750
I can't stand people pitying me.

129
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,950
Living like that would make me uneasy.

130
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,560
I won't accept it

131
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,830
I'm really not...

132
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,240
Let's just call it quits.

133
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,160
We talked about this.

134
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,600
Stop joking like this.

135
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,950
I'm not joking.

136
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,830
I'm serious.

137
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
No, Hu Manli.

138
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,270
If you don't want to be an assistant,
then don't.

139
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,600
Just pretend I never said it, okay?

140
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,800
Don't be angry.

141
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,630
I've thought it through seriously.

142
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,310
You're going into family office.

143
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,830
I don't understand that field anyway.

144
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
I need to take care of my dad.

145
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,070
Actually, between us work-wise,

146
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,240
there's hardly any overlap anymore.

147
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,920
You know that, right?

148
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,040
And another thing,

149
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,000
you're financially comfortable now.

150
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,560
Hurry up and find a place.

151
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,630
Time to move out.

152
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,560
Is a week enough time?

153
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,000
What do you mean?

154
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,560
I-I never said I was moving out.

155
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,360
Xiaozhou.

156
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,040
Consider my position too.

157
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,480
After my dad gets back,

158
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,830
he'll obviously be living with me.

159
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,870
I can't have him
sharing a room with Daer.

160
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,510
Daer can't sleep in my room either.

161
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,310
So this way.

162
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,040
There really aren't
any spare rooms left.

163
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,720
Right?

164
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,480
Then I'll live with Daer.

165
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,510
Didn't we agree already?

166
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,720
I'd tutor him with his studies.

167
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,070
He doesn't even have time
for homework now.

168
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,070
Where would he find time for tutoring?

169
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,560
Is...is it because of rent?

170
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,120
We-we can discuss it.

171
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,630
Name your price.

172
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,720
What price are you talking about?

173
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,600
Didn't I make myself clear?

174
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,120
No spare rooms.

175
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,310
Why are you still clinging to me?

176
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,920
You're Director Xue now.

177
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,950
Living under my roof

178
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,040
isn't appropriate.

179
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,120
Besides, you'll have a girlfriend again.

180
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,750
What if your girlfriend asks

181
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,270
why you're living with a single

182
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,830
divorced woman? What would you say?

183
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,830
It's hard to explain.

184
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,270
Some things need to be planned early.

185
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,000
How many days do you need?

186
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,800
Hu Manli, is it because

187
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,390
living here,

188
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,360
I'm in your way?

189
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,040
Well, you don't need to

190
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,000
say it out loud.

191
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,240
Should I introduce you a real estate agent?

192
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,720
No need.

193
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,390
Hey, let me tell you something.

194
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,440
In that chatgroup,

195
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,080
many people
already got their money back.

196
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,150
So I added someone
from that. investment company

197
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,790
A Mr. Wang.

198
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,120
That young man told me

199
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,240
to get back the 500,000,
we need to pay taxes first.

200
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,600
Pay taxes?

201
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,870
On our own money?

202
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,670
Why pay taxes?

203
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,270
That's what they said.

204
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,510
But Wang explained

205
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,390
the original company that went bust
got shut down,

206
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,630
so the CEO switched to another company
to process payments.

207
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,910
The new company's reason for
disbursement is investment profits,

208
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,790
so taxes are required.

209
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,790
How much tax?

210
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
Twenty percent of the principal.

211
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,200
And they want us to transfer it first.

212
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,360
Twenty percent.

213
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,630
That's 100,000 yuan.

214
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,510
Look at our current financial situation.

215
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
We barely have
100,000 yuan saved up.

216
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,480
If we really encounter scammers...

217
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,790
I'm scared too.

218
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,790
But all the information checks out.

219
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,550
Scammer

220
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,670
can't possibly know such specifics.

221
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,870
And those few
who got money in the group,

222
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,510
I privately added them and asked.

223
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,120
I checked all their Moments.

224
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,720
They look legit.

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,360
Alright.

226
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,910
This time,

227
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,720
we must be cautious.

228
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
[Transfer slip]

229
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,840
Sir, Ma'am.

230
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,510
You want to transfer money?

231
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,550
Yes.

232
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,200
Take out the money from the passbook.

233
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,480
Transfer it to this account.

234
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,030
Do you know the recipient?

235
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,600
Yes.

236
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,790
Yes, we do.

237
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,200
What's your relationship?

238
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,550
We...

239
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,030
He's my son.

240
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,960
You're Mr. Ding.

241
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,550
The person you're transferring to

242
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,840
doesn't share your surname.

243
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,870
My son shares my surname.

244
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:47,670
Right.

245
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,120
Right.

246
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,550
What's going on here?

247
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,080
I'm transferring money to my own child,
and you ask so many questions.

248
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,120
Does your bank

249
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,270
want to go out of business?

250
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,480
It's not like that.

251
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,240
Telecom fraud
has been rampant these past two years.

252
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,360
For security reasons,
we need to ask more questions.

253
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,750
See?

254
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,420
[Wang Xiuhong's ID]

255
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,750
My son shares my surname.

256
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,550
No problem, right?

257
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,000
Hurry with the transfer.

258
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,120
My son needs the money urgently.

259
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,000
If this gets delayed,
I'll file a complaint.

260
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,440
Everything's packed.

261
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,670
Have breakfast before leaving.

262
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
No need, I called a ride.

263
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,200
Mom.

264
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,360
Why did you insist on
Xiaozhou moving out?

265
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,150
Didn't I already tell you?

266
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,080
We don't have enough room when Grandpa returns.

267
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,790
Hu Manli.

268
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,440
My newly place isn't far from here.

269
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,750
If you need any help,

270
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,870
you can always come to me.

271
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,670
Xiaozhou,

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,240
you chose it on purpose, didn't you?

273
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,270
Of course.

274
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,670
I still need to tutor you, right?

275
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,000
So thoughtful.

276
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,750
If in these coming days,

277
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,120
you don't have time
to take care of Daer.

278
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,000
You can send him to me.

279
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,320
Is that okay, Mom?

280
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,910
No way.

281
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,080
Don't spoil him.

282
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,390
You should pay more attention
to your own work.

283
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:24,910
Got it?

284
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,630
Baodan.

285
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
I'll miss you, Baodan.

286
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,240
Coming down now.

287
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,150
You can't forget about me.

288
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,960
Baodan, I'll miss you.

289
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,150
Enough of that.

290
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,360
It's not like
we'll never see each other again.

291
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,550
We live so close.

292
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,960
If anything comes up,

293
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,480
you can still turn to Xiaozhou.

294
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,390
Then I'll be off.

295
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,750
Let me walk you out.

296
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,550
It's really heavy.

297
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,270
Here, put it on my back.

298
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,080
Xiaozhou,

299
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,320
send me the address.

300
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,360
I'll visit you.

301
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,960
Already sent it.

302
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,510
Alright, go back now.

303
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,030
Be a good boy.

304
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,080
Go on.

305
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,600
Mom.

306
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,510
You don't want Xiaozhou to leave either.

307
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,320
Right?

308
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,200
Of course.

309
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,120
You'll grow attached to a pet,

310
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,790
let alone a person.

311
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,030
Then I'll call him back.

312
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,630
Sit down.

313
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,910
I don't think he wants to leave either.

314
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,480
Sleeping arrangements?

315
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,120
I can squeeze in with him.

316
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,390
No need.

317
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,600
Don't see him unless necessary.

318
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,240
But that's not what you just told him.

319
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,750
He's doing well in his career now.

320
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,030
I can't hold him back.

321
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Can't be a burden to him.

322
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,550
But shouldn't friends

323
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,910
help each other out?

324
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,480
You need him right now.

325
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,550
You don't have to
play the tragic hero, okay?

326
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,480
No.

327
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,480
I don't need anyone.

328
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,030
I can manage by myself.

329
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,790
Anyhow, from now on,

330
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,630
don't see him

331
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,080
without my permission.

332
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,870
You're so annoying.

333
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,320
You barely ate breakfast.
Drink your milk.

334
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:49,960
No.

335
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,870
Why is Wang's number disconnected?

336
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,390
Try message him.

337
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,960
Why did he block me? What...

338
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,080
Well...

339
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,440
Ask those who received money
in the group chat

340
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,550
if they have other
contact info for Wang.

341
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,120
What?

342
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,750
How come this group got disbanded?

343
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,150
It's over.

344
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,550
We're finished now.

345
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,270
Lost even our funeral savings.

346
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,870
Hurry, call Zhiyuan.

347
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,120
Get him to figure something out.

348
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,150
You can't get

349
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,790
a word out of him if you tried.

350
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,510
What's the point telling him anything?

351
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,120
Back then, we always had Manli

352
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,840
to handle these things for us.

353
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,750
How come now you...

354
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,080
Manli?

355
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,270
Right. Go to Manli.

356
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,550
She doesn't have to help us now.

357
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,480
Can't worry about that anymore.

358
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
When that investment scheme collapsed,

359
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,440
Manli helped us
find the financial company.

360
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,840
She knows a lot of people.

361
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,360
She must know what's going on.

362
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,790
Let's go.

363
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,150
Hurry up!

364
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,390
Go!

365
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,480
Hurry up and eat the shrimp.

366
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,390
Finished your homework?

367
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,060
Yes.

368
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,000
But I can't solve two math problems.

369
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,550
I think...

370
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,200
No, you don't.

371
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,960
Look it up online yourself.

372
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,200
But my school teacher
came up with the question.

373
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,240
No solution online.

374
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,600
Then ask your classmates or teachers.

375
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,390
Could it be Xiaozhou?

376
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,480
Daer.

377
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,110
Grandpa, Grandma.

378
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,960
Why are you here?

379
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:14,880
What?

380
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,960
Your tone doesn't sound welcoming.

381
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,000
No, not at all.

382
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,030
Hello, you guys.

383
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,110
Welcome.

384
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,510
Come in.

385
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:24,830
Okay.

386
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,400
There's a homeowners' meeting tonight.
I need to go to

387
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,480
the property management office.

388
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,110
You stay home and keep

389
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,960
Grandpa and Grandma company, okay?

390
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,440
No rush, Manli.

391
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,070
We...

392
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,880
came to see you.

393
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,200
Me?

394
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,830
Well.

395
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,790
You might have fallen victim
to telecom fraud.

396
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,790
That can't be.

397
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,240
If they were scammers

398
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,960
how would they know

399
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,590
about the financial products
we bought years ago,

400
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,830
our home address,

401
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,480
and even our ID numbers?

402
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,640
It's obvious.

403
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,070
The financial company
sold your information.

404
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,350
That's impossible.

405
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,720
Manli.

406
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,350
Back then when you

407
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,070
helped us recover
those financial products,

408
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,400
the other party said

409
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,000
they would take full responsibility.

410
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,550
Seven or eight years have passed.

411
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,680
I reckon

412
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,960
it should be our turn by now.

413
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,440
You've been to this company before.

414
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,550
Could you help us go ask?

415
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,000
I suggest you report to

416
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,440
the police immediately.

417
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,480
There might still be hope of
recovering the money.

418
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,550
That Wang

419
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,590
was actually quite decent.

420
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,550
He couldn't be a scammer, could he?

421
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,960
Besides, we're

422
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,480
not those uneducated elderly folks.

423
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,790
We're not that easily fooled.

424
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,830
Alright then.

425
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,720
In that case,

426
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,550
you go ask Wang again?

427
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,000
I...

428
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:37,680
You're...

429
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,310
Manli.

430
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,790
Do you not want to
help with this matter?

431
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,720
It's not that I don't want to help.

432
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,350
I simply don't know how to help.

433
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,720
Manli.

434
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,510
Are you still upset about the breakup?

435
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,070
That's completely unrelated.

436
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,640
It's been so long already.

437
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,830
I understand.

438
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,640
Back then,

439
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,680
Zhiyuan who abandoned you

440
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,960
and started a new family.

441
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,070
Now his current wife

442
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,750
is about to give birth soon.

443
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,310
But let us make this clear.

444
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,030
This money is for Daer.

445
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,510
So,

446
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,000
take it seriously.

447
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,400
I appreciate your kindness.

448
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,720
I appreciate it on Daer's behalf too.

449
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,200
But Dingding is my son.

450
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,790
I can support him.

451
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,440
No need for you to worry.

452
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,350
It's getting late.

453
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,070
Maybe you should head back first.

454
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,960
Dingding has school tomorrow.

455
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,510
Look at you.

456
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,750
You're so cold-hearted.

457
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,400
That's not appropriate.

458
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,680
There are things I didn't want to say.

459
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,790
But since this is your attitude,

460
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,790
fine,

461
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,270
then we won't hold back either.

462
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,960
The root of this current trouble

463
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,510
lies with you.

464
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,750
The root lies with me?

465
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,790
You must be mistaken.

466
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,720
Not a penny of

467
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,240
your money ever made it into my account.

468
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,160
That can't be right.

469
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,030
Back then, the one million
relocation compensation

470
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,550
was intended to use for our retirement.

471
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,480
Then 500K vanished in
financial management.

472
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It was you who suggested

473
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,200
to use the remaining 500K

474
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,790
to buy an education annuity for Daer.

475
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,110
And you'd take care of
our retirement, right?

476
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,160
Now that you've split with Zhiyuan,

477
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,590
the money belonging to me and my husband

478
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,640
should be returned to us.

479
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,830
These are two separate matters.

480
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,920
That money was used

481
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,720
to buy insurance for Dingding.

482
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,160
Whether I'm with Ding Zhiyuan or not

483
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,750
has nothing to do with the child.

484
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,030
He's still your grandson, isn't he?

485
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,790
That's not how it works.

486
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,200
Once the money was given, how it's used

487
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,640
was entirely up to you.

488
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,000
We had no way of knowing.

489
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,350
Moreover,

490
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,000
raising children is parents' responsibility.

491
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,440
Grandparents helping is a blessing.

492
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,030
Not helping is only natural.

493
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,510
Since you won't help us
get the money back,

494
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,200
we won't help raise your child either.

495
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,270
Coming.

496
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,830
Hello, your delivery.

497
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,270
Thank you.

498
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,720
Give it a good shake
to get the fruit pieces.

499
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,960
Having hot pot?

500
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,720
Amazing.

501
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,030
You've been eating here
for free for so long.

502
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,830
But today's dish is special.

503
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,640
It costs extra

504
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,480
fifty.

505
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,920
Who would you like to pay?

506
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,400
I eat for free?

507
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,830
Fine, I won't argue with you.

508
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,270
Lucky I'm smart.

509
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,720
I smelled hotpot.

510
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,110
I knew you'd pull this trick.

511
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,350
I ordered takeout.

512
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,070
Here.

513
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,160
Hotpot.

514
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,070
What's so great about hotpot?

515
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,030
Spicy stew!

516
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,830
Want me to share some with you?

517
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,640
I'm not like your mom,
I won't charge you.

518
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,350
No thanks.

519
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,830
Haven't you read?

520
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,160
What?

521
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,160
What? Show me.

522
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,000
Show me.

523
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,270
Delivery guy

524
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,310
spit in the spicy stew,

525
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,920
then shook it up.

526
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,350
Xiaozhou.

527
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,720
It's fine.

528
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,510
News is just news.

529
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,920
You... enjoy it.

530
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,030
The delivery guys around here

531
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,070
probably wouldn't do that.

532
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:40,880
Yeah.

533
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,750
I... I'm not very hungry,
I'll eat later.

534
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,750
Um... Xiaozhou.

535
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,480
Want some juice?

536
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,110
It's free.

537
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:48,720
No need.

538
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,200
You're just being stubborn.

539
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,030
I'm giving you a chance now.

540
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,480
If you beg me now,

541
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,350
I can still give you

542
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,510
the original price of fifty.

543
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,830
Home-cooked meals

544
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,350
are both delicious and healthy.

545
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,030
Right, Dingding?

546
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,830
Use this strainer.

547
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,240
I picked it up.

548
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,400
Shall I pay here?

549
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,270
No problem.

550
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,750
Let me get you a bowl.

551
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,550
I'll grab another cup.

552
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,510
He gets drinks with the meal?

553
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:38,680
It's a combo.

554
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,310
Sir, enjoy.

555
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,030
I happened to run into Mr. Huang and

556
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,440
mentioned it in passing.

557
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,240
Mr. Huang

558
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,750
knows someone at the Health Bureau.

559
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,750
They called, and there

560
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,590
happened to be a vacant bed.

561
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,350
So Dad...

562
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,240
I mean,

563
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,200
Daer's grandpa got admitted.

564
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,240
Don't be too modest.

565
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,240
For you to ask someone for help,

566
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,830
I appreciate the gesture.

567
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,750
Let me buy you to dinner
after this is over.

568
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,400
Hu Manli, is it because

569
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,200
I'm in your way?

570
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,830
Some things

571
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,680
are better left unsaid.

572
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,790
I'll say this one last time.

573
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,550
That money was used
to buy insurance for Dingding.

574
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,310
You agreed to it initially, didn't you?

575
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,240
Now we're having second thoughts.

576
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,960
Can you get the money back
just by changing your mind?

577
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,790
Then do that to the scammer.

578
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,680
Didn't I just explain?

579
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,200
Wang couldn't be a scammer.

580
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:30,790
Okay.

581
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,750
Wang isn't a scammer.

582
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,030
He's just redistributing your assets

583
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,750
according to your intelligence level.

584
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,880
Now that's not right.

585
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,830
How dare you speak to me like this?

586
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,550
Look down on me
when everything's fine

587
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,920
but come running when there's trouble.

588
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,110
I'm kind, not stupid.

589
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,000
Why are you here?

590
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,270
I asked him to come.

591
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,790
Let's talk in the study.

592
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,240
As you can see my situation,

593
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,920
I'm having some work problems.

594
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,920
I'm not doing as good .

595
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,880
Now my father's bedridden.

596
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,350
I definitely don't have the money.

597
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,920
If you and your parents insist on this,

598
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,200
I can make things ugly.

599
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,110
Don't stoop to their level.

600
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,720
Don't worry.

601
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,400
This money will definitely
go to our son.

602
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,880
I can guarantee that.

603
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,750
I believe you.

604
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,510
Then please go back there

605
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,070
and explain to your parents, okay?

606
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:58,680
You...

607
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,400
Go ahead.

608
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,750
What's wrong?

609
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:12,960
Nothing.

610
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,270
I brought this upon myself.

611
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,720
She's pregnant.

612
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,790
Always orders me around.

613
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,030
The slightest dissatisfaction,

614
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,440
and she gives me attitude.

615
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,270
It's just strange.

616
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,480
You weren't like that when pregnant.

617
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,510
I wish I could.

618
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,680
But I don't have her privileges.

619
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,790
Giving you attitude?

620
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,030
In the end I'd the one who suffered.

621
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,960
Her tantrums

622
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,160
have become unbearable.

623
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,680
So I thought of bringing my parents

624
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,480
to help care for her.

625
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,350
But never expected

626
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,440
Never I expected...

627
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,070
You'd gain three more masters.

628
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,270
You thought two negatives
make a positive.

629
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,350
But married life

630
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,270
isn't as simple as math problems.

631
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,030
Professor Ding,

632
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,880
you've made your bed, now lie in it.

633
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,240
Serves you right.

634
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,310
That's right.

635
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,440
I've made your bed, now lie in it.

636
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,440
I deserve this.

637
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,200
It's all karma.

638
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,590
I won't laugh at you anymore.

639
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,350
If you're depressed,

640
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,590
it won't do good to our son.

641
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,030
Adjust your mindset yourself.

642
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:44,830
Anyway,

643
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,960
I still want to thank you.

644
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,240
All these recent events
have made me realize

645
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,960
you did so much

646
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,350
and bore so much for me before.

647
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,880
But back then,

648
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,160
I didn't see it.

649
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,310
If you'd said that earlier,

650
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,960
I wouldn't have
pushed you into the river.

651
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,400
Zhiyuan, what are you talking about?

652
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,000
Why keeping it from me and your dad?

653
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,160
Here we go again.

654
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:35,830
Zhiyuan.

655
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,480
There are some things

656
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,200
I don't know if you want to hear.

657
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,550
Go ahead.

658
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,200
Your parents

659
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,030
are intellectuals,

660
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,350
but when people get old,

661
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,640
they become willful

662
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,680
and unreasonable.

663
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,790
At such times, children should be firm.

664
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,750
You can't indulge them in everything.

665
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,640
Just like my dad.

666
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,200
If from the very beginning,

667
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,790
I'd disciplined him when he

668
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,000
wouldn't take his meds,

669
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,110
he wouldn't be hospitalized
with a stroke now.

670
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,160
This is my experience.

671
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,790
Listen to me if you want.

672
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,200
Before,

673
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,830
I was helping you play this role.

674
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,350
Now that I'm gone,

675
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,440
you'll have to play this role yourself.

676
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,830
If you think I've said too much,

677
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:35,960
don't be upset.

678
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:39,790
No.

679
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,030
I think what you said
makes a lot of sense.

680
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,550
Thank you.

681
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,440
Zhiyuan.

682
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,640
What did she say to you
just now in the study?

683
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,750
Nothing.

684
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,720
Dad, Mom.

685
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,590
Call the police.

686
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,030
Call the police?

687
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,030
If we weren't scammed,
why call the police?

688
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,920
That's right, Zhiyuan.

689
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,400
Hu Manli fooled you

690
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,550
with just a few words

691
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,240
She's just refusing to
repay our family's money.

692
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,000
Don't disturb her again.

693
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,310
Forget it.
Don't interfere in this matter.

694
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,720
I can see clearly

695
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,960
you're no match for her.

696
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,480
I said don't disturb her again!

697
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,270
Don't you understand?

698
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:22,750
Listen to me!

699
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:23,920
Get in! Go home!

700
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,200
Dad, Mom.

701
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,640
Don't leave yet.

702
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,510
Listen.

703
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,830
I've booked you train tickets for tomorrow

704
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,750
at 10 a.m.

705
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,000
The fastest one available.

706
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,110
Pack your things tonight.

707
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,070
I'll see you off
after breakfast tomorrow.

708
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,000
Zhiyuan.

709
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,510
Are you trying to kick us out?

710
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,550
You've been here for
quite a while now.

711
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,320
You've mostly finished
what needed to be done.

712
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,480
Lately I've been running
between school and work.

713
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,030
I don't have time to take care of you.

714
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,030
Go home.

715
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,360
You can come back later.

716
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,190
Done.

717
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,230
Tickets ready.

718
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,070
But we haven't accomplished anything
we came for.

719
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,840
Enough! Stop talking, just stop!

720
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,710
Can't you hear what he's implying?

721
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,510
He's kicking us out.

722
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,230
Then...

723
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,000
The book club thing,

724
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,400
you won't let your father attend either?

725
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,880
I've thought about this matter.

726
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,070
It's inappropriate.

727
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,280
Inappropriate?

728
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,510
Indeed.

729
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,670
We should never have come.

730
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,550
Inappropriate!

731
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,320
Go!

732
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,920
You're the one who invited us here.

733
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,550
Now you're driving us away.

734
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,510
Hey.

735
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,360
Your son has become successful now

736
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,630
and disowns his parents.

737
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,550
Dad, Mom.

738
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,000
it's not what you think.

739
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,280
If you think that way, there's

740
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,550
nothing I can do.

741
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,710
Get some rest.

742
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,190
Ding Zhiyuan.

743
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,510
Remember this.

744
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,710
This path was your own choice.

745
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,510
You'll have to walk every slope
yourself from now on.

746
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,800
From this day forward,

747
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,230
I'll never be your safety net
in life again.

748
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,710
If you fall into quicksand
and can't get out,

749
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,000
you can just wait there to die slowly.

750
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,000
Before, it was me
helping you play this role.

751
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
Now there's no more me.

752
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,400
You'll have to play this role yourself.

753
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,320
Zhiyuan.

754
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,590
I heard everything you said

755
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,880
downstairs earlier.

756
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,030
I know asking you to
talk to your parents

757
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,110
is very difficult.

758
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,030
Thank you, Zhiyuan.

759
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,550
I know you did this for me.

760
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,880
What I'm doing

761
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,150
isn't for anyone's sake.

762
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:31,960
It needs to be done,

763
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,280
so I did it.

764
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,400
Once the words are spoken,

765
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,360
so be it.

766
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,480
Alright.

767
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,230
It's very late.

768
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,000
Hurry and wash up.

769
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,280
It's the baby's bedtime story later.

770
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,070
Come.

771
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,630
Lisu.

772
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,180
Yes?

773
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,840
I've been busy all day.

774
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,150
I'm tired.

775
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,480
Let's skip the story tonight.

776
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,440
I know you're busy

777
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,880
and tired.

778
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,630
Okay.

779
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,710
Then let's pause for tonight.

780
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,070
Let's stop it altogether.

781
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,110
I know saying this

782
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,920
will definitely upset you.

783
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,920
But lately, I've been

784
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,110
accompanying you

785
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,590
to all kinds of prenatal classes and

786
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,110
practicing yoga with you.

787
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,360
Every night,

788
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,590
I have to read bedtime stories
to the baby.

789
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,280
I'm truly exhausted.

790
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,000
So I hope

791
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,510
from today onward,

792
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,070
I'll be there when necessary.

793
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,280
If not,

794
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,030
please don't involve me anymore.

795
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,920
Zhiyuan.

796
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,280
It's fine if you don't go.

797
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,960
But when it comes to the baby,

798
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,800
which part do you think is unnecessary?

799
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,000
I told you. The doctor said

800
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,150
they already have a pulse

801
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,230
and a heartbeat.

802
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,400
- They respond to... - Sorry.

803
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,400
They're human, and so am I.

804
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,190
Do you remember

805
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,150
what you said back then when you

806
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,960
persuaded me to separate?

807
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,880
"An exhausted man

808
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,920
can never become
a good husband or father."

809
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,630
So I hope

810
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,110
first and foremost,

811
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,000
to live my life at my own pace,

812
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,840
only then can I fulfill your needs,

813
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,030
the baby's needs,

814
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,150
and others' expectations of me.

815
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,590
I hope you can understand.

816
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,400
I understand.

817
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,320
Since you put it that way,

818
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,920
I get it now.

819
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,480
Get some rest.

820
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,400
I'll come after finishing this chapter.

821
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,840
Thank you.

822
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,500
[Court summons]

823
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,840
I absolutely didn't deceive any clients.

824
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,360
I've been in this industry for so long.

825
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,920
I wouldn't lack
basic professional ethics.

826
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,320
Manli, don't be hasty.

827
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,590
Blue Ocean's legal department
agreed to mediation.

828
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,030
Let's have a proper discussion.

829
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,440
Mr. Zhao, long time no see.

830
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,400
Hello.

831
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,400
I'm Li.

832
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,920
I'm a court mediator.

833
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,030
Hello.

834
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm the company's legal counsel, Zhao.

835
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,480
Let's sit down and talk.

836
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,070
Okay.

837
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,400
I've reviewed your dispute.

838
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,030
It goes like this.

839
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,110
Manli.

840
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,440
When you were at Blue Ocean,

841
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,760
did you sell
a unit-linked insurance policy?

842
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:10,880
Let me remind you.

843
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,110
Ma Yong from Hengtian Timber.

844
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,920
Is there any issue with this policy?

845
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Seven years ago,

846
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,800
you sold 3 million in unit-linked insurance to Ma.

847
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,230
Now he wants to cash out,

848
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,000
only to discover

849
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,710
the principal has dwindled to just over 100K.

850
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,920
The client sued Blue Ocean,

851
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,710
demanding 4 million in principal plus interest.

852
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,550
The court ultimately
ruled against the company.

853
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,360
And then?

854
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:35,710
Manli.

855
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,480
The company believes

856
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,880
when you originally
sold this insurance product,

857
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,960
you operated non-standardly,

858
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
failed as required

859
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,150
to disclose all risks to the client.

860
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,630
Now the company wants to sue you

861
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,000
to have you compensate this amount.

862
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,070
That's impossible.

863
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,070
Nonsense.

864
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,590
I've been in this line of work
most of my life.

865
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,320
How could I not understand
the procedures?

866
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,110
How can you say I didn't inform them?

867
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,880
Calm down.

868
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,030
Look.

869
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,280
The client already had
a handwriting verification done.

870
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,960
The risk disclosure section
is in your handwriting.

871
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,000
You wrote it for them back then.

872
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,840
This is a serious violation.

873
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,580
[I'm aware of the risk involved.
Ma Yong]

874
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,280
Mr. Ma, I've received it.

875
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,760
Let me verify first.

876
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,230
One moment.

877
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,360
Mr. Ma.

878
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,480
Why didn't you fill out
the risk disclosure section at the back?

879
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,760
Probably just missed it.

880
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:57,710
What should we do?

881
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,110
It's okay, where are you?

882
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,150
I'll come see you.

883
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,150
I'm on a plane,

884
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,280
about to take off.

885
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,590
Business trip?

886
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:05,960
Where to?

887
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,230
South America, to inspect timber.

888
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,800
How long until you're back?

889
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,590
Well, hard to say.

890
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,510
Probably about a month.

891
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:14,960
That long?

892
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,230
Well...

893
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,000
Manli, just write it for me.

894
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,840
You want me to copy it for you?

895
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,960
Just do it for me.

896
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:25,960
My flight's about to take off.

897
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:26,710
Bye.

898
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,920
- Wait, Mr... - We'll talk when I'm back.

899
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,480
The client asked me to do it.
