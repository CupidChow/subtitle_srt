Come.

42
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,430
What are you doing?

43
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,640
Today, the contract with Mr. Ai's family

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,510
is officially sealed.

45
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,640
I'll be No. 1 in performance.

46
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,000
So.

47
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,000

50
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,920
I'll then inform the company.

51
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,640
Why are you still thinking about this?

52
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,760
Of course.

53
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,710
Hu Manli.

54
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,950
This means a lot to you.

55
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,760
You won—you deserve it.

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
Since I'm this outstanding,

57
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,360
then lend me some more money.

58
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,190
Ask the company to add more funds.

59
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,080
I want this car.

60
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:29,870
That won't do.

61
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,190
The budget is way over.

62
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,000
So it seems you still have

63
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,310
no confidence in our future.

64
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,800
If all else fails, take a loan.
We'll take it.

65
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,360
Getting carried away, huh?

66
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,280
Let's go.

67
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,190

73
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,180
Yes.

74
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,560
Hey, Ms. Hu.

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,030
Fresh out of the oven, still warm.

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,150
Save two packs for me.

77
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:07,960
Why are you here?

78
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,400
Welcome back, Ms. Hu.

79
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,150
Want some duck?

80
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,120

81
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,360
Hello, Ms. Hu.

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,870
Here, check out the fresh produce.

83
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,910
Look. Beef, vegetables,

84
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,800
and shrimp.

94
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,750
Good, very fresh. All fresh!

96
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,590

97
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,520

98
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,000
I've prepared two fish for you.

99

For free?

101
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,430
Yes, for you. A gift.

102
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,000
No, no gift.

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,120
Let me pay. Here.

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,360
- I'll scan the code. - No, don't!

105

No, no, absolutely not.

106
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,030
You can't.

107
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,520
No, that's not okay.

108

109
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,750
I'm so flattered.

110
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,360
Not at all.

111
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Don't mention it.

112
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,590
Well then, I'll accept. Thanks!

Sometimes I really don't get it.

116
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,510
Are you actually vain

117
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,600
or down-to-earth?

118
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,360

134
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,310
Nothing else can give me this feeling.

135
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,870

Hello, reservation for Mr. Xue.

193
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,870
Table 12, this way please.

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,390
Thank you.

195
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,240
Come.

196
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:32,910
Sit.

197
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,750
This is ridiculous.

198
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,960
You're serious about this.

199
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,630
Didn't you want a Michelin restaurant?

200
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, I want to go to space too.

201
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,840
Make that happen?

202
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,480
Well, not right now.

203
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,720
We're having Western food?

204
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,390
Have a look.

205
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,870
Oh my god, it's so expensive!

206
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,270
Let's go.

207
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,390
We're already here.

208
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,120
Just give me
the meal's cash equivalent, okay?

209
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,750
Let's leave.

210
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,790
I've already ordered.

211
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,550
Such a waste of money.

212
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,200
Hu Manli.

213
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,960
I have something very important
to tell you.

214
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,320
What is it?

215
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,150
Is it good news or bad news?

216
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,480
For me, it's definitely good news.

217
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,360
But for you...

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,510
No.

219
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,030
It's fine.

220
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,550
I knew this day would come eventually.

221
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,480
It's okay, I can accept it.

222
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,270
All good things must come to an end.

223
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,200
We should...

224
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,390
part on good terms.

225
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,480
Eating at such a nice place,

226
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,630
you should've told me earlier.

227
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,670
I would've worn something nicer.

228
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,000
Could've taken some photos
for social media.

229
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,360
Parting on good terms?

230
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,200
In your dreams.

231
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm not leaving you.

232
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,320
Then... what is it?

233
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
Li Qingqing wants to

234
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,630
promote me to director.

235
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
That's great news!

236
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,120
Then why that expression?

237
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
She wants me to
lead the new venture at TSI,

238
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,960
family office.

239
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,960
It specializes in wealth succession
for high-net-worth clients.

240
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,390
She said I've only been here for
six months and have done

241
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,240
exceptionally well.

242
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,480
I closed several major deals and

243
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,550
even set up a trust.

244
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,000
That's why this proposal came about.

245
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,480
Did you accept it?

246
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,550
Not yet. She gave me a week to consider.

247
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,510
Text her right now, this instant.

248
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,270
Tell her you can start tomorrow.

249
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,000
But all my current achievements

250
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,240
are actually your accomplishments.

251
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,960
Truthfully, I'm just your puppet.

252
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,840
Everything I've gained today

253
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,200
rightfully belongs to you.

254
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,790
Actually I...

255
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,510
I don't have any real capability.

256
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,200
Right? I always feeling like a thief.

257
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,080
Xue Xiaozhou.

258
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,240
You were never the modest type.

259
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,000
Accept it immediately.

260
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,240
And about this family office business,

261
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,510
I'm completely unfamiliar with it.

262
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,600
I don't know what I should do.

263
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
You educated folks

264
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,960
always overcomplicate things.

265
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,550
When I worked reception at Blue Ocean,

266
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,750
I wanted to sell insurance.

267
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,670
Mr. Jin hesitated.

268
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,030
So I told him

269
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,630
it's just selling products.

270
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,000
What's so difficult?

271
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,240
Now I'm saying the same to you.

272
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,910
Family office is just a different name.

273
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,630
It's still selling products.

274
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,220
Hey.

275
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,360
Look at that guy behind you.

276
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,720
Wine not ready yet?

277
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,360
Fresh new-world wine
doesn't need decanting.

278
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,440
Try it again.

279
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,630
Okay.

280
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,390
He looks quite confident, doesn't he.

281
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,630
When I just walked in, I passed by him.

282
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,580
Saw him searching for
decanting knowledge online.

283
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,660
[Does new-world wine need decanting?]

284
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,440
So what?

285
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,910
So you see,

286
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,030
these people are just filling vacancies
without real qualifications.

287
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,630
Those who seem more capable than you

288
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,320
might actually be worse than you.

289
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,240
They're just good at pretending

290
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
and a bit more daring.

291
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,080
Got it?

292
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,480
The brave enjoy the world first.

293
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,870
Be bolder!

294
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
Do you really think I can?

295
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,630
Of course you can!

296
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,390
You just didn't know.

297
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,750
Now I'm telling you.

298
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:00,720
Okay.

299
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:01,960
I believe you.

300
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:02,960
That's right.

301
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:03,960
Work hard.

302
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:04,870
Got it?

303
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,910
Xiaozhou,

304
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,240
you'll be my pension insurance
from now on.

305
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,390
As for me,

306
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll be like a Buddha statue,

307
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,200
sitting at home,

308
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,080
relying on your support.

309
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Okay, I'll look after you.

310
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,270
I'm too full.

311
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,790
Can't eat anymore.

312
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,270
This meal will make me
gain three pounds.

313
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,630
Waiter.

314
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,440
Bill please.

315
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:02,870
He's paying.

316
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,510
Let me check.

317
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,550
Scan this.

318
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,150
This is...

319
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,440
There's a service charge?

320
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,390
Yes.

321
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,030
It's fine.

322
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,870
What are you laughing at over there?

323
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,120
Didn't you see
the waitress's look just now?

324
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,270
Her eyes nearly popped out.

325
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,910
Why?

326
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,910
She must be thinking.

327
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,320
What's the relationship
between these two?

328
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,080
The way we talk doesn't

329
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,910
sound like colleagues.

330
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,870
At your age,
you can't possibly be my son.

331
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,510
She definitely thinks

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,150
we're that kind of relationship.

333
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,840
What kind?

334
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,600
One is paying for the company.

335
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,910
You're my kept woman?

336
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,440
You're my kept man, obviously.

337
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
At my age, who'd keep me?

338
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
That's ridiculous.

339
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,200
That waitress

340
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,510
finally figured out our relationship.

341
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,670
Then you said "I'll look after you."

342
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,670
You even paid the bill.

343
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,510
Great, now she's completely confused.

344
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,870
She must be thinking

345
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,390
how can someone so young
have such unusual tastes?

346
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,910
Don't say that. It's not funny at all.

347
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,030
I was just joking.

348
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,240
Can't take a joke anymore?

349
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,360
You can joke about others,

350
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,790
but you shouldn't joke about yourself.

351
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,000
Besides, someone like you

352
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,870
might actually
have someone willing to keep you.

353
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,620
Oh my!

354
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,390
Really?

355
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,600
Thanks.

356
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,480
Though I know it's not true,

357
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,600
it still makes me happy to hear.

358
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,790
Say it more often.

359
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,550
Don't worry, I'll try.

360
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,840
Xue Xiaozhou

361
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,320
has only been with us for six months and

362
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,390
hasn't closed many deals,

363
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,960
but every deal has been a big one.

364
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,870
Recently,

365
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,600
he astonishingly
secured a family heritage case.

366
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,200
The amount on this deal

367
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,550
broke TSI's five-year record.

368
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,510
Excuse me.

369
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,120
Could you help me record this?

370
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,510
Is everything ready?

371
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,360
Ready.

372
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,630
All set.

373
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
Let's get a Super Supreme with

374
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,390
double cheese

375
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,120
and some egg tarts.

376
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Chicken wings sound good too.

377
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,790
Get some fries.

378
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,360
How are you feeling now?

379
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,320
Pretty much like normal.

380
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,910
Just that my fingers
aren't as nimble as before.

381
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,390
Doesn't affect daily life for now.

382
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,360
Yeah, life goes on.

383
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,720

the world's most famous ALS patient.

384
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,960
He fought the disease for over 40 years

385
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,630
while still contributed to the world.

386
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
Spare me.

387
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,790
If it really comes to that,

388
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,600
you'll definitely be one
pushing my wheelchair.

389
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,480
Absolutely.

390
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,120
But maybe I'll be paralyzed before you.

391
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,550
Maybe you'll be pushing me.

392
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,380
Bah! Touch wood!

393
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,200
You don't have to cheer me up
by cursing yourself.

396

405
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,030

Look.

409
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
[Share my important moment with you]

410
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,960
Let's begin then.

411
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,830
First, please share with us

412
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,790
your professional journey.

413
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,030
Actually when I
first entered this industry,

414
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,750
I was a claims adjuster.

415
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,400
My daily work involves
dealing with clients

416
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,110
and their sales representatives.

417
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,920
Frankly speaking,

418
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,920
most salespeople in this industry
only have

419
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,350
superficial knowledge.

420
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,880
They mainly secure clients through

421
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,920
persistent pestering

422
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,240
and underhanded methods.

423
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,110
So back then,

424
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,270
I really looked down on

425
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,790
frontline sales staff.

426
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,750
Even in his interview,

427
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,200
he called me petty in roundabout ways.

428
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,270
Later,

429
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,030
by coincidence,

430
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,240
or perhaps not just coincidence,

431
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,200
to be precise,

432
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,440
I was forced into this position.

433
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,590
I became

434
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
a sales representative at TSI.

435
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,480
At the beginning,

436
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,070
I naively believed

437
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,110
that solid professional knowledge alone

438
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,750
would help me close deals.

439
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,240
But

440
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,440
reality kept hitting me with setbacks

441
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,110
until I encountered certain things

442
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,830
and met certain people.

443
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,590
Only then did I realize

444
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,000
my understanding of this industry

445
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
was so shallow.

446
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,790
After handling several deals,

447
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,880
I gradually

448
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,030
developed a proper

449
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,590
understanding of this industry.

450
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,720
Selling insurance and closing deals

451
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,790
aren't achieved by

452
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,790

and discussing data.

453

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm very grateful for this job,

457
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,160

458

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,110

You must save him.

570
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,720
Don't worry, we'll do our best.

571
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,790
Thank you, doctor.

572
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,720
Thank you.

573
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,160
Hu Manli, you need to stay calm now.

574
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,200
You can't afford to panic right now.

575
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,110
How can I stay calm?

576
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,440
It's all my fault.

577
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,350
I didn't care for him enough.

578
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,270
If anything happens to him today,

579
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,270
I'll hate myself forever.

580
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:54,880
Alright, alright.

581
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,160
Don't think about that now.

582
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,960
You need to calm down.

583
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,000
Take deep breaths.

584
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,270
Deep breaths.

585
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,400
Calm down a bit.

586
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,830
Calm down.

587
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,200
Daer will be out of school.

588
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,310
I need to pick him up.

589
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,680
No, no.

590
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,790
I...I'll go get him.

591
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,480
I'll take care of Dingding
these few days.

592
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,350
You stay here and focus.

593
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,310
Wait for Mr. Hu's good news, okay?

594
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,240
Can you do it?

595
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,920
Yes, yes.

596
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,160
- Thank you. - Trust me.

597
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,200
Ya.

598
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,720
Manli.

599
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,200
Xiaozhou has told me everything.

600
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:29,880
Don't worry.

601
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,830
I've informed my colleagues
in the emergency department.

602
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,240
They'll definitely do their best.

603
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,590
Thank you.

604
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,310
Ya, please look after her for me.

605
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,200
I need to go pick up Daer.

606
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,030
Pick up... her son.

607
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,070
Don't worry.

608
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,960
I'll be off.

609
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,720
Text me if anything comes up.

610
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,510
Okay, don't worry.

611
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,070
Thank you.

612
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,440
Don't panic. Stay calm.

613
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,110
Ya.

614
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,270
Thank you, Ya.

615
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,000
Don't worry.

616
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,550
What did you say?

617
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,240
She's being sued

618
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,480
and most likely to lose.

619
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,270
No, the company is being sued.

620
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,200
She had a major client buy a unit-linked insurance policy

621
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,440
Unit-linked insurance?

622
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,240
It doesn't guarantee principal, yes?

623
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,640
But seven years ago, the market was good.

624
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,920
You could get over 6% returns
with your eyes closed.

625
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,270
But recently,

626
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,400
The client's company
had a capital chain rupture.

627
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,640
They needed to cash out this insurance,

628
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,110
and find almost all the principal
was lost.

629
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,160
It doesn't make sense.

630
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,880
Investment carries risks
that buyers should be aware.

631
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,350
The client shouldn't be able to
win the lawsuit.

632
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,160
That's exactly the problem.

633
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,480
There wasn't dual recording before.

634
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,240
So when signing the contract,

635
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,270
the client must copy a sentence verbatim.

636
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,310
Basically what it means is

637
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,440
the client has been
made aware of the risks.

638
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,640
But this text

639
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,640
has now been professionally verified.

640
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
It's not written by the client.

641
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,640
It was written by Hu Manli
on their behalf.

642
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,590
She wrote it for them?

643
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,510
So the company
is bound to lose this lawsuit.

644
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,750
Hu Manli really has some nerve.

645
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,310
Putting on high morals in front of me

646
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,720
while secretly engaging in
all kinds of underhanded tricks.

647
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,350
I told you before.

648
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,200
She's cunning, isn't she?

649
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,240
But she's got good luck.

650
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,310
The company will have to
take the fall for her.

651
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,400
What do you mean?

652
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,720
She gets off scot-free?

653
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,350
That can't be right.

654
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,240
Such a perfect opportunity.

655
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,720
We can't let her get away with this.

656
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,590
Mr. Jin wants to suppress this matter.

657
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,240
Doesn't want headquarters to know.

658
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,830
If they really investigate, he'll

659
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,880
bear responsibility too.

660
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,960
Honey.

661
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,720
You know someone in the headquarters'
legal department, don't you?

662
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,110
This matter

663
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,270
should be reported to
headquarters, right?

664
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,550
It's not a small matter.

665
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:16,660
[How is it going?]

666
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,060
[Ya: Just out of operation.
Still critical]

667
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Remember to give Dingding
a glass of milk before bed.

668
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,750
Not straight from the fridge

669
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,790
and give it to him cold.

670
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,200
Heat it in the microwave
for 30 seconds.

671
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:47,940
[Don't worry about things at home]

672
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,220
[I can only count on you]

673
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,740
[My dad's ill.
Please look after Daer for a few days]

674
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,750
Daer.

675
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,270
Coming with your brother again?

676
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Hurry up or you'll be late.

677
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,440
You guys go ahead.

678
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,550
Hey, listen.

679
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,960
From now on, don't call me "brother".

680
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,070
Why not?

681
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:58,920
Is that wrong?

682
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,240
Strictly speaking, I should be an

683
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,750
"uncle".

684
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,310
You?

685
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,270
An uncle?

686
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,400
Why though?

687
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,590
If I'm your brother.

688
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,110
Your mom will be my elder.

689
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,070
That's different generations.

690
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
It's fine.

691
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,750
She's 12 years older.

692
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,790
She can be your "aunt".

693
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,110
Then I'm 15 years older than you.

694
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,200
Why can't I be an "uncle"?

695
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,680
Anyway, no more "brother", got it?

696
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,920
Fine, fine.

697
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,830
Then hurry up, old man.

698
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,400
I'm gonna be late.

699
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,110
You little brat.

700
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,310
Manli.

701
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,750
What brings you here?

702
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,680
How's your dad doing?

703
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,200
Had emergency surgery overnight.

704
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,960
Not out of danger yet.

705
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,750
If there's anything I can help with,

706
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,790
don't hesitate to ask.

707
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,790
Nothing, really.

708
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,960
Just keep an eye

709
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,480
on Daer these days.

710
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,350
Got it, no problem.

711
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,480
You go ahead.

712
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,790
No need to wait here.

713
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,830
Okay.

714
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:05,830
Here, take this.

715
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,640
What?

716
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,030
I can't accept this.

717
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,160
Take it back.

718
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,590
Don't be polite with me.

719
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,680
You used to earn more and

720
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,680
spent more on the family.

721
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,000
Now that I earn more,

722
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,240
I should contribute more.

723
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,070
Really didn't expect that.

724
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,550
Didn't expect what?

725
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,920
Here, have some water.

726
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,310
Didn't expect you to hold no grudge.

727
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,350
Last time,

728
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,310
I pushed you into the river.

729
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,750
Actually, I should thank you.

730
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,550
That push of yours last time

731
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,920
make me understand many truths.

732
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,780
Huh?

733
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,640
I mean it.

734
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,880
Zhiyuan.

735
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,510
We're not family now.

736
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,680
You know? I appreciate your kindness.

737
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,790
Don't say that.

738
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,790
Anyway

739
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,110
I've been drinking your father's
medicinal wine for many years.

740
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:12,920
Now.

741
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,070
Take this money as
payment for the medicinal wine.

742
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:15,830
Okay?

743
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,680
If you won't take it,
then I won't either.

744
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,310
Just leave it here.

745
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,750
Fine then.

746
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,590
I'll just consider this as
a regular friend visiting an elder.

747
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,790
Thank you on my father's behalf.

748
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,000
Hu Degong's family?

749
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,480
Here!

750
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,000
- Hu Degong? - Here.

751
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,440
How is he?

752
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,480
Hu Degong woke up.

753
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,440
That's wonderful!

754
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,640
Thank you, doctor.

755
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,200
Good.

756
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,310
Thank you.

757
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,030
All right, now you can rest easy.

758
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,310
Good.

759
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,070
It's alright.

760
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,480
Terrific.

761
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,000
He's fine now.

762
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,750
That's great.

763
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,350
Xiaozhou?

764
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,070
I came right after seeing Daer off.

765
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,640
I heard Mr. Hu is out of danger.

766
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,200
Yes.

767
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,310
Get some rest now.

768
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,030
I'll stay here.

769
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,790
I bought you breakfast.

770
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,400
Eat before you go.

771
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,640
Who are you?

772
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,350
My colleague, Xue Xiaozhou.

773
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,720
You met at my place.

774
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,480
That time with your uncle and aunt.

775
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,960
He took care of Daer for me yesterday.

776
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,550
Xue Xiaozhou.

777
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,830
Xiaozhou, right?

778
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,960
Thank you.

779
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,350
Manli.

780
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,270
I'll pick up Daer later.

781
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,440
Let him stay at my place for now.

782
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,920
I've already talked with Daer.

783
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,000
I'll take care of him these days.

784
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,510
Daer said
his grandparents are still here.

785
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,160
Professor Ding needs to host his parents

786
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,640
while also caring for his pregnant wife.

787
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,270
So let's not have Daer add to the chaos, right?

788
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,720
Then I won't stand on ceremony with you.

789
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,030
- Thanks you. - It's fine.

790
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,200
Daer enjoys playing with me too.

791
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,350
Hu Degong's family member, right?

792
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,880
Yes.

793
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,800
Hu Degong will be
transferred to a regular ward soon.

794
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,670
Let me explain a situation to you.

795
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,110
Currently, the wards are full.

796
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,190
For now, he can only
use an extra bed in the hallway.

797
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,980
What?

798
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,070
My father just came out of ICU.

799
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,280
He needs proper rest.

800
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,320
Could you please do something
about the bed situation?

801
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,360
Don't worry.

802
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,000
We'll arrange it
as soon as a bed becomes available.

803
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,440
Of course.

804
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,320
We provide the same level of care
to all patients.

805
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,510
Don't worry.

806
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,360
Thank you, doctor.

807
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,630
Okay.

808
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,110
Thank you.

809
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,400
Okay, I got it.

810
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,590
Thank you.

811
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:44,670
How did it go?

812
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,190
The hospital beds are indeed
quite tight right now.

813
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,760
But they've all said

814
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,000
as soon as any bed becomes available,

815
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,760
they'll admit Mr. immediately.

816
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,030
That's great.

817
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,760
Don't worry.

818
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,070
I'll visit him whenever I can.

819
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,840
Alright. Thank you so much.

820
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,590
Xiaozhou.

821
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,400
Well...

822
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,190
About the wedding photos.

823
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,960
What wedding photos?

824
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,480
I forgot to block you
when I posted them.

825
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,230
I only realized
when I saw you liked my post.

826
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,150
I didn't mean to upset you.

827
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,150
Ya.

828
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,150
I don't think you meant to upset me.

829
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm not that petty either.

830
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,920
Liking it didn't mean anything special.

831
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,400
I just wanted to

832
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,920
wish you happiness.

833
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,150
Really?

834
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,030
Well...

835
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,590
Can we still be friends?

836
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,360
Who wouldn't want a doctor friend?

837
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,590
I'll be off.

838
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,320
Come in.

839
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,670
Professor Ding.

840
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,230
Come, have a seat

841
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,110
You need something?

842
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,440
Well...

843
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,440
I remember one of your student's parents

844
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,110
works at the Health Bureau.

845
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,360
Right?

846
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,070
Is it about your wife's pregnancy?

847
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,960
No, it's my father-in-law.

848
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,070
Or rather, ex-father-in-law.

849
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,670
He's in some trouble now.

850
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,710
The first trial verdict of Mr. Ma's

851
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,030
unit-linked insurance is out.

852
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,710
The court ruled that we're at fault.

853
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,400
So...

854
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,670
We have to repay both principal

855
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,800
and interest of four million.

856
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,590
Then prepare for the second appeal.

857
00:36:59,320 --> 00:36:59,960
I don't recommend it.

858
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,670
The reason?

859
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,280
All the evidence proves
the responsibility lies with us.

860
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,480
A second appeal would only
delay the compensation.

861
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,480
Besides,

862
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,400
if this matter escalates,

863
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,440
it'll greatly damage
the company's reputation.

864
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,590
It won't just be
a four-million issue anymore.

865
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,550
In fact, this matter has already escalated.

866
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,400
After the verdict was issued, the

867
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,840
headquarters' legal department

868
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,630
gave me a call.

869
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,000
They demanded that we

870
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,280
must take action regarding this incident.

871
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,920
Hello?

872
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,590
Have you all been doing well ?

873
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,400
We've been good.

874
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,190
I need to tell you something.

875
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,230
Do you remember

876
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:40,800
a few years ago,

877
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,480
that wealth management project
we invested in together?

878
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,000
The one that went bust?

879
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,510
Yes, that one.

880
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,670
Now,

881
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,400
that investment company

882
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,920
is calling everyone
to return our principal.

883
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,800
Haven't they called?

884
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,760
No.

885
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,360
Is it true?

886
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,590
Of course it's true.

887
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:02,840
How about this?

888
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,510
I'll add you to the group chat.

889
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,360
That's what the group is discussing.

890
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,840
Okay, okay.

891
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,630
Alright.

892
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,230
Your phone is so loud.

893
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,710
I'm taking notes for the news right now.

894
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,800
So many scammers these days.

895
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,230
Better be careful.

896
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,190
Join the group first
to check the situation.

897
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,440
If we can get the principal back,

898
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,800
that would be best.

899
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,630
Need to hear it.

900
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,030
Dental appointment?

901
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,110
No problem.

902
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,230
We'll arrange
the best dental clinic for you.

903
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,190
Don't mention it.

904
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,000
Alright.

905
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,670
I can go on my own.

906
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,440
Go back to work.

907
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,320
That won't do.
Promised your mom I'd look after you.

908
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:41,920
I'll keep my word.

909
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,550
Walk you to the gate.

910
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,230
That's the twelfth call this morning.

911
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,230
Your interview video
was published yesterday.

912
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,360
Today you're flooded with friend requests,

913
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,030
and your phone is ringing nonstop.

914
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,800
Bye.

915
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,000
Don't forget me when you're rich, bro.

916
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,760
Stop. What should you call me?

917
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:53,590
Okay, fine.

918
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,110
Bye.

919
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,480
Bye.

920
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,670
Bye.

921
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,360
I'm off.

922
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,070
Got it.

923
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,150
Hey, Ya.

924
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,110
Hey, Xiaozhou.

925
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,440
Lived up to your trust.

926
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,960
Mr. Hu can move to
a four-person ward today.

927
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,760
Really?

928
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,580
Yes.

929
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,590
Wonderful!

930
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,110
Thank you.

931
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,190
How is it?

932
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,110
I heard Mr. Hu is all settled in.

933
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,230
Pretty good.

934
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,110
How's his condition?

935
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,510
Doctor says quite stable.

936
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,110
Thanks.

937
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,440
Okay.

938
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,190
What are you doing here?

939
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,070
I came to visit Daer's grandfather.

940
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,960
Dad.

941
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
Can you hear me, Dad?

942
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,000
Luckily Zhiyuan helped out this time.

943
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,280
Fortunately he put in a word
with Mr. Huang.

944
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,150
That's why you got this bed.

945
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,840
So it was you who pulled strings.

946
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,440
Not exactly pulling strings.

947
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,440
I happened to run into Mr. Huang.

948
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,320
Just mentioned it casually.

949
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,000
Mr. Huang

950
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,590
knows someone from the Health Bureau.

951
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,590
He made the call.

952
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,480
Happened to have a bed available.

953
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,480
Dad...

954
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:09,800
I mean,

955
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,440
Daer's grandfather was

956
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,360
checked in right away.

957
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,190
Don't be too modest.

958
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,760
For you to actually ask for help,

959
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,360
I appreciate the gesture.

960
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,510
Once I get through this busy period,

961
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,670
I'll buy you to dinner.

962
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:22,960
Since you've got company,

963
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,880
I'll head back to office.

964
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:24,940
Oh.

965
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,960
Dad.

966
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,710
Dad.

967
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,590
Hello?

968
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,280
Who's this?

969
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,150
Hello.

970
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,360
I'm the court clerk from
Jiangcheng District Court, Shanghai.

971
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,550
Court?

972
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,030
Hello, Director Xue.

973
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:13,920
Hello, Director Xue.

974
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,030
Director Xue, congrats.

975
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:18,670
Hello, Director Xue.

976
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,320
Director Xue, hello.

977
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,360
Director Xue.

978
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,360
Hello.

979
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,710
Let me.

980
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,190
I'll get it.

981
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,000
Here.

982
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,230
Director Xue, hello.

983
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,590
Congrats, Director Xue.

984
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,630
After you.

985
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:52,840
Please, you first.

986
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,550
Come in.

987
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,630
This is the office with the best view.

988
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,360
Ms. Li left especially for you.

989
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,320
Please thank Ms. Li for me.

990
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,880
Here are the documents provided by HR.

991
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,320
You can review them.

992
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,110
See if there are suitable candidates
to build your team.

993
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,110
Oh, right.

994
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,480
You have a driver's license?

995
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,880
Yes, but I don't own a car.

996
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,400
This car

997
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,360
is for you.

998
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,960
Ms. Li asked me to tell you,

999
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,070
you're now the
star salesperson of the company.

1000
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,840
You represent the company's image.

1001
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,360
All necessary resources

1002
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,360
will be provided.

1003
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,630
I'll take my leave now.

1004
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,880
Director Xue.

1005
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,670
