No way, bro.

58
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,070
You're that broke?

59
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,510
Picking me up from school?

60
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,640
I live in your house.

61
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,350
Your mom is having tea

62
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,640

63
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,480
No time for you.

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,070

Pfft. Let's go.

66
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,800
This actually tastes nice.

67
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,470
- Daer…
- We'll...

68
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
You mom didn't come?

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,750
She's busy.

70
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240

74
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,150
Hi.

75
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,590
Hi.

76
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,590
OK.

77
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,840
Drive safe.

78
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,030
Bye.

79
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:28,710
Bye.

80
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,360
Bye.

81
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,240
What do you want to eat?

82
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,190
Sweet and sour ribs.

83
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,630

84
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:45,800
Bye.

85
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,560
My mom's here.

86
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,750
Let's go.

87
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,630
You

88
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,630
like her?

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,120
No.

90
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't talk nonsense to my mom.

91
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,910
What nonsense?

92
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,360
Earlier you said...

93
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,560
you know.

94
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,000
You called it nonsense.

95
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,910
Why did you panic?

96
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,840
You.

97
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,360
Don't say a thing

98
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,310
after you go home.

99
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,280
Mom.

100
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,960
What's for dinner?

101
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,960
I'm starving.

102
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,630
Before that...

103
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,960
Baodan.

104
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,400
You have anything to tell me?

105
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,840
Come on.

106
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,310
No.

107
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,120
Think again.

108
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,000
Did you snitch on me already?

109
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,910
I didn't.

110
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,870
You know too?

111
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,800
Hey, this kind of thing.

112
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,400
It's actually

113
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,150
pretty normal, isn't it?

114
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,120
Normal.

115
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,560
He used to get

116
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,310
over 80 in English.

117
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,630
This time, 78.

118
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,750
Remember your promise.

119
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,400
If he gets low grades again,

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,280
you're the one to blame.

121
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,240
OK.

122
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
That's what you were talking about.

123
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,630
Or else?

124
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,630
You have other secrets?

125
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:24,950
No.

126
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,000
You'd better not.

127
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,240
Get your act together.

128
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,750
Focus on studies.

129
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,630
This week,

130
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,240
no phone or computer.

131
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,560
No.

132
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,830
Manli, this isn't fair.

133
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,560
Rome wasn't built

134
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,310
in one day.

135
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:45,920
Right?

136
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,720
You don't have to fret

137
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,430
over one single exam.

138
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
And you.

139
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,360
You fail your monthly exam too.

140
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,360
You attended a meeting this morning.

141
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,360
What about the afternoon?

142
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,240
I'm at hospital.

143
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,720
Meeting with my mom's surgeon.

144
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,720
On your way back,

145
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,560
how many clients did you call?

146
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,480
Tried to find new clients at hospital?

147
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,630
I can see you're slacking off.

148
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,950
Even your cat is called Baodan.

149
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,680
Can you be ambitious?

150
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,830
Let me tell you.

151
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,270
I find clients even in grocery market.

152
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,000
Easy.

153
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,430
It's just November.

154
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,430
Just?

155
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,070
You guys think things are easy.

156
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,600
I have to watch over your every step.

157
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,430
I'm exhausted.

158
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,120
Why are you still standing?

159
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,190
Wash your hands.

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,750
Then do your homework.

161
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,310
Make your money.

162
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,070
What a combo.

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,750
Remember them?

164
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,480
Not really.

165
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,310
Boss.

166
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,310
50 words in 50 minutes.

167
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,160
You can't do that?

168
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,920
What's on your mind?

169
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,240
The girl from earlier?

170
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,390
No.

171
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,430
Don't worry.

172
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
I'll work hard.

173
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,750
I won't mess up the next exam.

174
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,870
I'll keep you and Baodan here.

175
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:52,680
Forget it.

176
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,870
When you feel troubled,

177
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,720
you can't do well.

178
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,800
Tell me the truth.

179
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,160
My experience says I can't

180
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,680
tell the truth to a teacher.

181
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,000
OK.

182
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,680
Thought you're my big brother.

183
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,830
You didn't mean it.

184
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,680
Whatever.

185
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,040
Can you

186
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,600
keep it from my mom?

187
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,630
I hate

188
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,920
snitching the most.

189
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,800
Tell me.

190
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,600
Shiyan.

191
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
That girl from earlier.

192
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,040
Her dad will work in US.

193
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,950
She moves the day after tomorrow.

194
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:42,800
Go on.

195
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,800
I checked.

196
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,920
It's called personal accident insurance.

197
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,510
Why do you want to know this?

198
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,000
Personal accident insurance.

199
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,750
Why are you laughing?

200
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,600
Is it that funny?

201
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,560
No.

202
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:26,920
So.

203
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,120
Let me think.

204
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,320
You mean

205
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,630
you like Shiyan.

206
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,750
But you think she doesn't like you

207
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,550
because you have the same height.

208
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,390
You have a single mom

209
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,270
but she has both parents.

210
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,320
Your mom lost her job

211
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,910
but they're rich.

212
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,270
All in all,

213
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,150
we can't compare.

214
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,670
Thought I had time to catch up.

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,550
Then

216
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,750
she's moving.

217
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,630
Your mom told me this.

218
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,600
Listen.

219
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,670
What is it?

220
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,270
A little man who thinks big.

221
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,030
Don't mock me.

222
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,550
Boss, let me tell you.

223
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,320
You're

224
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,240
more than just friends.

225
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,000
Your height is not a problem.

226
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,870
Nor is your family background.

227
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,030
Impossible.

228
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,910
Birds of a feather flock together.

229
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,960
I'm an exception.

230
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,200
You're no normal guy.

231
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,720
You get that from your mom.

232
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,000
I won't confess.

233
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,790
What if she rejects me?

234
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,750
So embarrassed.

235
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,790
What if she says yes?

236
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,670
No way.

237
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,080
She's got many friends.

238
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,870
Won't need me.

239
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,000
You know a lot, don't you?

240
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,750
Kids nowadays know this much?

241
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,630
I'm not a kid.

242
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,720
I'm mature.

243
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,200
Boss.

244
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
Being mature is the last thing

245
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,480
you need at your age.

246
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,480
Look.

247
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,150
If you don't tell her now,

248
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,240
you'll regret your whole life.

249
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,550
But

250
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,790
I'm afraid.

251
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,960
Of what?

252
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,550
I have an idea.

253
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,510
What is it?

254
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,000
Write to her.

255
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,630
Write?

256
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,960
What to write?

257
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,120
One word, one smile.

258
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,550
What are you hiding?

259
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
Show me.

260
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,670
Nothing.

261
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
I saw you hide.

262
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,670
What is it?

263
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,240
Nothing.

264
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,200
Teach him to write in English.

265
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,600
Writing

266
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
on such fancy papers?

267
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,360
You have to act

268
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,030
like you're really writing to someone.

269
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,200
Indeed.

270
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,120
Dingding.

271
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,960
Take note.

272
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,480
That's why he was admitted

273
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,480
into a top university.

274
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,960
Stop laughing.

275
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,270
Here.

276
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,750
Read to me.

277
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,480
What?

278
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,670
You can understand?

279
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:22,670
I

280
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,630
like...

281
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,510
It says I like. Right?

282
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,320
Translate the rest, OK?

283
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:30,840
Come on.

284
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,270
Um...

285
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,320
What?

286
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,390
Did you write? You can't understand?

287
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,120
OK.

288
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,030
You read, I translate.

289
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,870
Saves time.

290
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:42,670
OK.

291
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,720
I like for you to be still.

292
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,120
It is as though you were absent.

293
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,910
I like

294
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,440
this life.

295
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,630
Go on.

296
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,550
And you hear me from far away.

297
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,550
And my voice does not touch you.

298
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,840
Man's dearest possession is life.

299
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,360
and he must live it so as to feel

300
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,320
no torturing regrets.

301
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,790
It seems as if your eyes had flown away.

302
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,440
It seems a kiss had sealed your mouth.

303
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,080
As all things are filled with my soul.

304
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,840
You emerge from the things.

305
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,390
Filled with my soul.

306
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,630
You are like my soul.

307
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,790
A butterfly of dream.

308
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,270
And you are like the word: Melancholy.

309
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,510
So live that, dying,

310
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,080
he might say:

311
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,440
fight for the Liberation of Mankind.

312
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,270
That's it?

313
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,630
That's it.

314
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,120
No.

315
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,510
The English is so long.

316
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,670
How come there's only one Chinese.

317
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,870
Because Chinese

318
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,120
is sophisticated.

319
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,550
Chinese can be translated into

320
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,150
a pile of

321
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,670
English words.

322
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,670
That's so?

323
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,150
Not bad, Xiaozhou.

324
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,840
Dingding can't even

325
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,510
write that long in Chinese.

326
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,200
He's made such big progress.

327
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,030
He's sharp.

328
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,320
Work hard.

329
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,320
Mom.

330
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,960
Are you posting it?

331
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
What's wrong with me

332
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,670
flaunting my son?

333
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,270
Many clients are moms too.

334
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,550
When they see this,

335
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,000
they'll like and comment.

336
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,390
In time,

337
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,910
I can recommend products to them.

338
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,600
No, you can't use me like that.

339
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,480
Funny, isn't it?

340
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,960
Guess who spends my money in the end?

341
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,910
We're in this together.

342
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,000
- No…
- I agree.

343
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,840
But you have to wait.

344
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,550
Since we want to

345
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,750
attract target clients.

346
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,670
I advise

347
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,120
him to enhance

348
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,750
his writing.

349
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,960
The wording, grammar.

350
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,080
I have to go through them.

351
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,030
OK, make sure they're perfect.

352
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,630
Then we post it.

353
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,390
Now it's the most

354
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,360
critical time.

355
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,480
We have to look perfect in our posts.

356
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,240
Look.

357
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,600
If they spot any grammar mistakes,

358
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,670
it'll be a shame.

359
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,510
See that?

360
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,910
Take that down.

361
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,480
Perfection in everything, OK?

362
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,630
Have fruit.

363
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,750
I'm off.

364
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,600
Leave you guys to it.

365
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,270
Bro.

366
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,790
After this,

367
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,670
we're comrades.

368
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,270
I feel dizzy.

369
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,360
Low blood sugar.

370
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,630
Get me a blueberry.

371
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,870
Have it yourself.

372
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,960
- Sorry, Mr. Chen…
- It's fine.

373
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,120
to make you make a strip.

374
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,750
It's fine...

375
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,440
Grab something to...

376
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,320
Come on in.

377
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,320
No, my shoes...

378
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,270
Cover it.

379
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:40,870
Wait a sec.

380
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,630
I'll get a basin.

381
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,080
OK.

382
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,670
Here.

383
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,080
Put it here.

384
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,510
Sure.

385
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,510
OK.

386
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
I'll get going.

387
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,670
Wait a minute.

388
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,150
I want to tell you something.

389
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,840
Sit down.

390
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,390
My shoes...

391
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,360
It's OK.

392
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,510
Look.

393
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,720
You collect docs as requested.

394
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,000
Find Mr. Meng at the center.

395
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,270
He's in charge of claims.

396
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,120
He's also a friend.

397
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,030
I confirmed for you.

398
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,030
You can have a claim for the injury.

399
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:30,910
Really?

400
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Let me explain.

401
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,150
Insurance won't trick you.

402
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,510
It's the broker who's irresponsible.

403
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,120
You know?

404
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,150
You can have claims

405
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,080
during two years.

406
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,360
It's just the broker left office,

407
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,750
so your policy is left unattended.

408
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,550
OK?

409
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,390
You meet something like this again.

410
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,360
Just come to me.

411
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,630
It's inappropriate.

412
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,510
I didn't buy it from you.

413
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,870
Then

414
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,080
you can buy from me. You can trust me.

415
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,390
Just joking.

416
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,440
I'm familiar with this stuff.

417
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,350
20 years in this field.

418
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,240
Easy.

419
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,720
If you trust me,

420
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,510
write me an authorization letter.

421
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,590
I'll help get files

422
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,680
from hospital for you.

423
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,160
OK...

424
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,480
How about

425
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,960
you send me your catalog

426
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,310
from last time?

427
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,070
Don't feel burdened.

428
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:22,920
OK?

429
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,880
It just happens I'll visit that hospital

430
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,310
for my dad's medicine.

431
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,270
Small favor.

432
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,720
No, Ms. Hu.

433
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,920
I'm not being polite.

434
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,550
Our entire family's insurance belongs

435
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,830
to the health care system.

436
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,440
Compared to your commercial insurance,

437
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,160
I feel insecure.

438
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,920
In that way,

439
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,720
text me your family conditions.

440
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,030
I'll draft a few plans.

441
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,960
OK...

442
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,680
OK.

443
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,070
Have some tea.

444
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,880
No...

445
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,200
I have to attend to my stall.

446
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,880
Yes.

447
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,110
OK.

448
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,920
I won't keep you.

449
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,400
Sure.

450
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,160
Thanks.

451
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,960
I'll pay you on the phone

452
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,960
for the seafood.

453
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,440
OK.

454
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,720
Bye.

455
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,440
Bye.

456
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,400
Goodbye.

457
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,270
How's Xiaozhou doing at work?

458
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,240
Just so-so.

459
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,030
He relies on me for all his orders.

460
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,160
You let him live in your house.

461
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,110
Just so-so?

462
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,400
Manli, are you

463
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,000
not telling the truth?

464
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,160
You've seen...

465
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,790
something in him?

466
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,750
Hey, nonsense.

467
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,550
You can question my character,

468
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,830
but never my taste.

469
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,510
It proves.

470
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,720
You feel guilty.

471
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,590
OK.

472
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,750
He is

473
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,480
kind of useful.

474
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
Strengths, he has.

475
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,240
How so?

476
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,240
Recently,

477
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,110
I ask him to teach Dingding English.

478
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,070
It works.

479
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,000
Really?

480
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,510
I'll show you.

481
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,160
Dingding's English writing.

482
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:53,960
Take a look.

483
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,720
You're open-minded now.

484
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,750
What do you mean?

485
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,680
You know what he wrote?

486
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,030
What?

487
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,310
What is it?

488
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:18,750
Bye.

489
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,640
Bye.

490
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,310
You didn't?

491
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,310
Darling, here.

492
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:25,720
Over here.

493
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,200
Go.

494
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:27,880
Shiyan.

495
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,350
Take it.

496
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,480
Dad.

497
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:38,920
Thanks.

498
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,750
Got you.

499
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,790
I was praised again.

500
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,400
Mom.

501
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,200
Dad.

502
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,350
Let's go.

503
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,750
Go.

504
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,510
Bye.

505
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,240
Bye.

506
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,680
Bye.

507
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,480
See you.

508
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,240
Let's go home.

509
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,640
Ding Daer.

510
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,000
How was it?

511
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,830
You sent your letter?

512
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,030
Yes.

513
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,680
With my gift.

514
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,790
Will she block me if she reads it?

515
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,160
Maybe.

516
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,200
OK, I was kidding.

517
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,680
Man proposes, God disposes.

518
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,400
You've done all you can do.

519
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm proud of you.

520
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,200
Over here.

521
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,480
Go

522
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,160
home.

523
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,880
Easy, uncle.

524
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,110
Come here.

525
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,240
How's your grade?

526
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,750
Mom, I'm home.

527
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,440
Wash hands.

528
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,110
Mom?

529
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,960
Three dishes only?

530
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,880
What's wrong?

531
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,440
What?

532
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,550
Why are you so quiet?

533
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,920
Am I usually loud?

534
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,200
No.

535
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:22,680
She's

536
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,830
loud?

537
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,510
Not really.

538
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,680
Why are you so quiet?

539
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,440
Am I usually loud?

540
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,200
Yes.

541
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,550
Did you win over that crucial client?

542
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,110
No.

543
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,750
Um.

544
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,310
I'm full. I'll go do my homework.

545
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,880
Hold up.

546
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,000
Wh-what's wrong, Mom?

547
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,200
Xiaozhou asked you to

548
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,480
edit your English letter.

549
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,110
Did you do it?

550
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,640
I...

551
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,030
It's been long.

552
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,000
He did...

553
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,720
Yes.

554
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,400
Show me.

555
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,510
I want to read.

556
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,720
You handed it in, didn't you?

557
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,680
Handed it in?

558
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,720
To whom?

559
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,350
You hand in

560
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,070
homework to your teacher, right?

561
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,400
Yes, to the teacher.

562
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,400
OK.

563
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,720
I'll post the photo from last time.

564
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,680
I'll post it.

565
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,880
No.

566
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,590
What?

567
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,880
Please don't.

568
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,070
Why?

569
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,440
Don't show off.

570
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,030
They'll dislike.

571
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,160
It's OK.

572
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,400
To err is human.

573
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,110
Perfection looks fake.

574
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,160
I'll post it.

575
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,750
No, Mom.

576
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
You have anything to tell me?

577
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,640
I...

578
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,440
Nothing.

579
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,750
Mom.

580
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,400
Don't call me mom.

581
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,200
You coaxed me with an outsider.

582
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
You still take me as your mom?

583
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,350
What happened?

584
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,920
Quiet.

585
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,030
I wondered

586
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,030
why your grades dropped.

587
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,960
So you wanted to date.

588
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,200
He didn't.

589
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,350
I trusted you.

590
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
I leave him to you.

591
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,000
You helped him with a love letter?

592
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,030
Asking him to date.

593
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,640
I was such a fool.

594
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Calm down.

595
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,830
Go do homework.

596
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,070
Go.

597
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,440
I'll explain.

598
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,440
Go.

599
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,510
Shut this.

600
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,400
You can't blame

601
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,310
Dingding.

602
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,550
Of course.

603
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,790
He's 13.

604
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,200
You incited him.

605
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,880
Yes, I did.

606
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,750
But it was

607
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,640
for his own good.

608
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,920
More importantly,

609
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,160
I did it for you.

610
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
Do I look like a fool to you?

611
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,920
Dumb?

612
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,640
Come in.

613
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,680
Milk.

614
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,400
Thanks.

615
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,310
And?

616
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,400
Sorry.

617
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,830
Why are you saying sorry?

618
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,030
It's normal to want to

619
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,030
know the girl you like.

620
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,510
I'd worried if you

621
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,550
didn't feel that way.

622
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,200
Mom.

623
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,070
Really?

624
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,160
Why should I lie?

625
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,960
At your age,

626
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,750
I also liked a boy.

627
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,200
What's wrong with knowing classmate?

628
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,550
You kept this to yourself

629
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,350
and your grades dropped.

630
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,350
Worth it?

631
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,270
So

632
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,550
you don't blame me

633
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,000
for dating?

634
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,480
Dating?

635
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,720
You think too highly of yourself.

636
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,350
At such a tender age,

637
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,030
dating you talk about...

638
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,960
At most,

639
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,750
you guys do homework together.

640
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Don't keep things from me, OK?

641
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,440
OK.

642
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,070
And?

643
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,720
Nothing.

644
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,790
Think.

645
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,440
Really, nothing.

646
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,310
Why did you tell Xiaozhou

647
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm broke?

648
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,590
That I'm poorer than Shiyan

649
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,960
so Shiyan might look down on you.

650
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,000
He...

651
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,510
I was kidding.

652
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,350
Don't take it seriously.

653
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Think you've grown up?

654
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,030
Have secrets of your own?

655
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,960
Listen.

656
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,510
You're good-looking,

657
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,030
nice,

658
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,830
outgoing,

659
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,110
and humorous.

660
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That alone

661
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,750
makes you

662
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,310
one of the best sons of the country.

663
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,200
Mom.

664
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Come on.

665
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,350
You're embarrassing me.

666
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,400
I indeed met trouble

667
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,960
at work.

668
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,240
I didn't give up,

669
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,000
you see?

670
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,350
I'm still working.

671
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,030
Have I mistreated you?

672
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,680
If any girls turn you down,

673
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,510
it's not your problem.

674
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,790
It's theirs.

675
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,000
They have bad taste,

676
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,550
you know?

677
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,550
In my eyes,

678
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,070
you're perfect.

679
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,720
OK?

680
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
Mom.

681
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,830
Stop that.

682
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,640
I'm embarrassed.

683
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,440
I'm praising you.

684
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,110
Want me to criticize?

685
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,310
No...

686
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,880
Finish your homework?

687
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,240
No.

688
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,310
Too much?

689
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,030
No, I'm almost done.

690
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,070
Go on.

691
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,790
Have milk.

692
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:36,590
OK.

693
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,510
Sleep early.

694
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,400
Will you thank me?

695
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,880
No way.

696
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,110
I was right.

697
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,240
Dingding felt he wasn't good enough.

698
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,070
Right?

699
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,160
We have to change that.

700
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,350
He felt bad,

701
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,590
and it affected your relation.

702
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,590
Didn't I single-handedly

703
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,200
save you both?

704
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,880
You took risks.

705
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,240
What if the girl curses him?

706
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,720
What to do?

707
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,960
She won't.

708
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,960
Dingding's like you.

709
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,240
He's cute.

710
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,240
I encouraged him

711
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,880
after consideration.

712
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,680
That sounds nice.

713
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,240
Draft

714
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
plans for a new client.

715
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,400
New client?

716
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:40,830
Who's that?

717
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,000
A stall owner at the market.

718
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,680
You really find a client

719
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,310
when you get grocery?

720
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,350
What?

721
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,270
Someone's too in love to

722
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,030
introduce his girlfriend.

723
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,720
So I can only rely on myself.

724
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,510
What's your progress?

725
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,510
New potential client?

726
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,640
I called a few.

727
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,920
No reply.

728
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,590
Anyway,

729
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,880
we have two big orders.

730
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,440
Take it easy.

731
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,480
You won't eat because you ate yesterday?

732
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,350
You're young.

733
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,880
Don't tell me you want to be laid-back.

734
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,480
You want to be a monk?

735
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,590
I didn't say that.

736
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,400
I thought

737
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,110
you've been so busy

738
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,240
for a while.

739
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,830
You need to slow down.

740
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,030
Make sure you get proper rest.

741
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,680
You can talk.

742
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,310
Can you walk the walk?

743
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,510
Listen to me.

744
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,640
I will get that bonus car

745
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,680
at TSI for sure.

746
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,920
Hey.

747
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,880
We'll have to make deals

748
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,200
worth millions.

749
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,400
Think I can't?

750
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,440
No, that's not what I mean.

751
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,550
I know

752
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,310
you're capable,

753
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,680
but you have to

754
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,110
set the goal based on reality.

755
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,510
7 years ago,

756
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,400
I got my first

757
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,270
TOT certificate.

758
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,830
You know

759
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,480
what it is?

760
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,000
The biggest reward

761
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,960
in insurance.

762
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,480
Yes.

763
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,240
When I got my first commission,

764
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,590
I rushed to a car dealership

765
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,000
and bought my first ever car.

766
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,720
The same one with the bonus car.

767
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,790
Same brand.

768
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,720
Same model.

769
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,030
Thanks to you,

770
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,030
I was then kicked out.

771
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,750
To live,

772
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,400
I sold the car.

773
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,310
So you buy it back when you make money.

774
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,350
Is it just a car?

775
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,750
It's recognition of me.

776
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,590
You're well-educated, never discriminated.

777
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,720
You haven't seen

778
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,680
the ugly of the world.

779
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,830
I went through both.

780
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,680
The only thing I can do for myself

781
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
is selling insurance.

782
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,000
So

783

I will fight for this car.

I know.

790
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:10,790
But look.

What does she see in you?

792
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,440
You, yourself.

793
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,200
Just a small favor

794
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,480
and she'll ditch you?

795
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,590

796
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240
I don't think so.

And, you're earning money

just turn her down.

I declined

890
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,190
so they'd write on their own

891
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,480
and have me read it.

00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,760
he would have you edit it.

979
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,230
How could he print it out?

980
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,400
He was in such a hurry.

981
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,320
You know

982
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,400
about this?

983
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,230
I didn't.

984
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,440
I cherish your reputation.

985
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,400
How could I let this happen?

986
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,110
But you took that photo.

987
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,670
Only you have that photo.

988
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,510
Trust me.

989
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,670
When Li asked me for the photo,

990
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,510
I confirmed again and again

991
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,710
that you'd get to edit again.

992
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,000
He said the preface got delayed.

993
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,630
To have it printed in time,

994
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,670
he had to have it typeset first.

995
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:23,800
OK.

996
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,480
Withdraw all books.

997
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,760
He can't sell a single one.

998
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,320
It's

999
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,400
not appropriate.

1000
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,070
Not appropriate?

1001
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,960
He printed

1002
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,880
without my content.

1003
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,150
That's inappropriate!

1004
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,400
Zhiyuan.

1005
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,550
You've put me in a tight spot.

1006
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,920
Fendou is my friend.

1007
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,550
He also rents me buildings.

1008
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,670
I have to rely on him for business.

1009
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,800
That's your problem.

1010
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,840
None of

1011
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,630
my business.

1012
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,000
If you find it difficult,

1013
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,400
I'll meet him.

1014
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,440
Zhiyuan.

1015
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,760
Calm down.

1016
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,030
Sit.

1017
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,670
Don't be mad.

1018
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,670
Actually,

1019
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,280
it's not that serious.

1020
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,070
Who would buy this anyway?

1021
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,190
He's just sending it out as a gift.

1022
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,800
And those who receive it

1023
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,510
won't open it.

1024
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,000
I saw it.

1025
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,670
My colleagues and superiors saw it.

1026
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,880
I have a show

1027
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,320
and will be increasingly famous.

1028
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,320
My views, followers will see it.

1029
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,840
My stomach just feels upset.

1030
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,880
I feel bad all over.

1031
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,550
He has to explain.

1032
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,590
What do you want?

1033
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,920
Tell me.

1034
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,670
We should convince him.

1035
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,920
If he insists,

1036
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,440
I'll

1037
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,320
sue him.

1038
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,110
Unauthorized,

1039
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,550
he sells book using my fame.

1040
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,960
It's illegal.

1041
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,590
It'll be bad for both of us.

1042
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,440
Think about it.

1043
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,360
You'd agreed to

1044
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,000
writing the preface and signed.

1045
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,480
If this blows up,

1046
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,760
we won't be justified.

1047
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,320
He set me up.

1048
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,960
I was drunk.

1049
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,590
And.

1050
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,840
Why didn't you stop me?

1051
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,550
Were you helping him?

1052
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,110
You mean

1053
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,550
I set you up with him?

1054
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,230
How could you?

1055
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,150
Wasn't it for your own good?

1056
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,590
I wasn't blaming you.

1057
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,590
So I should

1058
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,880
let it go?

1059
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,480
You'll see my reputation

1060
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,360
go down the drain?

1061
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,590
Go home.

1062
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,070
We'll talk tonight.

1063
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,550
I'm busy.

1064
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,360
