Episode 16

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,200
What are you writing?

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,680
What brings you here?

43
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,510
Careful, it's hot.

44
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,590
Any problem with the surgery plan?

45
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,840
No, everything's fine.

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,070
I found this amazing little place

47
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,400
for skewers online.

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,590
Let's go together tonight!

49
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,400
I...

50
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,870
I'm on night shift today.

51
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,820
Ah?

52
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,000
Dr. Wu,

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,150
wasn't your shift the day before yesterday?

54
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,280
It's not your shift.

55
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,960
I remembered it wrong.

56
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,120
Look at your memory.

57
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,000
Let's go.

58
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:21,800
Here,

59
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,520
let me help you pack.

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,710
Okay.

61
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,000
Eat.

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,030
Don't like it?

63
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,520
Xiaozhou...

64
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,080
I...

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
There's something I want to tell you.

66
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,910
Actually, I have something to tell you too.

67
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,080
You go first.

68
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,030
You go first.

69
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,030
I...

70
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,840
It's nothing really, just...

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,280
I feel a bit nervous.

72
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,630
My mom's surgery is tomorrow.

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,190
I'm a bit worried.

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,190
Don't worry about it.

75
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,800
It's just
a minimally invasive procedure.

76
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,560
But what if something goes wrong?

77
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,560
It won't.

78
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,030
How could we be that unlucky?

79
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,710
Haven't I always been unlucky?

80
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,190
Xiaozhou.

81
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,680
If...

82
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,150
I mean if the surgery really fails,

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,800
can you handle it?

84
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,310
I...

85
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,240
No matter how hard it gets,
I'll have you.

86
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:39,960
Right?

87
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,030
What did you want to say?

88
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,400
Nothing.

89
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,870
I just wanted...

90
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,960
I just wanted to comfort you.

91
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,870
I'm fine, don't worry.

92
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,150
I still need to revise a paper tonight.

93
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,560
Let's not take too long.

94
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,120
Okay, let's hurry.

95
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,560
Here.

96
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:12,870
Okay.

97
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,080
I'll walk you back.

98
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,120
Shrimp.

99
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,390
Is it cold already?

100
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,680
Daer?

101
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,750
Tell me about your studies.

102
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,040
It's just so-so.

103
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,270
Modesty.

104
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,510
Let me tell you, this kid is smart.

105
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,480
You're definitely doing well.

106
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,560
Uncle, Auntie.

107
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,750
What brings you here?

108
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,920
Mom! You're finally back!

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,630
Back from work?

110
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,360
Hello, Manli.

111
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,630
We came to see you.

112
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,600
Get those things out.

113
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,000
Manli dear.

114
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,120
We know you lack nothing here.

115
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,800
So I just brought you some

116
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,750
spring onions, ginger and such.

117
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,950
Hope you don't mind.

118
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,630
These things are good.

119
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,830
Completely natural.

120
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,360
You can't buy these here with money.

121
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:54,920
Here.

122
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,240
- Where should I put these? - Thanks.

123
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,680
That's alright.

124
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,120
In the kitchen.

125
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,950
- Let me... - Daer.

126
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,480
I'll do it.

127
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,240
It's fine.

128
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,600
Look, the kid's grown into a young man.

129
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,310
He's all grown up.

130
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,270
Green stuff, good stuff.

131
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,920
Why didn't you call

132
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,680
ahead before you came?

133
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,430
What's there to say? We're family.

134
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,480
We're all family here.

135
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,120
Isn't it just like coming home?

136
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,680
Exactly.

137
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,870
Did you come for something?

138
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,060
Right.

139
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,830
Here.

140
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,950
Well...

141
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,390
A few months ago,

142
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,630
your uncle

143
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,920
had heart troubles.

144
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,430
So we went to the county hospital

145
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,120
for checkups.

146
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,600
But they said their facility
was too small

147
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,560
and referred us to the city hospital.

148
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,600
Then the city sent us to the provincial one.

149
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,120
The doctors at the big provincial hospital said

150
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,270
that he

151
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,680
has this condition...

152
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,950
something about a heart valve not...
not closing right.

153
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
He needs surgery.

154
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,070
Pretty scary the way they explained it.

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,750
We've been thinking it over

156
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,070
and figured if he needs surgery,

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,040
he'd better go to a major city.

158
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,560
First, big-city doctors
are more skilled,

159
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,040
right?

160
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,680
We'd feel safer about the operation.

161
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,510
Second...

162
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,360
Manli...

163
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,070
Didn't you buy that health insurance

164
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,390
for your uncle?

165
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:16,830
Right?

166
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,360
We thought it'd be easier to file claims.

167
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,070
So that's why we came to you.

168
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,680
Does Zhiyuan know you're here?

169
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
We just left
the provincial hospital this morning.

170
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,390
We went straight to the train station.

171
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,950
Didn't have time to call him.

172
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,870
You see.

173
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,560
After getting off the train, your uncle

174
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,430
tried calling Zhiyuan,

175
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,240
but his phone was turned off.

176
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,040
We couldn't reach him.

177
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,390
He's busy, right?

178
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,870
But it's okay.

179
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,310
Anyway,

180
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,720
let him be busy.

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,390
We've got you for this matter.

182
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,160
Right, Manli?

183
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,560
It's the same.

184
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,070
I need to tell you something.

185
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,310
Two months ago,

186
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,630
Zhiyuan and I separated.

187
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,420
Huh?

188
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,120
Hello, I'd like to check in.

189
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,430
This hotel isn't as good as last time's.

190
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,310
Even after breaking up,
she still helps us.

191
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,870
What a good person.

192
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,070
Hello.

193
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,000
The number you dialed is powered off.

194
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,560
Zhiyuan's phone is turned off.

195
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,560
Probably ran out of battery.

196
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,120
You can contact him later yourselves.

197
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:47,510
Alright.

198
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,160
I booked this room for three days.

199
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,000
You can stay here.

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,430
Let me do it.

201
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,040
It's okay.

202
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,390
Come on in.

203
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,190
It's time.

204
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,560
I want to watch news!

205
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,040
The TV remote is here.

206
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,940
Right.

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,120
This matter can't be delayed.

208
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,160
He still keeps this habit.

209
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,070
Yes.

210
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,270
Takes notes while watching news.

211
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,160
Don't mind him, come.

212
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,600
Sit here.

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,040
Sit down and rest for a while.

214
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,600
Tell me.

215
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,360
What happened between you and Zhiyuan?

216
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,320
During New Year's,

217
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,600
you two even came home together.

218
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,840
How could you break up so suddenly?

219
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,320
We're incompatible.

220
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,550
You've been together for so many years.

221
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,630
You're incompatible now?

222
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,550
You must have argued.

223
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,720
Said things in the heat of the moment?

224
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,840
Manli...

225
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,240
When two people live together,

226
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,550
there are bound to be bumps.

227
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,000
Right?

228
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,670
Look.

229
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,030
My husband and I

230
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,550
have been together almost a lifetime,

231
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,030
and we still argue.

232
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,600
It's normal.

233
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,240
Not worth splitting up.

234
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,150
You call those arguments?

235
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
That's me letting you win!

236
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,080
I can't be bothered.

237
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,150
Alright.

238
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,720
You're already out of breath.

239
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,600
Save your energy.

240
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:10,960
Manli.

241
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,030
Don't worry.

242
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,440
When I see Zhiyuan later,

243
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,720
I'll give him a good talking-to.

244
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,360
Can families just split like that?

245
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,240
What happened between him and me

246
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,390
are quite complicated.

247
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,790
Ask him yourself later.

248
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,720
See?

249
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,980
Hey!

250
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,120
Your nephew's been a bully again!

251
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,000
Manli.

252
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,750
All these years

253
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,390
How you've treated Zhiyuan

254
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,480
and the Dings,

255
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,550
I've seen it all and remember.

256
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,270
It must be his fault.

257
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,030
He must have upset you.

258
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,360
I'll scold him.

259
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,750
I have your back.

260
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,200
It's getting late.

261
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,480
You should rest early.

262
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,240
I'll head back now.

263
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,320
Alright.

264
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,440
I'm off.

265
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,030
Get some rest.

266
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,240
Got it!

267
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
Take care, Manli.

268
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,960
Your uncle and aunt came for treatment.

269
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,000
They couldn't reach you.

270
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,510
I've already arranged their stay.

271
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,840
I'll send you the address later.

272
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:14,960
Mr. Chen,

273
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,270
I've customized this plan for your family.

274
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:17,630
Look.

275
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,870
Education annuity.

276
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,720
Pension, critical illness and medical insurance.

277
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,840
Wait, Ms. Hu.

278
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:29,790
Wait.

279
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,440
Why isn't my mother included in the

280
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,440
medical insurance?

281
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,270
She's almost eighty.

282
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,550
Regular medical insurance

283
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,000
doesn't cover people over sixty.

284
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,960
What are saying?

285
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,870
Those who need insurance
can't get insured?

286
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,960
You keep pushing people who don't need

287
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,600
insurance to buy it anyway.

288
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,320
Mr. Chen, that's not what I meant.

289
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,320
Then what do you mean?

290
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:53,670
Right?

291
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,080
Ms. Hu, you're a good person.

292
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,790
But your company

293
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,790
only wants risk-free profits.

294
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,120
That's not right, is it?

295
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,270
If you ask me, maybe just forget it.

296
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,910
Sorry.

297
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,320
I've wasted your time for nothing.

298
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,480
Want fish?

299
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,600
How much for this fish?

300
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,390
It's cheap now, on sale. It's eighteen.

301
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,630
One kilo, please.

302
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,000
Got it.

303
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,900
Yes?

304
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,780
Oh my.

305
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,360
Just when Chen Laifu

306
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,630
started trusting insurance a bit,

307
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,360
then?

308
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,790
His mom can't get covered.

309
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,910
We're back to square one again.

310
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:30,900
Hey.

311
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,270
I remember one company's health plan

312
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,120
takes applicants under 80.

313
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,600
Check TSI's system

314
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,550
See if they do it.

315
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,630
Okay, I got it.

316
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,150
Don't just say "got it".

317
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,870
Go check right now.

318
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,960
I need results immediately.

319
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,750
Hu Manli,
my mom's having surgery this afternoon.

320
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,320
Right!

321
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,440
Then,

322
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,670
give me your account info.

323
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,750
I'll log in to check, okay?

324
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,510
Okay, hold on a sec.

325
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,440
Got it.

326
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,270
Send it to me.

327
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,860
[A little something to wish your mom good luck]

328

[Insurance plans]

329
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,320
Everwell Retirement Medical Insurance.

330
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:48,750
Found it.

331
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,360
Everwell Retirement.

332
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,240
Hello, Auntie? What's up?

333
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,780
What?

334
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,910
Still can't reach him?

335
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,200
Professor Ding.

336
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,270
Oh, you're here.

337
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,390
Your phone was off,
couldn't contact you.

338
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,200
What do you need?

339
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,510
Here's the situation.

340
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,630
The summary for

341
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,910
our department meeting
for the Party Committee is ready.

342
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,120
Professor Wang said you need to sign it.

343
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,000
Also, the department secretary needs

344
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,750
your final approval
on next week's lecture topics.

345
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,080
Also,

346
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,720
I've got two editorial replies pending

347
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,360
that need your review and confirmation.

348
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,670
Alright.

349
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,320
By the way...

350
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,000
Has Ms. Qiu contacted you?

351
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
No, why?

352
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,960
Just remember this.

353
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,390
If she contacts you,

354
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,120
tell her

355
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,150
I don't really want to see her lately.

356
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,510
Okay.

357
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,080
May I come in?

358
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:00,870
You go ahead.

359
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,660
Yes.

360
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,720
Have a seat.

361
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,600
That's alright.

362
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,750
What? You needed something from me?

363
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,600
Nothing from me.

364
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,720
But someone else needs you.

365
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,550
Why's your phone been off all this time?

366
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,510
Just need some peace and quiet.

367
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,550
Your uncle and aunt
are here for medical treatment.

368
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,200
They've been
trying to reach you for days.

369
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,840
You should contact them immediately.

370
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,020
Hm?

371
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,550
Give them a call.

372
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,780
Oh, right.

373
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,720
It's switched off.

374
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,080
Ding Zhiyuan,
now you're a big professor.

375
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,750
Are you avoiding us poor relatives?

376
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,080
No.

377
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,120
I've just been very busy recently.

378
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,480
That's why I turned off my phone.

379
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,150
You're here for medical treatment?

380
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:04,550
Yes.

381
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,510
For your uncle's treatment, here.

382
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,960
Have some water, take a rest.

383
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,000
Thank you.

384
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,910
Where are you planning to go
for treatment?

385
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,360
We should be asking you about this.

386
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,270
Asking me?

387
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,510
What would we know about it?

388
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
We came all the way from out of town.

389
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,120
Just tell us where to go for treatment.

390
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,390
We'll go wherever you arrange.

391
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,960
You want me to arrange it?

392
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,840
But I don't know anything about this.

393
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,600
You...

394
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,240
You...

395
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,460
Gosh!

396
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,270
Zhiyuan.

397
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,150
Actually,

398
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,630
your uncle's surgery

399
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,670
could be done
at the provincial hospital.

400
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,030
It's not that difficult.

401
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,510
But we don't know anyone there.

402
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,630
We don't feel secure.

403
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,270
After much deliberation,

404
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,200
we decided to come to you.

405
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,960
You're in Shanghai now.

406
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,440
A famous professor

407
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,120
must have good connections

408
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,320
and knows lots of people.

409
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:03,840
Right?

410
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,120
You could arrange this for us.

411
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,790
Why does it sound like

412
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,510
you don't want to help?

413
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,960
That's not what I meant.

414
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,670
I am a professor

415
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,670
but not at a medical school.

416
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,670
Besides,

417
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,480
I don't know any other doctors.

418
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh my.

419
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,360
What kind of talk is that?

420
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,390
Only medical school professors

421
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,720
can know doctors?

422
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,150
What kind of logic is that?

423
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,270
Anyway, let me tell you.

424
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,270
Your uncle and I

425
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,750
came to you for help today.

426
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,720
You've got to show your uncle respect.

427
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,910
This isn't about respect.

428
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,960
Look how suddenly you came

429
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,910
without any notice.

430
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,000
How could I find someone on such short notice?

431
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,670
What notice?

432
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,080
Coming to you is like coming home.

433
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,510
We treat you as family.

434
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,270
Why give notice?

435
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,750
Why give notice, I ask you?

436
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,080
Zhiyuan.

437
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,750
Actually,

438
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,510
we didn't mean to trouble you,

439
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,240
right?

440
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,270
Before, we'd ask Manli.

441
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,590
She handled everything for us.

442
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,310
Whenever Manli took us to see doctors,

443
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,920
she always knew someone and

444
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,200
arranged everything perfectly.

445
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,510
We never had to worry at all.

446
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,310
But now,

447
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,310
you two have broken up.

448
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:16,790
Right?

449
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,830
Then it's not appropriate
to contact her.

450
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,110
And you!

451
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,830
Why did you break up for no reason?

452
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,070
What a mess!

453
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,000
Auntie.

454
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,920
Can we not talk about the breakup?

455
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,160
Fine, won't mention it.

456
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,720
Okay.

457
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,880
Won't mention Professor Ding's breakup.

458
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,440
I've finally figured it out.

459
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,550
You...

460
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,640
He's nothing without Manli!

461
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
He can't accomplish anything!

462
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,960
Let's pack up.

463
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,880
Go home!

464
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,440
Don't.

465
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,720
We can't trouble Professor Ding!

466
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,270
- Uncle. - No.

467
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,880
- Don't be mad. -Go!

468
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,270
Seeing a doctor?

469
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,000
That's simple.

470
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,720
Here's what we'll do.

471
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,920
Let's go to the hospital.

472
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,200
If it's serious,

473
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,880
we'll figure something out.

474
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,920
We can visit a few hospitals.

475
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,070
Listen to more doctors.

476
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,790
That's good, no?

477
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:00,680
Alright.

478
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,720
Well.

479
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,240
We'll follow your arrangements.

480
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,000
Don't get angry so easily.

481
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,030
Okay.

482
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,920
Excuse me, may I cut in line?

483
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,000
Thank you.

484
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,480
Gosh, look!

485
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,590
He's already let several cut in.

486
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,030
When will we ever get our turn?

487
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,680
I'll go relieve him. I'll queue up.

488
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,510
Zhiyuan.

489
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,550
Go rest a while, I'll queue.

490
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,240
Go ahead, go on.

491
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,160
There's quite a queue here.

492
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,200
Zhiyuan.

493
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,960
I

494
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
need to talk with you.

495
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,200
Why exactly

496
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,590
did you separate?

497
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,240
Can we change the subject?

498
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,200
You can't just

499
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,750
break up your marriage over

500
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,000
trivial matters.

501
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,550
Think about your child.

502
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,270
Your Dingding

503
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,550
is such a lovely boy.

504
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,200
Think about him.

505
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,160
How about this?

506
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,350
Later I'll have your aunt

507
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,790
talk to Manli.

508
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,680
Talk it over.

509
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,790
You two should remarry.

510
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,480
Alright?

511
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,720
Don't bother yourself.

512
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,000
Actually...

513
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,830
Actually, I've been seeing someone else.

514
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:36,960
What?!

515
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,270
About this matter,

516
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,270
I was in the wrong.

517
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,880
But between me and Manli

518
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,830
there's also

519
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,920
incompatible personalities.

520
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,110
We just can't go on anymore.

521
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,640
You're being foolish!

522
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,960
Manli

523
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,070
treats you well,

524
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,480
treats the kid well, and

525
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,680
treats your parents well.

526
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,270
She treats us well too!

527
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,350
You mustn't let

528
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,000
those sly women bewitch you!

529
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,510
Uncle, it's not what you imagine.

530
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,750
My partner is a good person, very gentle.

531
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,350
She's even a big company's CEO.

532
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,310
Besides,

533
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,480
I'm already in my forties.

534
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,070
I know what I'm doing.

535
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,780
Hey!

536
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,440
There's still over eighty ahead.

537
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,030
How long are we going to wait here?

538
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,110
Zhiyuan, hurry and find someone to help.

539
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,830
Big hospitals are always this

540
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,480
crowded.

541
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,160
If we need to queue, then we'll queue.

542
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,680
No specialist appointments left.

543
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,440
What should we do?

544
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,070
No more left?

545
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,880
None at all.

546
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:38,830
Well...

547
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,000
Let's go line up first.

548
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,240
Go.

549
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,270
I... I'll go queue too?

550
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,000
Let's queue up.

551
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,920
Go wait outside the consultation room.

552
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,200
Okay.

553
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,160
Which way do we go?

554
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,240
Straight ahead, then turn right.

555
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,680
Are you sure?

556
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,550
Yes, it's over there.

557
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,400
Don't worry.

558
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,550
It'll be fine.

559
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,070
Zhiyuan...

560
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,070
He looks too young.

561
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,000
Not even thirty yet.

562
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,200
Is he qualified?

563
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,680
Let's hear what the doctor says first.

564
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,830
Don't worry.

565
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,590
I'll order a CT scan for you.

566
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,310
Go get it done.

567
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,110
We've already had it done at the provincial hospital.

568
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,590
Right.

569
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,240
See, this is a CT scan right here.

570
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,960
This was done at your local hospital.

571
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,920
Might not be accurate.

572
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,240
If you want our diagnosis,

573
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,880
you need to redo it.

574
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,240
Doctor,

575
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,880
before we came here,

576
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,000
we already looked it up online.

577
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,110
For my condition,

578
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,110
there's no need for so many tests.

579
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,510
Just operate on me.

580
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,000
You checked online.

581
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,070
Sir, if internet could cure illnesses,
what do we

582
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,510
need hospitals for?

583
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,750
What would doctors be for?

584
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,110
How dare you!

585
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,960
Young man,

586
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,550
are you just trying to take our money?

587
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,830
Just because we're from a small town,

588
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,640
we don't know better?

589
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,030
Young doctors make low salaries,

590
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,240
so you all depend on

591
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,960
prescribing unnecessary tests

592
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
and medications for extra income, right?

593
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,750
No, please don't say that.

594
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Sorry about that

595
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,960
You're the patient's family?

596
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,480
Yes.

597
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,880
Do you understand what I just said?

598
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,160
Perfectly.

599
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,310
Alright, then you tell him.

600
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,160
If you want treatment,
follow the procedure.

601
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,350
If not, then leave.

602
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,680
Of course.

603
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,830
We haven't finished yet.

604
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,070
We're not done!

605
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,680
Next.

606
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,310
Your attitude!

607
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:19,880
You... It's...

608
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,070
- Let's talk outside. - He!

609
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,640
Let's go out.

610
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,350
- Let's go. - Young...

611
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:22,750
Outside.

612
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,480
Sorry.

613
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,000
No respect!

614
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,790
I apologize.

615
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,640
We'll do it.

616
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,110
- How can he talk like that? - Bossy!

617
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,440
Zhiyuan.

618
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,590
Did you see that?

619
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,110
Young people these days are hopeless.

620
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,640
Hurry up and think of something,
hear me?

621
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,070
Well...

622
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,830
Think of a way.

623
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,350
Uncle...

624
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,550
Maybe we should listen to the doctor.

625
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,480
Do a CT scan first?

626
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,110
No.

627
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,550
He's just trying to make us
spend more money!

628
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,160
Money's not an issue for us.

629
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,640
Remember?

630
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,590
A few years ago, Manli

631
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,070
had you buy a medical insurance.

632
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,310
Medical treatment won't cost us.

633
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,200
The insurance will cover it.

634
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,270
Even with reimbursement,
we can't spend this money.

635
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,110
Look.

636
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,200
Back home they know
we have connections in Shanghai.

637
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,920
You can't let me suffer this injustice

638
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,830
just to see a doctor here.

639
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,830
Hurry up and call someone,
find an acquaintance.

640
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,590
Uncle.

641
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,240
Zhiyuan.

642
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,200
Listen.

643
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,350
For medical treatment,

644
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,790
you need someone familiar.

645
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,680
You hear me? Think of something quickly.

646
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,160
Look how angry your uncle is.

647
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,270
His old condition

648
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,000
isn't cured yet. Don't let

649
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,200
new problems arise from the anger.

650
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:13,720
You hear me?

651
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,350
But

652
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,030
I...

653
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,350
The people I know
are all university professors.

654
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,920
Where am I supposed to find doctors?

655
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,030
This isn't about capability.

656
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,400
It's about your attitude.

657
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,000
How could you say that?

658
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,790
Now that you're a professor,

659
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,110
you've forgotten
all the kindness shown to you?

660
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,400
Are you trying to make us leave?

661
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,110
If you want us gone, just say it.

662
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,000
No, I don't

663
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,480
Zhiyuan...

664
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,640
You can't do this.

665
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,110
If it weren't for the money he gave you

666
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,070
to attend a good school,

667
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,510
would you be where you are today?

668
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,640
Wait...

669
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,480
Think of something!

670
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,480
I didn't...

671
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,880
I really didn't mean it.

672
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,030
I need to take this call.

673
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:47,640
Hello?

674
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,750
Professor Ding.

675
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,420
Huh?

676
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,550
We finally reached you.

677
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,880
Long story short.

678
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
Due to a filed complaint,

679
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,240
the school must temporarily revoke

680
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,110
your nomination for the

681
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,110
Model Ethics Award.

682
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,550
Huh?

683
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,960
Director Huang, what do you mean?

684
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,880
Come to my office.

685
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,350
Alright.

686
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,110
There's an urgent matter at school.

687
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,000
I have to head back now.

688
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,400
Uncle, listen...

689
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,070
If you don't want the check-up,

690
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,720
I'll get you a cab.

691
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,960
Let's go back to the hotel.

692
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,270
Ding Zhiyuan.

693
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,960
I'm your own uncle!

694
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,160
I came all this way for treatment.

695
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,350
Will you help me or not?

696
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,510
If you won't help,

697
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,790
I might die here tomorrow,

698
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,550
and it won't be your concern!

699
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,160
Let's go!

700
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,830
- Let's go. - Uncle.

701
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,680
Don't be mad.

702
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,480
Let's talk this through.

703
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,070
Did you hear him?

704
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,880
Zhiyuan, think of something quick!

705
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,720
Hey!

706
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,000
Think of something!

707
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,030
- Auntie. - Don't be mad.

708
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,310
Mr. Chen, look at this product.

709
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,110
Available for those under 80.

710
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,440
I've calculated it.

711
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,550
At your mother's age,

712
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,000
it would only cost

713
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,350
less than 1K a year.

714
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,750
Didn't you say this morning my mom's

715
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,000
too old to be insured?

716
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,030
Those standard medical plans

717
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,750
with full coverage won't work.

718
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,270
Hello?

719
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,240
How much is the river shrimp?

720
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,550
Small ones 35, large ones 48.

721
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,350
Why so expensive?

722
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Can you make it cheaper?

723
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,000
Can't go lower.

724
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,830
Oh my!

725
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,110
You get what you pay for!

726
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,000
It's good stuff!

727
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,790
These shrimp are super fresh, look!

728
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,310
I'll have a kilo, big ones.

729
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:11,920
One kilo?

730
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,480
One kilo, large ones.

731
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,640
Let me finish the fish.

732
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,880
Mr. Chen, don't rush.

733
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,070
I need to pick up my kid!

734
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,550
I'm here! Don't worry!

735
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,110
Let me!

736
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,830
Don't worry.

737
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,350
See if this is enough.

738
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,310
Take out any you don't want.

739
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,310
Look, this one's dead.

740
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:27,830
I don't want it.

741
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,000
Take the dead ones out.

742
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,030
These okay?

743
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,480
About right.

744
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,350
One kilo!

745
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,200
One kilo, let me check.

746
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,270
Mr. Chen, how much?

747
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:36,830
Fifty.

748
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,310
Fifty yuan okay?

749
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,070
Sure, sure.

750
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,160
I'll bag it for you.

751
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,310
- Okay. - Scan the code.

752
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:41,960
Alright.

753
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
Payment's done.

754
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,110
Got it.

755
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,400
Do come again.

756
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,070
Will do.

757
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,000
Thank you.

758
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,830
Where was I just now?

759
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,960
This product's key feature:

760
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,000
Only covers non-medical insurance costs,

761
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,880
meaning if you don't have
medical insurance,

762
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,070
it's effectively full coverage

763
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,070
with an annual claim limit
of one million.

764
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,680
So basically,

765
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,790
annual medical expenses under one million

766
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,640
are all reimbursable.

767
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,310
Got it?

768
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,880
Honestly, this amount suffices
for most cases.

769
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,340
[Zhiyuan]

770
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:25,720
Ms. Hu

771
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,550
feel free to attend to your business.

772
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,160
No worries, Mr. Chen.

773
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,510
Here.

774
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,200
I'll leave the materials here.

775
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,160
Take your time reading them.

776
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:34,310
Okay.

777
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,550
Enroll one day earlier,

778
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,200
get coverage one day sooner, understand?

779
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,030
I'll leave these here.

780
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,510
Okay.

781
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,550
Your floor is too slippery.

782
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,590
Be careful not to fall.

783
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,510
- Right. - You should mop it.

784
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,070
Okay.

785
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,160
Too much water.

786
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,720
Are you okay?

787
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,400
I'm fine.

788
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,550
There, there.

789
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
How dare he bear the Ding surname?

790
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,440
He's doing it.

791
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,720
Calm down.

792
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,480
Here.

793
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,880
You'd better think of a solution!

794
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,270
Here!

795
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,350
Right here!

796
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,510
Here, right here.

797
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,790
There's an emergency at school.

798
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,110
Director Huang wants me back now.

799
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,960
I really have no choice.

800
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,350
I... I can only turn to you.

801
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,920
When you're helpless, you come to me.

802
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,400
Don't I have a job to do?

803
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:21,960
I...

804
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,640
I know, I...

805
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,750
But my uncle here...

806
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,480
Fine, I know—just go.

807
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,440
Thanks, thanks.

808
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,960
I leave it to you, I...

809
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,790
I have to go.

810
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,350
Young people these days...

811
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,200
Hello.

812
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,750
Manli!

813
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,400
What's going on?

814
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,720
Talk some sense into him.

815
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,880
Ask that man!

816
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,510
I just went to see a doctor

817
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,000
and ran into that young guy.

818
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,310
Just because he's a doctor

819
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,920
he started yelling at me.

820
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,350
How humiliating is that?

821
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,030
This is a good thing.

822
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,020
Huh?

823
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,160
How many patients

824
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,350
do doctors see daily
in such a big hospital?

825
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Him raising his voice at you

826
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,240
is completely normal.

827
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,640
If among so many people,

828
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,200
he's only polite to you,

829
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,960
what would that mean?

830
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,830
What does it mean?

831
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,680
It would mean your illness

832
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,550
is untreatable!

833
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,790
Think.

834
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,400
Doesn't that make sense?

835
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Manli's right.

836
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,680
The doctor speaking to you like that

837
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,440
means it's just a minor issue.

838
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,310
- You're okay. - Exactly!

839
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,350
I'm not so sure.

840
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,160
If I were

841
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,590
someone important,

842
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,400
How dare he talk like that

843
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,440
or treat me that way?

844
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,240
We simply don't know people.

845
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,510
We don't have connections.

846
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,270
He's bullying us.

847
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,270
I understand.

848
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,160
You're all about the patient experience.

849
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:42,680
Right?

850
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,070
No need to bother Ding Zhiyuan with this.

851
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,030
I'll handle it.

852
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,510
Really?

853
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,790
In the end, it's Manli we count on.

854
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,510
Come with me.

855
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,270
We're good.

856
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,350
The surgical incision is only 1cm.

857
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,790
Recovery should be quick.

858
00:29:59,310 --> 00:29:59,880
That's wonderful!

859
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:00,920
Congrats, Xiaozhou.

860
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,750
Thank you, Ya.

861
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,680
This is great!

862
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,110
Thank you.

863
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:07,960
Fantastic!

864
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,200
I need to take this call.

865
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,680
Okay, go ahead.

866
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,350
When Ms. Wang arrives,
I'll come find you.

867
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:18,750
Alright.

868
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,640
Stay with your mom.

869
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,590
Hello? Manli?

870
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,400
Did you need something?

871
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,720
Ding Fugui, right?

872
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,720
You have heart valve insufficiency.

873
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,550
You need surgery to replace the valve.

874
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,200
Doctor,

875
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,680
you're saying exactly
what our provincial hospital said.

876
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,310
They also advised us that

877
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,590
this surgery isn't a must.

878
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,550
It's our choice.

879
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,920
That's indeed the case.

880
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,440
If you were much older

881
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,790
we'd consider conservative treatment.

882
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,720
But you're not even sixty yet.

883
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,240
Your body can still handle the surgery.

884
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,510
Of course,

885
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,750
the surgery does carry some risks.

886
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,350
About that,

887
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,070
you need to think it through.

888
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,590
Doctor, after all this talk,

889
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,830
should we actually do

890
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,590
the surgery or not?

891
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,200
What the doctor means is

892
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,720
if the surgery succeeds,

893
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,240
well,

894
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,160
your quality of life will improve.

895
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,270
But if it fails,

896
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,960
after he has the surgery,

897
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,160
within a few years, he...

898
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,790
What... what do you mean?

899
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,110
My... my parents

900
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,480
lived to nearly a hundred!

901
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,200
I've still got decades left to live.

902
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,720
You...

903
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,720
Alright, since that's the case,

904
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,480
we can perform this surgery.

905
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:36,830
But

906
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,480
your basic medical insurance
doesn't cover this.

907
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,550
It's at your own cost.

908
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,160
No problem, doctor.

909
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,000
We bought

910
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,350
my husband insurance two years ago.

911
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,920
Just give us the best medication.

912
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,550
The most expensive ones.

913
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,920
Imported drugs only.

914
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,720
We can get reimbursed, right?

915
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,270
Alright.

916
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,310
Then go get
a full set of tests done first.

917
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,000
Wait.

918
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,550
Doctor.

919
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,960
Look, we've already done all the tests

920
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,110
back in our hometown.

921
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,200
To have surgery,

922
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,880
of course, we need to
redo the tests before that,

923
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,310
in case there are
any changes in condition,

924
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,680
so we can adjust
the surgical plan accordingly.

925
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,830
Makes sense.

926
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,680
Let's do them.

927
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,160
That makes sense.

928
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,550
Really appreciate your help today.

929
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,160
I didn't do much.

930
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,550
Just made some phone calls.

931
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,110
The director could squeeze us in today,

932
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,960
so I brought you all here.

933
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,680
How was Xiaozhou's mom's surgery?

934
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,030
It went well.

935
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,070
Xiaozhou is really happy.

936
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:29,920
That's wonderful.

937
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,000
Come visit us sometime.

938
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,830
You're Xiaozhou's girlfriend.

939
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,830
Then you're my younger sister.

940
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,440
He's staying at my place now.

941
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,590
My home is your home.

942
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,590
Look how thin you are.

943
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,590
You should eat more.

944
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,160
Come to my place, I'll cook for you.

945
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,880
Manli, you must be busy.

946
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,550
I need to go, too.

947
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,400
I'll be off.

948
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,750
Alright, we'll keep in touch.

949
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,240
Okay.

950
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,030
I'll buy you dinner.

951
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:51,750
Sure

952
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,720
Hello?

953
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,380
Huh?

954
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,680
You...you go first.

955
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,070
Hey.

956
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,200
What's wrong?

957
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,070
Manli...

958
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,270
Well...

959
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,640
They said we need 200K deposit
for hospitalization.

960
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,110
The surgery fees, treatment costs,

961
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,480
hospital bills - it all adds up.

962
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,920
But hospitals refund any overpayment.

963
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,310
Such a large sum of money,

964
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,880
will insurance cover it?

965
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,000
No problem at all.

966
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,920
Are you sure?

967
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,830
Yes.

968
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,240
Manli,

969
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,160
my son's getting married after New Year.

970
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,790
We

971
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,270
bought him a house and car.

972
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,920
Nearly spent all our savings.

973
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,240
We only have 200K left.

974
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,110
It's reserved for his wedding banquet.

975
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,640
What if today

976
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,240
I pay this deposit now,

977
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,240
but the insurance won't cover it?

978
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,000
Don't worry.

979
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,400
Normally it takes about
ten days to process.

980
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,310
I know someone in Blue Ocean Claims Dept.

981
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,400
I'll keep an eye on it.

982
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,030
You know someone there?

983
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:02,680
Alright then.

984
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,270
Well...

985
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,750
I'll go pay now.

986
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,670
[Li Fendou's Struggle]

987
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,030
Um...

988
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,280
Director.

989
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,110
This is all just a misunderstanding.

990
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,400
That day...he invited me for drinks.

991
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,550
Professor Ding.

992
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,030
And...

993
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,710
Don't explain to me.

994
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,510
Write prefaces or

995
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,000
give recommendations is your freedom.

996
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm just giving a friend's advice.

997
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,230
These so-called
autobiographies by upstarts,

998
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,070
at least you should read it first.

999
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,840
The content inside

1000
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,510
is hardly presentable.

1001
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,840
Writing prefaces for books
of this caliber,

1002
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,440
to be honest,

1003
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,030
really lowers your own status.

1004
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,360
I...

1005
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,000
I understand.

1006
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,840
That's why I wanted to explain.

1007
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,670
They'd already told me then.

1008
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,400
They wrote it .

1009
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,880
You should write it yourself
if you want to write for him.

1010
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,360
The ghostwriter's writing style

1011
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,550
is barely high school liberal arts level.

1012
00:34:59,150 --> 00:34:59,760
It even contains

1013
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,670
numerous grammatical errors.

1014
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,440
Putting your name on such work

1015
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,110
will make people laugh.

1016
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,480
Professor Ding,

1017
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,150
you've gained some online fame now.

1018
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,440
The department supports professors

1019
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,070
monetizing knowledge.

1020
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,150
But

1021
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,550
money is one thing.

1022
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,150
Your reputation,

1023
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,510
you should cherish it yourself.

1024
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,030
Director.

1025
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,440
This matter,

1026
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,670
I've truly fallen into their trap.

1027
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,860
Gosh!

1028
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,400
It's a complete loss of dignity.

1029
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,800
Utter disgrace.

1030
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:36,480
I...

1031
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:37,880
Director.

1032
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,320
I beg you.

1033
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,230
Please explain to the committee.

1034
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,320
This wasn't my intention.

1035
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,920
Unless you can prove

1036
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,920
the signature isn't yours,

1037
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,590
otherwise this Model Ethics Award

1038
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,840
won't go to you.

1039
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,070
Zhiyuan,

1040
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,880
you've worked so hard
for your achievements.

1041
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,280
In a couple years,

1042
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,880
I'll retire too.

1043
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,590
The higher-ups are watching.

1044
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,030
Don't ever

1045
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,670
lose big for small gains.

1046
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,230
I understand, I...

1047
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,400
I'm sorry.

1048
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,710
Hello?

1049
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,800
Zhiyuan?

1050
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,590
How's your situation going?

1051
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,590
We've completed the paperwork.

1052
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,550
Already settled in.

1053
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,320
Come over.

1054
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,190
Fugui's still angry with you.

1055
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,000
Did you hear me? Hurry up.

1056
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,840
Alright.

1057
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:30,960
I understand now.

1058
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,440
Well...

1059
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:33,880
Director.

1060
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,440
I have something urgent.

1061
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,000
I need to go to the hospital again.

1062
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,030
I'm sorry.

1063
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,000
I've inquired discreetly.

1064
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,510
Professor Ding has been
staying at the office.

1065
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,320
Three days.

1066
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,880
Not a single call.

1067
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,320
Seems he's really angry.

1068
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,670
Should I go smooth things over?

1069
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,320
No need.

1070
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,510
If I back down this time,

1071
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,070
getting him to help me again will be

1072
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,150
difficult.

1073
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,230
But if this continues,

1074
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,000
I worry Professor Ding might blame you.

1075
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,550
He's furious right now.

1076
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,070
He won't listen to anything I say.

1077
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,550
Let him vent first.

1078
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,280
I'll handle him later.

1079
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,320
It's nothing serious.

1080
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,070
Back to your work.

1081
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,360
I'll be off.

1082
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:45,880
Look...

1083
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,480
Manli bought so much food.

1084
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,670
Uncle.

1085
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,800
I bought you some milk.

1086
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,920
Don't you know I can't drink milk?

1087
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,070
Milk gives me diarrhea.

1088
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,150
Why are you so late?

1089
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,670
I was busy.

1090
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,590
You were busy.

1091
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:10,630
Well...

1092
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,630
What about your new girlfriend then?

1093
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,360
Why hasn't she come?

1094
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,150
An elder is hospitalized.

1095
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,550
Isn't it rude not to show up?

1096
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,030
She's busy too.

1097
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,960
She's busy too.

1098
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,800
What could a woman be so busy with?

1099
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,230
No matter how busy she is,
she's still your wife!

1100
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,670
You're a grown man.

1101
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,480
You should keep your woman in check.

1102
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,800
What's the point otherwise?

1103
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,710
Look at Manli.

1104
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,000
Even after breaking up with you,

1105
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,550
she's still running around helping.

1106
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,760
Just one call

1107
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,230
got me this chief physician,

1108
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,550
Bought so many things too.

1109
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,400
Look.

1110
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:42,630
This wash basin,

1111
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,030
all these necessities,

1112
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,000
and so much food.

1113
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
All from Manli.

1114
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,230
Oh, and this folding bed.

1115
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,400
This inpatient ward

1116
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,320
only has this one left.

1117
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,510
Manli snatched it for me.

1118
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,280
Otherwise,

1119
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,630
I'd have nowhere to sleep at night.

1120
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,440
Honestly, you...

1121
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,150
What were you even thinking?

1122
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,510
Leaving such a wonderful woman.

1123
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,710
What were you messing around for?

1124
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,190
You... go do your work.

1125
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,070
Go ahead.

1126
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,710
It's fine, I'll sit with you awhile.

1127
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,150
Hurry up and eat.

1128
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,550
You've lost weight since moving out.

1129
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,030
Seems without me watching over you,

1130
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,440
you can't take care of yourself.

1131
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,760
I'm fine.

1132
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,710
How's Baodan doing?

1133
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,760
Baodan's doing great.

1134
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,070
Absolutely thriving.

1135
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,030
Let me tell you.

1136
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
At the very beginning

1137
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,760
Manli refused to keep Baodan.

1138
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,590
But later,

1139
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,550
Baodan won her over

1140
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,480
with sheer charm.

1141
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,070
Now everything - baths

1142
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,070
feeding, litter scooping, nail trimming,

1143
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,280
she's more diligent than I am.

1144
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,440
There was this hilarious incident.

1145
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,480
Baodan

1146
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,840
scratched a corner of Manli's sofa.

1147
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,280
So I pretended to scold it

1148
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,030
and hit it.

1149
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,000
Suddenly Manli came between us

1150
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
and scolded me instead,

1151
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,320
saying Baodan's just a cat.

1152
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,670
It can't control itself.

1153
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,280
Then I felt relieved.

1154
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,400
You only ask about Baodan.

1155
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,920
Don't you care how I'm doing?

1156
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
Well...

1157
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,510
How are you?

1158
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,230
I'm not good.

1159
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,070
When I make another big deal with Manli

1160
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,440
and earn enough money,

1161
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,070
let's rent another place

1162
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,550
near the hospital.

1163
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,400
Baodan needs its mother.

1164
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,360
I need you more.

1165
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:44,880
Ya?

1166
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,800
Xiaozhou.

1167
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,480
We're over.

1168
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,400
Wait, is this some new prank?

1169
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,440
Xiaozhou, I'm serious.

1170
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,510
We're over.

1171
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,030
Ya, what's wrong?

1172
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:19,150
Did something bad happen at work?

1173
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,800
No.

1174
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,440
Did...did I do something to upset you?

1175
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,030
Is it because
I've been taking care of Mom

1176
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,230
and neglected your feelings?

1177
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,510
Or do you think I shouldn't
live with Manli?

1178
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,960
No, Xiaozhou, we...

1179
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,480
Then why?

1180
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,440
It doesn't matter.

1181
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,710
Anyway, from now on,

1182
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,480
take care of yourself.

1183
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,800
No, Ya, what's really wrong?

1184
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:03,760
Ya.

1185
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,590
Is everything okay at work?

1186
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,760
Yeah.

1187
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,400
She was just awarded
department star recently.

1188
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,670
Why are you asking this?

1189
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,800
Nothing, I just noticed
she's been looking tired

1190
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,440
lately.

1191
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,840
Wanted to share some of her workload

1192
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,920
You're making me jealous.

1193
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,760
