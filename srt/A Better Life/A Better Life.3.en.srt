40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Episode 3

41
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,850
Mr. Ai,

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,330
It's Manli.

43
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,290
My deepest condolences.

44
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,050
Unfortunately,

45
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,410
our claim adjuster
is also dealing with a bereavement,

46
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,820
so the claim payment
will be slightly delayed.

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,100
Manli,

48
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,690
I trust you'll handle it well.

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,770
Thank you for your understanding.

50
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,690
You must be busy. I won't keep you.

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,570
Okay.

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,620
Morning, Ms. Hu.

53
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,540
Morning.

54
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,820
Did you receive the photos?

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,820
Go ahead.

56
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,660
Weina informed me

57
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,940
Ms. Li has met with Hu Manli.

58
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,160
Regarding the investigation
into Hu Manli,

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,380
how far along is it?

60
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,220
Still looking into it.

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,260
But whether we'll find anything
is uncertain.

62
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,260
You need to hurry, honey.

63
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,890
As I've mentioned to you before,

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,410
when I left Hu Manli back then,

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,540
I straight up
poached one of her major clients

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,690
and brought them to TSI.

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,060
If she really joins our company,

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,260
I won't have an easy life.

69
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,890
If she doesn't come,
this position is mine.

70
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,260
Dig deeper.

71
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,130
I'm sure you'll find something.

72
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,540
In earlier years without dual recording

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,980
to get commissions,

74
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,450
she wrote liability waivers for clients

75
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,610
and signed for them.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,340
She definitely did these things often.

77
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,540
Go in this direction.

78
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,690
Strike hard.

79
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,060
You'll absolutely get results.

80
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,410
I believe it.

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,170
But if clients side with her

82
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,060
and stubbornly deny,

83
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,380
it'll be hard to prove.

84
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,100
Before dual recording,

85
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,610
insurance fraud hotspot was

86
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,820
medical insurance.

87
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,100
Right.

88
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,170
Target medical insurance first.

89
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,100
Got it.

90
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,760
At your service.

91
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,140
Manli.

92
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,810
Breaking news.

93
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,370
Mr. Wei's father fractured a bone.

94
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,050
Mr. Ma,

95
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,730
what happened?

96
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,020
Quick! Send me the hospital address!

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,610
You're so fast.

98
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,170
I was about to text you when you called.

99
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,220
Sending it now.

100
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,370
Okay.

101
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,880
One more thing,

102
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,580
Be careful of Kaixi,
Mr. Wei's secretary.

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,810
She's been badmouthing you to the boss,

104
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,050
trying to recommend
other insurance agents.

105
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,340
Don't worry.

106
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,220
With this call of yours,

107
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,580
Mr. Wei's deal is in the bag.

108
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,980
Mr. Ma, you've done us a huge favor.

109
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,020
Thank you.

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,140
Bye.

111
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,050
I'll go see Mr. Wei tomorrow.

112
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,700
Okay?

113
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,660
Drop the question mark.

114
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,850
Mr. Wei, after so many attempts,

115
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,490
you finally have time for me.

116
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,490
I can't keep avoiding you forever.

117
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,490
Have a seat, please.

118
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,610
Limited edition tea leaves.

119
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,370
Do try some.

120
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,850
Fine, just leave it there.

121
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,370
Alright.

122
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,810
But let's be clear.

123
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,170
I'll accept this gift,

124
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,170
but that expiring annuity product,

125
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,460
I'm really not interested.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,370
If you're short on commission,

127
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,140
we can collaborate on other projects.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,780
I won't let you leave empty-handed.

129
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,780
However,

130
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,780
like I always say,
I don't buy insurance.

131
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,850
If you're a friend,

132
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,810
let's sit down for tea and chat.

133
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,490
But if you're selling,

134
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,730
then I can't have you stay.

135
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,660
I'm not here to sell insurance today.

136
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,580
I'm here to process your claim.

137
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,020
Claim?

138
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,610
But I never bought insurance.

139
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,460
What claim?

140
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,490
You did buy it.

141
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,540
Impossible!

142
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,050
You really did.

143
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,020
Wait, hold on.

144
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,370
What kind of new trick is this?

145
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,460
Once when I came to pitch insurance,

146
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,140
your father happened to be there.

147
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,340
He said he wanted critical illness coverage.

148
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,810
I remember advising my dad
not to buy it.

149
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,220
Right.

150
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,840
Wait, what do you mean?

151
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,340
You signed up my dad behind my back?

152
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,490
Actually, at his age then,

153
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,220
he couldn't qualify for that plan.

154
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,020
But since we're friends,

155
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,810
I applied to the company

156
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,660
and gave him free accident insurance.

157
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,020
Accident coverage has no age limit.

158
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,220
It's valid till age 100.

159
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,370
Complimentary accident insurance.

160
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,370
Such a thing exists?

161
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,900
I consider you a friend,

162
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,250
while you've always seen me as a fraud.

163
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,610
I just can't swallow this injustice.

164
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,250
So the past two years,

165
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,850
I've been doing good deeds.

166
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,490
Your father's accident insurance,

167
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,810
I've been renewing it all along.

168
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,290
Manli, I'm truly impressed.

169
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,610
So then,

170
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,250
when I heard your father
had a bone fracture...

171
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,050
Wow, you're really well-informed.

172
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,300
What do you mean? Can this be claimed?

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,730
Of course.

174
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,980
Isn't this
what accident insurance covers?

175
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,700
I came today to collect documents

176
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,490
to process the claim for him.

177
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,250
It can really be claimed?

178
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,130
You're not paying out of
your pocket again?

179
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,100
Losing money for goodwill?

180
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,490
I couldn't afford that.

181
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,730
Premiums are cheap
but claims can be huge.

182
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,420
How huge could it possibly be?

183
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,610
There must be some fine print.

184
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,530
After deductions,
barely anything's left.

185
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,850
Let me put it this way.

186
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,940
If this settlement

187
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,250
doesn't meet your expectations,

188
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,940
I, Hu Manli,

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,610
will vanish from your sight forever.

190
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,060
I won't bother you again.

191
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,770
Alright.

192
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,940
Anyway,
it's all up to how you handle it.

193
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,180
As long as
the money ends up in my pocket,

194
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,220
I'll be very happy.

195
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,060
Now,

196
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,650
I'll have my secretary

197
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,420
send you
my father's documents later, okay?

198
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,220
Okay, I'll wait for it.

199
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:30,850
Good.

200
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,610
I'll take my leave .

201
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,460
No, have some tea.

202
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,610
No, I won't be in your way.

203
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,490
I'll be off.

204
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,610
Take care.

205
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,300
Okay.

206
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,610
What's this?

207
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,490
Open it and have a look.

208
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,980
Take a look at this.

209
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,660
[Cao Ling's Claim]

210
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,460
According to your instructions,

211
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,920
I mainly investigated

212
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,100
all policies Hu Manli had before 2021.

213
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,460
Up there.

214
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,060
This client had breast cancer
ten years ago.

215
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,730
Ms. Hu processed her claim.

216
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,830
The claim amount was 300,000.

217
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,340
What's the problem?

218
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,850
Before taking out the policy,
Cao Ling already had

219
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,370
breast cancer before.

220
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,010
When she was ill,

221
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,220
big data wasn't interconnected then.

222
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,100
It couldn't be detected during claim.

223
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,830
Now big data is linked.

224
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,770
All this information surfaces.

225
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,710
Therefore,

226
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,640
Ms. Hu colluded with clients for fraud.

227
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,700
There's this suspicion,

228
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,580
but no clear evidence shows

229
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,980
Ms. Hu knew about this.

230
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,700
I need evidence.

231
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,850
This is all I've found so far.

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,060
If you need,

233
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,580
I can ask Cao Ling.

234
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,370
I could also question Ms. Hu.

235
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,980
Don't bother Ms. Hu.

236
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,610
I'll report to Mr. Jin first.

237
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,820
Let Mr. Jin decide.

238
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,060
Understood.

239
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,250
Then I'll schedule with Cao Ling.

240
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,180
Meet her ASAP.

241
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,250
Okay.

242
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,060
I'll be off.

243
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,340
Ms. Manli.

244
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,010
Hello.

245
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,420
Ms. Manli.

246
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,460
Ms. Manli.

247
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,220
Hello.

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,420
Chunlu.

249
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,250
Come.

250
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,460
Mr. Wei senior's claim documents.

251
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,460
You handle it.

252
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,130
Expedite the procedure ASAP.

253
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,370
Manli, you're amazing.

254
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,130
By giving free
annual accident insurance,

255
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,850
you hooked a big fish like Mr. Wei.

256
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,530
Five years.

257
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,730
A full five years.

258
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:40,820
Manli,

259
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,530
you're so patient.

260
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,130
Learned another trick today.

261
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,370
At first it was just for performance.

262
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,580
Then it was pure stubbornness.

263
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,060
We're selling insurance,

264
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,220
not to scam money.

265
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,770
We have principles
and bottom lines, right?

266
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,350
Right.

267
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,580
Go now.

268
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,010
Through today's real case sharing,

269
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,940
I want to tell my dear clients,

270
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,370
as our parents age,

271
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,650
medical insurance gets hard to buy.

272
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,010
Accident insurance is essential.

273
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,460
DM me for details.

274
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,580
The slowest pace
isn't short steps but hesitation.

275
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,250
The fastest pace
isn't sprinting but persistence.

276
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,610
I'm Blue Ocean Hu.

277
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,100
Love you all.

278
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,300
The slowest pace isn't short steps

279
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,890
but hesitation.

280
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,370
Don't think about it. It's bad luck.

281
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,980
Manli, I never expected this.

282
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,250
When my father got discharged,

283
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,250
after medical insurance,

284
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,650
we only paid about 670 in cash.

285
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,890
Yet your company's compensation

286
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,420
transferred over 2,000.

287
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,130
My father even joked with me.

288
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,420
Said falling earns you money now.

289
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,650
Almost like a professional scam.

290
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,880
After deducting your medical costs,

291
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,910
we processed the claim payment.

292
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,940
Every single week,

293
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,980
there's also over 700 yuan
for nursing care.

294
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,610
Frankly, I'd rather
not to earn this money.

295
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,650
Your father's well-being

296
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,820
means more than anything, right?

297
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:44,710
Manli,

298
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,010
I'll take your kind words.

299
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,610
Here, Manli.

300
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,700
Let me thank you for my father.

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,060
Thanks you.

302
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,300
Mr. Wei,

303
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,730
I'm not here to claim credit today.

304
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,180
I know - next business deal, right?

305
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,530
Fine, that thing
you mentioned last time,

306
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,580
something that's about to terminate.

307
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,580
Tell me about it.

308
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,530
I'm not here for your commission either.

309
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,940
Then what?

310
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,250
I just need your words.

311
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,650
We insurance agents,

312
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,770
are we all scammers?

313
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,820
Manli, you've been waiting for this.

314
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,220
Then let's speak frankly.

315
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:31,590
Manli,

316
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,100
you've tracked my case for five years

317
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,980
just to provide me service.

318
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,060
I truly admire that.

319
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,530
But you're you, others are others.

320
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,530
You're good. You don't cheat me.

321
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,730
But with others,

322
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,490
I'll still...still keep my doubts.

323
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,180
Alright?

324
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,060
Mr. Wei, let me put it this way.

325
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,770
In the insurance industry,

326
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,060
most people are like me,

327
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,530
working conscientiously.

328
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,100
Are there scammers in the industry?

329
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,300
Of course.

330
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,100
Then again,

331
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,060
which industry has no scammers?

332
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,820
Right?

333
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,100
We can't judge the whole field

334
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,610
by a handful of bad apples.

335
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,180
That's not good.

336
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:11,890
Right?

337
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,940
Makes sense.

338
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,180
Then I take back what I said.

339
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,700
Well,

340
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,180
insurance agents,

341
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,010
most of them

342
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,220
aren't actually scammers.

343
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,850
Happy now?

344
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,420
So meticulous.

345
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,820
If I'm not meticulous in business,
I'll go bankrupt.

346
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,940
Alright,

347
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,730
Now we've reached the moment of truth.

348
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,340
Fine, go ahead.

349
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,100
Nothing escapes you, does it?

350
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,250
Since you're straightforward,
I'll get right to the point.

351
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,370
I think

352
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,700
given your current situation,

353
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,530
you should consider buying
whole life insurance.

354
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,820
My recommendation is
30 million coverage.

355
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,340
30 million.

356
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,490
That's quite an appetite you have.

357
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,610
I'd have to spend so much more annually,

358
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,370
yet you only give me 3.5% interest.

359
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,420
That's too low.

360
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,580
Mr. Wei,

361
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,370
may I boldly correct a misconception?

362
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,460
Insurance

363
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,130
is not icing on the cake,

364
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,700
but fuel in snowy weather.

365
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,980
To go far in life,

366
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,890
sometimes fuel matters
more than the icing.

367
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,460
How about this?

368
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,530
Prepare a detailed proposal first.

369
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,660
I'll take a look.

370
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,420
Tomorrow.

371
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,460
No problem.

372
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,180
Manli.

373
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,420
The life insurance plan for Mr. Wei,

374
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,180
have you checked the format and typos?

375
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,860
Already checked.

376
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,810
Went through it three times
as you instructed.

377
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,010
Make sure him read it through.

378
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,180
WeChat me immediately with his reaction.

379
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,900
Manli, I'm still a bit scared.

380
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,570
Maybe wait until you're done here,

381
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,050
or you could come with me instead.

382
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,380
In extreme cases, even one day's delay

383
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,940
or one hour, one minute

384
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,330
could make the cooked duck fly away,
got it?

385
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,010
Chunlu, perk up.

386
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,810
Today will be our brand new day.

387
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,980
Go on now.

388
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:46,920
Okay.

389
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,140
Your Chengdu branch is doing well.

390
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,770
This year's performance
grew significantly,

391
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,450
Yes.

392
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,580
We've been catching up to Shanghai.

393
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,810
We have urgent matters for Mr. Jin.

394
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,700
Okay, one moment.

395
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,050
Mr. Liu said
we should learn from Shanghai.

396
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,910
He really said that?

397
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,530
- Excuse me. - Yes.

398
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,420
Mr. Jin, Chen Fang says it's urgent.

399
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,940
Mr. Jin, sorry to interrupt,

400
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,530
but there's something important.

401
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,780
I think it's necessary to
report to you in person.

402
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,780
What is it?

403
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,550
Mr. Jin,

404
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,490
I have another piece of news.

405
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,460
Ms. Hu plans to use

406
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,730
Insurance Star as leverage to

407
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,490
jump ship to TSI for a higher salary.

408
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,140
Distinguished leaders,

409
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,140
dear colleagues, hello everyone.

410
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,420
First of all,

411
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,620
I would like to express

412
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,050
my deep gratitude for being awarded

413
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,420
the Blue Ocean Star.

414
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,420
Though the award

415
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,460
is an internal honor
within Blue Ocean Group,

416
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,730
it carries benchmark influence
in the industry.

417
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,420
Calling it the Oscar of insurance
isn't an exaggeration.

418
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,380
To be awarded with...

419
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,330
Memorizing lines?

420
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,770
Congratulations!

421
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,730
A bit too early, but thank you.

422
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,180
Not early at all.

423
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,140
Everyone knows you're the talk

424
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,570
of the company these days.

425
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,660
This awards ceremony

426
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,620
has to recognize you first.

427
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,290
How are you going to
celebrate with Professor Ding?

428
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,530
Have he already

429
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,980
prepared a candlelit dinner at home?

430
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,420
That's wonderful.

431
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,940
Today's a big day in your life.

432
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,980

good evening.

440
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,490

let's turn our attention to the screen.

Flowing endlessly onward.

17 years of perseverance,

447

[Lu Xiaomei] marks my 198th month of
continuous excellence.

Looking back now,

452
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,530
so many emotions well up.

453
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,490
17 years of perseverance,

454
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,530
I've delivered warm service

455
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,220
to 5,000 clients.

456
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,290
Moving forward,

457
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,140
I'll keep striving endlessly,

458
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,530
continuously serving,

459
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,250
leading other team members.

460
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,380
Mr. Hu, your team has done well.

461
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,530
Winding and converging,

462
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,090
all because of trust.

463
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,290
Becoming the district director,

464
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,730
I feel the responsibility is greater.

465
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,140
My daily schedule is packed tight.

466
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,010
I manage the team in the mornings and

467
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,510
schedule the client visit
for the afternoon.

468
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,010
Some say insurance work is stressful,

469
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,420
but I believe
it's greater responsibility.

470
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,530
Perseverance leads to lasting success,

471
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,010

Take a look.

514
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,090
Is this for real?

515
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,460

What's going on?

522

We have some connections.

523
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,090
Why would they kick you out?

524
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,660
Did you say something wrong?

525
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,530
Come back first. Mr. Jin.

526
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,030
Come in.

527
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,330
Ms. Hu.

528
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,040
Take a look.

529
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,620
Cao Ling?

530
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,940
She's my client, what about her?

531
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,510
Well.

532
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,700
My subordinate was sorting through
old claim policies.

533
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,220
He found something suspicious
in this policy.

534
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,460
So, there are some questions

535
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,490
I'd like to clarify with you.

536
00:26:59,480 --> 00:26:59,940
You said

537
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,660
ten years ago,

538
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,570
Cao Ling bought
critical illness insurance from you.

539
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,160
Afterwards,

540
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,700
she filed a claim

541
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,140
for breast cancer.

542
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,010
That's right.

543
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,900
But this Cao Ling

544
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,700
had already had breast cancer

545
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,140
before purchasing the insurance.

546
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,250
Were you aware of this?

547
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,330
Per regulations,

548
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,140
Cao Ling shouldn't have qualified
for this insurance.

549
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,190
Even if she bought it,

550
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,090
recurrent breast cancer

551
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,530
won't be covered either

552
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:38,990
Right?

553
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,120
Ms. Hu,

554
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,730
regarding her situation...

555
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,330
I'm not sure.

556
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,570
Not sure?

557
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,400
Yes.

558
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,100
According to the insurance process,

559
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,730
I asked all required questions
before signing.

560
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,460
The client failed to
disclose truthfully.

561
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,090
Are you sure

562
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,460
it's the client's fault?

563
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,140
What do you mean?

564
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,460
Are you doubting me?

565
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,330
She told me to do it this way.

566
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,330
I knew having had breast cancer

567
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,330
would disqualify me from insurance,

568
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,180
so I didn't want to buy it.

569
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,530
But Hu Manli told me it's fine.

570
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,900
Said she'd help me figure it out later

571
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,010
by tampering with medical records.

572
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,860
She's lying! I didn't!

573
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,730
Why would I instruct her?

574
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,490
Only you know the truth.

575
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,290
Mr. Jin, her situation,

576
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,810
I...I didn't know.

577
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,490
She's slandering me!

578
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,460
She has no reason to.

579
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,420
Why would she slander you?

580
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,490
Let me ask you.

581
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,250
Before Cao Ling took out the insurance,

582
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,570
did you know she had breast cancer?

583
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,770
Mr. Jin, I...

584
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,160
Did you,

585
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,620
or didn't you?

586
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,180
Manli, I'm begging you.

587
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,730
My child has autism.

588
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,900
If you don't help me now,

589
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,330
I have no way out.

590
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,460
Manli, please help me.

591
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,220
I'm begging you, Manli.

592
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,250
Get up. Please get up.

593
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,420
Can we talk?

594
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,570
Manli...

595
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,860
Stop kneeling.

596
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,180
Can you really bear

597
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,330
to see me and my son die?

598
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,810
Her situation was complicated.

599
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,700
Enough! That's enough.

600
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,810
I don't care about the rest.

601
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,050
Mr. Jin, give me a chance.

602
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,220
Let me explain privately.

603
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,770
Don't bother.

604
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,050
You're a veteran.

605
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,770
I'll save you the dignity.

606
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,900
Leave on your own.

607
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,140
Leave?

608
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,700
Where can I go?

609
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,380
Don't you get it?

610
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,900
You got fired.

611
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,490
Hu Manli is in trouble.

612
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,490
What happened?

613
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,420
What's wrong?

614
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,940
What exactly is going on?

615
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,900
Cao Ling, hello. I'm Hu Manli.

616
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,420
Hello.

617
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,940
The number you dialed is powered off.

618
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,330
Mr. Fang.

619
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,250
Mr. Fang.

620
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:38,980
What?

621
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,620
I... In the materials
I gave you earlier.

622
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,220
There wasn't that voice recorder.

623
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,290
Ms. Hu is after all a senior agent.

624
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,490
There might be
some misunderstanding.

625
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,290
I asked the client specifically.

626
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,530
But I didn't know my inquiry

627
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,730
would actually harm Ms. Hu.

628
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,490
But Cao Ling told me before.

629
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,140
She was the culprit in the fraud.

630
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,700
It wasn't instigated by Ms. Hu.

631
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,700
Ms. Hu must have arranged it with her.

632
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,660
When I stepped in,

633
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,660
the client got scared

634
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,330
and revealed the truth

635
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,460
about this matter.

636
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,490
The relevant department has verified it.

637
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,140
It's extremely egregious.

638
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,330
Maybe termination

639
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,140
is the best outcome for Ms. Hu.

640
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,050
Work hard.

641
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,980
You're about to become permanent staff.

642
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,540
[Police Report]

643
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,660
Ms. Hu, you can't go in! Ms. Hu!

644
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,700
Mr. Jin, do you remember
this police report?

645
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,980
Why do you still have it?

646
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,220
Back then I was alone,

647
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,140
doing cold calls in Nanhui.

648
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,980
I was new and clueless.

649
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,460
I ended up getting arrested

650
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,900
as a scammer by villagers.

651
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,860
It was you

652
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,420
who drove from Xujiahui to Nanhui

653
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,940
for over two hours

654
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,700
to bail me out from the police station

655
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,810
That was August 16, 2004.

656
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,010
You saved me once.

657
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,050
Can you save me one more time, Mr. Jin?

658
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,290
Crying now, are you?

659
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,220
Weren't you so capable before?

660
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,170
Got arrogant as your performance grew.

661
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,490
Had others sign
compliance training for you.

662
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,050
When underwriting claims,

663
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,780
you bypassed procedures
for expedited processing.

664
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,010
The back-office staff

665
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,530
have been discontent with you for long.

666
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,130
I've been covering for you
on many things.

667
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,780
You know that?

668
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,010
I know I was wrong, Mr. Jin.

669
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,050
I'll change, I know I messed up.

670
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,090
Even if you made all those mistakes,

671
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,210
I'm still willing to give you a hand.

672
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,010
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

673
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,530
If you hadn't met with Li Qingqing...

674
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,940
I can explain about Li Qingqing.

675
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,900
Just answer me.

676
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,780
Did you meet with Li Qingqing or not?

677
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,690
She did contact me,

678
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,610
but I didn't agree to anything.

679
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,690
You didn't agree

680
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,380
because you hadn't won
Insurance Star yet!

681
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,860
Once you got that honor,

682
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,820
you'd have leverage to negotiate, right?

683
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,820
No!

684
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,210
She did reach out to me.

685
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,170
I was afraid refusing would offend her.

686
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,650
And yes, it flattered my vanity too.

687
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,690
But I didn't promise her anything.

688
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,980
I never considered leaving, Mr. Jin.

689
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,490
If it weren't for you back then,

690
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,090
I wouldn't be where I am today.

691
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,570
I'm not an ungrateful person.

692
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,740
Alright, enough.

693
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,090
I don't care what you say.

694
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,170
I only care what you do.

695
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,490
Your actions have spoken clearly.

696
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,170
Very well then.

697
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,860
That Li Qingqing,

698
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,530
her wolf-pack mentality is quite famous

699
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,210
in our industry.

700
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,420
Over at her place,

701
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,980
everything is profit-driven.

702
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,300
You'd fit right in there.

703
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,740
It suits you.

704
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,050
I respect your choice.

705
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,260
And let me congratulate you, okay?

706
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,610
Be civil.

707
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:56,860
Leave your own.

708
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:35,740
Honey.

709
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,900
It's done.

710
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,090
Don't worry.

711
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,260
I begged Ms. Hu not to tell.

712
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,130
I got on my knees and pleaded.

713
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,420
I told her

714
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,610
if she exposes this matter,

715
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,460
then my child and I

716
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,130
would have no way out.

717
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,380
So you mean

718
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,380
Hu Manli didn't put you up to this?

719
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,010
Yes.

720
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,260
Then this is serious trouble.

721
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,460
The company has found out now.

722
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,300
300,000 means over ten years in prison.

723
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:19,980
Please help me.

724
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,340
No.

725
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,860
My child is sick.

726
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,050
He needs my care.

727
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,650
I'm begging you.

728
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,490
Help me, I can't get caught! No!

729
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,050
Ma'am, please don't do this.

730
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,780
I'm just following company orders.

731
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,780
Ma'am...

732
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,610
Please stand up.

733
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:32,780
Get up/

734
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,130
It's not that I don't want the money.

735
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,570
Given your current situation,

736
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,380
there might be a way out.

737
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,940
Please help me.

738
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,610
I underestimated you.

739
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,380
I always thought

740
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,530
you just wanted small favors from me.

741
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,010
Seems I misjudged the situation.

742
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,460
Who's behind you?

743
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,490
Background check was my assignment.

744
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,570
Cut the crap.

745
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,650
What good is ruining me to you?

746
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,300
I'm just doing my job.

747
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,530
Believe it or not.

748
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,260
Fine.

749
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,610
Tight-lipped, aren't you?

750
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,420
We'll meet again.

751
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,900
Better pray
you don't fall into my hands.

752
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:49,780
Hello?

753
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,170
What do you want?

754
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,010
You wouldn't see me.

755
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,940
I had to come to your office.

756
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,260
Want something to drink?

757
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,780
Cut the crap.

758
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,210
It's about the house.

759
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,610
Have you thought about it?

760
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,170
Whether you ask me once
or a hundred times,

761
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,490
my answer remains the same.

762
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,420
I won't sell my family's house.

763
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,740
Xiaozhou,

764
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,050
no matter how you resent your father,
I understand.

765
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,380
But Zhig was your father's life's work.

766
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,530
You can't let anger make you reckless.

767
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,210
I know you need money.

768
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,300
Today,

769
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,130
if you're willing to sign this contract,

770
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,300
the 500K on this card

771
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,260
is yours immediately.

772
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,530
If Xue Runnian

773
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:51,610
saw the company he built collapsing,

774
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,170
wouldn't he be heartbroken?

775
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,690
Xiaozhou,

776
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,610
after all, he was your father.

777
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,900
Who he is doesn't matter.

778
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,530
When people make mistakes,

779
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,380
they must pay the price.

780
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,210
Don't come again.

781
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,820
It won't change anything.

782
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,610
Your company with Xue Runnian

783
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,050
has nothing to do with me.

784
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,420
Xiaozhou.

785
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,420
Don't go.

786
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:24,940
Let go.

787
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,530
Take the card.

788
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,050
Don't you need money?

789
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,010
Just take the card.

790
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,900
You need money, I know.

791
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,340
- Sign the contract. - Let go!

792
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,740
Can you stop this already?

793
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,300
You two...

794
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,650
I figured it out.

795
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,050
Now I've got it all sorted.

796
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,010
So that's why you targeted me.

797
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,610
You're colleagues.

798
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,340
Ding Zhiyuan left me for you.

799
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,340
You've already won.

800
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,130
Must you be so ruthless?

801
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,260
Destroy my career too?

802
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,340
What do you mean?

803
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,820
You orchestrated this
yet pretend ignorance.

804
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,940
It's not what you think.

805
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,570
It just occurred to me.

806
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,460
Does Ding Zhiyuan know he exists?

807
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,010
Young man,

808
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,820
do you know about Ding Zhiyuan?

809
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,610
You're something else.

810
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,690
Both older and younger,
greedy appetites.

811
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,170
You've misunderstood.

812
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,490
So it seems they

813
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,170
don't know about each other.

814
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,010
My relationship with Xiaozhou...

815
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,460
I'm his elder.

816
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,650
It's not the kind you're imagining.

817
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,490
Elder? What kind of elder?

818
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,260
The kind who could save him
20 years of struggle? A sugar mommy?

819
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,010
There's nothing between us.

820
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,210
You two were practically hugging.

821
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,420
And you're still covering for her.

822
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,530
So you knew about
Ding Zhiyuan's existence.

823
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,130
Quite resourceful.

824
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,380
Very charming.

825
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,420
But let me warn you,

826
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,940
Professor Ding is quite innocent.

827
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,090
He wouldn't accept someone this young.

828
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:16,860
Xiaozhou.

829
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,130
Xiaozhou.

830
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,380
Hu Manli.

831
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,570
If you feel

832
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,690
you've got leverage over me,

833
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,460
go ahead and tell Ding Zhiyuan.

834
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,170
You're not afraid?

835
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,940
Let's see who he believes,

836
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,690
me or you.

837
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,660
♫If I close both eyes tonight♫

838
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,540
♫Back to that wishing summer night♫

839
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,300
♫Wind brushes your shaking frame♫

840
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,100
♫That world feels close just the same♫

841
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,500
♫If I dare to face the dawn♫

842
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,220
♫Do you know this face you'd drawn♫

843
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:31,020
♫Gray spirals looped in endless chase♫

844
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,820
♫Tracing tears not words they trace♫

845
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,580
♫How many times must this repeat♫

846
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,100
♫Sighs pull my gaze to retreat♫

847
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,940
♫Sleepless nights, risks untold♫

848
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:50,740
♫None of it for my own soul♫

849
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,180
♫Winds blew, rains poured♫

850
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,060
♫Umbrellas broke, we soared♫

851
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,140
♫Sky fell, ground shook♫

852
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,660
♫Through dusk till dawn I stood♫

853
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,620
♫Cars passed, dreams drowned♫

854
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:05,020
♫Every stop's chain unbound♫

855
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,060
♫Moon watched, stars blazed♫

856
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,940
♫Lamps died, connections phased♫

857
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,060
♫Held hands, laughed then cried♫

858
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,340
♫Hearts froze, parts died inside♫

859
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,980
♫Tried hard, spoke true♫

860
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,980
♫Now I'm someone I never knew♫

861
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,980
♫Love came, hate stayed♫

862
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,500
♫I arrived, you frayed♫

863
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,860
♫Voice cracked, tears burned♫

864
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,860
♫Life lost, lessons earned♫

865
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,460
♫Grew up, let go♫

866
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,460
♫Why cling to old sorrow♫

867
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:44,820
♫How many loops replay♫

868
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,500
♫Sighs steal my gaze away♫

869
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,020
♫Lost nights, bold bets♫

870
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,660
♫Nothing for my regrets♫

871
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,060
♫Winds raged, storms crashed♫

872
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,740
♫Dawns broke, I held fast♫

873
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,860
♫Cars fled, dreams fled♫

874
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:11,340
♫Every route left dead♫

875
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,860
♫Love left, hate stayed♫

876
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,740
♫Voice gone, tears paid♫

877
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,380
♫Grew strong, moved on♫

878
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,380
♫Why dwell when it's gone♫
