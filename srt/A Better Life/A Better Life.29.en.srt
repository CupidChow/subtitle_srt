Episode 29

41
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,200
Leaving us hanging here now

42
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,200
isn't a good sign.

43
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,840
Let me give her a call.

44
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,230
Ms. Yan, thank you for today.

45
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,040
Don't mention it.

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,120
We'll leave the rest to you.

47
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,510
TSI?

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,790
Someone from your company

49
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,710
already contacted us.

50
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,000
I know.

51
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,510
That's my company's

52
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,350
newly promoted Director Xue.

53
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,630
Very young and full of drive.

54
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,960
It's just that...

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,120
It's alright.

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,240
If there's anything,

57
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,190
you can tell me.

58
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,280
Mr. Li is about to entrust
such a large sum.

59
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,000
The most important thing is reliability.

60
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,840
I think

61
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,080
this can prove

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,190
I can do better

63
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,310
than him.

64
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,240
[Chen Xiaotian's after party]

65
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,870
Ms. Yan.

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
Please tell Mr. Li.

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,430
The resources I can secure for him
within the company

68
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,360
are definitely more than
Director Xue can.

69
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,800
This is Director Tang.

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,590
Mr. Li, nice to meet you.

71
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,560
Hello, welcome.

72
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,680
Hello, I've heard so much about you.

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,360
These two are my top business experts.

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,000
Hello.

75
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,630
Nice to meet you.

76
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,280
Hello.

77
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,000
Pleasure.

78
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,310
Then let's keep in touch.

79
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:08,750
Okay.

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,840
Take care.

81
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,470
Thank .

82
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,190
Goodbye.

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,310
Goodbye.

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,960
Goodbye.

85
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,080
Ms. Yan, we had an appointment at 2 pm.

86
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,080
I just talked to your colleague.

87
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,590
As for the specifics,

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,080
your company can discuss internally.

89
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,520
My colleague there doesn't

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,120
handle family office business.

91
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:28,910
Is that so?

92
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,120
But

93
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,630
your colleague brought over
several project managers,

94
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,750
and Mr. Li is very satisfied.

95
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,190
Ms. Yan.

96
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,590
Anyway,

97
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,400
here are the concert tickets for you.

98
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,960
Center of the inner section

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,910
with excellent views.

100
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,120
Thank you both for your trouble.

101
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,630
Your colleagues gave us an invitation

102
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,240
for the concert's after party.

103
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,710
We can chat and take photos
with celebrities up close.

104
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,240
With that invitation,

105
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,120
attending the concert

106
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,560
becomes secondary.

107
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,000
Ms. Yan.

108
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,630
Why didn't I think one step ahead?

109
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,830
Are you okay?

110
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm fine.

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
You can head back first.

112
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,390
I need to go to the office.

113
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:38,870
Okay.

114
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,830
Hello, Director Xue.

115
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:46,920
Hello, Director Xue.

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,510
Hello, Director Xue.

117
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,950
Hello, Director Xue.

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,830
You came to me just for this matter?

119
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,240
Within the same company,

120
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,750
two directors are
competing for one client.

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,000
What kind of

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,680
impression would that
leave on the client?

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,190
So what do you want me to do?

124
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,630
I hope you

125
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,560
could possibly mediate.

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,750
Let Tang Ling withdraw

127
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,040
from the competition?

128
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,680
Yes.

129
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,390
Guess what?

130
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,830
It was me who asked Tang Ling

131
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,360
to compete.

132
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,830
Why?

133
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,720
Xue Xiaozhou.

134
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
Do you think you're still in school,

135
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,070
where classmates fight

136
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,920
or something, and

137
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,430
you go complain to the teacher?

138
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,120
In the workplace,

139
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,920
whoever secures the client

140
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
is the winner.

141
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,950
It's that simple.

142
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,360
Isn't there an order to everything?

143
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,000
You introduced Li Fendou
to me first, right?

144
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,040
Wrong.

145
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,430
No such thing as first come,
first served.

146
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,310
Being first doesn't guarantee
securing the client.

147
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,750
Whoever ultimately lands the client,

148
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,800
wins.

149
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,510
That's our fundamental goal.

150
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,680
I'm confident
I can secure Li Fendou's deal.

151
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,040
Confidence is an expectation,

152
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,070
not an established fact.

153
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,360
I

154
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,190
must ensure our company wins decisively.

155
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,120
If you think I'm wrong,

156
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,600
then you

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,750
go win the client back.

158
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,830
Deliver results.

159
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,120
Turn confidence into reality.

160
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,560
When you have a say,

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,070
you can set new rules.

162
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,190
I exceptionally
promoted you to director

163
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,190
and even tolerated

164
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,430
you hiring Hu Manli
with a tainted background.

165
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,950
This isn't fair to Ling either,

166
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,430
right?

167
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,560
But she didn't come complaining to me.

168
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,360
She's competing with you on merit.

169
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
That's the attitude I want.

170
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,800
You should be the same.

171
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Why are you still standing here?

172
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,000
Your time is running out.

173
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,720
If you and Hu Manli
fail to deliver this time,

174
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,720
once her probation ends,

175
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,950
you'll have to leave with her.

176
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,950
TSI doesn't carry dead weight.

177
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,000
Good, I understand.

178
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,510
Daer.

179
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,630
Eat. Put the phone away.

180
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,190
I am eating.

181
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,190
Excuse me.

182
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,360
What's wrong?

183
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,830
Mr. Qiu, here's the thing.

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,560
This suit of Professor Ding's,

185
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,070
I accidentally washed and shrunk it.

186
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,830
Suits shouldn't be machine washed.

187
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
You shouldn't have made

188
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,750
such a basic mistake.

189
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:06,870
It's not that.

190
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,430
I originally set it aside
to send for dry cleaning.

191
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,720
But someone

192
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,720
put it in the machine wash basket.

193
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,480
I think it was me.

194
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,270
I put it there by mistake.

195
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,720
This isn't her fault.

196
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,310
Forget it then.

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,190
Next time before washing,

198
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,920
you must check carefully, okay?

199
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,160
Okay.

200
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,270
Dad.

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,950
Isn't it the suit Mom gave you

202
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,000
for your 40th birthday?

203
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,600
Let me see.

204
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,440
It really is that one.

205
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,600
I won't

206
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,390
blame you for shrinking the clothes.

207
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,320
But could you help me think of a way

208
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,360
to restore it, please?

209
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,320
Thank you.

210
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay.

211
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,790
Just throw it away.

212
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,510
It's not even good clothes.

213
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,080
Look at it.

214
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't waste effort to restore it.

215
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,390
Isn't worth it.

216
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,200
Am I right, Zhiyuan?

217
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,030
What are you saying?

218
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,870
You heard it was from my mom, and you

219
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,600
want to throw it away.

220
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,630
You're deliberate.

221
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,080
Daer.

222
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,120
Daer, it's not like that.

223
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,030
It's ruined by the wash.

224
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,270
It's beyond repair.

225
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,080
If you don't want it,

226
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,200
I do.

227
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,790
Daer.

228
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,270
Come upstairs.

229
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,630
Scold me here if you want.

230
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,870
You upset my mom.

231
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,120
I won't let it drop.

232
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,670
Go upstairs.

233
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,120
Come with me.

234
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,960
Ms. Qiu.

235
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,510
I'm sorry.

236
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,120
You silly boy.

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
You did the right thing.

238
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,030
I did the right thing?

239
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,840
Why didn't you speak up for me?

240
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,270
You know what Ms. Qiu is

241
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,150
going through now.

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,030
She's not that young anymore,

243
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,790
and she's carrying my baby.

244
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,150
If I had defended you just now,
she would

245
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,480
definitely be upset.

246
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,440
If she gets angry,

247
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,550
it could affect the baby.

248
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,840
What if something happens?

249
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,550
I know you're a kind-hearted child.

250
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,670
You surely don't want such a thing
to happen, right?

251
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,440
What does that child have to do with me?

252
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,000
I couldn't care less.

253
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,360
Then doesn't that child
have something to do with me?

254
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,150
After all, I'm your father.

255
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,440
Look, I'm

256
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,030
stuck in a very awkward position.

257
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,030
Shouldn't you try to
understand me a little too?

258
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,030
Dad.

259
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,910
I really don't understand.

260
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,550
Qiu Lisu clearly ruined
your relationship with Mom.

261
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,440
Why does she keep targeting Mom?

262
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,840
Mom hasn't done

263
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,790
anything to her.

264
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Between people,

265
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,320
there are many things

266
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,720
that are inexplicable
and hard to define.

267
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,000
First of all,

268
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,150
humans are complex creatures.

269
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,000
Why am I not that complicated?

270
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,870
I can't take it anymore.

271
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,080
I just want to go back to my mom.

272
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,240
This is the adult world you've

273
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,670
never understood.

274
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,550
Sometimes,

275
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,200
for the people you care about,

276
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,150
you have to learn to endure.

277
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,440
I, your father,

278
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,720
just realized this truth a bit too late.

279
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,750
Health and marriage funds.

280
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,390
When the new member
reaches entrepreneurial age

281
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,150
and meets the entrepreneurial conditions,

282
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,510
the family fund will then pay them

283
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,000
a substantial startup fund.

284
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:26,960
Dingding.

285
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,080
Hey mom.

286
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,910
You look exhausted.

287
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,200
No, I'm fine.

288
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,790
Liar.

289
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,360
Your dark circles are showing.

290
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,000
Really?

291
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,790
I'm okay.

292
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,600
Where are you?

293
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,750
Feeling stuffy inside.

294
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,790
Came out for a walk.

295
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,750
Did you need something?

296
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,600
Not really.

297
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,670
I'm just

298
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,750
checking if you had dinner.

299
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,240
Dinner this early?

300
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,750
It's not early.

301
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,030
It's already past eight.

302
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,080
Mom, what's going on?

303
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,390
Is the new job that busy?

304
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,200
I ate late at noon.

305
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,360
Not hungry now.

306
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,630
But you,

307
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,790
shouldn't you be doing homework now?

308
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,440
Why are you using your phone?

309
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm not.

310
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,600
I'm just concerned about you.

311
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,630
I see.

312
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,840
Then I'll go eat.

313
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,200
You go do your homework.

314
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,360
Let's talk later, okay?

315
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,360
Wait.

316
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,200
Don't hang up.

317
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,360
Keep me company for a while.

318
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,030
What's wrong?

319
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,200
Dingding.

320
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,240
It's nothing.

321
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,670
Do you have something to tell me?

322
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,120
Miss me?

323
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,630
Be honest with me.

324
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,240
Did something upset you at Dad's place?

325
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,360
No.

326
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Mom misses you too.

327
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,270
I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

328
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,120
Okay?

329
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,510
We haven't seen each other for so long.

330
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,080
I'll call your dad later.

331
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
It's not my dad.

332
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,630
It's Chen Xiaojun.

333
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,270
What about Chen Xiaojun?

334
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,240
Did he bother you again?

335
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,790
Today in class he gave me the finger.

336
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,270
I got mad and called him trash.

337
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,000
But the teacher only heard me.

338
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,440
You know how he is.

339
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,000
He's such a teacher's pet.

340
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,000
He insisted he never made that gesture.

341
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,790
But the teacher only heard me cursing.

342
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,510
So I got scolded.

343
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,320
I was just scared

344
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,790
the teacher would tell you.

345
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,120
No.

346
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,630
The teacher didn't complain to me.

347
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,270
Don't worry.

348
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,790
Even if the teacher contacts me,

349
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,720
I got your back.

350
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,440
Mom.

351
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,510
You're so good to me.

352
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,630
Silly.

353
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,480
I'm your mother.

354
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,390
Who else would I be good to?

355
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,200
Listen.

356
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,030
Don't dwell on such small things.

357
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,670
There's trash everywhere.

358
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,910
When you grow up,

359
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,270
you'll encounter even worse trash.

360
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,000
You know what?

361
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,630
You need to start learning to
adapt from now on.

362
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,840
Make your heart stronger.

363
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,080
Mom,

364
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,790
I'll be fine.

365
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,510
You need to work hard too.

366
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,910
Okay, this is long enough.

367
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,240
I need to do my homework.

368
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,360
Hanging up.

369
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,750
Do you homework.

370
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,150
We'll talk again later.

371
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,180
[Li Fengdou's page]

372
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,940
[Notice: Tang Ling's new post]

373
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,600
You're back.

374
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,630
Did you get the mass email?

375
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,440
Li Qingqing also assigned Tang Ling
to handle family office business.

376
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,840
Li Qingqing is really pragmatic.

377
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,550
Whoever's capable gets support.

378
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,790
Now the pressure's on you.

379
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,480
Have you figured out how to respond?

380
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,510
Cheer up.

381
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,400
I've found a breakthrough.

382
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,400
Ding Zhiyuan and Li Fendou
have some connection.

383
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,510
Didn't expect that, did you?

384
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,240
I knew Li Fendou's name
sounded familiar.

385
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,070
I remember now.

386
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,160
Zhong Ning mentioned it to me before.

387
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,310
Ding Zhiyuan wrote the preface
for this tycoon's autobiography.

388
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,200
You want Ding Zhiyuan
to contact Li Fendou?

389
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,790
No.

390
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,310
Why?

391
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,200
Because he's

392
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Qiu Lisu's husband.

393
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,960
Thinking about that relationship,

394
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,640
I just can't

395
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,920
have any connection with this person.

396
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,640
What's wrong with you?

397
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,160
I've moved on, why can't you?

398
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,160
Fine, we won't use that connection.

399
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,510
I ordered takeout.

400
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,830
Hello, your delivery.

401
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,350
Thank you.

402
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,920
Come on, let's eat.

403
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,310
Director Xue.

404
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,000
What method do you plan to use
to win over Li Fendou?

405
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,550
Hu Manli.

406
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,200
This time,

407
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,030
I want to try using my own method.

408
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,640
Tell me about it.

409
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,750
I haven't figured it out yet.

410
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,310
But I think

411
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,440
I can come up with something.

412
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,030
Say, if I lose this time,

413
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,550
would you look down on me?

414
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,750
Do you remember what I said to you?

415
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,160
Which part?

416
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,510
You said when you first started
selling insurance,

417
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,440
after running around all day,

418
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,310
you were tired, hungry and cold,

419
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,070
and didn't have any money on you.

420
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,790
you could only sit by the roadside
and order some wontons.

421
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,110
You ate them on the dusty road.

422
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,310
After filling your stomach,

423
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,270
you felt unwilling to give up

424
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,550
and thought,

425
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,960
why can others succeed,

426
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,550
while I, Hu Manli, can't?

427
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,680
Is that the part?

428
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:52,790
Wrong.

429
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,110
I said

430
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,000
I saw in you

431
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,030
the potential

432
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,750
to become
an outstanding insurance agent.

433
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,790
That was you lying to me.

434
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,400
So I want to tell you again.

435
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,200
Really.

436
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,920
You are an outstanding

437
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,240
insurance professional.

438
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
I'm not lying to you now.

439
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,160
You can do it.

440
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,590
Really.

441
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,920
Use your own way

442
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,480
to defeat Tang Ling,

443
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,310
defeat me.

444
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,240
You're going to the office? So early?

445
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:45,750
There's a

446
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,720
training session.

447
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,000
How come I didn't know?

448
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,920
What training?

449
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,680
You... you didn't know?

450
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,270
Ms. Li notified us last minute.

451
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,310
So it's okay if I don't go, right?

452
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,270
I want to go see my dad today.

453
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,590
It's fine, I'll get you time off.

454
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,270
Then...then I'll go first.

455
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:05,920
Okay.

456
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,400
Say...say hello to Mr. Hu.

457
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,350
Thank you.

458
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:08,900
Hm.

[Li Fendou's autobiography]

460
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,980
[Purchase page]

461
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,640
Mr. Gu.

462
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,310
You're here too.

463
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,200
What brings you here?

464
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,550
I'm meeting friends to play ball.

465
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,270
They're not here yet.

466
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,830
What a coincidence!

467
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,440
Yes.

468
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,160
Yes.

469
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,510
How about

470
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,640
I play you for a few more rounds?

471
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,920
You just can't get enough of winning.

472
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,160
Don't say it like that.

473
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,750
Sure, let's play together.

474
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,270
Okay.

475
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,640
My pleasure.

476
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,720
Here, have some water, Mr. Gu.

477
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,270
Okay, thank you.

478
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,590
I just heard from your assistant.

479
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,830
You've been coming to
play daily recently.

480
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,200
When skills fall short,
one must practice diligently.

481
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,310
You're being too modest.

482
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,790
How about this?

483
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,590
If you

484
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,960
don't mind,

485
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,960
I'll come be your
practice partner every day.

486
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
Really?

487
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,790
Yes,really.

488
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,680
Won't a practice partner be expensive?

489
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,400
I'll try not to charge you.

490
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,720
Then I'll come same time tomorrow.

491
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,310
Sure.

492
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay, tomorrow.

493
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,590
Let's have some water first.

494
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,550
Then play one more round.

495
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,000
Okay.

496
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,070
About that company you mentioned before,

497
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
do you have a proposal yet?

498
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,510
I was just about to report to you.

499
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,480
Director Tang
provided several proposals.

500
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,680
They recommend letting professional managers
take over the company.

501
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,750
In that case,

502
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,440
Keke can also regularly receive that

503
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,350
trust fund dividend.

504
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,880
They say many old-money families abroad

505
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,750
operate this way.

506
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,480
But we're Chinese.

507
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,720
Can we be like them?

508
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,070
When foreign kids turn eighteen,

509
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,510
they're kicked out of the house.

510
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,960
That kind of heartless attitude,

511
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,400
should we learn from them?

512
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,350
Keke's place

513
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,200
is about to open?

514
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,240
It's open.

515
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,000
Let's go take a look.

516
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:54,790
Okay.

517
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,110
Then I'll give her a call.

518
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,000
No need.

519
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,880
Mr. Wang, we're going to Keke's shop.

520
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,440
Got it.

521
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:14,720
Mr. Li,

522
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,400
it's right across.

523
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,240
Watch your step.

524
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,880
It's over here.

525
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,400
Here.

526
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,310
Be careful.

527
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,310
This is the floor.

528
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,070
Slow down.

529
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,750
What kind of mess is all this?

530
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,830
Door's unlocked, come in.

531
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,030
Browse freely.

532
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,960
Finally opens a shop,
and you choose the second floor.

533
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,310
The stairs are practically collapsing.

534
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,400
Who'd come up here to shop?

535
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,590
What brings you here?

536
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,350
Can't I visit my daughter's shop?

537
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,030
Look.

538
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,310
Look all you want.

539
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
But in my place,

540
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,270
if you look, you buy.

541
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,960
Is this a scam shop?

542
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,880
I have to buy if I look?

543
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,200
Then call the police.

544
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,000
Yan.

545
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,700
Hm?

546
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,030
Pick whatever you like, it's on me.

547
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,000
Me?

548
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,400
Anything.

549
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:57,960
This one.

550
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,160
How much is it?

551
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,480
Twenty thousand.

552
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,160
What thing costs twenty grand?

553
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,350
Made by your daughter's own hands.

554
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,550
The only one in the world.

555
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,680
One-of-a-kind piece.

556
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,750
Not worth it?

557
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,640
Just trying to fleece customers, huh?

558
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:25,920
Understood.

559
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Don't be too ruthless now.

560
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm not ruthless.

561
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Just need twenty grand
for now.

562
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,350
What do you mean
"just need twenty grand for now"?

563
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,790
Why do you need money this time?

564
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,960
Take a look.

565
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,750
Tell me what's missing in this room.

566
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,030
Common sense.

567
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,480
We're definitely not short on that,

568
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,720
Dad,

569
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
we still need an AC unit.

570
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,110
Sponsor me, won't you?

571
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,110
No wonder it's so hot.

572
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,160
Ran out of money during renovations.

573
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,160
Couldn't install the AC.

574
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,200
Counting on you.

575
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,070
Now you know
money doesn't grow on trees.

576
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,550
Weren't you a shop assistant for years?

577
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,200
How come you didn't
save enough for an AC?

578
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,750
Will you give it or not?

579
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,750
Just say the word.

580
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,200
No pressure if you don't.

581
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,200
I'll just tough it out.

582
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,350
Might get heatstroke someday

583
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,550
or suffer heat exhaustion.

584
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,110
You can collect my body at the hospital.

585
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,480
Bah!

586
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,110
Touch wood! Now!

587
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,240
So you've decided to sponsor me, eh?

588
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,000
Thanks, Dad.

589
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,000
Here.

590
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,070
Twenty grand, right?

591
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,440
I can transfer the money

592
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,830
one condition.

593
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:52,790
Go home?

594
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,790
Take over the business?

595
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:56,680
Deal.

596
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,270
Really?

597
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:11,160
Ten, hundred, thousand...

598
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,400
Thirty grand.

599
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,440
Now we're talking.

600
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,350
Thanks, Dad.

601
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,350
I'll take the money.

602
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,400
About taking over,

603
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,920
maybe next lifetime.

604
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,070
What did you say?

605
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,310
I said you'd be better off

606
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,110
while you're still spry.

607
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,510
Find yourself a new wife

608
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,510
and have another kid or two.

609
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,440
Then you'd have your heir.

610
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,270
You little brat!

611
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,270
Mr. Li, don't!

612
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:36,680

613
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,480
Mr. Li.

614
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,270
Mr. Li.

615
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,440
Slow down.

616
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,200
She's broke
but still play the tough girl.

617
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,240
Let me tell you.

618
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
When she asks you for money,

619
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,310
don't give her a dime!

620
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,550
Okay, understood.

621
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,030
Wait, no.

622
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,830
Last time you bought her
concert tickets.

623
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,550
That was under your orders last time.

624
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,200
Wait.

625
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,510
If I order it, you just follow through?

626
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,070
As her father, I can spoil her.

627
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,200
Can't you discipline her?

628
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,070
Okay, understood.

629
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,000
Let me tell you.

630
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,440
This time, I'm serious.

631
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,720
I can't control her anymore.

632
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,200
That Tang something running the trust,

633
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,750
if she's no good, replace her.

634
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,680
Mr. Li.

635
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,790
We've already changed several rounds.

636
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,830
None have satisfied you.

637
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,310
That just proves they're incompetent.

638
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,680
Their fees are high too.

639
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,750
And they never get to the point.

640
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,590
How about this?

641
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,310
You tell them your requirements,

642
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,400
so they can execute properly.

643
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,000
If I tell them my requirements,

644
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,350
they'll tell Keke,

645
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,110
and she would explode.

646
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,030
Keke will find out sooner or later.

647
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,680
So you see.

648
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,590
I need to find competent people.

649
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:05,750
Right?

650
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,550
This requires proper methods.

661
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,000
Your little shop is really nice.

662
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,480
Quick, come take a look.

663
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,480
This is really interesting.

664
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,360
If you hadn't contacted me yesterday,

665
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,590
I was about to message you.

666
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
My little shop was just renovated
last month.

667
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,070
Now it's mostly put together.

668
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,150
Officially open for business.

669
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,400
Look here.

670
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,320
These earrings, bracelets, necklaces

671
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,510
are all made by myself.

672
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,360
Pretty, right?

673
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,320
Very pretty.

674
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,320
These toys

675
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,070
Aren't these all things
we played with as kids?

676
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,190
I had this little train
when I was a child.

677
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,510
Nostalgic, huh?

678
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,590
Let me tell you.

679
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,630
All these

680
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,480
are vintage items
I collected one by one.

681
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,960
There are so many varieties nowadays.

682
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,360
Look at these old things.

683
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,710
We used to throw them away
as trash when moving.

684
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,000
Now they can actually be sold for money.

685
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,110
How much is this?

686
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,550
Two hundred eighty?

687
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,480
That expensive? Does anyone buy it?

688
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,710
They're not buying toys.

689
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,760
They're buying nostalgia.

690
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,880
I just feel sorry for you.

691
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,880
I remember you graduated
from some American university?

693
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,960
Right.

694
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,480
You, a returnee from overseas,

695
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,630
originally worked in sales.

696
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,360
I thought you were
a corporate management trainee,

697
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,280
the kind destined for management.

698
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,190
Now you're running this little shop.

699
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,440
Does it make money?

700
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,960
Does your family agree?

You had a fight with your dad?

706
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
I don't even want to talk about him.

707
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,280
Anybody here?

708
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,000
Anybody here?

709
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,400
Who are you?

710
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,360
You installed this door?

711
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,190
What about it?

712
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,280
You know I rented this attic, right?

713
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,280
I've seen the tenant and landlord
of that attic room.

714
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,230
It's not you.

715
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,800
You're the sub-landlord?

716
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,670
Let me tell you.

717
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
When you rented this place,

718
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,070
did you check the floor plan?

719
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,760
My attic on the
second-and-a-half floor shares

720
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,360
a bathroom with your third floor.

721
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,230
Now your renovation enclosed them all.

722
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,030
You're monopolizing the public bathroom.

723
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,000
I can report to property management
to forcibly demolish yours!

724
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,280
Let's discuss this properly.

725
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,230
Don't shout. Your veins might burst.

726
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,760
Yuki.

727
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,670
About old downtown houses,

728
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,360
many share kitchens and bathrooms
between households.

729
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,510
I suspect you were tricked by the agent.

730
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,400
What should I do then?

731
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,480
Well this matter...

732
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,320
Clearly we didn't
consider everything, right?

733
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,230
But forcing demolition now

734
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,070
won't benefit you either.

735
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,320
How about this?

736
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
We'll pay extra rent monthly

737
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,960
for this bathroom.

738
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,190
Consider it separately rented, okay?

739
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,000
You're being reasonable,

740
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,880
so I'll make a token gesture.

741
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,030
Five hundred monthly.

742
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,550
Okay, no problem.

743
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,440
I'll transfer it now.

744
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,320
Wait.

745
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,960
This... this matter

746
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,880
isn't mine alone to decide, right?

747
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,000
I need to consult other tenants

748
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,710
and the main landlord.

749
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,590
I'll contact you later?

750
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,710
I'm off.

751
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,190
Yuki.

752
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,070
You shouldn't have agreed so quickly.

753
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,280
He was just testing you.

754
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,510
You agreed so quickly.

755
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,110
He must think he asked for too little.

756
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,710
How much could he possibly want
for just one bathroom?

757
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
From my experience,

758
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,030
he'll definitely come back to raise the price.

759
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,340
What?

760
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,780
[I found a connection to Li Fendou]

761
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,710
Hu Manli.

762
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,030
This time,

763
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,320
I want to try it my way.

764
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,480
I need to prove myself.

765
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,150
Only then can I rightfully be your boss.

766
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,070
Practicing already?

767
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,360
Mr. Gu.

768
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,320
Xiaozhou.

769
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,280
You've been practicing with me
every day these days.

770
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,550
You've worked hard.

771
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,670
Not hard at all.

772
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,110
I'm just getting free exercise anyway.

773
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,360
Come on, I'm not stupid.

774
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,230
Speak up.

775
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,440
What do you need from me?

776
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,630
You saw right through me after all.

777
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,320
Actually, there is something
I'd like to ask for your help with.

778
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,880
I hope you could put in a word for me

779
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:37,960
with Mr. Li Fendou.

780
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,960
Regarding their family trust matter?

781
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,320
Yes.

782
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,320
That won't do.

783
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,670
This is a major family matter for them.

784
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,000
I don't have that much influence.

785
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,960
Mr. Gu, it's not like that.

786
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,960
I'm not asking you to
interfere with Mr. Li's decision.

787
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,280
I just want him to give me a chance

788
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,000
to meet and talk in person.

789
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,030
Even if it doesn't work out,

790
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
a least I can give up without regrets.

791
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,070
Don't you agree?

792
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,880
A meeting isn't difficult to arrange.

793
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,480
But first we need to
finish today's game.

794
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,840
Let's see if you can
actually beat me first.

795
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,670
So should I win or lose this?

796
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,550
What do you think?

797
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,150
Alright.

798
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,000
Serve.

799
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,150
Hello.

800
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,760
My surname is Hu.

801
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,550
I have an appointment with
Mr. Li at 1 pm.

802
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,920
Okay, please wait a moment.

803
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,550
Sorry about that.

804
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,360
Mr. Li doesn't have

805
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,510
any appointment scheduled with
a Ms. Hu at 1 pm today.

806
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,230
Really?

807
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,510
Hold on a second.

808
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,840
You said you had
an appointment with Mr. Li at 1 pm?

809
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,780
Huh?

810
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:05,670
You remembered wrong?

811
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,100
Gosh.

812
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,920
Sorry, I got the time wrong.

813
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,190
Look, I'm already here.

814
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,190
Is there any chance I could just
go in and say hello to Mr. Li?

815
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,880
It won't take long.

816
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,230
I'm sorry, ma'am.

817
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,590
Mr. Li's schedule this afternoon

818
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,510
is completely full.

819
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,150
He's going to the Housing and
Urban-Rural Development Committee.

820
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,440
Thank you.

821
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,000
You're welcome.

822
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:16,880
Great shot, Mr. Gu.

823
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,630
You've improved.

824
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,480
I admit defeat.

825
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,440
Have some water.

826
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:25,840
That's enough.

827
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,150
You can go.

828
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,880
I won't help you contact Mr. Li anymore.

829
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,550
No, wh-what do you mean?

830
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,760
Because you threw the game, right?

831
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,440
I didn't.

832
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,880
It's too obvious.

833
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,030
Do you know this is insulting?

834
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:41,710
I...

835
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,280
No...

836
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,360
Xue Xiaozhou.

837
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,440
I always thought

838
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,440
you were someone I could be frank with.

839
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,400
Didn't expect you to pull this trick too.

840
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,150
Mr. Gu, I...I didn't know.

841
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,630
Just go.

842
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,630
Mr. Gu, please let me explain.

843
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,670
Mr. Gu

844
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,510
Explain what?

845
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,760
I did throw the game on purpose.
