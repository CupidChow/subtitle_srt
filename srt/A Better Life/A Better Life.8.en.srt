Episode 8

41
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,480
Insurance broker.

42
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,710
Alright, I'll contact you later.

43
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,870
Actually, that works too.

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,350
He's also related to Ms. Qiu.

45
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,640
See that person over there?

46
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,840
He's Qiu Lisu's relative.

47
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,680
He's Mrs.,

48
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,350
I mean, Ms. Qiu's relative?

49
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,200
Well...

50
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,200
How...how is he with you?

51
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,560
That's not important.

52
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,350
In a while,

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,560
take him upstairs.

54
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,200
Introduce him to Wei Yuanxiang.

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,470
You know Mr. Wei, right?

56
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,190
Tell Mr. Wei.

57
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,630
He's Qiu Lisu's relative.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,430
He's Ms. Qiu's relative.

59
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,840
So, you mean...

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,750
I should take Ms. Qiu's relative along

61
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,190
to help you get business?

62
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:23,750
Clever girl.

63
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,430
Much obliged.

64
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,960
Ms. Qiu's relative?

65
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,680
Yes.

66
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:33,800
Excuse me.

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,560
She must be mistaken.

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:36,960
Xiaozhou?

69
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,520
Xiaozhou.

70
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,240
What brings you here?

71
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,560
Are you here for me?

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,080
Ms. Qiu,

73
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,630
this is?

74
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,190
A junior member of my family.

75
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,750
I have nothing to do with her.

76
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,190
Mr. Wei,

77
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,590
when did you arrive?

78
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,590
How come I didn't see you?

79
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,960
- Ran into two classmates - Let's drink.

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,030
- Just chatting. - Cheers!

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,630
Thanks! Thanks for coming!

82
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,820
Hey!

83
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
Hello, Mrs. Ding.

84
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,840
That,

85
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,190
that relative,

86
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,240
he just left.

87
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,470
I don't know.

88
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,470
I just feel he and Mr. Qiu seem

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,870
a bit weird.

90
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,150
Okay.

91
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,280
Got it.

92
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,710
Wang Xue,

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,000
let me buy you coffee some day.

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,630
You don't have to, Mrs. Ding.

95
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,030
Alright, goodbye.

96
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,430
Xue Xiaozhou.

97
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,630
Do you know how big a deal you've lost?

98
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,400
I've delivered the meal
right to your lips.

99
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,680
All you need to do is open your mouth.

100
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,800
Say a few words, and you close the deal.

101
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,520
How could you mess this up?

102
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,630
If it weren't for...

103
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,080
I've told you ten thousand times.

104
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,190
That woman and I

105
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,560
aren't in the relationship you think.

106
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,710
Using her for clients disgusts me.

107
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,710
I know that woman

108
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,310
broke your heart, and you hate her,

109
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,710
but think it this way.

110
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,680
She used you.

111
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,630
You could use her too.

112
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,310
Hu Manli, I'll say this one last time.

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,920
I have no ties with that woman!

114
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,600
Stop yelling.

115
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,000
I've seen
plenty relationships like this.

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,920
I can tell exactly what you are.

117
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,720
She ruined my parents' marriage.

118
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,560
Satisfied?

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,190
Your parents' marriage?

120
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,680
What do you mean?

121
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,600
What do you mean?

122
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
I don't understand.

123
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,870
Thirteen years ago,

124
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,600
she used my mom to get close to my dad,

125
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
tricked my father away,

126
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,040
and made him leave my mom.

127
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,160
That's why I hate her.

128
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,600
Get it now?

129
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,240
Yuki told me

130
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,160
she's buried two husbands.

131
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,870
One was your father?

132
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,830
Your father's dead?

133
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,160
Yeah, in a car accident three years ago.

134
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,270
I'm sorry.

135
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,950
So all your family assets

136
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,680
were swindled by that woman?

137
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,720
Wait. Why is that the

138
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,360
only thing you care about?

139
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,240
I just think it's unfair for you!

140
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,070
After all,

141
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,120
you're your father's son.

142
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,870
He should've left you something.

143
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,190
None of that matters now!

144
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,360
We absolutely cannot get involved

145
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,480
with Qiu Lisu in any way.

146
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,430
Absolutely not.

147
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,480
Find a new client.

148
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,390
A new client? I...

149
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,950
Hey!

150
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,360
You think this is like

151
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,070
shopping at a supermarket?

152
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,270
Clients lined up for you to pick?

153
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,480
This Mr. Wei,

154
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,190
I spent five years educating him,

155
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,430
just to slightly change

156
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,390
his prejudice against insurance.

157
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,600
Now you're throwing it away

158
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,270
just to prove a point?

159
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,870
Hu Manli, if he's your only

160
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,160
potential big client,

161
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,800
then let's just give up.

162
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,240
Young man,

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,480
don't be short-sighted.

164
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,870
Insurance is about long-term thinking.

165
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Is he the only one or not?

166
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,720
Of course there are others.

167
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,270
Let me check when I get back.

168
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,020
Hey!

169
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,000
Sun Jie, you're back.

170
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,240
Hello, Ms. Wang.

171
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,390
Come here.

172
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,070
You're here to see your mom?

173
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,800
Yes

174
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,680
Did you know?

175
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,390
Your mom's got something going on.

176
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,160
What do you mean?

177
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,680
Gosh. There's this man

178
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,430
younger than your mom.

179
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,600
He's visiting her all the time.

180
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,360
Your dad

181
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,630
just passed two months ago.

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
Your mom already has new prospects.

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,920
Older woman, younger man.

184
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,430
Twilight romance.

185
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,040
OMG.

186
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,390
Your mom's so trendy!

187
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,040
Ms. Wang, it's not like that.

188
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,870
He's my mom's
old neighbor from the alley..

189
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,360
An old neighbor?

190
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,120
Yes.

191
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,620
I see.

192
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,560
Our former alley neighbors

193
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,510
have always been close.

194
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,070
Oh!

195
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,160
It's not what you think.

196
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,120
My apologies then.

197
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,270
Forget I mentioned it.

198
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,720
Don't let me keep you.

199
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,160
Sure. Back to my exercise.

200
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:02,800
Mom.

201
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,270
What were you just saying?

202
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,120
You're going traveling?

203
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,390
To Europe?

204
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,600
Yes.

205
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,070
That's too far.

206
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,070
How about this instead?

207
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,680
Wait till my daughter's summer break.

208
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,600
I'll drive.

209
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,120
Take you all out on a road trip

210
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,000
around Jiangsu and Zhejiang, okay?

211
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,190
No need.

212
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,310
Don't let me keep you.

213
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,270
Mom.

214
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,510
Look, you're just an old lady.

215
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,360
Right?

216
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,200
You don't speak English.

217
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,750
You've never been abroad

218
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,320
and won't join a tour group.

219
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,510
I can't rest easy
with you traveling alone.

220
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,910
Who says I'm going alone?

221
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,080
Wow.

222
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,510
You found a travel buddy?

223
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,030
Who is it?

224
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,320
Male or female?

225
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,120
Male.

226
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,240
Male?

227
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,550
Is that not okay?

228
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,720
Who is it? Do I know him?

229
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,840
You do know him.

230
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:03,910
Dong,

231
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,840
our old neighbor from before.

232
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,340
Oh.

233
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,200
Dong? Him.

234
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,630
Now I remember.

235
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,000
He came to Dad's funeral.

236
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,510
Right?

237
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,840
Just him?

238
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,080
What's wrong with that?

239
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,750
Mom.

240
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,670
If I remember correctly,

241
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,440
Dong is 20 years younger than you,
right?

242
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,440
Is it appropriate to travel with him?

243
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,150
Why is it inappropriate?

244
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,390
I think it's fine.

245
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,720
Mom.

246
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,080
Be honest with me.

247
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,390
Do you have other intentions?

248
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
Since when do you care about me?

249
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,390
If you put it that way,

250
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,480
this conversation is pointless

251
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,000
Mom.

252
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,630
Dad just passed away.

253
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,270
Right?

254
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,960
Even if you want to find someone,

255
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,150
isn't this too soon?

256
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,440
I know what I'm doing.

257
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,870
Mom, I'm not criticizing you.

258
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,750
If you want a companion,

259
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,550
I support you.

260
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,480
I don't object.

261
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,840
But could you

262
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,200
find someone decent?

263
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,870
Not someone like Dong.

264
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,030
What are you doing?

265
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,600
Do you know
what the neighbors are saying?

266
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,320
The gossip is really nasty.

267
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,200
Enough!

268
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,960
Sun Jie.

269
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,870
I asked you to come today

270
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,550
just to tell you this.

271
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,480
From now on, I'll decide my own affairs.

272
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,360
I'm already at this age.

273
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,320
I lived most of my life for you guys.

274
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,720
From now on,

275
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,200
don't any of you try to control me.

276
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,840
Manli.

277
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,120
This time, you must help me.

278
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,670
She won't listen to anything I say now.

279
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,960
What should I do?

280
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm truly at my wit's end.

281
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,360
You're my only hope now.

282
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,120
So, this is why you contacted me before.

283
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:01,960
Mom.

284
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,390
Yes.

285
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,200
Okay, I understand.

286
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,840
Let's meet and talk.

287
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,360
Mom.

288
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:04,870
Goodbye.

289
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,360
Bye.

290
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:06,750
Come here.

291
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,320
Let me take your schoolbag.

292
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,080
Manli.

293
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,440
Yes.

294
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,240
Here.

295
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,510
Let me introduce you two.

296
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,030
Hello.

297
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,440
Hi.

298
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,390
I don't know you two know each other.

299
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,600
This is Chen Zihao's mom, my neighbor.

300
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,480
Zihao's mom?

301
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,000
Hello.

302
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Dingding told me so much about Zihao.

303
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,840
Zihao is so outstanding.

304
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,550
Won awards in programming, right?

305
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,320
Yes.

306
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,080
That's wonderful.

307
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,510
Learn from Zihao.

308
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,720
Heard that?

309
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,320
Your mom said learn from me.

310
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,150
Call me "Master".

311
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,790
Hey!

312
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,030
Hao, don't be rude.

313
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,390
It's fine

314
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,200
Heard that, Hao?

315
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,870
Don't be rude.

316
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,720
Oh right, I remember that tent.

317
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,960
Want to group buy with us?

318
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,870
What tent?

319
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,200
Our class is camping at Sheshan.

320
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:38,870
You forgot?

321
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,120
Oh right!

322
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,960
Let me tell you.

323
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,840
Daer's dad is a professor.

324
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,480
Hey,

325
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,720
he has a show.

326
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
It's called "Philosophers Speak".

327
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,270
Let me tell you.

328
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,910
In this show of his,

329
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,360
when he explains things

330
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
it's so profound yet simple.

331
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,080
It's so fascinating!

332
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,790
Wang Shiyan, my daughter,
has become a fan.

333
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,480
I watch every episode of
"Philosophers Speak"!

334
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,030
I'm so honored to meet you.

335
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,510
You flatter me.

336
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,390
In my firm's annual meeting,

337
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,200
my boss asked me

338
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,600
to find a way

339
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,080
to invite Professor Ding
to record a slogan.

340
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,000
I checked with MCN agencies for quotes.

341
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,480
They said

342
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,440
Professor Ding doesn't take just any job.

343
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,000
Exactly.

344
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,150
But look, now I've met you.

345
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,320
I'm sure we'll work something out.

346
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,390
Okay.

347
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,200
Hey.

348
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,750
Shall we group

349
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,480
buy the tent?

350
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,320
The offer ends tonight.

351
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,720
That's okay. We have one at home.

352
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,240
You do?

353
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,790
Yes, we do.

354
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,510
Alright.

355
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,600
Okay.

356
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,480
Let's grab dinner sometime.

357
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,030
Sure.

358
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,910
Of course.

359
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,630
We're off.

360
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,080
Bye.

361
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,510
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

362
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,000
Goodbye.

363
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,750
Let's go.

364
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,440
Is your bag heavy?

365
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,870
Have much homework today?

366
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,150
Dingding.

367
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,670
What are you doing?

368
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,960
Wash your hands. Let's eat.

369
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm looking for the tent.

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,960
Didn't you say we had one?

371
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:43,910
We do.

372
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,440
Eat your dinner.

373
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,440
Is it big enough

374
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,750
for the three of us?

375
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,480
Your dad's in retreat.

376
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,910
He doesn't have time to go.

377
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,240
Retreat isn't prison.

378
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,000
Taking one day off should be fine.

379
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,440
Is your trip more important
than Dad's work?

380
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,480
I'll go camping with you.

381
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,270
But they require it to be a family trip.

382
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,630
You going alone

383
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,150
makes us seem like a single parent.

384
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,600
If you won't ask, I will.

385
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
What's wrong with
single-parent families?

386
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,960
Can't I provide for you?

387
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,320
Never seen you
this dedicated to studying.

388
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,200
Got it.

389
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,720
I'll go talk to him later.

390
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,000

391
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,480
Are you guys...

392
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,440
Stop talking.

393
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,600
Eat.

394
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,600
Do homework after dinner.

395
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,320
Much homework today?

396
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,080
Not too bad.

397
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,200
Have some fish.

398
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,960

[Reminder: son's camping trip
requires both parents]

400
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:06,790
What's wrong?

401
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,150
Daer's school organized a camping trip.

402
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,510
It was planned before school started.

403
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,480
Said the whole family should go.

404
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,840
Then you should go.

405
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,000
I support you.

406
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,550
I know you don't mind.

407
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,600
But Hu Manli still hasn't told

408
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,000
our son that we've separated.

409
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,150
So you'll keep pretending to be married?

410
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,480
This is ridiculous.

411
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,550
Zhiyuan.

412
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,630
I understand your conflicted feelings.

413
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,120
You don't want to see her.

414
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,630
But...

415
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,910
You care about the child.

416
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,440
However...

417
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,600
Making you keep acting like this,

418
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,630
that's another matter entirely.

419
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,750
You've been separated for some time now.

420
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,150
I know you promised to give her time

421
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,440
to explain to the elders and child.

422
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,480
But she keeps delaying.

423
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,480
And now she's making you

424
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,720
to pretend to be married in public.

425
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,000
What does that tell you?

426
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,270
What does that mean?

427
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,670
It means

428
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,080
she doesn't want the world to know

429
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,440
you've already separated.

430
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,000
After all, it's not good news.

431
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,030
Not just not good news.

432
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,870
For her, it's disastrous.

433
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,510
It's not because of her feelings.

434
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,320
It's her public image.

435
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,270
To succeed in sales,

436
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,000
she must present to the world

437
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,910
an image of perfect family life.

438
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,600
What's more.

439
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,000
You're not just
a university professor now

440
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,080
but a popular knowledge blogger

441
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,000
for high-net-worth individuals.

442
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,670
Your personal brand serves as

443
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,670
the best credibility endorsement for her.

444
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,550
This adds luster

445
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,030
to her carefully crafted image.

446
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,910
Hu Manli knows that

447
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,000
perfectly well.

448
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,960
So you think

449
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,270
she'd be willing to let the public know

450
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,600
that you've already separated?

451
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,120
Now that you mention it,

452
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
everything suddenly makes sense.

453
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,790
Scheming woman.

454
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,790
Still calculating at this point.

455
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,360
How pathetic.

No.

00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,000
Your analysis is correct,

461
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,030
absolutely accurate.

462
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,120
That's how she is.

463
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,550
It seems

464
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,390
those last bits of pity for her

465
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
aren't necessary anymore.

At the beginning,

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,510
all that neighborhood gossip,

470
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,790
I didn't take it seriously.

471
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,270
I thought since my dad just passed away,

472
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,680
and that man
is 20 years younger than Mom,

473
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,880
how could it be possible?

474
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,480
Right?

475
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,240
Exactly.

476
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,680
But later,

477
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,920
the neighbors told me

478
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,480
that man

479
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,750
always had a young woman visiting him

480
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,550
all the time.

481
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,510
Then,

482
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,070

you've been talking for over an hour.

503
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
So what insurance policy
are you inquiring?

504
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,880
Don't rush, I'm getting to it.

505
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,680

my dad was leaving it to my daughter

508
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,750
when he was alive.

509
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,270

510
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,270
It's their lifelong savings.

About how much?

512
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,480
Not that much.

513
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,200
At least a million.

514
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,000
That much?

515
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,580
Yes.

516
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,640
Let me tell you.

517
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,310
This con artist

518
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,160
must be after that money.

519
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,400
I was thinking the exact same!

520
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,830
Who will pay for their trips?

521
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,920
Definitely my mom!

522
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,640
Right! Once they're abroad,

523
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,270
this guy sweet-talks her.

524
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,270
Mom gets confused

525
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,000
and gives him everything.

526
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,960
Listen to me.

527
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,480
Money's one thing.

528
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,960
But she could get hurt.

529
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,420
What?

530
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,510

Sorry about that.

548
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,240
Not the sharpest tool.

Hu Manli, what are you doing?

557
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,550
You said there was a deal.

558
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,640
I heard gossip all morning.

559
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,200
And you call me unreliable?

560
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,880
You almost ruined this deal!

561
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,750
What do you mean?

562
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,920

to buy insurance for grandkids.

567
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,350
Wait, if it's a scam,

568
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,030
she should call the police.

569
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:23,790
Why come to you?

570
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,640
That's called client retention.

571
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,270
Even she can't convince her mom,

572
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,400
but I can.

573
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,920
Young man, study hard, okay?

574
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,240
Your favorite cashmere yarn.

575
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,880
The color's nice, right?

576
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,680
Very nice.

577
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,750
Ms. Zhou, when knitting,

578
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,070
be careful with your neck.

579
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,030
Yes.

580
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,680
You came in time.

581
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,110
Winter's coming soon.

582
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,110
I knitted
another pair of gloves for you.

583
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,880
Really?

584
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,720
Cashmere ones.

585
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,270
Look.

586
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,920
So lovely!

587
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,440
Nice, isn't it?

588
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,270
Let me try them on.

589
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,400
Look.

590
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,310
Fits perfectly!

591
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,510
Wonderful!

592
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,070
I adore them!

593
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,680
Aren't they pretty?

594
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
So pretty.

595
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,400
Pretty?

596
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,350
So warm.

597
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,920
Simply perfect.

598
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,440
Ms. Zhou,

599
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,480
Yes?

600
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,920
Sun Jie came to me the other day.

601
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,640
Oh.

602
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,200
She said she wants to
send her daughter abroad.

603
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,880
Yes.

604
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,590
If the kid really goes abroad,

605
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,070
we won't see her for years.

606
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,030
What should we do?

607
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:22,920
Gosh.

608
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,110
I just can't bear to let her go.

609
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,110
You raised the kid when she was little.

610
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,310
Of course it's hard to part with her.

611
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,880
But flights are convenient nowadays.

612
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,350
You can see her more often.

613
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,400
You don't need to worry about that.

614
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,270
Yes,
I've raised her since she was little.

615
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,310
When she returned home
for elementary school,

616
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,270
I was upset for days, you know.

617
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,790
Oh my.

618
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,920
Talking with you
made me lose track of time.

619
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,960
Thank you for the knitting yarn.

620
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,750
I have other things to attend to.

621
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,920
I won't keep you for dinner then.

622
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,550
Manli?

623
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,880
Ms. Zhou, the reason we came

624
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,400
is mainly to discuss with you

625
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
about your granddaughter's
education annuity.

626
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,200
What's going on?

627
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,830
Here's the situation.

628
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,400
Please sit down, let's talk.

629
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,350
Well.

630
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,270
Some time ago,

631
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,790
Sun Jie came to me.

632
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,480
Said she wants to send the kid abroad.

633
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,920
She wanted to buy
an education annuity from me.

634
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,270
But she's having
some financial difficulties.

635
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,220
Oh.

636
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,680
Education annuity?

637
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,920
That sounds wonderful.

638
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,880
Ms. Zhou, please look at this.

639
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,510
This education annuity is a product

640
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,960
specially designed by our company

641
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,640
for future education expenses.

642
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,270
During their child's growth, parents can

643
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,510
set aside funds in advance,

644
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,000
be it for studying abroad

645
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,590
or future entrepreneurship,,

646
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,640
or even marriage.

647
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,270
It'll give sufficient financial security.

648
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,240
Pretty nice.

649
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,960
Yes.

650
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,030
It's just that the lump sum

651
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,880
is a payment of one million.

652
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,550
So Sun Jie feels

653
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,750
it's financially burdensome for her.

654
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,350
A lump sum payment is quite straining.

655
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,440
Can't it be paid in installments?

656
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,030
If not five years,

657
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,400
she can do ten years.

658
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,030
Then the cash value
won't appreciate as fast.

659
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,240
Right?

660
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,310
What if major expenses come up
during this time?

661
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,680
It's not cost-effective.

662
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,270
Let's discuss this later.

663
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,750
Oh my.

664
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,000
She's your only daughter.

665
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,480
Help her if you can.

666
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,510
I could help,

667
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,110
but I don't want to.

668
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,480
Alright, I have other matters.

669
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,790
I won't keep you longer.

670
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,740
Oh.

671
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,310
Customer loyalty my foot.

672
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,640
This is social suicide.

673
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,830
I've known Ms. Zhou for so many years.

674
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,790
She knits me
a pair of gloves every year.

675
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,200
She seemed really strange today,

676
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,070
gosh,

677
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,400
like she was possessed or something.

678
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,720
Ms. Hu.

679
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,400
Third time's the charm.

680
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,830
I'll give you one last chance.

681
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:16,960
If the next client

682
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,110
is still like this,

683
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,960
we should terminate our partnership.

684
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,400
This con artist

685
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,640
is really something else.

686
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,270
He's s good at
psychological manipulation.

687
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,270
Look, Ms. Zhou
won't even listen to me now.

688
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,680
Ms. Zhou is going out - look.

689
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,590
Where's she going all dressed up?

690
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,960
Morning.

691
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,920
So what?

692
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,640
Not our business.

693
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,310
Working out?

694
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,590
- Hi. - Dong.

695
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:57,920
You're here.

696
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,960
Here.

697
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,680
Look at you.

698
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,070
Always bring me gifts, so sweet.

699
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,790
See?

700
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,030
Thanks.

701
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,070
Gosh...

702
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,550
Thank you.

703
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,240
Let's go.

704
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,640
Go.

705
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,400
Let's go.

706
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,550
Oh my god.

707
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,000
It matches your outfit today.

708
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,830
Yes.

709
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,030
How does it match so well?

710
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,680
I think I forgot my keys.

711
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,270
No rush.

712
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,550
Let me check.

713
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,440
Checking.

714
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,640
Let me see.

715
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,030
Look.

716
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,790
It's here, thought I didn't bring it.

717
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,750
I'm always forgetting things.

718
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,790
- Scared me. - Let's go.

719
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,350
Okay.

720
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,590
What do you want to eat today?

721
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,070
What do you think?

722
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,200
There's a Michelin restaurant.

723
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,680
See?

724
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,350
I was right, wasn't I?

725
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,160
Michelin?

726
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,550
Better find new clients fast.

727
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,920
Xiaozhou.

728
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,640
Xiaozhou.

729
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,550
Wait, come here.

730
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,750
Xu said your girlfriend's a doctor.

731
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,550
So?

732
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,750
That's perfect!

733
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,000
Don't get handsy when talking.

734
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,550
Can she write me

735
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,160
a depression diagnosis?

736
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,680
What do you need that for?

737
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,270
Stop asking questions!

738
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,160
Just write it for me.

739
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,590
Did Xu tell you

740
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,960
I graduated from law school?

741
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,110
Huh?

742
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,590
So you're saying you can write it?

743
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,240
I'm saying it's not allowed!

744
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,480
Faking documents is illegal.

745
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,750
Why so harsh?

746
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,640
It's not like I'm doing anything bad.

747
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,720
Don't be so rigid!

748
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,200
Do me this favor, okay?

749
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,110
[Physical Exam Report]

750
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,750
Manli, my mom's medical report came out.

751
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,440
The doctor said she

752
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,510
shows early signs of Alzheimer's.

753
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,070
I need to take her for further tests.

754
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,640
No wonder

755
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,550
she's been acting so strange lately.

756
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,030
Her personality changed too.

757
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,030
What should I do now?

758
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,680
She won't listen to anything I say.

759
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,310
She's completely bewitched.

760
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,920
Don't panic.

761
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,440
Let me ask you.

762
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,880
That con artist

763
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
has other women.

764
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,000
Are you sure about this?

765
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,720
Our old neighbor saw it firsthand.

766
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,720
To be honest with you,

767
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,830
I tried to confront them myself

768
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,960
but didn't succeed.

769
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,960
I'm just too busy.

770
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,830
I have to work

771
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,790
and take kids to classes.

772
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,750
I really have no time.

773
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,680
Otherwise,

774
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,350
I'd definitely catch that scammer.

775
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,000
Mom, who's the scammer?

776
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,270
Why are you out so early?

777
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,830
Manli, the kid's out.

778
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,680
- Can't talk now. - Coz I was good.

779
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,000
Got it covered, don't worry.

780
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,680
I'll take care of this.

781
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,750
You go do your thing.

782
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,750
Bye now.

783
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,100
Hey!

784
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,000
Come here!

785
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,000
Where are you looking?

786
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Come on, hurry up!

787
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,110
Wait. Why am I here?

788
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,590
Dong lives here.

789
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,680
Get in, hurry.

790
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,200
So what?

791
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,830
This Dong's two-timing women.

792
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,310
Maybe he's

793
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,590
setting this up with another woman.

794
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,310
You know?

795
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,720
Hu Manli, we sell insurance.

796
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,110
If clients meet scammers,

797
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
we should advise calling police.

798
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,480
You think selling insurance

799
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,030
is just sitting in a café,

800
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,920
tossing documents at clients,

801
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,480
say a few words and close the deal?

802
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,790
How naive can you be?

803
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
We're professionals.

804
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,510
I want clients to buy my insurance

805
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,480
because of my expertise,

806
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,000
not some free labor.

807
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,440
Kid,

808
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,960
the biggest policy

809
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,510
in my career is 8 million.

810
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,720
You know how did I land it?

811
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,000
On a rainy day,

812
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,920
I drove 120km/h on the highway,

813
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,400
helping a client catch a cheater.

814
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,720
Clients have professionals everywhere,

815
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,590
but who's risked life with them?

816
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,880
Just me, Hu Manli.

817
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,830
That's unshakable trust.

818
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,200
Get it? Seriously.

819
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,240
Look! See that?

820
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,920
That's him! See?

821
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,350
Don't stick your head out!

822
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,550
He'll spot us!

823
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,510
♫Hu Manli, Manli♫

824
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,030
Wait, you...

825
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,270
Hurry up!

826
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,350
Scan a bike and follow him!

827
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,160
He's getting away!

828
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,720
Hurry up!

829
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,720
Hurry! Scan a bike!

830
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,920
Pick that up for me!

831
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,300

♫I'm all about that Manli♫

872

I'm exhausted.

873
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Lady, we're literally

874
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,550
risking lives here.

875
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,830
Wipe your sweat.

876
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,000
That's an e-bike.

877
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,790
What were you thinking?

878
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,920
Don't catch a cold.

879
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:42,640
Okay, thanks.

880
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:43,680
That works.

881
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,310
Here.

882
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,000
You need to

883
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,510
adjust it properly.

884
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,960
You're in white too.

885
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,400
Of course I'll match you.

886
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,030
See?

887
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,510
Even holding hands.

888
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,680
Dance well later.

889
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,920
Of course I will.

890
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,310
Okay?

891
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:08,920
Okay.

892
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,270
Let's go.

893
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,200
Never mind, their moves are...

894
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,070
Right.

895
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,880
Yes.

896
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,510
Yes.

897
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,000
I will.

898
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,550
The weather's nice today.

899
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,200
They said it might rain.

900
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,680
Weather's unpredictable.

901
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,830
Because we're here, right?

902
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:25,750
Hey,

903
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,440
remember that Fang from dance team?

904
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,590
The one with demolition compensation.

905
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,960
Owns eight properties.

906
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,550
I remember her.

907
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,030
Yesterday she said she likes me.

908
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,310
I completely ignored her.

909
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,440
Wouldn't that be great though?

910
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,160
Eight properties!

911
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:39,880
You could

912
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,270
live in a different one each day

913
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,680
and still have one left over weekly.

914
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,160
How perfect would that be?

915
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,270
Gosh, that woman...

916
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,680
wears gold rings on eight fingers.

917
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,440
So tacky.

918
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,240
When she dances, all that flesh and

919
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,960
that smell...

920
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,960
Absolutely unbearable.

921
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,550
Well,

922
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,880
you're different though.

923
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,590
You

924
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,110
have class.

925
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,790
Keep your home spotless too.

926
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,550
As for me,

927
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,880
I like your type.

928
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,440
Alright, enough talk.

929
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,510
Come, let's dance.

930
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,280
Let's dance.

931
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,670
Is it lively?

932
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,360
Very lively indeed.

933
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,190
Everyone's dancing now.

934
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,030
Quite a crowd here.

935
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,760
They dance pretty well.

936
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,670
Come here.

937
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,840
Sit here.

938
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,150
What are you doing?

939
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,280
Help block the view for me.

940
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,590
Put your sunglasses on.

941
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:07,840
Don't move.

942
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,280
Turn around.

943
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,190
Stay still.

944
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,760
So hot! I'm burning up!

945
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:37,920
Take a break.

946
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,280
Wait.

947
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:38,920
Here.

948
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,280
Put some paper down first.

949
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,190
Otherwise,

950
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,150
you sweated so much from dancing,

951
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
if you sit directly,

952
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,710
you'll catch a cold easily.

953
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,100
Well.

954
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,360
If I get sick, so be it.

955
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,670
Might as well die sooner.

956
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,190
No one likes me, anyway.

957
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,150
Bah!

958
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,110
What would I do if you died?

959
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,670
Leaving me all alone in misery?

960
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,440
Isn't that tragic?

961
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,400
Exactly.

962
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,280
Squat down.

963
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,760
You're the one I worry about most now.

964
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,550
It's all my fault.

965
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,630
I've dragged you into this.

966
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,030
Hey!

967
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,070
Please don't say that.

968
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,440
Just drink some water.

969
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,320
Okay okay, drink up.

970
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,590
Chicken feet.

971
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,320
-Alright. - Enjoy.

972
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,630
Thank you.

973
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,000
Eat.

974
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,880
It's your favorite.

975
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,960
Here.

976
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,800
This is nice.

977
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,030
Okay.

978
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,670
Dip it in vinegar.

979
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,230
Come on, try it.

980
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,280
Yummy, right?

981
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,110
Excuse me, ma'am.

982
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,590
Are you No. 26?

983
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,550
Are we 26?

984
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,480
We're still waiting for two guests.

985
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,360
Could you wait a bit longer?

986
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,030
Sure, no problem

987
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,480
Thank you..

988
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,880
I love this most.

989
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,110
Didn't sleep last night?

990
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,070
Come catch me!

991
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,070
Don't run!

992
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,760
- Stop! - Can't catch me!

993
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,360
Let's go over there.

994
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,800
Hey!

995
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,190
Okay.

996
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,190
We agreed on 8 a.m.

997
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,030
It's almost noon now.

998
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,000
Why are you so late?

999
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,550
Luckily he hasn't left home.

1000
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,320
Come in! Why are you standing there?

1001
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,190
People might see us!

1002
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,920
No, Hu Manli...

1003
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,230
We've been following for seven days.

1004
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,630
How much longer must we follow?

1005
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,960
Seven days is nothing.

1006
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,150
Time reveals a person's heart.

1007
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,000
Stop being unreasonable, okay?

1008
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,150
We've been watching Dong for seven days.

1009
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,400
The only female visitor is Ms. Zhou.

1010
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,000
I think he treats her very well.

1011
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,710
He's not a scammer.

1012
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,800
Nonsense!

1013
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,110
Of course a scammer
would treat her well!

1014
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,320
Could he swindle money by beating her?

1015
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,960
What kind of logic is that?

1016
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,070
Real-world logic.

1017
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,280
See?

1018
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,710
Now even you're fooled by this scammer.

1019
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,880
You're just too naive, you know?

1020
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,030
I've had enough.

1021
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,960
Let's disband right here.
Have fun alone.

1022
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,230
He's coming out. See?

1023
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,110
About to leave again.

1024
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,960
Don't forget your phone!

1025
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,840
Right.

1026
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,110
See that woman?

1027
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,590
Be careful.

1028
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,360
Close the door when leaving.

1029
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,840
Damn it.

1030
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,320
Did you see what he did?

1031
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,630
I'm off.

1032
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:08,440
Bye.

1033
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,000
Saw that?

1034
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,190
This... this doesn't prove anything.

1035
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,230
So stubborn.

1036
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,280
Maybe she's just his sister.

1037
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,190
Dong is an only child.

1038
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,840
Then that must be...

1039
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,440
The cleaning lady.

1040
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,960
You blow kisses to your cleaning lady?

1041
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,030
You've got weird tastes.

1042
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,480
Damn it, didn't get the video.

1043
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,590
Stop messing around. Gosh!

1044
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,320
Won't believe till you see proof?

1045
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,320
I'll make you admit defeat today.

1046
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,670
What? Come here.

1047
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,360
What now?

1048
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,880
No, Hu Manli, what's your deal?

1049
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,630
Shut up.

1050
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,070
No, what are you doing?

1051
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,070
Hello.

1052
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,630
You are...

1053
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,070
Hello.

1054
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,000
Neighborhood committee census.

1055
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,070
I notified your husband by phone.

1056
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,440
My husband?

1057
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,280
Neighborhood committee?

1058
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,710
Do you have your IDs?

1059
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:26,840
Yes.

1060
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,030
Our IDs.

1061
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,480
What?

1062
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,440
Didn't bring IDs again?

1063
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,670
You must carry IDs when working!

1064
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,840
How many times is this?

1065
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,320
Sorry.

1066
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,760
Go get them!

1067
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:41,840
Sorry.

1068
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,360
Seriously!

1069
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,920
You're still in probation, you know?

1070
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,440
Use your brain when working!

1071
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,510
I told you

1072
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,070
bring IDs when going out!

1073
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,840
What were you thinking?

1074
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,280
What are you doing?

1075
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,480
Well?

1076
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,440
Anything else to say?

1077
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,440
Then... what's next?

1078
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,760
Don't rush to the next step.

1079
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,070
I want you to admit it yourself.

1080
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,110
Is Dong a con man?

1081
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,190
Fine, I... I admit my mistake.

1082
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,440
You're experienced, happy now?

1083
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,920
That's more like it.

1084
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,840
[Printing Shop]

1085
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,960
So, what's next?

1086
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,440
Next step... wait here.

1087
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,400
Can you change this name for me?

1088
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,920
Change it to Ding Daer.

1089
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,510
Okay, I'll try.

1090
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,440
Remove the watermark, please.

1091
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,400
No watermark.

1092
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:44,510
Alright.

1093
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,840
Look.

1094
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,400
Does it look real?

1095
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,110
So who's Ding Daer?

1096
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,030
My son.

1097
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
Can you tell it's edited?

1098
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,710
Depression.

1099
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,440
Why fake a medical certificate?

1100
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,710
It's so frustrating.

1101
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,510
The school organized a family camping trip.

1102
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,550
All parents had to attend.

1103
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,590
But my ex-husband...

1104
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,280
Well, your current stepfather.

1105
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,190
He turned me down.

1106
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Yeah, you're separated now.

1107
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,710
Not really fit for happy family events.

1108
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,190
But my son doesn't know we split.

1109
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,960
Your son doesn't know you separated?

1110
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,070
Why?

1111
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,760
Isn't it obvious?

1112
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,480
What if my son can't

1113
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,590
handle it and harm himself?

1114
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:26,880
Best case,

1115
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,710
his grades fall.

1116
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,670
Worst case, what if

1117
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,230
he's depressed and suicidal?

1118
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,070
So you forged a medical certificate

1119
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,000
to force your ex-husband
into a happy family act?

1120
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,110
He's unreasonable.

1121
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,840
I had no other choice.

1122
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,880
You're more of a con artist than Dong.

1123
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,190
That's nonsense.

1124
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,280
Mine is a white lie

1125
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,070
Fundamental difference between me

1126
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,280
and swindlers like Dong, okay?

1127
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:51,630
Are we done?

1128
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,480
Who's my stepfather?

00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:12,430

♫Sighs pull my gaze to retreat♫

1139
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,830
♫Sleepless nights, risks untold♫

1140
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,630
♫None of it for my own soul♫

1141
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,070
♫Winds blew, rains poured♫

1142
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,950
♫Umbrellas broke, we soared♫

1143
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,030
♫Sky fell, ground shook♫

1144
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,550
♫Through dusk till dawn I stood♫

1145
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,510
♫Cars passed, dreams drowned♫

1146
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:04,910
♫Every stop's chain unbound♫

1147
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,950
♫Moon watched, stars blazed♫

1148
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,830
♫Lamps died, connections phased♫

1149
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,950
♫Held hands, laughed then cried♫

1150
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,230
♫Hearts froze, parts died inside♫

1151
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,870
♫Tried hard, spoke true♫

1152
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,870
♫Now I'm someone I never knew♫

1153
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,870
♫Love came, hate stayed♫

1154
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,390
♫I arrived, you frayed♫

1155
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,750
♫Voice cracked, tears burned♫

1156
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,750
♫Life lost, lessons earned♫

1157
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,350
♫Grew up, let go♫

1158
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:31,350
♫Why cling to old sorrow♫

1159
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,710
♫How many loops replay♫

1160
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:48,390
♫Sighs steal my gaze away♫

1161
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,910
♫Lost nights, bold bets♫

1162
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:56,550
♫Nothing for my regrets♫

1163
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,950
♫Winds raged, storms crashed♫

1164
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,630
♫Dawns broke, I held fast♫

1165
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,750
♫Cars fled, dreams fled♫

1166
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:11,230
♫Every route left dead♫

1167
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,750
♫Love left, hate stayed♫

1168
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,630
♫Voice gone, tears paid♫

1169
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,270
♫Grew strong, moved on♫

1170
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,270
♫Why dwell when it's gone♫
