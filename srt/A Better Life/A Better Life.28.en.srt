A Better Life

40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Episode 28

41
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,510
Many people confuse

42
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,760
family offices with trusts.

43
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,920
In reality, these are
two completely different tools.

44
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,920
A family office can be
an independent company,

45
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,230
a group holding enterprise,

46
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,400
or even some contractual arrangements,

47
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,200
while a trust
doesn't belong to any company.

48
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,840
It's a legal asset structure arrangement

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,790
where the settlor
entrusts assets to the trustee

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
and requires the trustee
to manage the assets

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,150
according to the trust deed.

52
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,310
All asset returns
belong to the beneficiaries.

53
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,150
Good morning.

54
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,150
You're up.

55
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,560
The bathroom is so dirty.

56
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,680
When did you last clean it?

57
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,240
What are you listening to
so early in the morning?

58
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,520
Venturing into a new field,

59
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,840
I need to start from scratch.

60
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,080
When you're free,
make me a reading list.

61
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,710
Let me see.

62
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,080
Where did the sun rise from today?

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,470
It rose from the west, alright?

64
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,870
Let's eat.

65
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,960
I'm probably not
cut out for studying anyway.

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,680
I bought a few books the other day

67
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,590
and started reading them last night.

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
Couldn't get past the first three pages.

69
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,800
Don't worry.
You've got me, your personal repeater.

70
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,470
But I can't rely on you forever.

71
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,910
Not entirely my fault.

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,190
Look.

73
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:23,960
This expert

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,120
says family trusts
and trusts are two concepts.

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,080
I listened all morning
but retained nothing.

76
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,000
I heard it.

77
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,560
Wasn't it explained clearly
in the video?

78
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,630
Can I repeat it to clients?

79
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,800
Will clients understand?

80
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,120
High-net-worth individuals
don't need to.

81
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,360
Someone around them will get it.

82
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,470
Are high-net-worth individuals
not human?

83
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,960
All humans prefer plain language.

84
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,560
What's all that
corporate asset structure jargon?

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,910
Let me summarize it in one sentence:

86
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,310
A trust is like a public restaurant

87
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,080
only serving what's on the menu.

88
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,470
Family trusts are like
private chef customization.

89
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,430
With money,

90
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,190
it's all negotiable.

91
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,080
Okay, I surrender.

92
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,710
Your down-to-earth explanation skills
are top-notch.

93
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,470
Mocking me now?

94
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,190
No, I'm complimenting you!

95
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,080
Your so-called
high-net-worth individuals,

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,000
going back 20 or 30 years,

97
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,480
all came from rural areas.

98
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,560
Might be less educated than me.

99
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,270
Yes, my dad came from the countryside too.

100
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,160
I'm a country bumpkin myself.

101
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,390
That's not what I meant.

102
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,800
Brushed your teeth yet?

103
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,360
We rural folks eat breakfast
before brushing.

104
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,630
Spit it out! Full of bacteria.

105
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,750
Go on, go brush your teeth.

106
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,800
Fine, alright.

107
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,070
Morning, Director Xue.

108
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,750
Hello.

109
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,310
Morning, Director Xue.

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,070
Director Xue.

111
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,120
Hello.

112
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,120
Hello, Director Xue.

113
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,600
Hello, Director Xue.

114
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,240
Director Xue.

115
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,190
Director Xue.

116
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,040
Hello, Director Xue.

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,430
Hello, Director Xue.

118
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,560
Hello, Director Xue.

119
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,240
After you.

120
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
No, you go first.

121
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,390
Please go ahead.

122
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,560
You came first, you go ahead.

123
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,190
After you.

124
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,360
Director Xue, hurry up.

125
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,630
Don't waste everyone's time.

126
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,360
Stop calling me Director Xue.

127
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,270
I've told you many times.

128
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,120
Just call me by my name.

129
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:29,630
Okay.

130
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,680
Director Xue, after you.

131
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,070
After you.

132
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,480
Director Xue.

133
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,360
Prepare another version
of this report for me.

134
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,000
Hello, Director Xue.

135
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,510
Okay.

136
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,480
Manli?

137
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,750
What brings you to our company?

138
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,070
This...

139
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,600
Director Tang, let me introduce

140
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,070
a new colleague in my team,

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,120
Hu Manli.

142
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Hello.

143
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,950
Please, after you.

144
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,190
Incredible!

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,310
Penthouse with great views!

146
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,070
This is insane!

147
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,870
Li Qingqing is so pragmatic.

148
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,750
You close a deal

149
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,950
and immediately get such a big office.

150
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,160
Amazing.

151
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,720
Truly amazing.

152
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,480
This is so comfortable.

153
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,720
Incredible

154
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,430
Director Xue.

155
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,720
My apologies. Director Xue, please.

156
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,630
Director Xue.

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,870
Coffee, tea or mineral water?

158
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,630
Coffee.

159
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,870
Coffee, okay, coffee.

160
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,240
Coffee.

161
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,920
By the way, Hu Manli.

162
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,600
Stop calling me
Director Xue like the others.

163
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,830
It makes me very uncomfortable

164
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,120
hearing it over and over.

165
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,390
No way.

166
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,950
You are Director Xue after all.

167
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,000
What else should I call you?

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,430
I can't address you by your first names.

169
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,160
I know.

170
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,800
But psychologically speaking,

171
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,870
it's awkward.

172
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,510
You know?

173
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,680
When people call you Director Xue,

174
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,040
it's not just flattery.

175
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,870
It means you shoulder responsibilities,
understand?

176
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,920
I get it

177
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,160
But could you please stop
calling me Director Xue?

178
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:35,920
No.

179
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,240
I'm your assistant now.

180
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,510
As soon as we step in here,
I must address you as Director Xue.

181
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,870
You're dealing with major clients now.

182
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:47,630
Get it?

183
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,430
At all times

184
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,950
you must maintain commanding presence.

185
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,510
Even when you're uncertain,

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,040
you've got to project twice your stature.

187
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,870
Show me how you'd walk.

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,870
Head up, chest out,

189
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,630
with commanding presence.

190
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,160
Okay, I get it.

191
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,190
Just putting on an act, isn't it?

192
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,240
Pretentiousness is when
virtue doesn't match position.

193
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,560
Director Xue,

194
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,630
you're amazing, truly impressive.

195
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,750
I have faith in you.

196
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,070
Don't forget what we agreed on before.

197
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,600
From now on, I'm counting on you.

198
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:18,750
Understand?

199
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,870
I'll take it

200
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:25,750
Hello?

201
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,310
Yes, coming right away.

202
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,360
Li Qingqing wants to see me.

203
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,270
I'll be right back.

204
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:34,630
Go ahead.

205
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,200
Let me enjoy your seat

206
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,670
all to myself now.

207
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,720
Ah, so comfortable.

208
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,870
[Hu Manli's resume]

209
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,080
Hu Manli?

210
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,790
Yes.

211
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,630
I was afraid it would be a different person,

212
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,790
so I specially requested
the resume from HR.

213
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,320
It's indeed Hu Manli from Blue Ocean.

214
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,080
Come in.

215
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,120
Ms. Li, you wanted to see me?

216
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:13,910
Have a seat.

217
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,030
I heard from HR
you hired a new assistant.

218
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,270
I mentioned it to you the other day.

219
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,840
Did a background check?

220
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,510
Yes.

221
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,200
Then you should know

222
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,240
the person you hired

223
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,960
was not only fired by Blue Ocean,

224
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,910
but not long ago,

225
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,510
she was also sued by Blue Ocean.

226
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,080
She lost the case.

227
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,270
I know.

228
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,320
But

229
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,750
you promised me

230
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,840
to establish my personal family office,

231
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
and I have absolute autonomy over this.

232
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,440
Yes, you do have autonomy.

233
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,840
But that doesn't mean
bringing in trouble.

234
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:47,910
Not her.

235
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,480
Then you'll have to replace me first.

236
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,630
You value Hu Manli this much?

237
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,120
What's your relationship?

238
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,200
Personal privacy.

239
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,120
Can't disclose.

240
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,670
It has to be her?

241
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:13,910
Must be her.

242
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,240
Xue Xiaozhou, you need to understand.

243
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,510
I can support you,

244
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,360
or I can support someone else.

245
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,120
Ms. Li,

246
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,000
I know you can.

247
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,910
But I also know you won't.

248
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,750
That confident?

249
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,550
When you initially chose

250
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,030
a newcomer like me with

251
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,270
less than a year in the industry,

252
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,030
ultimately,

253
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,600
it's because I proved myself
with results.

254
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,320
Similarly, by choosing
Hu Manli this time,

255
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,910
I'll let the result speak for itself.

256
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,960
Please trust me.

257
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,390
I chose the right person.

258
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,790
Hiring Hu Manli will benefit

259
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,240
not just me

260
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,270
but also you,

261
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,510
as well as the company.

262
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,030
It's a formal pledge,

263
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,030
if I understand correctly?

264
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,120
Fine.

265
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,030
Two-month probation period at TSI.

266
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,870
I hope during this probation period,

267
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,960
you can prove it to me.

268
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,510
No problem.

269
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,790
Alright.

270
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,440
Then I'll take my leave first.

271
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,240
Thank you, Ms. Li.

272
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,510
Ms. Li,

273
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,670
you're really keeping Hu Manli?

274
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,200
Do you think

275
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,200
when I first brought Xue Xiaozhou
into the family office,

276
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,270
was it somewhat

277
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,670
too hasty?

278
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,080
Hello?

279
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,750
Ms. Li wants to see me?

280
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,480
Okay, I'm coming right up.

281
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,720
Thank you, Ms. Li.

282
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,440
I promoted Xue Xiaozhou to director.

283
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,840
You don't have any objections, do you?

284
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,790
No, not at all.

285
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,120
How could I?

286
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,360
I know

287
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
you're unconvinced.

288
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,750
Ms. Li,

289
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,080
I believe you have your reasons

290
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,670
for doing this.

291
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,440
Tell me.

292
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,360
Are you truly convinced by Xue Xiaozhou?

293
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,270
I'm not,

294
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,630
Then my goal is achieved.

295
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,870
When you came to TSI,

296
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,000
you poached Hu Manli's client

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,200
as your pledge to me.

298
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,840
Some in the industry
might look down on such behavior.

299
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,510
But I admire this about you.

300
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,000
Your relentless drive for performance.

301
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,480
Pity.

302
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
After your team grew larger,

303
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,870
your mindset became somewhat lax.

304
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,000
I promoted Xue Xiaozhou

305
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,550
to introduce competition

306
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,360
and to reignite your fire.

307
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,510
Tang Ling.

308
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,390
Show me that fighting spirit

309
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,910
you once had.

310
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,270
Ms. Li.

311
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,480
Rest assured.

312
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,080
I've long realized my shortcomings,

313
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
so I've been working hard.

314
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,200
I promise you.

315
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,630
I'll show you

316
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,270
I'm still that Tang Ling you admire.

317
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,270
No.

318
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,720
Even better.

319
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,000
Good.

320
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,720
Then I'll give you a chance right now.

321
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,320
Prove yourself to me.

322
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,630
Really?

323
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,150
My mom found a new job?

324
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,630
That's great.

325
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,510
So can I go back now?

326
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,120
What?

327
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,120
You want to
go back to live with your mom?

328
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,630
Aren't I supposed to live with her?

329
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,200
So are you uncomfortable living with me?

330
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,910
Or

331
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,080
did Lisu treat you badly?

332
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,910
No.

333
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,480
It's just...

334
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,390
I simply miss my mom.

335
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,360
Daer,

336
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,320
when you came to stay,

337
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,270
you called me first.

338
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,390
Although you didn't say anything,

339
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,790
I know

340
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,630
you wanted to help your mom

341
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,870
to lighten her burden.

342
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,200
Right?

343
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,080
For your mom right now,

344
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,030
this is the most difficult period.

345
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
She just sold the house,

346
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,080
found a new job,

347
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,960
and still has to

348
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,870
look after your grandpa
at the nursing home.

349
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,600
If you go back now,

350
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,630
she definitely won't say no.

351
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,600
But for her,

352
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,000
life would become even harder,
.more exhausting

353
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,440
You surely don't want

354
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,510
her to be like that.

355
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,320
Right?

356
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,870
Am I seeing this right?

357
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,080
My mom is actually reading a book?

358
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,870
And you're reading so attentively.

359
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,960
Stop being sarcastic.

360
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,200
You miss a good spanking now?

361
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
That's more like

362
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,630
the Ms. Hu Manli I know.

363
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,670
Come here, let me take a look.

364
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,960
Pull your hair up.

365
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,270
You'll get acne from covering it.

366
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,600
Look!

367
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,480
So many pimples.

368
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,150
You don't wash your face, do you?

369
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,790
Okay, fine.

370
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,960
I've already ordered.

371
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,510
You're reading Professor Zeng's book.

372
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,390
Yes.

373
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,270
Your university's
insurance department doctoral supervisor.

374
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,750
I'm currently working in
family office services,

375
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,840
so I bought some books to study.

376
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,510
That's good.

377
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,030
The robot is coming.

378
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,080
All your favorite foods.

379
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,200
Okay.

380
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,270
Thanks, mom.

381
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,320
Dingding.

382
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,600
Are you free tomorrow?

383
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,960
Yes, why?

384
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,670
Going bed shopping me.

385
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,750
Buy a bed?

386
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,600
What kind of bed?

387
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,320
You can't keep living at
your dad's place forever.

388
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,720
My place is small,

389
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,750
but a bunk bed
would still make the space work.

390
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,750
Maybe just forget about it.

391
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,480
You have too much going on now.

392
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,630
Let him stay at my place for now.

393
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,200
We agreed during the divorce that

394
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,000
I have his custody.

395
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,790
I'm very grateful that you've been

396
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,830
looking after him these days.

397
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,590
Manli.

398
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,350
Listen to me.

399
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,070
Just listen to me on this matter.

400
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
Given your current situation,

401
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,830
it's not good for Daer to live with you.

402
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,750
Alright then,
I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

403
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,720
Or maybe we should just forget about it.

404
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,550
Why?

405
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,640
I'm actually doing fine
living at my dad's place.

406
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,790
I eat well every day.

407
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,400
A nanny takes care of daily chores.

408
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,550
We even have a chauffeur.

409
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,510
It's quite nice.

410
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,070
Are you really the type
to indulge in luxuries?

411
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,550
I...

412
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,640
Could be, yes.

413
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,480
Stop joking around.

414
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,680
You're afraid coming back
would burden me, right?

415
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,480
That's not it.

416
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,350
If you come back,

417
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,830
I'll definitely be a bit more tired.

418
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,160
But you're my son.

419
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,680
How can you live in someone else's home?

420
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,310
No child wants to
live under someone else's roof.

421
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,400
My dad is family.

422
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,590
It's not "someone else's roof".

423
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,110
Precise wording.

424
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,030
Mom, stop adding drama
to yourself, okay?

425
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
And tragic drama at that.

426
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,720
Let me be honest with you.

427
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,550
At first when I thought about
living at dad's place

428
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,240
and remembering his new wife,

429
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,030
I got annoyed too.

430
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,720
But guess what?

431
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,070
When I leave for school in the morning,

432
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,200
she hasn't even gotten up.

433
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,160
When I come home at night,

434
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,030
she hasn't returned yet.

435
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,510
Basically, she doesn't even exist.

436
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Out of sight, out of mind.

437
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,350
It's wonderful.

438
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,550
Shush. Your dad's still here.

439
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:29,920
It's fine.

440
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,350
One thing at a time, right?

441
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,400
Yes.

442
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,720
One thing at a time.

443
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,920
Manli, look.

444
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,200
Daer has spoken.

445
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,750
So shouldn't you respect his choice?

446
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,270
Tell me.

447
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,440
Why don't you want to come back with me?

448
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,920
Mom, will you ever stop?

449
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,550
Besides what I just said,

450
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,110
actually,

451
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,640
there's another reason.

452
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,110
I want to spend more time with Dad.

453
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,830
I've noticed

454
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,400
Dad seems to have become more likable.

455
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,790
He can understand human speech now and

456
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,880
speak human language too.

457
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,160
I feel being with him

458
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,750
isn't as unpleasant as before.

459
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,720
Then why didn't you say so earlier?

460
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,070
Didn't want him to get too proud.

461
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,590
I'll keep mentally manipulating him.

462
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,640
You're quite cunning, aren't you?

463
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,160
Jealous?

464
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,400
Be reasonable, okay?

465
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,830
He's your dad, why would I be jealous?

466
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,960
That's good then.

467
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,270
He's here.

468
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,160
Get in, I'll take you back.

469
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,000
By the way, Zhiyuan.

470
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
I forgot to give this to you.

471
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,750
Here.

472
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,070
What's this?

473
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,480
The 500,000 from your parents before

474
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,240
were used to buy Daer insurance.

475
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,160
Starting this year,

476
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,480
you can get annual payouts.

477
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,480
This money came from your family.

478
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,750
You decide how to handle it.

479
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,240
No need.

480
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,160
This money,

481
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,160
you keep it yourself.

482
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,200
You might need it
during these difficult times.

483
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,720
I wouldn't dare use your family's money.

484
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,070
If your parents show up at my doorstep again,

485
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,830
I can't handle it.

486
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,070
Don't worry.

487
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,440
I won't let them bother you anymore.

488
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,440
As for the money,

489
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,590
I have the final say.

490
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,110
What do you mean?

491
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,200
Didn't you say before

492
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,070
that I should be
more assertive when needed?

493
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,070
Well, I mustered up my courage
and tried once.

494
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,590
But unexpectedly,

495
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,640
my trouble was

496
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,030
actually resolved just like that.

497
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,790
Really?

498
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,240
Did you get angry with your parents?

499
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,680
Not exactly.

500
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,310
I just

501
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,550
firmly demanded that they

502
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,720
follow my arrangements.

503
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,750
I originally thought
they would make a scene.

504
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,070
But in the end nothing happened.

505
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,110
The matter was settled.

506
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,720
You really understand life
better than I do.

507
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,400
I've learned something this time.

508
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,640
Am I hearing this right?

509
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,310
You, a professor and internet celebrity,

510
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,480
learning from me?

511
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,350
Mom.

512
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,350
Don't say that.

513
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,830
Dad has improved.

514
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,830
You should praise him.

515
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,880
Give him positive feedback.

516
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,960
Well, you're indeed his son.

517
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,400
I can't say bad things about him?

518
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,920
Okay, I'll praise him. Zhiyuan.

519
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,030
You've made progress.

520
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,270
Keep up the good work.

521
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,680
Strive to be the master of the house.

522
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,070
Hear that?

523
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,720
Have I made any progress?

524
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,550
Praise me.

525
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,640
Great, you're amazing.

526
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,240
Is that enough?

527
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,310
Alright, it's settled then.

528
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,510
Thank you.

529
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,590
That Li Shan from
"New Forces in Business"

530
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,830
just called and told me.

531
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,510
The chamber of commerce that Li Fendou
belongs to loves going to MegaSports.

532
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,440
That's their regular spot
for playing tennis.

533
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,830
Said she'd take me to meet him.

534
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,310
Tennis? I don't play.

535
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,790
Don't worry, I do.

536
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,310
Speak like a rick heir.

537
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,440
More like rich heir in debt.

538
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,920
Then keep your Sunday morning free.

539
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,790
What's wrong?

540
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,580
Huh?

541
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,000
Well.

542
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,070
After I meet Mr. Li later and finish

543
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,960
introducing myself,

544
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,880
should I ask for
his WhatsApp immediately?

545
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,590
Don't force it.

546
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,550
Look for opportunities,
play some games with him first.

547
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,550
Get a feel for his style.

548
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,480
How do I do that?

549
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,000
Judge by his playing style.

550
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,920
See if he's offensive or defensive.

551
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,830
I thought you could play?

552
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,750
You must know more than me.

553
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,720
What should I do if he's offensive?

554
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,640
And what if he's defensive?

555
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,920
Should I deliberately lose to him?

556
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,640
When Ya took me to
play with Director Kang,

557
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
we had to intentionally lose.

558
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,790
But they saw through it.

559
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,240
If Mr. Li notices,

560
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,000
wouldn't that be bad?

561
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,400
But if I win,

562
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,550
he... he might get angry.

563
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,070
You're nervous?

564
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,920
I... I just don't want to mess this up.

565
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,400
Hu Manli, tell me what I should do.

566
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Xue Xiaozhou.

567
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,350
Right now, you're the boss.

568
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,030
You need to lead me forward.

569
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,310
I know.

570
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,550
But I just feel like

571
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,510
I'm not quite ready.

572
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,240
When it comes to family office,'

573
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,550
I'm not ready either.

574
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,480
You need to believe in yourself.

575
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,880
If you're an eagle,
you must spread your wings and soar.

576
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,310
If not, you're just a canary.

577
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,590
Wait. Can you stop

578
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,270
using these
cheesy metaphors all the time?

579
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,000
Then you're a little chicken, alright?

580
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,920
Don't quibble with me.

581
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,790
Straighten your back.

582
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,440
Director Xue.

583
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,110
Shan, hello.

584
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,070
Li Shan, do you still remember me?

585
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,680
You are...

586
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,830
Hu Manli.

587
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,920
Why are you here?

588
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,790
I'm now Director Xue's assistant.

589
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,030
Please take good care of me today.

590
00:23:59,550 --> 00:23:59,920
Okay.

591
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,880
Let's go then.

592
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,100
Yes.

593
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,440
You've been very busy lately,
haven't you?

594
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,110
Haven't seen you for a long time.

595
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,510
Have been dealing with
some messy family matters.

596
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,480
Sorting things out.

597
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,200
Haven't been out.

598
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,510
When you stay in too long,
you become lazy。

599
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,270
Mr. Gu, hello.

600
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,550
Shan.

601
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,030
Hello.

602
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,030
What brings you here today?

603
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,350
Came to introduce you to a new friend.

604
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,030
Xue Xiaozhou,

605
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,030
head of TSI's Family Office.

606
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,350
What?

607
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,550
Head of TSI's Family Office.

608
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,550
Mr. Gu, Chairman of
the Chamber of Commerce.

609
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,590
Also captain of the Wolf Tennis Team.

610
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,480
What wolf?

611
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,590
Now it's rabbit only.

612
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,350
Mr. Gu, hello.

613
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,510
Xue Xiaozhou.

614
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,220
I see.

615
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,200
So Mr. Li isn't here, right?

616
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,880
Mr. Li? Which Mr. Li?

617
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,310
I see now.

618
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,830
It seems your visit today

619
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,310
has other purposes.

620
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,000
You're here for Li Fendou, aren't you?

621
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,640
Let me tell you.

622
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,200
This Li Fendou

623
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,350
has finally come around today

624
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,880
and started working on
family wealth inheritance.

625
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,440
I told him two years ago.

626
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,110
He only has one daughter.

627
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,640
I told him

628
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,680
you'd better get started.

629
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,200
But this country bumpkin told me

630
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,830
he said company money
is his personal money.

631
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,070
Why make things so complicated?

632
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,440
Stupid, right?

633
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,480
But now?

634
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,750
Not only is he doing it,

635
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,960
but I've heard

636
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,960
he's also making a huge fuss about it.

637
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,510
Already changed several companies.

638
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,640
None satisfied him.

639
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,480
Don't call him country bumpkin.

640
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,880
Either he doesn't do it,

641
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,960
but when he does, he's quite particular.

642
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,110
By the way,

643
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,240
Mr. Li probably won't come today.

644
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,310
So your trip might be in vain.

645
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,240
How could it be in vain?

646
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,310
Director Xue is actually here

647
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,750
to exchange skills with you today.

648
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,480
Really?

649
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,310
Yes.

650
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,590
I'd like to play a match with Mr. Gu.

651
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,960
You can play too?

652
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,550
Director Xue was

653
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,830
the president of
Fudan University's tennis club in college.

654
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,030
- Really?- No.

655
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,480
Okay then, let's have a good match.

656
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,640
It's been a while since I last played.

657
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,200
You warm up first.

658
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,880
I'll go change.

659
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,270
Okay.

660
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:13,830
We'll play in a bit.

661
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,070
You've met your match today.

662
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,030
Finally got a worthy opponent.

663
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,070
Nice shot.

664
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,030
Great shot.

665
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,550
Really good.

666
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,160
Tricky one.

667
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,880
This is a good one.

668
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,790
Yes, not bad.

669
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:07,790
Not bad.

670
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,400
Great shot.

671
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,030
Getting there.

672
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,070
Yes.

673
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,440
Good shot.

674
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:12,790
Not bad.

675
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,160
Indeed.

676
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,680
Started slow then picked up.

677
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,880
Director Xue is quite skilled.

678
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,960
No wonder he's so young

679
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,920
and Ms. Li always supports him.

680
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,440
Thanks to your whole family.

681
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,640
Hurry up and lose.

682
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,160
Why play so seriously, really.

683
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,070
Good.

684
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:39,830
Good.

685
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,160
Great shot.

686
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,750
What a pity.

687
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,510
Just a bit short.

688
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,030
Out of stamina.

689
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,160
Sorry about that, Mr. Gu.

690
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Just some amateur skills.

691
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,440
But still won this time.

692
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,000
Mr. Gu.

693
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,830
You went easy on me.

694
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,440
Here, hydrate.

695
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,510
No need, I have mine.

696
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,480
Better keep moving.

697
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,550
Don't just admire others' skills.

698
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,070
Without practice, you'll never catch up.

699
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,400
Can't keep up physically.

700
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,070
You're pretty good.

701
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,590
Last time I saw you running.

702
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,110
Not many can beat me.

703
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,480
You're one of them.

704
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:54,920
Alright..

705
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,590
Mr. Gu.

706
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,480
Gu's done playing.

707
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,350
That racket.

708
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,960
See you next time.

709
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:07,680
Goodbye.

710
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,440
Pleasure meeting you.

711
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,920
Go change out of those wet clothes.

712
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,750
Don't catch a cold.

713
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,550
Should I not have

714
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,720
won that point against Mr. Gu?

715
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,070
Either way, it's over now.

716
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,750
Stop thinking about it.

717
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,550
And you were telling others to hydrate.

718
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,000
Looks like your brain needs hydration.

719
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,030
Let me tell you.

720
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,200
At first I could still stay rational.

721
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,070
I kept reminding myself to let him win

722
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,960
to make him happy.

723
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,640
But as we kept playing I just...

724
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,400
I truly couldn't control myself,

725
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,920
especially at critical moments.

726
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,440
I felt that I,

727
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,240
I should treat this match sincerely.

728
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,550
What if Mr. Gu felt the same way?

729
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,160
But now it seems my

730
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,480
judgment was wrong.

731
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,000
Hu Manli, just scold me.

732
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,960
Why would I scold you?

733
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,200
Today,

734
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,070
we didn't meet Li Fendou

735
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,720
and managed to
offend the chamber's chairman.

736
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,310
This deal probably won't happen now.

737
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,400
If this deal falls through,

738
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
there'll be another one.

739
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,790
This world

740
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,510
has more rich people
than just Li Fendou.

741
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,830
But why is it that I

742
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,750
can't even handle
a simple tennis game properly?

743
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,400
Xue Xiaozhou.

744
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,680
do you know what kind of person

745
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,350
can truly succeed in our line of work?

746
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,440
Certainly not someone like me.

747
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,240
Only by using your natural strengths

748
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,400
to interact with clients

749
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,590
can you last long in this industry.

750
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,030
What am I good at?

751
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,640
I'm only good at offending people.

752
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,000
All roads are made by walking.

753
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,350

00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,190
But all departments in our company

943
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:44,960
have already allocated most resources

944
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,360
[Chen Xiaotian's concert]

945
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,000
towards family office services.

946
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,960
As for our family office,

947
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,150
- actually, we have... - Okay.

948
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,760
I understand.

949
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,320
You have your
business introduction here?

950
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,480
The business introduction is right here.

951
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,920
I'll take this back to have a look.

952
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,400
Please review it first then.

953
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,760
We'll schedule another meeting later.

954
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:04,920
Alright.

955
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:05,800
Let's meet again.

956
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,920
Ms. Yan.

957
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,880
That concert you mentioned earlier,

958
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,760
is it Chen Xiaotian's concert?

959
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:11,920
Yes.

960
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,550
What's wrong?

961
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,960
I can get tickets.

962
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,880
Are you sure?

963
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,320
It sold out within minutes
after sales opened.

964
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:18,800
Ms. Yan.

965
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,880
We serve high-net-worth individuals.

966
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,960
If we can't even secure concert tickets,

967
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,800
how can we satisfy our clients?

968
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,110
Center seats. Members and scalpers
are all sold out.

969
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,510
No problem, leave it to me.

970
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,590
Okay, waiting for your update.

971
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,670
Keep in touch.

972
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,550
About those tickets,

973
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,710
I'll try my best to get them for you.

974
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,840
Wait for my update.

975
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,920
Don't worry, the middleman confirmed

976
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,670
tickets can be obtained, no problem.

977
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,000
What's wrong?

978
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,320
You're upset because I got the tickets
and stole your thunder?

979
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,480
Not happy?

980
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,030
That's not why.

981
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,630
Her boss is our major client.

982
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,230
That's correct.

983
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,510
But we're not babysitters either.

984
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,960
Today we helped them get tickets.

985
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:10,630
Right?

986
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,510
What if tomorrow
they say their toilet is clogged.

987
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,400
Should we go fix that too?

988
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,000
I'd be overjoyed if

989
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,400
he really asked me
to go fix their toilet.

990
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,110
That means they treat me as family.

991
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,030
We shouldn't always
fawn over big clients.

992
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,710
Sometimes refusal is an attitude too.

993
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,630
Saying no

994
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,070
shows you've got confidence.

995
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,030
Li Fendou is my client.

996
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,070
Let me take the lead, okay?

997
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,960
This time, follow my lead.

998
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,070
That's what I said initially.

999
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,400
But petty officials
are hard to deal with.

1000
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,230
Especially those around the boss.

1001
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,760
We don't need their help.

1002
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,840
We just need them not to sabotage us.

1003
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,840
Just leave this person to me.

1004
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,230
I'll handle it for you, alright?

1005
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,070
When you finally meet Li Fendou,

1006
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,480
I won't interfere anymore, okay?

1007
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,190
About those concert tickets,

1008
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,320
I've already paid the middleman.

1009
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,110
If we don't take the tickets,

1010
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,960
the money's wasted.

1011
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,840
Won't let it happen again, okay?

1012
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:00,590
Okay.

1013
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,190
Fine then.

1014
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,030
It's been almost an hour now.

1015
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,840
Ms. Yan still hasn't shown up.

1016
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,630
You did contact her, right?

1017
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,480
Yes, I texted her when I arrived.

1018
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,070
No reply though.

1019
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,360
And this appointment time

1020
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,800
was set by herself three days ago,

1021
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,000
That shouldn't happen.

1022
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,670
If something came up suddenly,

1023
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,550
she should have notified us earlier.

1024
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,360
Now leaving us hanging here

1025
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,400
isn't a good sign.

1026
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,110
Let me call her.

1027
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,550
Ms. Yan, thanks for today.

1028
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,280
Don't mention it.

1029
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,320
