Episode 17

41
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,230
Okay.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,870
Okay, Mr. Chen.

43
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,000
Besides your mom,
any thoughts on annuities?

44
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,840
Let me tell you.

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
The products I sent you
are all excellent.

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,950
Of course not.

47
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,920
Regardless of policy size, every client

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,840
is equally important to us.

49
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,150
Okay okay, no problem.

50
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,950
Anything else?

51
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:52,920
Goodbye.

52
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,640
Aren't you having dinner
with girlfriend?

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,760
Why are you back so early?

54
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:05,790
What's wrong?

55
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,520
She wants to break up with me.

56
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,700
Huh?

57
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,710
Had a fight?

58
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,000
Anger talking, is it?

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,630
I wish that was the case.

60
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,520
It doesn't seem that way.

61
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,310
Why though?

62
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
So sudden...

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,080
There must be a reason.

64
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,400
I don't know why either.

65
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,360
She wouldn't say anything.

66
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,280
I... I don't know what I did wrong.

67
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,750
I don't know what to do now.

68
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,630
Don't worry.

69
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,750
I'll talk to Wu Ya when I'm free.

70
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,520
No, Manli, you...

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,150
Can you really help me?

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,680
Don't worry.

73
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,630
There's no one I can't persuade.

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,280
Probably just mood swing.

75
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,870
Don't worry.

76
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,520
Let me talk about work first.

77
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,280
That Mr. Chen from the market

78
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,120
finally decided to get basic

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,960
medical insurance
for his 76-year-old mom.

80
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Help him with the procedure.

81
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,240
Can't he do it online himself?

82
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,190
That's not right.

83
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,870
Yes, you're heartbroken,

84
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,910
but work can't be sloppy.

85
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,710
Okay, I get it.

86
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,590
I'll handle it tomorrow.

87
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,750
Not tomorrow!

88
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,030
Now.

89
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,030
I'm really not feeling well now.

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,910
I know you're unwell and in a bad mood,

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,590
but the phone operation
needs your face scan,

92
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,150
or I'd go do it for you.

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
His mom is 76 years old.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,400
Earlier coverage means more protection.

95
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,310
Right?

96
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,560
Get on it now.

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,590
After that, leave the rest to me.

98
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,680
I'll handle it, okay?

99
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,470
Send the link now, send it.

100
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,000
You've been drinking?

101
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,520
Have some water.

102
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,910
Baodan.

103
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,910
Do you miss mommy?

104
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,630
Miss mommy?

105
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,150
Look.

106
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,960
It says it misses you.

107
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,280
Mommy's joking with me, right?

108
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,310
Look.

109
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,800
See.

110
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,000
Mommy's teasing me, isn't she?

111
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,600
Ya, look.

112
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,270
Look at Baodan's belly.

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,950
Hasn't it gotten bigger?

114
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,870
It's been eating so well lately.

115
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,680
Baodan just told me

116
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,040
it really misses you.

117
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,510
It wants to see you.

118
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,390
I want to see you too.

119
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,270
Could you reply to my message?

120
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,120
Ya, look.

121
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,870
Baodan's on my bed.

122
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,870
Just whispered something to me.

123
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,750
It says

124
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
it wants to see you.

125
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,360
It misses Mommy.

126
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,560
Look.

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,360
Baodan.

128
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,510
Say "Mommy".

129
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,800
Mommy's joking with me, right?

130
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,070
Say "Mommy, I want to see you".

131
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,390
The orphan policy

132
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,830
is a professional term
in the insurance industry.

133
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,510
It refers to when an insurance broker

134
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,720
or agent leaves their position,

135
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,630
your policy

136
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,600
temporarily lacks service coverage.

137
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,000
If you encounter this situation,

138
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,600
you can call the insurer's
customer service.

139
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,000
The company will assign a new agent

140
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,630
based on actual circumstances.

141
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,000
Of course, you can also
request a specific agent.

142
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,160
To all my dear clients,

143
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,270
did you understand everything?

144
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:02,950
Love you all.

145
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,310
Hello Mr. Chen.

146
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,870
No, not yet.

147
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,270
It's still early for bed. Go ahead.

148
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,560
Ms. Hu.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,240
I really can't figure out
these phone operations.

150
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
All this policyholder,
insured person stuff.

151
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,270
This relationship, that explanation.

152
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,510
It's honestly too confusing.

153
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,720
That's normal,
first-timers always struggle.

154
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,630
Let me help you, hand me your phone.

155
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:36,920
Okay.

156
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,830
Have some water.

157
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,160
Alright.

158
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,360
You have your mom's ID number?

159
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,630
Yes, I made copies.

160
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,000
Here.

161
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,070
Let me see.

162
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,830
320,

163
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,870
120,

164
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
1947.

165
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,360
All done.

166
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,600
Perfect.

167
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,270
Well...

168
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,430
How...how will
my mom's medical bills get reimbursed?

169
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,720
Well.

170
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,160
If something happens...

171
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,800
Touch wood, I mean

172
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,510
if you're too busy with work,

173
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,680
just give me a call.

174
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,190
I'll handle the insurance claims.

175
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,510
So...

176
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,070
After insurance is sold,

177
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,720
you still take care of us.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,560
Didn't I tell you before?

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,950
A responsible insurance agent

180
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,630
only begins with the sale.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
Just call me for anything,

182
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,950
I'll handle everything for you.

183
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,960
That's great!

184
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,360
Then...what if I fight with my wife?

185
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,120
Yes.

186
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,750
If I can't resolve it,

187
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,870
I'll ask the neighborhood committee

188
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,480
to mediate until you reconcile.

189
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,440
Okay!

190
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
Ms. Hu, thank you so much!

191
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,480
Look, with me here,

192
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,670
I haven't earned you much money,

193
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,750
yet I'm troubling you so much.

194
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,120
I definitely want to land big clients.

195
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,600
Right?

196
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,550
But nobody's money grows on trees.

197
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,600
Being wary of scams is normal.

198
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,320
Let's start with small orders first.

199
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,910
You can get a feel for me.

200
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,360
See if I'm reliable.

201
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,670
You know where I live anyway.

202
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,670
I'm not going anywhere.

203
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,360
Alright.

204
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,750
From now on, just call me
when you need seafood.

205
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,670
I'll deliver to your door.

206
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,390
Thanks.

207
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,080
Take two fish home.

208
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,360
Mr. Chen, don't trouble yourself.

209
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,720
No one's home for dinner today.

210
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,630
Very fresh.

211
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,440
I need to take this call.

212
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,320
Hello?

213
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,750
Manli?

214
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
What's going on?

215
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,120
That insurance claim got rejected.

216
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,630
You need to look into this.

217
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,120
Why?

218
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,270
Chunlu.

219
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,910
Manli, you needed me?

220
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,670
I need to ask you something.

221
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,200
Two years ago,

222
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,630
I asked you to buy insurance

223
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,120
for my ex-husband's uncle, remember?

224
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,000
Let me remind you.

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,550
You hadn't closed a deal
for three months.

226
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,390
Per policy,
your agent ID should've been revoked.

227
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,240
That's why I arranged this deal for you.

228
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,030
Do you remember?

229
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,320
What's wrong?

230
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,200
Back then I specifically told you

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,200
to get them medical
and critical illness coverage.

232
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,840
What plan did you actually get them?

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,670
Do you recall?

234
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,790
Manli.

235
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,700
Hey.

236
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,870
Manli.

237
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,600
Uncle, Auntie.

238
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,420
Yes.

239
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,080
This is Chunlu, my apprentice.

240
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,200
Nice to meet you.

241
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:38,870
Hello.

242
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,750
Uncle, Auntie.

243
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,270
Good thing you reconsidered.

244
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,440
If you waited two more years and past 60,

245
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,360
you wouldn't qualify
for medical insurance.

246
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,150
See?

247
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,720
Chunlu will take you upstairs for recording.

248
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,910
Just follow the procedure.

249
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,270
Chunlu, after recording, mind the time.

250
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,630
Get them to the train station.

251
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,600
Got it, no problem.

252
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,910
I need to leave now.

253
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,270
Dingding has a parent-teacher meeting.

254
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,240
I'll be late if I don't go.

255
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,630
Alright, go handle your business.

256
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,200
We're fine.

257
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,630
Luggage.

258
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,440
Yes, the luggage.

259
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,510
Help with the luggage.

260
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,720
Here, let me.

261
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,480
So Manli asked me to arrange

262
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,390
a combo of critical illness
and medical insurance.

263
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,550
Though critical illness
costs more yearly,

264
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,960
if you do get sick,

265
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,440
you'll get a large payout.

266
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,750
But...if we don't get sick,

267
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
wouldn't all that money go to waste?

268
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,600
Right.

269
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,440
It won't.

270
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,600
After a certain number of years

271
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,790
it'll be returned to you.

272
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,080
Returned?

273
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,360
That's...that's acceptable then.

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,750
Look miss.

275
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,910
About this insurance of yours,

276
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
for both of us

277
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,080
it's over 3,000 per person yearly.

278
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,120
That's over 6,000 in total.

279
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,120
If we really don't get sick,

280
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,960
will we get our money back?

281
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,120
This is consumption-type.

282
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,000
Non-refundable.

283
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,000
No refund?

284
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,360
That...that's not ideal.

285
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,550
Then how...

286
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,120
We'll think about it.

287
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,000
Look.

288
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,360
Can we just buy that one separately,

289
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,670
the critical illness one you mentioned?

290
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,720
Yes, the serious disease one.

291
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,320
Yes.

292
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,510
But we usually recommend getting both

293
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,320
policies for more

294
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,630
comprehensive protection.

295
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,670
No.

296
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,080
Look here.

297
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,270
For major illnesses,
we've got that covered.

298
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,000
For minor ailments, we can tough it out.

299
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,030
It's not worth
spending over 6,000 a year.

300
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,480
Right?

301
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,120
Exactly.

302
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,270
I think you're just trying to make money.

303
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,000
Aren't you?

304
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,360
That's why you bundle them.

305
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,080
Forget it, maybe we shouldn't buy.

306
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,240
No.

307
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,790
Auntie, please sit.

308
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,790
Well.

309
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,600
Then I'll just set up
critical illness for you.

310
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,320
Okay.

311
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,670
Okay.

312
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,030
We'll

313
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,360
just get that one.

314
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,480
Yes, that one.

315
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,000
Why didn't you tell me this important info?

316
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,630
They insisted, I couldn't help it.

317
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,030
You're worried about being let go,

318
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,240
but have you considered
the clients' needs?

319
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,150
Chunlu, you're in big trouble!

320
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,790
Manli, you...

321
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,200
Don't try to scare me.

322
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,870
Everything was recorded.

323
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
My procedures
are fully legal and compliant.

324
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,000
So according to what you're saying,

325
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,870
there's no other way then.

326
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,480
I've already spoken to Chunlu.

327
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,720
But judging from the procedures,

328
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,750
she did nothing wrong.

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
This matter,

330
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,390
I'm afraid there's no other way.

331
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,550
If there's nothing else, I'm off.

332
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,720
Wait.

380
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,400
I'm not going back.

381
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,480
I won't leave until I see Ya today.

382
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,400
What do you want?

383
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,000
Being annoyingly persistent?

384
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,110
Be careful or Wu Ya might call the cops.

385
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,750
Whatever, I have to see her today!

386
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,680
Which room is hers?

387
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,720
I don't know.

388
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,550
You don't know your girlfriend's room?

389
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,480
Ya, which floor are you on?

390
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,340
[Hu Manli]

391
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,640
Ya.

392
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,160
It's me, Manli.

393
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,270
If you really want to break up,
give him a reason.

394
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,350
Xiaozhou won't understand if you do this.

395
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,030
No matter what,

396
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,160
you should talk this through, right?

397
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,310
I made everything clear last time.

398
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,550
Wait, I'm sorry.

399
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,440
Ya, I...I'm sorry.

400
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,920
Tell me what to change, and I'll change.

401
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,480
Ya.

402
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:14,920
Ya.

403
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,790
You two made it through such hard times.

404
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,110
How can you just stop loving him now?

405
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,480
What exactly happened?

406
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,640
He's too self-centered, too selfish.

407
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,720
There's no one but himself in his heart.

408
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,030
Maybe I never loved him.

409
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,350
I only loved the idea of him.

410
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,720
The real him was never worth my love.

411
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,240
Xiaozhou.

412
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,070
He broke up with his girlfriend.

413
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,640
I have an idea.

414
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,680
I want to switch to field work.

415
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,720
You want to sell insurance?

416
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,510
But you...

417
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,240
Are you sure?

418
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,030
Xiaozhou.

419
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,110
Relationships between people

420
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,110
require deliberate effort to maintain.

421
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,720
Now you're selling insurance,

422
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,350
if you can't learn to please others,

423
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,680
why would they sign policies with you?

424
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,160
I don't want shady methods to
sell insurance!

425
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,270
This is social etiquette!

426
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,400
How is that shady?

427
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,590
I know you care about me,

428
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,480
but I want to try my own way.

429
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,000
Give me some time, okay?

430
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,720
You can refuse this deal,

431
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,550
but why end partnership with her?

432
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,240
Today is insuring a cheating husband,

433
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,070
then tomorrow?

434
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,000
Insuring the mistress next?

435
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,440
Who after that?

436
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,400
I dare not imagine.

437
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,960
A three-million-yuan policy.

438
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,920
Think about your mother.

439
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,000
Morning.

440
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,720
Why didn't you call me?

441
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,920
Are you okay?

442
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,480
I'm fine.

443
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,030
I'll go to the office.

444
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,590
I can drop Daer off at school too.

445
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,750
Ah?

446
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,270
Are you sure?

447
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:56,720
Of course.

448
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,550
You're sure you're alright?

449
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,310
Of course.

450
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,310
Don't worry about me.

451
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,240
Last night,

452
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,070
I really thought about it.

453
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,240
These past six months,

454
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,480
I've done many things wrong.

455
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,030
I let Ya down.

456
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,240
Ya may seem

457
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,920
cheerful on the surface,

458
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,880
but actually...

459
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,070
she takes things to heart.

460
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,270
So what's your plan now?

461
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,880
I'll work hard from now on.

462
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,590
Prove it to her with actions.

463
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,200
I won't disappoint her again.

464
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,160
Good.

465
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,680
You,

466
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,920
just follow my lead, got it?

467
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,400
In six months, we'll get you

468
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,920
a down payment for a small place.

469
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,510
Then you can slap those keys

470
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,960
right in front of her.

471
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,830
Guaranteed to move Ya to tears.

472
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,110
Mom.

473
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,310
Don't make love sound so materialistic, okay?

474
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,070
Wrong.

475
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,790
A house isn't just material.

476
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,640
It also provides spiritual security.

477
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,550
Agreed.

478
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,750
Well said.

479
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,240
Learn from Xiaozhou.

480
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,000
He admit him mistakes.

481
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,020
[Chen Fang liked Tang Ling's post]

482
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,380
Hm?

483
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,000
They know each other?

484
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,510
You liked my post.

485
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:50,830
No I didn't.

486
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
I liked a new property ad.

487
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,160
Look yourself - isn't that you?

488
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:56,830
Cancel it now.

489
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,480
My bad.

490
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,880
Be more careful next time.

491
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:04,960
Canceled.

492
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,660
Oh ho?

493
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,160
What's wrong?

494
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,920
Let me ask you.

495
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,720
You said back then

496
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,750
Chen Fang asked you to
check my past claims.

497
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,960
You're not bringing up
old grudges again, are you?

498
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,480
Seriously.

499
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
I always thought I'd offended Chen Fang.

500
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,350
That's why he's messing with me.

501
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:39,960
Isn't it?

502
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,160
Look.

503
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,160
Chen Fang liked Tang Ling's post.

504
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,070
They know each other?

505
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,400
Theoretically,
they shouldn't know each other.

506
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,400
When Tang Ling jumped to TSI,

507
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,110
Chen Fang hadn't joined us yet.

508
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
But it's normal for people
in the same circle.

509
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,680
Yes.

510
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,720
It's normal for peers to know each other.

511
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,510
Liking each other's posts is normal too.

512
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,270
But look.

513
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,680
Now.

514
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,830
Liked, then canceled it.

515
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,960
That's not normal anymore.

516
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,640
Seems they've been involved for a while.

517
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,720
Back when Li Qingqing

518
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,750
poached me to TSI as director,

519
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,920
Tang Ling must have been scared,

520
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,880
so she teamed up with Chen Fang

521
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,240
and used you to take me down.

522
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,400
I see.

523
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,830
That's what happened.

524
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,350
They're definitely involved.

525
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,070
What are you doing?

526
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,510
Confront Tang Ling.

527
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,680
Sit down.

528
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,480
Sit down.

529
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:56,750
Sit!

530
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,400
You have no proof.

531
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,920
They'll never admit it.

532
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,270
Besides,
you're Tang Ling's subordinate now.

533
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,680
She can easily make things hard for you.

534
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,960
Remember,
just do your job normally at work.

535
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,830
Keep your distance from her.

536
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,790
So you're saying we should let it go?

537
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,510
They're in the light while we're hidden.

538
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,750
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

539
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,790
You're a heroine, Mom.

540
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,640
No.

541
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,750
You're the queen.

542
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,110
I'm the femme fatale.

543
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,680
Listen to me.

544
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,720
My goal is crystal clear now.

545
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,000
I want that car.

546
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,030
I said I want that car, hear me?

547
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,790
Everything else can wait,
I'm telling you.

548
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,400
I-I want the 30% sugar one.

549
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,000
Ling bought it.

550
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,070
Nice.

551
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,510
There's enough for everyone.

552
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,550
Xiaozhou.

553
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,440
You finally came.

554
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,000
Ling treated us to milk tea.

555
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,550
We were waiting for you.

556
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,110
Couldn't start without you.

557
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,000
How spoiled.

558
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,160
No, thanks.

559
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,310
You guys go ahead.

560
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,030
Refusing her kindness.

561
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,160
Silk-stocking milk tea.

562
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,590
Less sugar, less ice.

563
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,480
Is that okay?

564
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,830
You have no proof.

565
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,400
They'll never admit it.

566
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,680
Besides,
you're now Tang Ling's subordinate.

567
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,110
It'd be too easy for her
to mess with you.

568
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,160
Thanks.

569
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,790
Xiaozhou is our department's lucky star.

570
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,590
Everyone should learn from Xiaozhou.

571
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,350
Thanks for the milk tea, Ling.

572
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,590
Learn from Xiaozhou.

573
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,720
Alright, carry on with your work.

574
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,030
Let's dig in.

575
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:48,920
Thank you.

576
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,720
Here's yours with 30% sugar.

577
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,960
Sugar-free, please.

578
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,830
Sure, sure.

579
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,070
Ling.

580
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,590
He only takes it
when you hand it to him.

581
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,240
He's riding on his stellar performance,

582
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,400
keeping you under his thumb.

583
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,440
This just proves he feels untouchable.

584
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,000
That kid's completely unyielding now.

585
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,000
No hurry.

586
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,550
Everyone's got a soft spot somewhere.

587
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,030
Even if he's a stone,

588
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,070
I'll find a way to melt him down.

589
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,880
Young man.

590
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,400
Where's Mr. Chen?

591
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,680
My dad?

592
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,920
He took my grandma to the hospital.

593
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,240
I'm watching the stall for a few days.

594
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,880
You're Chen Laifu's son?

595
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:38,790
Yes.

596
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,960
Your grandma is sick?

597
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,960
My grandma, her...

598
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,920
Her leg hurts too much.

599
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,880
The doctor said
she needs joint replacement.

600
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,940
What?

601
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,110
Why didn't your dad tell me?

602
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,550
Don't know.

603
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,510
Which hospital?

604
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,350
The Traditional Medicine Hospital.

605
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,480
Mr. Chen, I'm at the hospital now.

606
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,270
Which department?

607
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,880
Radiology Department.

608
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,750
Radiology Department.

609
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,830
Radiology - I see it.

610
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,750
Radiology is just...

611
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,000
Are you inside?

612
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,160
Radiology.

613
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,920
I see you.

614
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,750
Over here.

615
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,480
Ms. Hu.

616
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,000
Mr. Chen.

617
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,240
Ms. Hu.

618
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,440
Didn't I tell you before?

619
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,110
If your mom gets sick,

620
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,070
contact me immediately.

621
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,590
Hello.

622
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,480
This is Ms. Hu.

623
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,830
Ms. Hu.

624
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,720
I'm here to
handle the compensation for you.

625
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,720
If I hadn't gone to your stall,

626
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,510
I wouldn't know.

627
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,590
That doctor mentioned

628
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,720
the artificial joint for mom,

629
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,790
if it's the regular kind,

630
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,350
the domestic-made one

631
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,680
would be covered by medical insurance.

632
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,590
It wouldn't need mom's special insurance.

633
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,510
So I didn't tell you.

634
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,240
Then why not get a better one?

635
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,240
Get her an imported joint.

636
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,270
Your insurance can fully cover it.

637
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,640
Really?

638
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,960
Would I lie to you?

639
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,070
I've processed claims for clients.

640
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,440
Got nearly 100K reimbursed.

641
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,270
Actually you're quite lucky.

642
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,880
Your policy happens to cover this.

643
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,590
Mom, that's...

644
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,830
That's wonderful, just wonderful.

645
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,920
Thank you so much, Ms. Hu.

646
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,680
Thank you.

647
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,200
Look.

648
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,830
If you hadn't told us,

649
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,880
we'd never have known

650
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,000
there's so much... to consider.

651
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,640
Are all the tests done?

652
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,240
Well... we'll do them shortly.

653
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:12,940
Oh.

654
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,790
Uncle, try this.

655
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,720
Uncle, Auntie.

656
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,270
Eat while it's hot.

657
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,510
I'm afraid there might be traffic later,

658
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,070
and we won't make it.

659
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,750
Here.

660
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:43,880
Auntie.

661
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,070
Here, you try some too.

662
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,160
It's really soft.

663
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,720
Zhiyuan.

664
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,270
Are you in such a hurry

665
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,960
to have your aunt and me

666
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,400
leave?

667
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,200
Uncle.

668
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,720
That's not what I meant.

669
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Before we go,

670
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,350
let me ask you.

671
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,640
How do you think I've treated you

672
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,110
since you were little?

673
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
Nothing short of perfect.

674
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,200
You've treated me

675
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,790
like your own son.

676
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,240
Do you remember

677
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,640
when you were short 20K

678
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,720
for your middle school?

679
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,160
Remember?

680
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,200
Of course not.

681
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I remember that year

682
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,830
my dad had just spent money

683
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,830
building a house for Grandma back home

684
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,680
and was temporarily short on funds.

685
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
He didn't have that much.

686
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,590
At that time,

687
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,880
it was you

688
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,070
who gave me 20K,

689
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,920
so I could continue my studies.

690
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,920
20K back then...

691
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:45,750
Here's what.

692
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,590
Uncle,

693
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,240
if you ever need my help,

694
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,350
just say the word.

695
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:51,720
Really?

696
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,750
Of course.

697
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,920
Don't say later.

698
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,750
I need your help right now.

699
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,110
Go ahead.

700
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,110
You see.

701
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,790
Your father and I are brothers.

702
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,880
You're his son,

703
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,070
and our own son

704
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,750
is your cousin.

705
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,270
Blood runs thicker than water

706
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,510
Your cousin's getting married.

707
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,550
But we're short on banquet funds.

708
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,920
The bride might call it off.

709
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:21,720
I...

710
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,000
I came to Shanghai for treatment.

711
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,400
Manli said insurance would cover it.

712
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,070
- Slow down. - Not a penny covered.

713
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,030
Alright.

714
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,110
I...I...

715
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,160
How do I explain this back home?

716
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,720
How will your cousin marry now?

717
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:42,750
Uncle.

718
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,400
Calm down.

719
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,240
I understand what you mean.

720
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,510
How much is still needed?

721
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,400
200K.

722
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,270
200K...

723
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,200
I...

724
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,350
Uncle, it's not that I won't lend you,

725
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,790
but when Manli and I separated,

726
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,510
I left everything I could

727
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,360
for her and our child.

728
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,480
Right now I've

729
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:12,820
Ah?

730
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Given them everything?

731
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,230
Right.

732
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,110
Then—then what about your new partner?

733
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,630
Right.

734
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,360
What?

735
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,670
Isn't your new partner some big boss

736
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,320
of a big company?

737
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,880
She must have money.

738
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,920
That's hers, not mine.

739
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,110
Not yours?

740
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,480
Fine!

741
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,800
Let's go, come on!

742
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,960
Let's just go.

743
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,760
Calm down!

744
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,030
Are you okay?

745
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,510
Take it easy

746
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,150
I...

747
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,960
I finally see it now.

748
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,070
He looks down on us poor relatives.

749
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,840
He's thriving now.

750
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,960
Take it easy.

751
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,880
You're an ungrateful

752
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,030
wretch!

753
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,710
Had I known you'd treat us like this,

754
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,840
forget about 20K,

755
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,510
I wouldn't give you a single cent.

756
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,960
Calm down.

757
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,920
Zhiyuan, what's wrong with you?

758
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,320
Say something!

759
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,630
You're gonna be the death of him!

760
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,800
Listen to me.

761
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,760
This- this concerns

762
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,800
your cousin's happiness.

763
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,400
And besides,

764
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,230
people should have some conscience.

765
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:10,880
Uncle, you...

766
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,440
Could you calm down first?

767
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,070
I'll

768
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,190
figure something out.

769
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,190
I'll find a way to get you

770
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,190
that 200K.

771
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,000
Alright?

772
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,000
Seriously?

773
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:23,550
Yes.

774
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,190
Then return the train ticket.

775
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,030
Wait, why return the ticket?

776
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,480
I'm not leaving.

777
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,590
I...

778
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
I'm staying till
you put cash in my hand.

779
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,440
Then I'll go.

780
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,190
I feel better with money in hand.

781
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,920
It's reassuring.

782
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:39,880
Alright.

783
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,030
So many dishes.

784
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,590
Let's eat.

785
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,400
It's fine.

786
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,550
Eat.

787
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,710
Have some food.

788
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,230
Some shrimp.

789
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,110
These shrimp are already peeled.

790
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,840
Let me have some shrimp.

791
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,550
Don't rush.

792
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,550
Ms. Qiu.

793
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,550
Professor Ding just called me.

794
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,510
Said you didn't answer his call.

795
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,070
Really?

796
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,190
I was in a meeting with Mr. Chen,
didn't notice.

797
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,440
Did he mention what it's about?

798
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,230
Something about
relatives from his hometown

799
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,110
running into some trouble.

800
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,550
Relatives from hometown?

801
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,880
Tell him I'm very busy now.

802
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,630
You handle everything on my behalf.

803
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:30,710
Yes.

804
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,230
Where's Ms. Qiu?

805
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,150
I need to speak with her
in person urgently.

806
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,360
Professor Ding.

807
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,510
Ms. Qiu is unavailable now.

808
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,630
She authorized me.

809
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,480
You can talk to me.

810
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,710
Here's the thing.

811
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,920
I want to

812
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,030
borrow some money from Ms. Qiu.

813
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,320
Borrow money?

814
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,000
And it's 200K all at once.

815
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,920
Right, said it's for his relative.

816
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,840
Ms. Qiu,

817
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,510
should we lend the money or not?

818
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,320
Professor Ding is waiting for my reply.

819
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,510
Sure.

820
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,400
This... this...

821
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,880
What an impressive building!

822
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,480
Exactly

823
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,480
Your significant other

824
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,230
works in this very building?

825
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,510
Yes.

826
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,400
On the 19th floor.

827
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,480
You said your partner is the boss.

828
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,320
I thought it was a small business.

829
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,190
This is a big company.

830
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,320
A real tycoon!

831
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,710
Yes.

832
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,150
They're doing major deals here.

833
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,150
Zhiyuan.

834
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,590
You're really something, amazing!

835
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,880
From now on,
your cousin will rely on you.

836
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,920
Sure, no problem.

837
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,630
Absolutely, yes.

838
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,510
Uncle, Auntie.

839
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,070
My partner's usually busy with work,

840
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,440
managing the whole company.

841
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,960
She can't spare time to visit you.

842
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,840
But today's perfect.

843
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,110
I'll introduce you to her, come say hi.

844
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,030
Alright.

845
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,880
This lobby

846
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,630
is huge!

847
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,510
So impressive.

848
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,230
Uncle, Aunt.

849
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:04,960
This way.

850
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,480
That's the door?

851
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,070
Yes.

852
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
Hello, 19th floor.

853
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,360
Okay, come in.

854
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,070
Okay.

855
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:12,920
This way.

856
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,630
Huang, we're not going to the office?

857
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,840
Ms. Qiu said to pay you first.

858
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,400
-Alright. - What a big company.

859
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,710
Uncle, let's get the money first.

860
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,590
Right.

861
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,400
Business first, get the money sorted.

862
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,000
Avoid unnecessary complications.

863
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,960
Don't say such crude things!

864
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,920
Such a big company

865
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,840
won't cheat us of 200K.

866
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,400
This way.

867
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,320
Fine, scolding me again.

868
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,030
So this...is the office area?

869
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,800
Yes.

870
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,280
We are...

871
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,360
Look, here and there too.

872
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,590
Professor Ding,
which card for the transfer?

873
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:45,590
Your bank card.

874
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,480
Here.

875
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:49,800
Here.

876
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,280
Thank you.

877
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,480
Okay.

878
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,480
Sorry to trouble you.

879
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,320
Please sign this loan contract first.

880
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,150
What?

881
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,110
Loan contract.

882
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,760
Simply put, it's an IOU.

883
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,510
Loan...

884
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,590
IOU?

885
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,480
Zhiyuan.

886
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,760
This IOU... isn't this...

887
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,230
your partner's money?

888
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,280
We're family.

889
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,760
Why need an IOU?

890
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,360
Yes, right.

891
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,510
Huang, what's going on?

892
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,110
Don't get it wrong.

893
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,320
This money belongs to the company.

894
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,510
Withdrawing funds

895
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,150
requires financial documentation.

896
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,710
I don't understand your policies.

897
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,800
I only know

898
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,000
we family borrowing some money

899
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,280
don't need an IOU, right?

900
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,400
Sir.

901
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,070
Even though we're family,

902
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,400
it's proper to write an IOU
when borrowing.

903
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,110
Otherwise there's no proof later.

904
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,880
Little girl, who do you think you are?

905
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,590
Is this your place to speak?

906
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,030
Uncle, Aunt, don't be angry.

907
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,630
The company has its own regulations.

908
00:39:59,150 --> 00:39:59,510
Well...

909
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:00,880
How about

910
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:01,880
you don't sign.

911
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:02,510
I'll do it.

912
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,000
I'll sign it.

913
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,590
Professor Ding.

914
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,920
This won't do.

915
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,710
The borrower must sign.

916
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,320
Um...

917
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,360
Uncle.

918
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,070
Just follow the procedure.

919
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,550
Please sign it.

920
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,920
Our son's banquet money
isn't settled yet.

921
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,550
Maybe...

922
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,230
We should just sign.

923
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,000
Sign it.

924
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,710
Don't turn the page.

925
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:05,670
Wait...

926
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,280
What does this clause mean?

927
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,030
Why is there interest?

928
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,190
This is even more outrageous.

929
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,280
How come it's due in just half a year?

930
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,030
What... what's going on here?

931
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:17,920
If company funds are

932
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,880
lent to private individuals
for no reason,

933
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,960
with no interest or repayment deadline,

934
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,960
the company audit won't pass it.

935
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,440
Uncle.

936
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,280
Don't worry about it.

937
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,320
Just sign it.

938
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:29,840
Sign it.

939
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,190
Once signed, you must comply.

940
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,550
Let me remind everyone.

941
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,070
Failure to repay on time,

942
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,230
the tax bureau will

943
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,480
levy 20% personal income tax

944
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,110
Twenty percent!

945
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,280
Ding Zhiyuan!

946
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,440
Uncle.

947
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,800
You... you can't manage this family.

948
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,440
I have my dignity!

949
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,190
I'm leaving!

950
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,920
No, seriously.

951
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,000
Uncle! You...

952
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,030
I...

953
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,760
- Auntie! - My card.

954
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,360
Auntie, you...

955
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,030
You're really...

956
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,670
Don't be angry.

957
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,400
Really...

958
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,280
Where's Qiu Lisu?

959
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,480
I must see her immediately.

960
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,230
Ms. Qiu is on a business trip.

961
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,070
Which way is downstairs?

962
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Which way should we go?

963
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:03,510
Uncle.

964
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:04,840
Uncle.

965
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,440
That way, go that way.

966
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,960
This way, right this way.

967
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,360
Zhiyuan, tell me.

968
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,190
What was all that farce?

969
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,030
Your uncle just had surgery.

970
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,550
He shouldn't get this worked up.

971
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,590
My partner is away on business.

972
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,550
It's all done by her subordinates.

973
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,760
Ding Zhiyuan.

974
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,400
I'm asking you one last time.

975
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:30,550
That 200K,

976
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,000
are you covering it or not?

977
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,840
Say something now.

978
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Yes or no?

979
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,800
I'll handle it, I definitely will.

980
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,030
Uncle, just rest assured.

981
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,630
I'll find a way to deal with this.

982
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,480
I'm giving you three days.

983
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,150
Three days.

984
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,440
Get enough money
for your cousin's banquet,

985
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,320
or don't bother about my life!

986
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,800
Zhiyuan said he'll handle it, enough.

987
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,150
Water.

988
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,840
Slowly, don't choke.

989
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,760
