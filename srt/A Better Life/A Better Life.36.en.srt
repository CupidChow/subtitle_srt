00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,030
Ms. Chen, don't worry.

197
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,080
I've run a test.

198
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,750
It's not a flu.

199
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,360
I just

200
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
talked too much

201
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,670
and worn out my throat.

202
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,320
You exhausted yourself.

203
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,000
You should rest more.

204
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,630
No worries.

205
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,960
Where was I?

206
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:15,840
Madam.

207
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,240
You were considering if

208
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,960
you're going to a nursing home.

209
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,390
It's not about

210
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,030
whether I go or not.

211
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,840
But if I live there,

212
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,320
what about Lulu?

213
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,150
Lulu?

214
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,670
Her pet parrot.

215
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,670
You can take

216
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,150
it with you there.

217
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,600
My son lives abroad.

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
In my retirement,

219
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,150
I want to travel the world.

220
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,870
Too expensive.

221
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,240
My mom's pension,

222
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,360
4,000 a month.

223
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,870
Now hospitals

224
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,670
are crowded.

225
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,630
I stay at a place for a few months.

226
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,320
My husband and I earn only salaries.

227
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,080
Manli.

228
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,720
We've been working for a week.

229
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,120
How about you take a break tomorrow?

230
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:19,960
I'm good.

231
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,840
Subway is across the road. Go home.

232
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,270
OK.

233
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,120
You won't leave?

234
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,550
Dong invited a few friends

235
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,270
who are DINKs.

236
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,390
I want to know

237
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,150
their needs in their retirement.

238
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,440
I'll be off.

239
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,200
OK.

240
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,630
Thanks.

241
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,320
This is Cai's case.

242
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,440
Mr. Jin.

243
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,750
I want to request an exception.

244
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,120
Can we add him onto the trial plan?

245
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,670
Touching story.

246
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,200
But rules are rules.

247
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,670
I know.

248
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,790
But Mr. Jin.

249
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,510
Actually,

250
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,670
Manager Yu has reported this to me.

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I trust you.

252
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,510
And I understand your

253
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,440
compassion.

254
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,630
But.

255
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,440
When emotions get in the way of rules,

256
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,030
you can't make another mistake.

257
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,270
You learned the lesson the hard way.

258
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,750
Rules are made to serve people.

259
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,270
Now we see someone in need

260
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,960
but watch and stand by?

261
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,080
I feel bad.

262
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,240
You're wrong.

263
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,080
Rules ensure fairness

264
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,120
in the most diverse way.

265
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,200
Look.

266
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,120
The cost as Tianyang

267
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,840
is tens of thousands a year.

268
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,720
How many could afford it?

269
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,320
Those who could

270
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,080
aren't necessarily willing.

271
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,840
You said to expand the silver economy.

272
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,630
I don't think

273
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,080
you aimed for money.

274
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,240
Mr. Jin.

275
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,000
I collected this data.

276
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,240
For instance, in Shanghai,

277
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,080
nearly 40% of

278
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,670
long-term residents are over 60.

279
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,630
They have various needs in retirement.

280
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,840
High-end nursing homes

281
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,150
are just a small part of them.

282
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,320
There's staying home,

283
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,030
traveling the world,

284
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,960
or living in a neighborhood.

285
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,360
In my surveys,

286
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,510
DINKs

287
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,360
even want to take care of each other.

288
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,790
If the firm

289
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,480
really want to expand silver economy,

290
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,550
we should

291
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,910
present various plans,

292
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,390
catering to our clients.

293
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,150
You

294
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
made all of this?

295
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,720
Yes.

296
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,720
Hard work.

297
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,550
Not enough.

298
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,240
Many raise their doubts.

299
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,600
But the management needs solutions.

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,910
Your solution is?

301
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,030
You mean...

302
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,200
How long will you take?

303
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,750
Soon.

304
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,480
I'll present it very soon.

305
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,630
Thank you.

306
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,840
Don't.

307
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,910
I haven't agreed yet.

308
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,150
Be wise before

309
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,870
you choose to be nice.

310
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,320
Understood.

311
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,550
Cai.

312
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,320
Did you tell your kids about yourself?

313
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,720
No.

314
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,630
You can be on your own now.

315
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,440
What about the future?

316
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,120
You need someone to look after you.

317
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,550
I've thought it through.

318
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,150
When my day comes,

319
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,320
I'll go to the funeral home

320
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,480
and write a will.

321
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,080
They can burn me when I'm gone.

322
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,870
I won't trouble anyone.

323
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,390
Knock on wood.

324
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,720
If I had known

325
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,670
your case earlier,

326
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,720
I would've made you buy a medical plan.

327
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,870
It's no use crying

328
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,000
over spilt milk.

329
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,550
I bought you a dehumidifier.

330
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,510
It's low-power.

331
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,080
Think you can run this at home.

332
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,960
I guess so.

333
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,270
Right.

334
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,550
I brought medicine.

335
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,480
Keep it. I took it from home.

336
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,750
Hu.

337
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Don't spend money on me.

338
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,750
I don't have time to enjoy myself.

339
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,240
If you don't want it,

340
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,720
throw it away.

341
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,030
It's heavy. I can't carry it.

342
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,270
I see now

343
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,510
you're a good person.

344
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,360
How about I go to your company

345
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,440
and explain?

346
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,440
I forged the medical reports,

347
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,240
not you.

348
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,360
It's OK.

349
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,510
It's OK?

350
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,510
The firm let you off?

351
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,480
Yes.

352
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,200
They'll help you.

353
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,670
I'm applying for you,

354
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,240
trying to add you onto the trial plan.

355
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,480
You're not lying, are you?

356
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,910
Why should I?

357
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,960
So now,

358
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,680
take care of yourself.

359
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,200
Hear me?

360
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,200
Wait for my news.

361
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,550
OK.

362
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,310
Where's power supply?

363
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,270
Plug it here?

364
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,480
Last Window of Life.

365
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,480
I want to use Cai's story

366
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,720
to promote Blue Ocean's

367
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,920
diverse elderly care service.

368
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,310
How's that?

369
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,070
Do you have

370
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,590
suitable influencers to collaborate?

371
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,550
Hey.

372
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,070
Values in this plan

373
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,830
matches those of

374
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,590
Zhiyuan's Philosopher's Talk.

375
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,270
If he proposes this to Kevin,

376
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,920
we can almost make it.

377
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,000
But you two are...

378
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,510
What?

379
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,750
He's my ex.

380
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,720
Can't we

381
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,070
be friends now?

382
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,000
It's just work.

383
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,640
I'm not guilty.

384
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,110
I can come to him myself.

385
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,550
I'll talk to him

386
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,310
about this plan.

387
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,880
You wrote this?

388
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,720
You don't think I can do this?

389
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,480
I just didn't expect

390
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,070
you to be so amazing.

391
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,400
Tell me yes or no.

392
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,310
Social welfare,

393
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,640
elderly care,

394
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,750
and benefits of all.

395
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,480
I'm

396
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,680
obliged.

397
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,070
I used to

398
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,000
hate these speeches.

399
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,680
Why do they sound like music now?

400
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,920
I became

401
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,350
the one I despised.

402
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,550
Are you OK?

403
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:51,960
I'm good.

404
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,640
Hold on.

405
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,720
My pharyngitis flares up.

406
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:01,880
Here.

407
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,110
Thanks...

408
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,750
OK now?

409
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,110
So you hide at school

410
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,680
to chase your old lover?

411
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,790
You misunderstood.

412
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,550
I came to him

413
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,200
for work.

414
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,550
See for yourself.

415
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,160
Manli's back at Blue Ocean.

416
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,440
They want to promote

417
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,510
a project

418
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,510
on my show.

419
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,830
You agreed?

420
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,720
Yes.

421
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,270
Good.

422
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,110
Excellent.

423
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,680
I pled and pled

424
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,070
and you declined

425
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,160
Zhig's promotion.

426
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,550
When it's your ex,

427
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,310
you agree so fast.

428
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,070
Between the two firms,

429
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,680
you chose Blue Ocean.

430
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,830
Did you?

431
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,750
It's different.

432
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,640
Between me and her,

433
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,270
you chose her.

434
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,510
Can you stop your nonsense?

435
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,070
Ding Zhiyuan.

436
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,830
I ask you one last time.

437
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,350
Me,

438
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,920
or her?

439
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,030
So I looked like this when I questioned him

440
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,510
in the park back then.

441
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,830
Hu Manli.

442
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,200
You waited for this, did you?

443
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,440
I'm sorry.

444
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,510
I never want to compete with you

445
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,750
to be his wife.

446
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,960
You're safe.

447
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,350
Stop acting.

448
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,240
It's OK.

449
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,240
Curse me if you want.

450
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,400
I've been betrayed.

451
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,350
I feel you now.

452
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,590
Stop.

453
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,350
Come back, Qiu Lisu.

454
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,830
You.

455
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,440
Come back.

456
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,440
Back.

457
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,310
Stop your tantrum.

458
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,750
I warn you.

459
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,270
Don't mess with her.

460
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,830
It's not what you think.

461
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,550
I've got work to do.

462
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:03,880
Go home.

463
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,920
OK.

464
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,510
Sure.

465
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,960
Thank you, Kevin.

466
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,160
Thanks...

467
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,720
Ning.

468
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,070
Where's your mom?

469
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,590
She's back late last night.

470
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,440
She even missed her clock.

471
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,240
Let her sleep.

472
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,000
Can you go to school alone?

473
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,200
Should I drive you?

474
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,720
I'm good.

475
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,550
I overslept.

476
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,550
Why didn't you wake me?

477
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,750
- What's with you
- Eat up!

478
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
You look so bad.

479
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,350
Running a fever?

480
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,030
No, my pharyngitis flares up.

481
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,790
No fever.

482
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,350
Good news.

483
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,030
Kevin called,

484
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,000
saying it was

485
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,110
a unanimous approval.

486
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,830
We'll collaborate by not only

487
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
promoting on Philosopher's Talk,

488
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,310
but also other shows.

489
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,270
If you need,

490
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,590
we'll do a large-scale campaign.

491
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,640
Really?

492
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,350
Great.

493
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,400
I'll tell Jin.

494
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,000
Dingding, go on.

495
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,070
I'll drive you.

496
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,070
I'll get washed.

497
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,200
I'll get you a sandwich.

498
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,550
Mom.

499
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,030
Manli.

500
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,000
Manli.

501
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,350
Mom.

502
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:16,960
Manli.

503
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,350
Mom.

504
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,920
Manli.

505
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,070
Daer, get her up.

506
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,000
I'll call an ambulance.

507
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,400
Mom.

508
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,790
Wake up.

509
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,440
Pay!

510
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,000
Pay!

511
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,640
Pay!

512
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,070
Come out.

513
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,750
Jump in here.

514
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,400
Pay!

515
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,350
Where you going?

516
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,640
What do you want?

517
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,440
Pay...

518
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,030
Run away?

519
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,000
Madam.

520
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,160
When will

521
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,160
you pay our wages?

522
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,880
The firm's in a tough position.

523
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,200
Finance Department will pay ASAP.

524
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,030
No money? We'll take your

525
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,030
valuables.

526
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,110
Let's do it.

527
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,110
You can't.

528
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,270
It's against the law.

529
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,350
I'll call

530
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,790
the police.

531
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,510
You can't.

532
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,270
The phone is worth something.

533
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:56,880
Give me.

534
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,790
Don't.

535
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,000
- No.
- Give me!

536
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,240
The phone...

537
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,000
Come carry this.

538
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Looks valuable.

539
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,160
Help me carry.

540
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,200
Valuables only.

541
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,750
We can do this, right?

542
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,750
Blood.

543
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,350
There's blood.

544
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,270
I beg you. Call an ambulance.

545
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,640
I can't lose my child.

546
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,880
Hurry. Go.

547
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,350
Go.

548
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,590
Go...

549
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,070
I beg you.

550
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,550
Leave it.

551
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,830
Your phone.

552
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,030
I didn't take a thing.

553
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,200
I'm fine.

554
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,640
Go back.

555
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,030
It's full of bacteria here.

556
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,030
Bad for your health.

557
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,030
Fine?

558
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,350
Pneumonia.

559
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,480
Manli.

560
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,110
Do you have a death wish?

561
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,830
I didn't have a fever.

562
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,750
I never knew it was this serious.

563
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,240
Xiaozhou.

564
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,640
How are you?

565
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,750
What happened?

566
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,070
I called him.

567
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,310
Feeling any better?

568
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,200
Dad.

569
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,510
Are you OK?

570
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,270
I called him.

571
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,480
You guys...

572
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,310
are my bestie

573
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,480
and my good boy.

574
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,270
Cover yourself.

575
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,590
Are you cold?

576
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,480
It's OK.

577
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,550
Want to eat something?

578
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,400
I'll get you some.

579
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,790
No appetite.

580
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:41,880
Thanks.

581
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,510
Nurse.

582
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,310
Nurse.

583
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:50,920
Nurse.

584
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,160
Is her IV drip running out?

585
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,960
Let me see.

586
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,750
Hu Manli, where's your family?

587
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,510
- What?
- What?

588
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,510
Who's her family?

589
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,270
Him, my son.

590
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,270
Me?

591
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,880
Miss Nurse.

592
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,510
You can tell me about her condition.

593
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,350
The doc said

594
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,200
your mom didn't have a fever

595
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,110
perhaps for she's in the early stage

596
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,680
or her immune system is weak.

597
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,200
If it's the latter,

598
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,480
you should later take note

599
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,640
if the patient has other

600
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,310
symptoms like having trouble breathing.

601
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:36,920
OK.

602
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,510
Yes.

603
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,070
OK.

604
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,110
Can I leave after this?

605
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:41,880
Yes.

606
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:42,880
Thank you.

607
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,720
I'm OK.

608
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,000
I booked a car. In five minutes.

609
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,350
It's fine.

610
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,270

Don't be afraid.

- Zhiyuan.

628
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm with you.

629
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,030
My baby.

630

My baby.

631

Don't fret.

632

Are you her family?

633
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,590
Yes.

634
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,550
I need to tell you something.

635
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,440
They baby's heartbeat rate is very low.

636
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,640
Be prepared.

637
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,790
I want my baby.

638
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,750
I want my kid.

639
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,110
I fully understand how you feel now.

640
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,960
We'll do our best to save the baby.

641
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,960
But prepare yourselves for the worst.

642
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,750
The baby is only 7 months old

643
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,590
but suffers a long fetal distress.

644
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,590
Chances of surviving

645
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,680
are low.

646
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,400
If you fully understand,

647
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,720

She's not young.

655
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,000
She might not have another baby.

Please.

733
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,030
Because I know

00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,440
our Shanghai branch

781
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,590
set up an Elder Care Department.

782
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,960
They came up with

783
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,510
this amazing project.

784
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,590
The promo video

785
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,190
Last Window of Life

786
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,510
represents our values in the new era.

787
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,030
From sales-oriented,

788
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,110
we turn into client-oriented.

789
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,150
A new chapter.

790
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,440
It also highlights

791
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,510
our social and industry

792
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,030
responsibilities.

793
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,440
Therefore, we have

794
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,400
Annual Outstanding Contribution Award

795
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,000
to honor colleagues expanding new

796
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,710
territories.

797
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,920
This award isn't about sales figures.

798
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,190
But it's the most valuable award

799
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,320
of Blue Ocean Life.

800
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,440
The award goes to

801
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,230
director of Elderly Care Department,

802
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,630
Ms. Hu Manli.

803
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,760
Give it up for her.

804
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,760
Now welcome Ms. Hu Manli

805
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,190
to receive her award.

806
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,960
Welcome.

807
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,840
Amazing.

808
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,030
You deserve it.

809
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,510
Congrats.

810
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,400
Thanks.

811
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,710
Thank you.

812
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,320
Thank you.

813
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,110
OMG.

814
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,920
I forgot what I have to say.

815
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,510
Manli.

816
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,280
You're the best.

817
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,710
We're always with you.

818
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,670
[Outstanding Contribution]

819
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,510
Thank you all.

820
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,400
Thought I'd lose sleep last night.

821
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,510
Turned out I slept pretty soundly.

822
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,280
This trophy

823
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,590
feels lighter than I thought.

824
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,800
When I moved,

825
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,550
I dumped all my trophies

826
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,960
and certificates.

827
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,360
I thought I no longer wanted

828
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,320
a good reputation.

829
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,110
But today,

830
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,960
I'm still thrilled to

831
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,880
be standing here.

832
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,840
I want to

833
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,760
thank the firm,

834
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,550
my boss,

835
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,320
and my dear clients.

836
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,280
Love you.

837
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,880
Bravo.

838
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
I almost got this award 2 years ago.

839
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,070
Then I told myself

840
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,550
that

841
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,070
if

842
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,110
I could stand here holding a trophy,

843
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,800
would that be the peak of my life?

844
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,000
Now I'm here.

845
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,400
I really think it's the peak of my life.

846
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,590
Amazing.

847
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,710
Beautiful.

848
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,360
You deserve it.

849
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,070
Well done.

850
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,480
Good job.

851
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,280
But I don't think I should say that.

852
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,510
It sounds like a curse.

853
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,070
Once you're at the highest,

854
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,110
the only road is downward.

855
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,670
I don't want to retire.

856
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,550
I want to work hard.

857
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,360
After this,

858
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,800
I will

859
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,920
serve my clients in a better way.

860
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,550
OK.

861
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,190
People asked me

862
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,590
why I wanted to sell insurance.

863
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,070
Because at that time,

864
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,000
I discovered I could

865
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,280
easily get along with people.

866
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,280
People trust me too.

867
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,320
They call people

868
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,440
like me, social butterflies.

869
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,630
Of course,

870
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,880
utilizing this skill,

871
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,920
I improved my life.

872
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,510
Then.

873
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,110
For some time,

874
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,960
I was getting ahead of myself

875
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,110
like a kite with a broken string.

876
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,280
I was so pleased with myself,

877
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,070
higher and higher.

878
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,960
But no kites with broken strings

879
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,070
could sustain long.

880
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,710
Next,

881
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,840
I plumped onto the ground.

882
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,360
Later in my life,

883
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,360
crises arose.

884
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,030
I got to know some people.

885
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,230
I started to see my work differently,

886
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,760
to see myself differently.

887
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,510
Now, through my job,

888
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,150
I can not only support my family

889
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,070
but also contribute to society.

890
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,960
What more can I ask for?

891
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,190
So told myself to

892
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,190
cherish what I do now.

893
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,280
I will work hard.

894
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,030
They say, "At forty, I had no doubts."

895
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,360
But today,

896
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,480
I still have many doubts.

897
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,320
At least, I figure one thing out.

898
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,320
A good life

899
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
requires material comforts

900
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,760
and inner peace.

901
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,670
I love my job,

902
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,400
my family,

903
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,840
my friends,

904
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,670
and last but not least, myself.

905
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,000
Well said.

906
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:03,960
Good job.

907
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,320
Bravo.

908
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,760
Cherish every moment present to

909
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,030
live your life.

910
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,510
Sorry.

911
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,840
I talked too much.

912
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,550
OK.

913
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:24,510
One last word for myself.

914
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,510
Hu Manli, you're the best.

915
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,590
Hu Manli.

916
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,030
You're the best.

917
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,440
Thank you.

918
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,510
Well done.

919
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:39,800
Thank you, everyone.

920
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,400
Thanks...

921
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,070
Another round of applause

922
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,280
for Hu Manli.

923
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,280
Amazing.

924
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,320

was amazing.

935
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,710

Yes.
