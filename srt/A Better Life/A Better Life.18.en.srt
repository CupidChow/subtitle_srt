00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,440
Thanks.

196
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,790
Fruit can wait.

197
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,240
Follow me.

198
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:47,870
Go on.

199
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,120
Time's ticking.

200
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,240
Hurry up.

201
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,910
Xiaozhou.

202
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,750
Can you lend me money?

203
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,150
Why?

204
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,510
You broke up without telling us.

205
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,030
Zhiyuan.

206
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,240
You ever take us seriously?

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,790
Let's not talk about that.

208
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:12,790
Zhiyuan.

209
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,480
Think about it.

210
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,670
Without your uncle Fugui,

211
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,360
you wouldn't have come this far.

212
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,440
Now you made it,

213
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,270
that's how you repay him?

214
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,510
It's not Zhiyuan's fault.

215
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,080
You should ask Manli

216
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,960
for Fugui's money.

217
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,120
Mom.

218
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,360
I told you.

219
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,630
Fugui

220
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,510
changed the policy on site.

221
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,910
It had nothing to do with Manli.

222
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,390
Don't listen to her story.

223
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,630
Fugui said

224
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,510
he bought the plan from

225
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,790
Manli's disciple.

226
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,960
Manli's smart.

227
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,240
She must've instructed

228
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,750
her disciple.

229
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,790
The way I see it,

230
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,510
she tricked Fugui on purpose.

231
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,360
But there's no other way.

232
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,600
All in all,

233
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,870
you took nothing

234
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,750
when you separated.

235
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,790
She took all the money.

236
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,080
She has to pay Fugui's bills now.

237
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,550
Mom.

238
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
I told you

239
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,510
why we broke up.

240
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,910
Now...

241
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,750
You handed in your salary, fine.

242
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,030
She keeps money from me and your dad.

243
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,480
You and Dad?

244
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,320
Tell me.

245
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,790
When we

246
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,670
received the relocation compensation,

247
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,960
I bought wealth investment products.

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
But I couldn't make a profit.

249
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,870
Manli asked me to buy insurance

250
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,270
with the rest 500,000 for Daer.

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,240
Something called Sail...

252
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,200
Sail to Future?

253
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,240
Yes.

254
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,720
She said it was for his education.

255
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,270
You remember?

256
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,030
Yes.

257
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,840
I don't care

258
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,150
if you divided things up fairly.

259
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,600
This 500,000 was for

260
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,200
our grandson.

261
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,240
Even if you separated,

262
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,200
shouldn't you

263
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,910
split the money reasonably?

264
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,720
You've given her the money.

265
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,630
Go ask for it.

266
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:03,870
Mom.

267
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,390
I'll think of other ways.

268
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,270
It's not just money.

269
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,080
It's about our family reputation.

270
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,750
What will Fugui think of us

271
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,910
if we fail to handle this?

272
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Your dad has been a teacher,

273
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,320
and I, an office lady.

274
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,910
People all think highly of us.

275
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,840
You don't work or live here,

276
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,390
but we're still around.

277
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,960
What will they think of us?

278
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,480
We care.

279
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,080
Yes.

280
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,750
That's what I was saying.

281
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,080
We can't let people

282
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,480
talk bad behind us.

283
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,360
OK.

284
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,960
I

285
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
see your point.

286
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,240
Gotta go.

287
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,600
What does your ex have

288
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,550
to do with you?

289
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,120
Why borrow money for him?

290
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,510
You're right.

291
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,000
But I kind of

292
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,240
bear the responsibility.

293
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,670
I pushed his uncle and aunt

294
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,550
into buying insurance.

295
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,150
Did you put a gun on their heads?

296
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,440
You just recommended.

297
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,000
Later they changed their plan.

298
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,390
You had nothing to do with that.

299
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,120
I mentored Chunlu.

300
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,630
I can't bear to

301
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,870
leave this matter unattended.

302
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,440
You still

303
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,840
love Zhiyuan?

304
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
What's wrong with you?

305
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,840
Don't insult me.

306
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,600
You're going?

307
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,790
Really has nothing to do with Zhiyuan.

308
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,960
We brokers

309
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,240
need to offer great service.

310
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,030
Right?

311
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,200
Even if it were

312
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,750
an average client,

313
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,750
I'd take care of them.

314
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,440
The same account on the agreement?

315
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,030
Yes.

316
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,440
Thousands is fine.

317
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,720
Millions is better.

318
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,840
Just paid my mom's bills.

319
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,150
I'll lend you 50,000.

320
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,270
Totally enough.

321
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:02,910
So much.

322
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,480
Listen.

323
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,510
I lend it to you,

324
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,870
not your ex.

325
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,320
I know.

326
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,360
For my sake.

327
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,390
OK, done.

328
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,150
Thank you.

329
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
[Tonghua University]

330
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,270
Ding.

331
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,840
I have something to tell you.

332
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,440
Come in.

333
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,510
How's your uncle Fugui doing?

334
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,030
Don't worry.

335
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,550
I came to you

336
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,390
just for his matter.

337
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,000
My parents' relocation compensation.

338
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,630
You invested it

339
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,750
in annuity for Daer?

340
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,440
Yes.

341
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,600
Can we withdraw the money?

342
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,390
It's not yet been 5 years.

343
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,790
The cash value will decrease.

344
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,000
Can we take out 200,000 first?

345
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,390
You want it for Fugui?

346
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,840
Yes.

347
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
But this money isn't for me.

348
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,360
Let's forget the added value.

349
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,360
They still help with studying abroad,

350
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,840
jobs and health care.

351
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
We both agreed when we bought the plan.

352
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,910
Dingding's in middle school.

353
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,600
He's going to continue studies

354
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,390
even abroad.

355
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,870
You need to plan

356
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,390
for his future.

357
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,480
I know

358
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,870
you have difficulties.

359
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,360
But I...

360
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,080
You know.

361
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,510
The department,

362
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,750
my agent company,

363
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
and my family.

364
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,390
I'm so torn apart.

365
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,720
I have no other ways.

366
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,150
Your new wife

367
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,440
won't help?

368
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,630
Can you stop talking like that?

369
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,550
What?

370
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,550
What's wrong?

371
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,600
Isn't it truth you have a new lover?

372
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,720
I told you

373
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,240
she was a sweet talker

374
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,390
who'd break your heart.

375
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,240
You didn't listen,

376
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,030
talking about real love.

377
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,670
Anyway,

378
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,390
you got the money from my parents.

379
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,600
You should return it.

380
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,390
What if I won't?

381
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,440
Zhiyuan, mind that

382
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,390
when we separated,

383
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,320
we distributed our assets clearly.

384
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,550
My parents have

385
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,790
the transfer records.

386
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,360
Give me the money.

387
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,480
Money?

388
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,550
OK, follow me.

389
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,320
I'll give you.

390
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,240
Come on.

391
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
No, where to?

392
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:00,840
Zhiyuan.

393
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,790
This is the last time I ask.

394
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
For your uncle,

395
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,270
you will force me for money?

396
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,920
Force?

397
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,920
It's supposed to be my family's.

398
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,240
Who will you

399
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,960
save, if I and Fugui fall into water

400
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,200
at the same time?

401
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,510
Not again.

402
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,400
Don't talk nonsense.

403
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,200
Let's talk about the money.

404
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,680
You were lucky last time.

405
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,480
You won't necessarily be saved now.

406
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,270
One more thing.

407
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
This water is shallow.

408
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,750
Even if you fall,

409
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,880
you won't drown.

410
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,510
What?

411
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,920
You're insane.

412
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,070
Ding Zhiyuan.

413
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
I told you you'd regret leaving me.

414
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,110
But I don't care anymore.

415
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,640
Remember.

416
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,920
You treaded on this path.

417
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,680
You're on your own.

418
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,680
From now on,

419
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,070
I won't be your safety net.

420
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,510
Even if you sink in mire,

421
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,880
I won't save you.

422
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,160
You're crazy.

Ms. Duan, how's my mom recovering?

442
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,350
Go to my office.

443
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,640
Ms. Duan.

444
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,920
Tell me the truth.

445
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,200
I take any

446
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,030
result.

447
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,270
Not that bad.

448
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,160
Xiaozhou.

449
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,880
She'll wake up later

450
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,310
than we expected.

451
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,240
Why?

452
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,110
Complicated.

453
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,200
We need further tests.

454
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,790
Of course.

455
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,960
Your mother has stayed in

456
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,240
a coma for long.

457
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,920
It's also an important factor.

458
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,640
Don't worry.

459
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,790
No news is good news.

460
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,070
OK.

461
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,480
Thank you.

462
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,110
Ms. Duan.

463
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,880
I'll go back my mom.

464
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,680
Thank you.

465
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,880
You're welcome.

466
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,480
Have water.

467
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,030
Thanks.

468
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,030
Calm down.

469
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,550
Mr. Lu is the best

470
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,720

00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,750

472
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,830
That's us.

473
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:32,720
Let's go.

474
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,960
OK.

475
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,110
You have family with you?

476
00:21:59,400 --> 00:21:59,830
Doc.

477
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,440
You can tell me anything.

478
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,350
It's best for your family

479
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,680
to hear what I'm about to say.

480
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,960
My parents are gone.

481
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,590
Are you married?

482
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,480
Any partner?

483
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,480
We separated.

484
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,000
Siblings?

485
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,880
I'm the only child in the family.

486
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,070
I don't have any close relatives.

487
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,160
That'll be hard.

488
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,310
Rest assured.

489
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,110
I'm prepared.

490
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,110
It's OK.

491
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,440
I have insurance,

492
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,550
medical assistant.

493
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,750
Don't worry about the charge.

494
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,440
I'll cooperate on your treatment.

00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,560
[Jun, let's talk.]

496
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
[Video call]

497
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,160
Jun.

498
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,000
Why are you here?

499
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,550
Why didn't you answer my texts?

500
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:16,880
Playing.

501
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,440
I have to go back.

502
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,680
I miss you.

503
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,640
I want to see you.

504
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,350
Let's talk.

505
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,960
I don't want to talk.

506
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,590
What's that attitude?

507
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,350
I asked for leave on your behalf.

508
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,310
Let's have dinner together.

509
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,960
Who asked you to do that?

510
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,240
I'll compete in a game.

511
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,590
Is that more important than Mom?

512
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,270
Yes. Even without a game,

513
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,310
I won't dine with you.

514
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,240
That's how you treat me?

515
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,400
You broke up,

516
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,680
you didn't want me.

517
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,030
From that day,

518
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,590
you're dead to me.

519
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,310
Don't come to me.

520
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,750
Pretend I don't exist.

521
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,720
Ms. Hu.

522
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,000

523
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:23,720

528
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,480

529
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,440
What's their need?

530
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,680
You'll know.

531
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,310
Come.

532
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,750
Over there.

533
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,550
It's the management?

534
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:42,920
[Office]

535
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,550
No...

536
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,720
You'll see.

537
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,400
Quiet.

538
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,720
So many people.

539
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,960
Shh.

540
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,750
Everyone, quiet.

541
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,350
Please.

542
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,510
- Let me introduce…
- Hi!

543
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,590
Ms. Hu.

544
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,590
Mr. Xue.

545
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,160
They're all

546
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,400
my friends at the market.

547
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,830
They all know about

548
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,750
my mom's matter.

549
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,750
So

550
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,590
they're interested in insurance.

551
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,030
But I don't know

552
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,880
the details.

553
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,720
So I invited you to

554
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,440
tell them.

555
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,750
They can consult.

556
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,750
No problem...

557
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,750
Ms. Hu.

558
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,030
What about my dad?

559
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,350
He has underlying health conditions.

560
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,110
Ms. Hu.

561
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,400
My wife had an appendectomy.

562
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,240
Can she buy a plan?

563
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,310
Ms. Hu.

564
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,960
Is the age limit 80?

565
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,200
You need to help me with it quick.

566
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,790
My mom turns 80 the next year.

567
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,590
And me.

568
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,640
Everyone, calm down.

569
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,590
Easy.

570
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,480
We'll go through one by one.

571
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:44,830
OK.

572
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,480
Since you're all here,

573
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,240
I'll answer every question.

574
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,510
Yes, keep in order.

575
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,510
Don't get all chaotic.

576
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,160
And after you ask,

577
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,830
you need to buy a plan.

578
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,880
If you don't,

579
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,440
if you don't,

580
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,590
you'll waste

581
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,110
their time.

582
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,720
Don't worry.

583
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,160
It's OK.

584
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,310
Let me tell you this.

585
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,880
I work here for 16 years.

586
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,790
You have to respect me for that.

587
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,640
I

588
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,070
promise

589
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,270
to you guys.

590
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,270
You can trust her products.

591
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,550
Give her the money,

592
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,110
and it's all set.

593
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,160
I appreciate it.

594
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,830
But only if you really need it.

595
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,720
You shouldn't waste your money.

596
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,240
We have plenty of time.

597
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,350
This is our job.

598
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,510
It's fine if you don't buy.

599
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,550
Don't feel pressured.

600
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,200
Not a bit.

601
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,160
OK?

602
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,880
I have only one request.

603
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:35,750
What is it?

604
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,270
When I get grocery,

605
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,830
you need to round the figure down.

606
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,200
Of course.

607
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,350
Not a problem.

608
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,270
Ms. Hu

609
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,830
is our VIP from now on.

610
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,310
I'll blame you if you fail

611
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,070
to serve her.

612
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,590
No.

613
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,790
Just kidding.

614
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,590
I didn't know there'd be so many people.

615
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,790
I didn't bring enough booklets.

616
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,240
Just browse through, OK?

617
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,160
Hand these out.

618
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,030
Come on.

619
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,310
Sit and tell us.

620
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,160
OK...

621
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,550
Come on.

622
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,160
Sit.

623
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,920
Please.

624
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,590
Take a seat.

625
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:11,830
Here.

626
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,750
Take a look.

627
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,790
Tell us what you think.

628
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,720
Come on.

629
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,310
Here.

630
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,880
We have many products.

631
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,750
See which suits your needs.

632
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,960
Savings plan, medical...

633
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,440
critical illness plans, you name it.

634
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,160
Take a look.

635
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,960
What a day.

636
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,350
But I'm happy.

637
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,920
How many deals have we made?

638
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,680
16.

639
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,110
But it's all small deals like accident,

640
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,030
medical plans.

641
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,720
They're all deals anyway.

642
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,790
In time,

643
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,960
as long as you continue serving clients,

644
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,310
small orders grow big.

645
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,480
You'll say this in your short video.

646
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,030
You secretly watched my vids?

647
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,400
No.

648
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,720
Let me teach you some values.

649
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,790
You know

650
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,920
when I feel happy the most?

651
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,480
When you have commission.

652
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,070
Wrong.

653
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,440
When clients have claims.

654
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,160
When they say thank you,

655
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,000
I feel like a lifesaver.

656
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,790
I make this world better.

657
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,110
You can't

658
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,240
buy that feeling with money.

659
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,680
So you're not

660
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
thinking about money all day?

661
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,350
I am.

662
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,830
I want money and to be a lifesaver.

663
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
How do you like your shrimp?

664
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,510
Shrimp,

665
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,240
however

666
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,270
you like.

667
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,680
I don't know how.

668
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,400
You'll cook.

669
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,030
I won't.

670
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,070
Let's play rock paper scissors.

671
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,350
Manli.

672
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,830
Zhiyuan told

673
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,880
us all.

674
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,200
He wants to help us.

675
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,680
But you took his

676
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,160
parents' money.

677
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
So we came to you.

678
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,750
Did he say I bought an annuity plan

679
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,070
with it for our kid?

680
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,240
You have the money.

681
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,110
Only you know how

682
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,590
you spend it.

683
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,920
I can show you the policy.

684
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,480
Don't give me that stuff.

685
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,550
They're all fake.

686
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,830
You're a broker.

687
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,200
I can't tell if you trick us.

688
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,160
Yes.

689
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,000
Well,

690
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,160
if you hadn't

691
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,720
pushed us into buying the insurance,

692
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,200
we wouldn't be here.

693
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,920
Right?

694
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,510
At the end of the day,

695
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,440
even without the insurance plan,

696
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,750
my uncle would still have gotten sick.

697
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,310
You.

698
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
That's how you talk?

699
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,270
Shut up.

700
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,920
You know how they say in our hometown?

701
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,830
Why buy insurance when you're all good?

702
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,310
Isn't it casting a curse?

703
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,920
I got sick because of that curse.

704
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,830
The doc said

705
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,960
his illness

706
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,590
isn't necessarily curable.

707
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,070
If we had known

708
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,550
there would be no claims,

709
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,270
we wouldn't have treated it.

710
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,030
What was the point?

711
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,550
We wouldn't have bought your plan.

712
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,310
Yes.

713
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,400
Is it of any use?

714
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:19,960
Listen.

715
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,720
This is your doing.

716
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
It's all your fault.

717
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,680
We don't ask much.

718
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,790
You and Zhiyuan separated

719
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,400
and he gave you everything.

720
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,590
You only need to take out the money

721
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,640
his parents left you.

722
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:32,750
Yes.

723
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,960
What if I won't?

724
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,350
We're not leaving.

725
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,270
Manli.

726
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,720
What is

727
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,480
your relation with that guy?

728
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,310
Who is he?

729
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,550
Not your concern.

730
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,440
You're guilty.

731
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,680
What do you mean?

732
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,960
Manli.

733
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,000
I was trying to get

734
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,790
you and Zhiyuan back together.

735
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,270
Turns out

736
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,830
you're unfaithful.

737
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,550
Uncle Fugui.

738
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,960
I respect you guys

739
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,270
since you're senior.

740
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,350
If this nonsense continues,

741
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,000
don't blame me for being rude.

742
00:32:59,510 --> 00:32:59,790
You.

743
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,720
Manli.

744
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,310
You're a single mom.

745
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,590
You live with a young guy.

746
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,640
It's wrong no matter how you see it.

747
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,510
I broke up with Zhiyuan.

748
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,920
And he cheated on me.

749
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,000
No way.

750
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,000
Zhiyuan is a nice guy.

751
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,830
You must've

752
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,510
mistreated him,

753
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,000
driving him away.

754
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:25,920
I see.

755
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,270
That's your plan.

756
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
[Manli]

757
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,400
Zhiyuan.

758
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,960
Your uncle is kicking up a ruckus here.

759
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,400
Please take them away.

760
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,750
Manli.

761
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,960
You did this to him.

762
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,240
Clean up the mess.

763
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,720
Take responsibility.

764
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,000
You want fruit?

765
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,880
Did you call the police?

766
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,280
Trespassing you say?

767
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,150
I didn't.

768
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
It was me.

769
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,070
Officers.

770
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,150
This way.

771
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,800
These too.

772
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,760
Trespassing.

773
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,920
They even want to stay.

774
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,320
Officers.

775
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,000
This is between family.

776
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,400
You.

777
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,190
What do you want?

778
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,840
Misunderstanding.

779
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,070
She's my niece-in-law.

780
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,590
This is our home.

781
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,280
I broke up with her nephew long ago.

782
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,400
We're not related.

783
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,510
She owes us money.

784
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,110
And she keeps a man.

785
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,760
Will you mind your manners?

786
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,550
You gigolo.

787
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,190
You won't admit?

788
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,070
Stop.

789
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,360
You have a debt dispute.

790
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,150
Take it to court.

791
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,190
It's illegal to stay at others'

792
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,070
houses by force.

793
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,400
Please leave with your belongings.

794
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,280
I just had a heart surgery.

795
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,400
Who will touch me?

796
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,840
See?

797
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,230
Medical certificate.

798
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm not bluffing.

799
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,880
If anything happens to him,

800
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,960
both of you

801
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,320
will be held accountable.

802
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,670
It's OK.

803
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,150
Water.

804
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,800
- Dingding.
- What's this?

805
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,880
Grandpa Fugui?

806
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,150
What's going on?

807
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,590
And

808
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
police officers.

809
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,070
Go to your room.

810
00:35:59,400 --> 00:35:59,760
It's OK.

811
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,590
What's wrong?

812
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,590
Come out later.

813
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,800
Stay in now.

814
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,110
Officer,

815
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,440
I don't owe them.

816
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,840
I broke up with my ex-husband.

817
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,030
This is my house.

818
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,760
They have no rights to stay.

819
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,440
Please make them leave.

820
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,360
Let's talk somewhere else.

821
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,960
He had a surgery.

822
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,190
Needs to be stable.

823
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,320
Though it's wrong for him to stay,

824
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,030
if you drive him away

825
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,110
and something happens,

826
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,230
you'll be responsible.

827
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,880
You're family.

828
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,710
How about this?

829
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,000
You all take a step back.

830
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,550
Talk with each other.

831
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,360
If you can't talk it through,

832
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,070
come to us.

833
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,710
Then...

834
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,800
You called us, right?

835
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,000
Sign here.

836
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,400
OK, we'll be off.

837
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,590
Bye.

838
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,630
They left?

839
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,440
Manli.

840
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,400
Forget the police.

841
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,360
We're not afraid of you.

842
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,800
No one can drive us

843
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,070
away.

844
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,480
Turn on the TV.

845
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,510
News program is about to begin.

846
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,480
What's your plan?

847
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,190
Officers are right.

848
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,030
He had a surgery.

849
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:46,920
We can't provoke him.

850
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,480
So we let them stay?

851
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,630
Use your brain.

852
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,920
Let me think.

853
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,710
What do they care the most?

854
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,280
Money?

855
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,230
Reputation?

856
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,550
Yes.

857
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,550
Got it.

858
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,510
Reputation.

859
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,150
Get Dingding.

860
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,000
We'll eat outside, my treat.

861
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
No plan tonight?

862
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,070
I'll wring my head off.

863
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:20,590
Tsk.

864
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,030
They think I'm a pushover.

865
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,510
Where's the toilet?

866
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,070
Dingding.

867
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,190
That's how we do it.

868
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,510
I'll leave the poster to you.

869
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,280
Will we go too far?

870
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,000
They did it first.

871
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,710
Prof. Ding is Daer's dad.

872
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,550
A public figure.

873
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,480
With this...

874
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,480
Stop.

875
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,880
I don't care how they think.

876
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,280
I cared for them,

877
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,030
and they blame me now.

878
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,880
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

879
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,880
OK, problem solved. Dig in.

880
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,740
[Connection failed]

881
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,000
Wait.

882
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,710
Do your uncle's laundry too.

883
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,280
Together.

884
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,880
Together.

885
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,710
You.

886
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,280
Isn't is just laundry?

887
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,320
What's wrong with TV?

888
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,030
No signal.

889
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,070
Hey.

890
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,400
Help me.

891
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:54,880
Hurry.

892
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,360
Morning news about to start.

893
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,480
I need to keep a record.

894
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,840
I can't miss that.

895
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,060
[Connection failed]

896
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,630
It...

897
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,000
Why is there no signal?

898
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,590
I didn't pay cable fees.

899
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,550
Pay then.

900
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,000
I don't watch TV.

901
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,360
Pay if you do.

902
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,110
This is my hobby.

903
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,920
I watch news.

904
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,440
What if there's a new conference?

905
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,920
Ministries will attend.

906
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,840
Big deal.

907
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,000
I can miss it.

908
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,800
You take part in too?

909
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,880
I don't.

910
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,840
I have to know the details ASAP.

911
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,320
What does it have to do with you?

912
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,030
You think

913
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,320
the world will stop without you?

914
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,710
I can't get it.

915
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,920
Since you're that capable,

916
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,440
why are you asking money from me?

917
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,590
You couldn't see the economy clearly

918
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,670
so you bought the plan for the benefit

919
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,670
of a few bucks?

920
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:54,880
Hey.

921
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,110
You.

922
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,280
That's how you talk to seniors?

923
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,190
You ever act like a senior?

924
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,510
You lent Zhiyuan 20,000 back then,

925
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,230
and you request a tremendous interest.

926
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,360
What?

927
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,480
Without your money,

928
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,150
he couldn't have made it?

929
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,000
He probably could've done better.

930
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,400
Then you wouldn't have to

931
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,630
beg for me to turn on the TV.

932
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,800
Manli.

933
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,840
Don't go overboard.

934
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,230
You swindled money out of Zhiyuan

935
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,840
and keep a man.

936
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,320
You think you're justified.

937
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,110
You just have to make

938
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,230
me curse you.

939
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,800
If you have time,

940
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,840
keep your own man in control.

941
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,230
Hey, who are you talking to?

942
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,920
Respect.

943
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,800
I'll...

944
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
Let me remind you.

945
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,190
Smash it.

946
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,510
That fruit bowl

947
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,710
is worth hundreds.

948
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,670
The floor, foreign materials.

949
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,920
Once the value

950
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,150
exceeds 5,000.

951
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,880
I can file a case.

952
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,630
Intentional damage.

953
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,320
This is not your hometown.

954
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,710
Officers aren't your connections.

955
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,190
They'll arrest you.

956
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,760
Put down.

957
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,510
She's trying to

958
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,360
piss us off.

959
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,920
Nearly fell for that.

960
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,710
I can wash by hands.

961
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,880
Wash it clean.

962
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,030
Manli.

963
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,630
You're too young to

964
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,670
win us.

965
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,230
Honey.
