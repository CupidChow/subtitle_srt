40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Episode 31

41
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,200
That's 320.

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:43,840
There.

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,150
Okay.

44
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,510
Thank you.

45
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,070
Thank you.

46
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,870
No wonder Ms. Yan suddenly
asked me about you.

47
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,560
The world is so small.

48
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,840
My dad

49
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,280
actually found you guys
to help him with money matters.

50
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,200
Thanks you for putting in
a good word for us with Mr. Li.

51
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,480
That's why your father
was willing to give us this opportunity.

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,760
Manli, don't go easy on him.

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,310
Take him for all he's worth.

54
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,960
If you can't handle it,

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:09,960
I'll do it.

56
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,000
To close this deal with your father,

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,120
we need your approval.

58
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,280
We can't just
take advantage as we please.

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,030
Miss Li.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,280
- It's... - Just call me Yuki.

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,840
Yuki.

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,080
Here's the thing.

63
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,360
Your father wants to
set up a family trust.

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,710
This concerns you.

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,590
So we came

66
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,000
to hear your thoughts.

67
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,430
I have no objections.

68
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,750
His lousy company,
whoever wants it can have it.

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,030
Your father cares deeply about you.

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,080
He's already thinking about
your marriage and children.

71
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,000
Thinking way ahead.

72
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,590
Can't scheme against me,

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,590
so he's scheming against
my future children.

74
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,400
What do you mean by that?

75
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,680
You're already 27.

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,910
Any prospects?

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,910
Yes.

78
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,310
North, south, east, west.

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,030
Plenty of directions.

80
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,080
If there's someone, hurry up then.

81
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,840
Look at me. When I was your age,

82
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,750
I'd already had my son.

83
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm 39 now.

84
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,630
Dingding is 13.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,710
In a few more years,
he can look after a retired me.

86
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,030
Manli.

87
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,120
You sound like

88
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,190
the women at the matchmaking event.

89
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,560
Are you rushing me into marriage?

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,870
Anyway,

91
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,360
I'm not having kids.

92
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,750
Li...

93
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,560
Yuki.

94
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,400
Here's thing.

95
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,310
The core design of this family legacy

96
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,470
is the successor.

97
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,400
Your father actually deeply respects

98
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,150
that you have your own career.

99
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,120
Since you don't want to
inherit the company,

100
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,710
we discussed

101
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,710
and came up with a solution.

102
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,280
While Mr. Li is still fit,

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,280
you should find someone suitable
whom you love,

104
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,280
and who, of course, loves you back.

105
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,430
Marry him and have children.

106
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,750
This way,

107
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,360
Mr. Li can directly
train the third generation

108
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,400
as successors.

109
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,520
Right?

110
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,630
I understand now.

111
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,750
What Mr. Li means is

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,190
he messed up raising me,

113
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,390
so he wants me to
create a kid for him to train.

114
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,800
No. It's not like that.

115
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,680
Not at all.

116
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,000
What he just said was a terrible idea.

117
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,480
Yes.

118
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,510
Don't overthink it.

119
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,480
Your father

120
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,190
is making plans for the family, you know.

121
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,390
Manli.

122
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,390
You don't know my family situation.

123
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,830
Don't take the blame for him.

124
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,000
In Li Fendou's whole life,

125
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,720
he's only fought for himself.

126
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,630
Talking about doing it for the family.

127
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,870
My mother's been gone for years.

128
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,680
I am

129
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,190
practically invisible at home.

130
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,270
All these years,
this home only had himself.

131
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,070
Hello?

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,510
Didn't we agree on 80K?

133
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,190
Why is it 100K now?

134
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,160
This is extortion!

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,430
The second landlord?

136
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,950
Manli, you're right.

137
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,630
This person is just a scoundrel.

138
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,720
At first we agreed on 500 a month.

139
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,270
Then it became 80K a year.

140
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,630
I barely managed to scrape enough money
from friends

141
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,120
and took out some online loans,

142
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,000
now he's demanding 100K.

143
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,310
You took online loans?

144
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,600
Let me tell you,
that's a big no no.

145
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,600
Haven't you seen the news online?

146
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,630
It's terrifying.

147
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,950
For such a small amount,

148
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,720
ask your father for help.

149
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
I'd rather borrow from loan sharks

150
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,040
than go to him.

151
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:37,950
Why?

152
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,560
Using his money
means being under his control.

153
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,600
No way.

154
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,360
Yuki.

155
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,270
If you want to
keep this little shop running,

156
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,070
you need to solve
the second landlord issue.

157
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,040
Online loans are absolutely
not an option.

158
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,830
Your father is

159
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,310
currently the most direct way

160
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,800
to solve your problem.

161
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,070
Manli.

162
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,160
Do you know why
I opened this little shop?

163
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,680
Tell me.

164
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,480
After Mom passed away,

165
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,480
I missed her terribly.

166
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,190
I missed the old days

167
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,360
when our family was together.

168
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,720
But Dad just got busier and busier.

169
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,070
He spent money

170
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,430
to stuff me into some

171
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,000
boarding high school in another city.

172
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,430
I could only come back once a month.

173
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,510
Sometimes he's not even home.

174
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,870
After that,

175
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,750
I went abroad.

176
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,630
I returned during New Year.

177
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,600
The house was bustling with
New Year visitors.

178
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,720
I wanted to talk with him.

179
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,510
But he had no time.

180
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,920
Later,

181
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,510
I stopped having
any expectations of him.

182
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,720
I just treated him as non-family.

183
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,870
Now,

184
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,270
this little shop

185
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,510
is my only solace.

186
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,870
So,

187
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,630
after graduation,

188
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,560
I first worked in sales

189
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,870
to gain some experience

190
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,160
and save capital for my dreams.

191
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,240
Does Mr. Li

192
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,600
know about this matter?

193
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,430
He doesn't want to know.

194
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,310
He just thinks I'm being willful.

195
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,870
That's your perception.

196
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,720
You feel

197
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,920
your father doesn't
understand you enough.

198
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:05,920
But have you

199
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,750
ever truly tried to
understand your father?

200
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:14,920
Yuki.

201
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,070
Find an opportunity

202
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,000
to have a good talk with your dad.

203
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,240
You share your thoughts

204
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,750
and listen to his too.

205
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,190
Between father and daughter,

206
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,360
what could be so hard to resolve? Right?

207
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,630
What if he still doesn't understand?

208
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,200
Other things aside,

209
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,720
if he refuses to help in dire need,

210
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,270
I won't take his money either.

211
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,720
I'm on your side.

212
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,870
Come eat first.

213
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,960
The food's getting cold.

214
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,200
My heart is even colder.

215
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,240
What should we do now?

216
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,550
Perhaps,

217
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,910
we can only

218
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,910
work it out through Yuki.

219
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,270
Get her to compromise.

220
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,550
But you saw her attitude today.

221
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,510
Completely unreceptive.

222
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,510
Easily provoked.

223
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,270
She hasn't yet come to terms
with reality.

224
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,440
But

225
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,750
this takes time.

226
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,870
So we need to

227
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,510
wait a little longer.

228
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,720
Wait?

229
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,200
Wait until when?

230
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,840
Can Li Fendou have this patience?

231
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,080
He might drop you
and bring in someone else.

232
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,080
Very soon.

233
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,320
You see.

234
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,390
The sub-landlord
is demanding 100K from her.

235
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,750
She can't come up with the money.

236
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,750
Her little shop will face
forced demolition.

237
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,120
Her mental state will collapse.

238
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,510
When that time comes,

239
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,360
we'll approach Yuki again.

240
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,550
Should be able to achieve our goal easily.

241
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,390
But you heard what Yuki said today.

242
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,960
She'd rather take online loans

243
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,870
than ask her father for help.

244
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,240
She also said

245
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,750
she opened this little shop

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,550
to fulfill her childhood dream.

247
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,630
But she lacks the ability
to realize her dream,

248
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,670
For her,

249
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,080
the best way

250
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,630
is to accept Li Fendou's arrangement.

251
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,360
Li Fendou is doing what's best for her.

252
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,510
What's best for her?

253
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,620
Yes.

254
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,790
What's best for her?

255
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,000
Does that mean she should
abandon her dreams?

256
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,120
Does that mean her life
can be arranged at will?

257
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,240
No, don't be emotional about this.

258
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,510
I don't agree with your approach.

259
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,510
How about this?

260
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,390
You step away from

261
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,200
this matter for now.

262
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,720
I said I don't agree.

263
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,870
But now I'm the one calling the shots!

264
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:57,720
I...

265
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,120
Hu Manli.

266
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,510
I know Yuki's original intention
for opening the shop

267
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,270
is truly touching.

268
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,870
I also know you're
a person of sentiment and principle.

269
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,120
But

270
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,150
you have to
think for yourself sometimes.

271
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,320
If this deal falls through,

272
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,150
you'll have to leave.

273
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,360
What about Daer?

274
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,550
Don't you want to bring him home?

275
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,320
Mr. Hu is in the nursing home with

276
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,750
tens of thousands in monthly expenses.

277
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,870
I understand this situation
better than anyone.

278
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,510
Listen to me.

279
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm doing this for your own good.

280
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,000
For my own good?

281
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,080
That gives you the right to force me

282
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
to do something
my conscience can't accept?

283
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,390
How is this any different from
Li Fendou's methods?

284
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,630
What's wrong with that?

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,630
If I'm like him,

286
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,390
it's because you and Yuki

287
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,440
are immersed in your own narratives.

288
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,870
Moved by yourselves,

289
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,000
completely disregarding reality.

290
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,360
Reality?

291
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,240
I never thought

292
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,320
the day would come when
Xue Xiaozhou lectures me about reality.

293
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,000

Even if one day,

298
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,510
Yuki and I reach desperate straits,

299
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,080
that doesn't mean

300
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,960
we should abandon our convictions.

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,030
Is it principal-guaranteed?

386
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,150
Of course.

387
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,960

No, you really spoke well.

514

515
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,200
If I didn't think you spoke well,

516
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,510
I won't waste time taking notes.

517
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,350
Don't you agree?

518
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,790
So you agree with everything then?

519
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,310
Let me ask you one thing.

520
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,310
Professor Zeng,

521
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,510
have you ever sold insurance yourself?

522
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,510
Have you ever dealt with clients?

523
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,350
I'm engaged in research work.

524
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,160
Then I know exactly
where the problem lies.

525
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,030
You've never sold insurance yourself

526
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,790
nor dealt with clients.

527
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,400
So when you talk about insurance,

528
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,830
it always feels like there's a barrier.

529
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,200
Must one personally sell insurance
to discuss it?

530
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,550
You can discuss it.

531
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,350
But

532
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
you won't hit the key points.

533
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,480
That's enough.

534
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,880
So in your opinion,

535
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,240
what counts as hitting the key points?

536
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Let's hear your brilliant views.

537
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,160
The insurance we're discussing now

538
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,920
came from overseas.

539
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,590
In Foreign families and Chinese families,

540
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,350
the relationships between
parents and children

541
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,510
and the concerns
are completely different.

542
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,510
Let me introduce myself first.

543
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,750
I've been in the insurance industry

544
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,160
for 20 years.

545
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,030
Over these years,
I've dealt with all kinds of clients.

546
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,400
For example, I had one client

547
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,200
who got divorced from her husband.

548
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,350
To prevent this from
affecting their child,

549
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,550
they actually kept it hidden
for 20 years.

550
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,240
I have another client.

551
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,960
Because of an illegitimate child
from a previous relationship

552
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,400
he feared it would damage
his professional reputation,

553
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,070
including his relationship
with his current family,

554
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,110
so his requirements for confidentiality work

555
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,240
are extremely high.

556
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,440
I even have a client

557
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,270
who's seriously ill.

558
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,400
She wants no treatment.

559
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,440
She wants to commit suicide.

560
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,480
Before she dies,

561
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,350
she wants to
leave all her money to her son.

562
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,720
As for me,

563
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,200
I can't say anything noble.

564
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,880
I understand all the principles.

565
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,790
But I think

566
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,830
when it comes to actual operations,

567
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,640
selling insurance is like

568
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,590
doing math problems.

569
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,550
If you only attend classes
but don't practice,

570
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,790
you won't get good results.

571
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,310
That statement is very accurate.

572
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:53,720
Yes.

573
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,750
Practical and realistic.

574
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,200
I was on the phone.

575
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,000
I disturbed you.

576
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,110
It was really my fault.

577
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,920
But I was too worried.

578
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,270
Because

579
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,400
I've encountered another
difficult problem.

580
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,960
I finally came up with a solution,

581
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,880
but the answering time is running out.

582
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
If I

583
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,680
offended you, I'm sorry.

584
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,110
I apologize and bow to you.

585
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,720
But I really have to go now.

586
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,400
Sorry.

587
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,110
Sorry.

588
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,880
Why did she just leave?

589
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,240
That was quite well said.

590
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,110
Tao.

591
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,440
Tao.

592
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,510
Manli, you're here.

593
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,830
Are you free now?

594
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,440
The boss is here too.

595
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,240
Let me tell you about the policy.

596
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,000
Please come inside.

597
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,440
Okay.

598
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,110
It's too dirty here.

599
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,830
Come on in.

600
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,960
What a beautiful car.

601
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,310
Come on in.

602
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,590
Come.

603
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,110
You guys sit.

604
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,680
I'll wash my hands.

605
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,590
They're dirty.

606
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Have a seat inside.

607
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,920
Please sit inside.

608
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,350
Come.

609
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,310
Don't trouble yourself.

610
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,510
- Thank you. - Have some water.

611
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,270
Thank you.

612
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,160
Thank you.

613
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,920
Thanks.

614
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,790
Here.

615
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,000
The signal was bad
in the venue earlier.

616
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,310
What I wanted to tell you is

617
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,270
the plan I made for you,

618
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,680
the key isn't about the returns.

619
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,270
Rather, this insurance policy

620
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,350
belongs entirely to your daughter.

621
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,070
What do you mean?

622
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,920
Is your daughter getting married soon?

623
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,310
Yes.

624
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,440
Let me ask something
perhaps inappropriate.

625
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,960
Are you not

626
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,110
very satisfied with this son-in-law?

627
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,550
Even outsiders can tell.

628
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,550
This son-in-law of mine

629
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,240
appears gentle and refined
on the surface.

630
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,110
but I've heard from others.

631
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,750
He has a gambling habit.

632
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,350
While I'm still alive,

633
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,480
he doesn't dare show his true colors.

634
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,750
But if I were to die,

635
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,830
and this money falls into his hands,

636
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,000
he'd just gamble it all away.

637
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,270
You should have told us earlier.

638
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,440
To tell you the truth,

639
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,200
their marriage,

640
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,790
I originally didn't agree to it.

641
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,400
But my son-in-law played dirty.

642
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,720
He got my daughter pregnant already.

643
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,440
As for my daughter,

644
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,110
she insists on keeping the baby.

645
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,480
I had no choice.

646
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,510
I had to agree.

647
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,070
What a disgrace.

648
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,960
I didn't know how to tell you.

649
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,110
Tao, don't scare yourself like this.

650
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,960
They have children now.

651
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,720
It's still a happy thing after all.

652
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,240
Right?

653
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,110
If he settles down properly
after marriage,

654
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,310
lives honestly,

655
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,750
and treats your daughter well,

656
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,550
that's all that matters.

657
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,030
But I feel unsure inside.

658
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,440
My daughter is no match for him.

659
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,880
So Tao,

660
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,070
I just wanted to tell you.

661
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,920
You should buy life insurance.

662
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,400
Should the things
you worry about happen,

663
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,750
from a legal perspective,

664
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,880
this money would completely
belong to your daughter,

665
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,750
counting as pre-marital assets.

666
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,510
It seems

667
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,000
this might not work either.

668
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,640
My son-in-law gambles.

669
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,680
I've only heard rumors.

670
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,110
The young couple gets along well now.

671
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,550
If my son-in-law finds out

672
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,440
he gets nothing,

673
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,510
he'll definitely argue with my daughter.

674
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,750
In the end, my daughter will suffer.

675
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,000
You're also worried about that?

676
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,240
How about this?

677
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,680
You can buy an annuity trust.

678
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,590
This way,

679
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,310
it won't hurt
the young couple's relationship.

680
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,920
The terms in the contract

681
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,350
can also ease your concerns.

682
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,720
The best of both worlds.

683
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,200
That sounds wonderful.

684
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,070
But I just bought
wealth management products.

685
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,160
See, I even brought the oil over.

686
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,110
No problem then.

687
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,750
How long can you redeem the money?

688
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,590
I bought a one-year product.

689
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,640
I can't refund it now.

690
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,200
Manli.

691
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

692
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,310
It's fine.

693
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,030
How about this?

694
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,030
I'll set up your

695
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,240
plan for now.

696
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,270
One year will soon pass.

697
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,830
When your product matures,

698
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,310
you can come buy the insurance.

699
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,310
That works.

700
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
I'll definitely
buy from you a year later.

701
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,200
You prepare the plan first.

702
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,480
Okay.

703
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,310
Xiaozhou.

704
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,510
About Li Fendou's family matters,

705
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,350
I don't want to delay any longer.

706
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,310
Do you want to go

707
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,000
persuade Li Fendou

708
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,030
to give up
his life arrangements for Yuki?

709
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,830
Li Fendou isn't Sun Atao.

710
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,200
He might not listen to your persuasion.

711
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,270
As parents,

712
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,440
whether rich or poor,

713
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,240
what worries us most
are always our children.

714
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,070
From this perspective,

715
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,880
there's no difference between
Li Fendou and Sun Atao.

716
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,830
Are you confident you can convince him?

717
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,310
Have to try.

718
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,270
Even if I fail,

719
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,310
I can sleep soundly at night.

720
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,350
Have you considered

721
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,400
the consequences
if this deal falls through?

722
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,480
Just getting fired, right?

723
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,830
If TSI doesn't want me,

724
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,310
I can find another job.

725
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,720
I've already inquired.

726
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,790
Someone like me

727
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,310
could work as

728
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,240
full-time nanny or maternity matron.

729
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,240
I can earn about

730
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,000
ten thousand yuan per month easily.

731
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,070
Hu Manli,
you always make decisions unilaterally.

732
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,550
Have you considered my feelings?

733
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,030
I'll submit my resignation letter
to you tomorrow.

734
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:28,960
Wait!

735
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,680
What did you say?

736
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,830
Resignation?

737
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,110
Say it again, come on.

738
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,000
Don't get worked up.

739
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,110
Listen to me.

740
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,030
If this deal falls through,

741
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,830
Li Qingqing will definitely blame you.

742
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,830
When that happens,

743
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,640
slap my resignation letter
right in front of her.

744
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,960
She won't do anything to you.

745
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,240
She needs you to
counterbalance Tang Ling.

746
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:45,830
You get that?

747
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,310
You want me to sacrifice you

748
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,550
to advance my own career?

749
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,440
I know you're not that kind of person.

750
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,160
This has nothing to do with you.

751
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,640
- It's me...
- I won't allow you to resign!

752
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,000
You're not thinking clearly right now.

753
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,550
I'm done talking.

754
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,510
Hu Manli.

755
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,830
I used to work in insurance
because of my mother.

756
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,310
Now I'm in this industry because of you!

757
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,510
You're the one who helped me
gradually accept this job.

758
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,590
You helped me mature step by step.

759
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,310
I worked so hard on Li Fendou's case

760
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,240
just to earn your approval.

761
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,110
If I succeed with this deal

762
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,070
but lose you in the process,

763
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,110
I'd rather have nothing at all.

764
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,070
So you want to resign?

765
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,720
Fine, I'll resign with you.

766
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,160
Wherever you go, I'll go.

767
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,000
Whatever you do,

768
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,110
I'll be right there with you.

769
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,070
I can't control you now.

770
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,960
I'm just going to cling to you.

771
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,750
Why are you shouting?

772
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,000
How silly can you be?

773
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,790
Let me tell you something.

774
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,160
I need 100K today.

775
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,720
One penny less,

776
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,960
and I'm not leaving

777
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,750
without the money.

778
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,070
I've told you already.

779
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,160
I don't have that much money.

780
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,640
Simple solution.

781
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,070
You've got so much stock.

782
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,200
Use goods as collateral.

783
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,720
You wouldn't dare!

784
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,590
What wouldn't I dare?

785
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,440
When you get the money,

786
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,240
come redeem them then.

787
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,000
Listen to me.

788
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
My dad's coming any minute.

789
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,510
He's not someone to mess with.

790
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,640
Your dad's coming?

791
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,480
I'm terrified!

792
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:23,960
Where's your dad then?

793
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Stop right now!

794
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,510
Where's your dad?

795
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:26,880
Dad!

796
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,640
Open up!

797
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:32,960
Open up!

798
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,350
Open up!

799
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,440
Open up!

800
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,310
What are you doing?

801
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,160
What are you doing?

802
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,350
Let's talk this through properly.

803
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,830
Her dad actually came?

804
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,240
Just in time.

805
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,510
Pay your daughter's debt.

806
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,510
What debt? What's going on?

807
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,200
- Your daughter owes money. - Mr. Li.

808
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,350
It's a long story.

809
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,750
This guy's a sub-landlord.

810
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,440
A complete scoundrel.

811
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,350
Yuki got scammed

812
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,110
by the agency.

813
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Now this crook's extorting
100K from her.

814
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,590
How much?

815
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,590
100K?

816
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,830
What now?

817
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,590
Let's call the police.

818
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,640
Call the police.

819
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,720
I'm not scared of police.

820
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,920
Want your daughter's shop to stay open?

821
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,880
I'll come every day if she does.

822
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,640
How about that?

823
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,680
Wait.

824
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,160
Okay.

825
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:22,830
Go on.

826
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:23,880
Go on.

827
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,550
Make this shop shut down.

828
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,440
I'll be worry-free.

829
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,160
Go ahead.

830
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,030
Mr. Li, this isn't appropriate.

831
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,920
Let him make a scene, it's fine.

832
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,270
What do you people mean?

833
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,350
Let him do it.

834
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,160
Go make trouble, go on.

835
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,550
Why are you here?

836
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,510
Check if your business
has gone under yet.

837
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,400
Weren't you running a store?

838
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,790
How did you end up in debt?

839
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,880
My debts are none of your business.

840
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,030
I'm not asking you to repay them!

841
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,440
See that?

842
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,830
She admitted the debts herself.

843
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,960
Pay up then.

844
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,920
Come here, Yuki.

845
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,400
I'll take full responsibility
for my own debts.

846
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,270
What responsibility?

847
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:55,880
With what capital?

848
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,200
That's my problem anyway!

849
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,160
None of your concern!

850
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,110
Stay outside.

851
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,440
Director Xue, keep Yuki inside.

852
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,680
Please stop talking for now, okay?

853
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,880
Give me two minutes, alright?

854
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,880
Why are you stopping me?

855
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,670
This is my matter.

856
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,670
I need to handle it myself.

857
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,710
If you could handle it yourself,

858
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,440
we wouldn't be in this mess today.

859
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,030
Hu Manli has been
brainstorming

860
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,070
solutions for your situation
for days now.

861
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,440
If you go out now,

862
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,400
I can't stop you.

863
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,960
But I can tell you clearly

864
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,800
you'll just be
making more trouble for her.

865
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:27,920
Understand?

866
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,800
Ms. Hu.

867
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,800
Listen to me.

868
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,400
Nobody interfere with this matter.

869
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,360
I want to see whether Keke is tougher

870
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,550
or this scoundrel is.

871
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,230
You already called him a scoundrel.

872
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,000
How can you just stand by?

873
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,070
Why do I feel

874
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,110
today is a setup you've arranged for me?

875
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,110
You dragged me here to watch this show.

876
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,550
Are you trying to scam me
into paying money

877
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,670
to help Keke resolve this matter?

878
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,150
Let me tell you something.

879
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,840
You were hired by me.

880
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,150
Don't sit on the wrong side.

881
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,510
Of course I know.

882
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,480
Mr. Li.

883
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,190
Leave it to me, okay?

884
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,320
Give me two minutes, alright?

885
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,360
Wait here.

886
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:08,800
Let me ask you.

887
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,510
Upstairs,

888
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,840
do you also have illegal structures?

889
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,590
What nonsense are you saying?

890
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,000
There aren't any illegal structures.

891
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,550
How am I talking nonsense?

892
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,630
You said it yourself.

893
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
This bathroom

894
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,480
is shared with the upstairs tenant.

895
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,320
Your upstairs tenant

896
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,070
has never come down to use the bathroom.

897
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,070
What does that mean?

898
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,760
It means you have a bathroom inside.

899
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,920
Doesn't a privately built bathroom
count as an illegal structure?

900
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,630
You need evidence to make such claims.

901
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:38,710
Evidence?

902
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,190
Shall we go upstairs and check?

903
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,800
Don't mess around.

904
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,590
Why messing with me?

905
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,320
You're a sub-landlord.

906
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,360
You must own at least
seven or eight properties minimum.

907
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,670
If your business is bigger,

908
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,070
you might even have ten.

909
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,550
If all ten get inspected at once,

910
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,710
that'd be troublesome.
Could you handle it?

911
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,710
If the property management
comes to inspect

912
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,480
at worst,

913
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,360
this iron gate gets torn down.

914
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,590
But if

915
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,070
all ten properties
get inspected together,

916
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,440
then...

917
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:12,880
Right?

918
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,670
Think carefully.

919
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,480
What do you mean?

920
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,360
I don't mean anything.

921
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,590
How about this?

922
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,000
I'll give you two days.

923
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,630
Think it over carefully.

924
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,880
I'll just file the complaint myself.

925
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,190
Let's dismantle it together, okay?

926
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,510
Just my bad luck.

927
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,920
Don't be angry.

928
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,110
Think it over carefully.

929
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,550
Waiting for your call.

930
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,880
Didn't realize you were this capable.

931
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,230
Mr. Li.

932
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,880
If such a trivial matter

933
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,670
requires your personal intervention,

934
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,510
how could I even be
qualified to manage your family office?

935
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,880
As for me,

936
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,440
I just want to seize this opportunity

937
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,190
to let Yuki have a proper talk with you.

938
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,670
Let you hear her original intention
for opening this small shop.

939
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
You've already planned everything.

940
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,480
It's not like that.

941
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,030
I just feel bad for Yuki.

942
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,110
If I were her mother,

943
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,800
I definitely couldn't bear

944
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,360
seeing her bullied
like this by outsiders.

945
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,000
It seems today

946
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,190
isn't the right time to continue talking.

947
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,710
That scoundrel landlord
will definitely contact me again.

948
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,320
If you want,

949
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,710
I actually think this is

950
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,070
a great opportunity for reconciliation
between you and Yuki.

951
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,590
If you don't want to,

952
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,630
at most, I'll just forgo your business.

953
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,590
The decision is yours.

954
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,440
Alright?

955
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,800
I'll contact Ms. Yan
when the time comes.

956
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,670
What do you mean?

957
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,920
You're dropping this case?

958
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,400
What Ms. Hu means is

959
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,440
you should find another time
to talk with Yuki.

960
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,960
Alright then, I'll wait for your update.

961
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:00,800
Leaving.

962
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,360
Mr. Li, take care.

963
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,400
Bye.

964
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,880
Let her have some time alone.

965
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:20,840
It's fine.

966
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,030
Take a look.

967
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,710
Five hundred a month.

968
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,710
That's 6,000 a year.

969
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,880
If there's no problem, sign here.

970
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,000
Come on.

971
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,710
Show me your payment QR code.

972
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,480
You're really something.

973
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,150
Just you wait.

974
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,360
We'll wait.

975
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,960
Take your time, I'll wait for you.

976
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,030
Manli.

977
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,760
Is he going to retaliate?

978
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,590
Don't worry.

979
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,510
He's just trying to make a living.

980
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,710
Making money is his top priority.

981
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,590
He won't target you.

982
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:36,840
Here.

983
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,280
Keep this contract safe.

984
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,320
Make a copy and submit it
to the property management.

985
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,510
I've also looked into
the relevant policies.

986
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,590
The government is doing its best to resolve

987
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,000
such public property rights issues.

988
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,550
They support agreements like this.

989
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,150
You know?

990
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,630
Actually,

991
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,190
we should thank this landlord.

992
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,070
When he asked you for 100K outright,

993
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,880
your dad almost rushed out
to hit him in anger。

994
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:08,920
Really？

995
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,840
Yes! If I hadn't stopped him,

996
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,880
we might all be
at the police station by now.

997
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,660
Right.

998
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,190
Mr. Li.

999
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,840
We all understand a father's love
for his daughter.

1000
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,760
But you're still a respectable figure.

1001
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,230
Right?

1002
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,760
Don't be so impulsive next time.

1003
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,630
Look.

1004
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,800
Look familiar?

1005
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,510
Back then, I was in elementary school.

1006
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,710
You and Mom

1007
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,150
opened a small grocery store
near the school.

1008
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,070
Whatever kids were interested in,

1009
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:11,880
stationery,

1010
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,880
toys,

1011
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,670
snacks, little accessories,

1012
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,360
you sold everything.

1013
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,920
That buckle was broken at the time.

1014
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,920
Your mother fixed it for you

1015
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,150
and gave it to you.

1016
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,110
Dad.

1017
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,760
If you and Mom

1018
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,840
had kept running that little shop,

1019
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,840
would Mom still be alive?

1020
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,880
Our family

1021
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,550
could have stayed happy like before.

1022
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,670
Keke.

1023
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,070
Do you think we were happy back then?

1024
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,360
That shop was only 30 square meters.

1025
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,030
Goods in the front,

1026
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,480
we lived in the back.

1027
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,880
You didn't even
have space to do homework.

1028
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
Was that happiness?

1029
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,800
The place was cramped.

1030
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,400
But my heart felt wide open.

1031
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,960
Back then,

1032
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,920
all the girls in my class envied me.

1033
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,360
Because they thought

1034
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,550
our family's grocery store

1035
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,590
was like a fairy tale kingdom

1036
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,960
full of little toys.

1037
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,590
And all the trinkets belonged to me.

1038
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,030
To them,

1039
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,400
I was like a princess.

1040
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,190
You'll always be a princess in my eyes.

1041
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,710
I worked so hard with your mother

1042
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,440
and struggled so desperately

1043
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,670
just to give you

1044
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,710
a princess's life.

1045
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:33,800
Yes.

1046
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,400
You and Mom

1047
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,110
worked yourselves to the bone for money.

1048
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,320
Before long,

1049
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,710
we moved to a bigger house,

1050
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,070
got a car,

1051
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,480
and hired maids and nannies.

1052
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,150
But

1053
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Mom was gone.
