40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Episode 9

41
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,680
Lisu.

42
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,760
How could this child

43
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,480
have turned out like this?

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,120
I never noticed anything wrong.

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,200
Zhiyuan.

46
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,120
Daer has always been such a sunny kid.

47
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,630
How could he suddenly have depression?

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,910
Could it be a misdiagnosis?

49
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,240
I consulted the doctor.

50
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,360
The doctor said

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,430
it might be the academic pressure

52
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,750
of middle school.

53
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
It could also be adolescence-related.

54
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,710
And the doctor said

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,310
even kids who seem cheerful

56
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,870
aren't immune to this illness.

57
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:30,910
I...

58
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
I've failed as a father.

59
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,240
Let me take this call.

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,150
Hello?

61
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,680
Ms. Qiu, the diagnosis is fake.

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,800
Fake?

63
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,400
Yes, it's photoshoped,

64
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,710
and very poorly done.

65
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,240
I checked further.

66
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,400
The clinic on the form doesn't exist.

67
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,240
I see.

68
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,000
But for now,

69
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,430
keep this from Professor Ding.

70
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,000
Understood?

71
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,190
Okay, I got it.

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,800
Lisu.

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,960
I've decided.

74
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,240
I should still attend

75
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,150
Daer's school even.

76
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,190
Once there,

77
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,520
you'll have to put on a show

78
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,750
of being a loving couple
in front of Daer.

79
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,080
This way,

80
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
we can stabilize Daer's condition,
right?

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,430
There's no other choice.

82
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,960
I know this is unfair to you,

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,030
but given Daer's current state,

84
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,310
if he finds out we've separated,

85
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,430
it would only make things worse.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,470
Daer's health is concerned.

87
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,710
I can't take that risk.

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,000
You want to go camping.

89
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,240
I have no objections,

90
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,750
but I think the priority now

91
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,520
is to address Daer's condition.

92
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,280
I have a suggestion.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,470
Manli.

94
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,240
Why did you bring me here?

95
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,120
This is where I used to live.

96
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,560
You'll understand when we get there.

97
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,620
Oh.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,600
Ms. Zhou.

99
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,680
Did you take your
blood pressure meds this morning?

100
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,390
Yes, I did.

101
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,160
Good.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,430
This is Dong's home.

103
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,310
You know him?

104
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,240
Hey, what brings you here?

105
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,000
- Lili. - Come in.

106
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,190
Come in, have a seat.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,270
Come.

108
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,270
Come on in.

109
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,380
Oh.

110
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,680
What's going on here?

111
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,540
Gosh.

112
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,160
Seems this Dong is quite something.

113
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,720
-Making wife and girlfriend meet.
- Ms. Zhou's here.

114
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,390
The most dangerous relationship
is the safest.

115
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,120
Pretty impressive.

116
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,920
Hey!

117
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,240
What brings you here?

118
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,920
How else to expose your true colors?

119
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,360
Ms. Zhou,

120
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,000
I invited you here today

121
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
just to tell you

122
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,830
Dong is a fraud.

123
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,720
You know that?

124
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,360
He's dating you

125
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,040
while

126
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,680
he's with her too.

127
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,870
Who are you?

128
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,480
Coming to my home spouting nonsense?

129
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,070
Must be a misunderstanding.

130
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,040
Dong and I are friends.

131
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,310
Right.

132
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,160
I know Lili too.

133
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,000
Ms. Zhou,

134
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,040
that's exactly why
this conman is so good.

135
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,920
He mixes truth with lies to confuse you.

136
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,310
Last time I saw them at the doorway.

137
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,310
Blowing kisses back and forth.

138
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,680
Don't you deny it.

139
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:48,950
What?

140
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,040
Me blowing kisses to her?

141
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,560
Oh my!

142
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,310
Yesterday.

143
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,510
- You forgot your phone when going out.
- Listen.

144
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
I brought it to you, remember?

145
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:00,630
That...

146
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,940
Oh!

147
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,920
Look, ma'am.

148
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,190
You must have misunderstood.

149
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,000
Dong and I are theater troupe friends.

150
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,950
We're shooting a short play recently,

151
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,720
playing husband and wife.

152
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,160
We were just rehearsing that day.

153
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
We were still immersed in our roles.

154
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,510
Gosh.

155
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,830
It's not what you think.

156
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,000
Theater troupe?

157
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,750
You're quite good at making up stories.

158
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,000
I know about this matter.

159
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,390
This... seems like
a real misunderstanding.

160
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,560
What misunderstanding?

161
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,270
Ms. Zhou, they've tricked you.

162
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,000
You know that?

163
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,510
They use these identities as cover.

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,360
Now we know!

165
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,750
They're running a scam together!

166
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,160
A theater troupe?

167
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,480
Excuse me, I've been on camera before.

168
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,480
You can't fool me with these tricks.

169
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,480
Mr. Wei, Lili.

170
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
The director's here.

171
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,600
How's your couple acting going?

172
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Couldn't be better!

173
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,600
Some already think we're married.

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:04,870
Wait.

175
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,800
Do we have extras today?

176
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,360
Doesn't seem so.

177
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,310
The script.

178
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,920
Look.

179
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,270
What's this?

180
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,040
This drama they're shooting

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,920
airs next month on TV.

182
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,750
Fix the cables.

183
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,480
Go up here.

184
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,000
Observe first.

185
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,680
Got it.

186
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,830
Lights, hurry up!

187
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,120
We're the real deal from the TV station.

188
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,720
Don't believe me? Look.

189
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,430
See the credentials?

190
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,560
We're pressed for time.

191
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,190
Open it, let me see.

192
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,830
There, how's that? Good?

193
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,390
Go over there.

194
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,120
Sound's coming, make way.

195
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,240
Where's makeup?

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,120
Let's check the equipment.

197
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,560
Put it here

198
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,040
Hurry up, we're in a rush.

199
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,390
Done, all set.

200
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,390
Pull this wire.

201
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:45,920
Double-check it.

202
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,430
Right.

203
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,360
The board.

204
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,390
I'm good here.

205
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,510
Ms. Zhou, I'm truly sorry.

206
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,750
We...we meant well but messed up.

207
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,430
Meant well?

208
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,190
You know how I am.

209
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,510
Sun Jie sent you, didn't she?

210
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,920
No no, she had nothing to do with this.

211
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,800
It was all my idea.

212
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
If Sun Jie didn't tell you,

213
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,000
how'd you know about me and Dong?

214
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,240
She's always guarding against me.

215
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:38,870
Fine.

216
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I can guard against her too.

217
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,360
Ms. Zhou...

218
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,790
This is entirely my fault.

219
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,910
Please don't let it
affect your relationship.

220
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,870
I'll apologize to Mr. Wei another day.

221
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,480
Don't be angry with me.

222
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,150
You're busy, I'll go now.

223
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,480
You're leaving?

224
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,020
Ah?

225
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,750
Alright, I understand.

226
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,510
You meant no harm.

227
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,870
Ms. Zhou.

228
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,510
You really forgive me?

229
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,000
I've known you for over a decade.

230
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,150
Don't I know your temperament?

231
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,510
Sharp-tongued

232
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,200
but kind-hearted.

233
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,320
There's something

234
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,320
I've been thinking over and over.

235
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,600
You're the most suitable person to ask.

236
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,630
Do tell.

237
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,030
As long as I can do it,

238
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,200
I'll give it my all.

239
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,510
You know what Dong

240
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,720
is like.

241
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,360
All these years

242
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,030
he's been doing odd jobs everywhere.

243
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,270
It was alright when he was young.

244
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,000
But now in middle age,

245
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,390
his strength is failing.

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
When he gets old,

247
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,360
there'll come a day he can't work.

248
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,030
He has no pension.

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,080
What do you think we should do?

250
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,480
Ms. Zhou, you mean...

251
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,270
I'm nearly 20 years older than him.

252
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,670
I'll surely pass before him.

253
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,670
Then in his future,

254
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,720
when he reaches my age,

255
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,790
no one will care for him.

256
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,910
How pitiful!

257
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,150
That's why I thought

258
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,270
I want to buy him
a pension insurance.

259
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,060
Oh.

260
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,960
So how much coverage do you want?

261
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,440
One million.

262
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,000
Our company currently offers

263
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,600
two types of

264
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,080
pension insurance plans.

265
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,720
Dividend-paying insurance

266
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,480
and traditional insurance.

267
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Which one do you think
suits Dong better?

268
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,550
Let me think.

269
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,790
How about...

270
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,550
I'll prepare several proposals.

271
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,080
Then we'll see what Ms. Zhou prefers.

272
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,510
That's not what I meant.

273
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,440
Then what do you mean?

274
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,360
Something still feels off to me.

275
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,670
What do you mean?

276
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,440
Hello?

277
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:08,910
[Depression Report]

278
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,550
Hu Manli!

279
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,240
What's the deal with our son's diagnosis report?

280
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,960
I need to take this call.

281
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,750
You go ahead.

282
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,510
I'll catch up shortly.

283
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,200
Ding Da'er always acts carefree,

284
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,960
but doctors say there's a type

285
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,270
called smiling depression.

286
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,600
Hu Manli!

287
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,510
Can you ever tell the truth?

288
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,360
This diagnosis report is fake,

289
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,120
isn't it?

290
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,200
What?

291
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:42,750
Hello?

292
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,630
Wh-what's fake?

293
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,270
Stop pretending!

294
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,200
I know you can hear me.

295
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,390
Listen up.

296
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,000
I won't go to our son's camping.

297
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,120
About our separation,

298
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,480
when are you telling him?

299
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,550
Let me tell you.

300
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,910
We absolutely can't tell him now.

301
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,910
Alright?

302
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,910
He's got midterms coming up.

303
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,670
Fine.

304
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,550
You won't tell him?

305
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,550
I will.

306
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,480
No!

307
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,320
If Daer finds out,

308
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,750
I swear I'll make you pay!

309
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,960
This isn't your decision.

310
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,720
Don't tell him!

311
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,600
Don't you dare, hear me?

312
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,510
I'm warning you.

313
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,270
If you dare say anything,

314
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,630
you'll never see the kid again!

315
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,480
How dare you!

316
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,670
Just watch me!

317
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,120
I can't believe it!

318
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,320
Calm down.

319
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
She actually threatened me.

320
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,390
Wait.

321
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,030
We haven't fixed
Ms. Zhou's affair yet.

322
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,440
Kiddo,

323
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,320
I have some matters to attend to now.

324
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,150
Let's discuss that matter later, okay?

325
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,360
Wait.

326
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,630
Today's matter

327
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,840
should be clarified today.

328
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,360
What exactly is wrong?

329
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,840
He has no other women outside

330
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,150
doesn't mean he's not a scammer.

331
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,080
Think about it.

332
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,030
Ms. Zhou and her husband
were married nearly 40 years.

333
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,550
He passed just two months ago,

334
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,360
and she has someone new.

335
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,630
She's buying him million-yuan annuities.

336
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,510
Is that normal?

337
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,080
Then how long would be normal?

338
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:11,900
Huh?

339
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,550
Ms. Zhou's husband passed away.

340
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,120
How soon should she move on?

341
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,080
What timeframe
would you consider normal?

342
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,030
I can't say for sure.

343
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,440
But two months

344
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,960
is definitely too soon.

345
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,790
So, Ms. Zhou should be like you,

346
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,390
unable to move past the separation

347
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,270
and escape reality.

348
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,550
That would be normal, right?

349
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,480
Are you crazy?

350
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,200
Why bring me into this?

351
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,150
So what if you separated?

352
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,630
Why hiding it from the world?

353
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,200
Aren't you tired?

354
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,080
Isn't it escaping reality?

355
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,150
I'm not doing this for myself.

356
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,480
I'm doing it for my son.

357
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,240
He'll be affected if he knows.

358
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,320
Still fooling yourself.

359
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,550
You know nothing!

360
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm wasting my time,

361
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,840
standing here bickering with you.

362
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,870
Ms. Qiu and I have errands to run.

363
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,030
Go upstairs.

364
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,670
Call me if anything comes up.

365
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,200
Dad.

366
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,510
Get off.

367
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,630
We need to talk.

368
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,600
Yes?

369
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,600
Did Mom upset you?

370
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,600
No.

371
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,870
Then did you upset Mom?

372
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,960
Daer.

373
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,120
You're too young to understand.

374
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,030
When you're older...

375
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,320
Is it because of that woman in the car?

376
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,360
No.

377
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,750
I saw everything.

378
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,600
She gave you

379
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,000
that car, didn't she?

380
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,120
Give the car back to her.

381
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,200
Go home, and apologize to mom.

382
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,670
I'll put in a good word.

383
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,670
We can put this behind us.

384
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,320
You know how Mom is.

385
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,670
Tough on the outside,

386
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,910
but soft-hearted inside.

387
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,270
Your mom and I are separated.

388
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:19,750
What?

389
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,000
Your mom and I

390
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,550
split up a month ago.

391
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:28,910
Dingding.

392
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,840
Dad took you to the therapist?

393
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,440
He kept saying he was busy

394
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,480
and couldn't get away.

395
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,240
Said he was in the final push
of his retreat.

396
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,960
I saw how much you wanted him there,

397
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,910
so I thought...

398
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,670
You've separated?

399
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,750
He told you?

400
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,200
Why didn't you tell me?

401
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,480
Listen.

402
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,550
After all, this isn't a good thing.

403
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,240
Don't you agree?

404
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,240
Dingding.

405
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,110
Dingding.

406
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,640
Dingding.

407
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,240
What are you doing?

408
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,160
Open the door!

409
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,030
Dingding.

410
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,590
Don't be angry, Dingding.

411
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,030
You have exams coming up, remember?

412
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,920
I didn't want to affect your mood.

413
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,070
Your grandpa's blood pressure
is unstable too.

414
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,920
I was doing what's best for you, okay?

415
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,510
Dingding.

416
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,240
Take it.

417
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,240
Throw it away, sell it, or whatever.

418
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,480
If you'd told me earlier,

419
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,270
I wouldn't have
accepted that woman's gift!

420
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,480
I wouldn't even have seen her.

421
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,350
You're not mad at me?

422
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,400
Why would I?

423
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,440
I'm sorry.

424
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,350
I'm sorry.

425
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,640
You didn't do anything wrong.

426
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,440
Why are you saying sorry?

427
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,880
It's all my fault.

428
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,070
Are you okay with us separating?

429
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,350
Separating?

430
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,000
Of course I don't want that.

431
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,270
But things have already come to this.

432
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:42,790
Mom...

433
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,000
Don't be sad.

434
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,590
You separated.

435
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,160
No big deal.

436
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,920
No matter what,

437
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,350
I'm here.

438
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,510
Come here.

439
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,070
I'm sorry.

440
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,070
I'm not a good mother.

441
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,790
I'm sorry.

442
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Good. We've cleared it up.

443
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,550
The child is tougher than

444
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,510
we imagined.

445
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,960
On another topic.

446
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,920
Li Fendou has approached me
several times.

447
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,510
Zhiyuan,

448
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,030
how about

449
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,400
you set a time?

450
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,270
Another dinner meeting?

451
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,750
I think we should pass.

452
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,830
What are you afraid of?

453
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,270
Li Fendou doesn't mind.

454
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,750
Besides,

455
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,000
he's Zhig's landlord.

456
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,440
Just do this one favor for me, okay?

457
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,590
It's not that I won't help you

458
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,640
I just lack confidence in myself.

459
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,550
You know what kind of temper I have.

460
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,680
If it's just casual dining and drinking

461
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,510
with light conversation,

462
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,440
I'd be fine.

463
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,480
I'm just afraid those bosses
will play cultured

464
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,750
and start talking art and philosophy.

465
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,270
When I hear those nonsensical opinions,

466
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,270
I can't help but argue back.

467
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,440
In the end,

468
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,790
instead of building rapport,

469
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'd just make things worse.

470
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,030
Zhiyuan.

471
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
That's exactly where your charm lies.

472
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,070
Don't worry.

473
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,510
That Li Fendou

474
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,070
isn't some petty boss either.

475
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,350
Besides,

476
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,200
even if you did
say something to offend him,

477
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,400
I wouldn't care at all.

478
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,720
Between you and him,

479
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,640
you're obviously more important.

480
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,030
If you're really unhappy,

481
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,400
just walk away.

482
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,720
I won't stop you.

483
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,110
Alright?

484
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,160
Okay.

485
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,310
Thank you.

486
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,880
Haven't finished yet?

487
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,720
Here, drink your milk.

488
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,240
Yes?

489
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,000
You really don't blame me

490
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,680
for the separation?

491
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,480
Why would I blame you?

492
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,920
If anyone's to blame, it's Dad.

493
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,440
I'm not that fragile.

494
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,270
I mean when I separated from your dad,

495
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,400
I didn't ask for your opinion.

496
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,750
I just made you come with me.

497
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,400
Why would you need my opinion?

498
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,750
Isn't it obvious?

499
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,750
If you really had asked me,

500
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,480
then I'd blame you.

501
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,920
Our bond is strong, that's true.

502
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,830
But let's face it.

503
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,720
Your dad's a university professor.

504
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,030
So what?

505
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,160
He's now somewhat internet-famous.

506
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,400
Zhong Ning told me

507
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,830
he's currently earning

508
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,790
no less than I used to.

509
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,720
So?

510
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,270
His new wife is disgusting, yes.

511
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,240
But she owns a tutoring center.

512
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,640
She must have
loads of educational resources.

513
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,070
If you stayed with your dad,

514
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,920
she could help you out.

515
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,680
Stop.

516
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,110
Ms. Hu Manli,

517
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,590
no more such nonsense.

518
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,270
Let's be honest here.

519
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,070
I'm just afraid if you stay with me,

520
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,110
I'll hold you back.

521
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,750
Wait.

522
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,550
Mom.

523
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,400
Why this sudden inferiority complex?

524
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,680
He's a professor, and you

525
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,830
went to vocational school.

526
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,960
So you're beneath him?

527
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,310
I just said...

528
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,590
Ms. Hu Manli.

529
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,160
Open your eyes and look around.

530
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,680
Everything in this house

531
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,830
was bought with your money.

532
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,310
How are you inferior to him?

533
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,510
Don't you dare look down on yourself.

534
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,640
Do you really think so?

535
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,270
Ms. Hu Manli.

536
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,550
Be more confident.

537
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,310
Only incompetent people

538
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,160
need to flaunt money or resources

539
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,350
to prove their worth.

540
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,160
You'll always be the best to me.

541
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,830
That has never changed.

542
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,510
Thank you, Dingding.

543
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,380
Hmph.

544
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,270
What's with the "hmph"?

545
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,830
There's milk on your face.

546
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,920
Do your homework.

547
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,960
Don't stay up late.

548
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,180
Oh.

549
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:46,720
Hello?

550
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,790
Hello?

551
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,070
What about Ms. Zhou's deal?

552
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,590
Take it.

553
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,830
But we must clarify with Sun Jie.

554
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,000
Why?

555
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,720
We'll take this job

556
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,070
but we'll do it flawlessly,

557
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,110
leaving no room for criticism.

558
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,960
Let everyone see my capability.

559
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,220
♫A dream I can't wake from♫

560
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,820
♫Who sleepwalks through the haze♫

561
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,700
♫Endless winds keep blowing on♫

562
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,740
♫Who truly understands♫

563
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,940
♫Hearts divided by thick walls♫

564
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,460
♫No shared pain we can recall♫

565
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,180
♫Our pains♫

566
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,060
♫Each bloom in separate ways♫

567
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,260
♫Riding sunset clouds I'll fly♫

568
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,820
♫Back to where our home once stood♫

569
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,940
♫Skies forever clear and bright♫

570
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,900
♫Life's but a fleeting dream♫

571
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,040
♫Yes it is♫

572
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,540
♫Love's the thread that holds us close♫

573

♫Through the throes♫

575
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,880
I'll send your things tomorrow

576
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,830
by express to your school.

577
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,480
Remember to collect them.

578
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,590
What?

579
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,880
She actually wants to
buy pension insurance

580
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,110
for that con artist?

581
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,200
She's gone mad!

582
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,740
Gosh.

583
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,790
I don't agree.

584
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,510
Actually, your mother doesn't need your approval

585
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,640
to buy insurance for Dong.

586
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,920
What does your colleague mean by this?

587
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,860
Huh?

588
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,000
For money,

589
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,200
you'd sign any shady deal,

590
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,070
wouldn't you?

591
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,030
No.

592
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:10,640
Calm down.

593
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,680
Shush!

594
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:14,830
Sun Jie.

595
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,070
At first

596
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,240
I thought exactly like you,

597
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,070
believed Dong was a fraud.

598
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,030
Then Xue Xiaozhou and I
tailed him for seven days.

599
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,200
I realized he and your mom

600
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,880
are genuinely dating.

601
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,270
Manli.

602
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,070
My father just passed two months ago.

603
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,200
Now my mother wants to spend

604
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,350
so much money on another man.

605
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,350
A million!

606
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,200
Yes.

607
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,260
Gosh!

608
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,350
Dating?

609
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,240
You people really...

610
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,680
For profit, you'd

611
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,790
say absolutely anything.

612
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,440
That's not the case.

613
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,960
Hu Manli,

614
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,350
I'm warning you.

615
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,030
You can't take my mom's case!

616
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,750
Sun Jie

617
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,000
It's your mother's choice.

618
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,070
Hu Manli

619
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,160
I just want your answer today.

620
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Will you take my mom's case or not?

621
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,160
Calm down. Sit, sit.

622
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:05,830
Let's talk.

623
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,550
Answer me!

624
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,030
Aren't you embarrassed? So many people!

625
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,480
Calm down.

626
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,750
Sit down. Let's talk.

627
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,960
Sit down.

628
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,640
Sun Jie.

629
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,830
I'm several years older than you.

630
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,480
I've experienced more.

631
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,310
Life sometimes...

632
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,830
Just doesn't make sense, you know?

633
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,030
No matter how sad you are,

634
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,310
after crying and shouting,

635
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,920
you just have to accept it.

636
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,590
Stop overthinking. Life goes on.

637
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,640
Alright! Fine!

638
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,510
I asked for your help.

639
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,720
Not your lecture.

640
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,680
That's my mother.

641
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,110
I can't watch her make mistakes.

642
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,070
What are you doing? Where are you going?

643
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,830
This is really driving me crazy!

644
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,680
This is absolutely ridiculous!

645
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,720
No, wait.

646
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,640
Where are you going?

647
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,270
She's so emotional now.

648
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
I have to keep an eye on her.

649
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,000
Get the check!

650
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,350
Bill, please.

651
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:01,920
Mom!

652
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,110
Mom!

653
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,070
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

654
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,590
Mom.

655
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,200
Are you really going to
buy pension insurance

656
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,110
for that con artist?

657
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:20,720
Yes.

658
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,030
I don't agree.

659
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,550
I don't need your approval.

660
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,350
You want to be with him.

661
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,070
Right?

662
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,270
That's your freedom.

663
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,270
I can't control you.

664
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,550
But the money belongs to
both you and Dad.

665
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,110
I'm your daughter.

666
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,270
I can't just watch your money

667
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,550
get scammed by this man.

668
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,270
The pension insurance was my idea.

669
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,200
He was worried you'd have doubts.

670
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
He told me not to buy it.

671
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,400
Sun Jie.

672
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,550
I'm telling you one last time.

673
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,550
Dong is not a scammer.

674
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,440
We have feelings for each other.

675
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,920
We're serious.

676
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,310
Gosh, you're serious?

677
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,350
Mom!

678
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,240
Mom!

679
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,240
Have you lost your mind?

680
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,680
Are you out of your senses?

681
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,310
Dad just passed two months ago!

682
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,720
Two months!

683
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,200
And you're with this man already!

684
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,070
Stop shouting, stop it.

685
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,400
Have you really gone mad?

686
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,000
Shh.

687
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,960
I'm sure we can talk about this.

688
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,960
Don't argue.

689
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,000
Ms. Zhou.

690
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,720
About this matter,

691
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,160
Xiaozhou and I have been running around

692
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,200
and have a thorough understanding.

693
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,160
Dong has indeed been good to you.

694
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,110
But with your husband
just passing away...

695
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,920
Sun Jie was rude earlier,

696
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,110
but her feelings are understandable,
right?

697
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,240
You all think two months is too short.

698
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,550
Then how long do you want me to wait?

699
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,550
Two years or twenty years?

700
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,830
Don't be angry.

701
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,880
That's not what we meant, we...

702
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,310
Wait?

703
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,790
I've spent my whole life waiting!

704
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,640
I'll be 60 next year.

705
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,000
And you still make me wait.

706
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,440
Are you waiting for me to die?

707
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,030
Let me tell you plainly.

708
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,790
I've been seeing Dong for five years.

709
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,590
We met at the senior university.

710
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,110
He's a performance class teacher.

711
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,750
Five years?

712
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,960
My father was still alive then.

713
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,960
Mom!

714
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,240
You...

715
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,240
Have you no shame, Mom?

716
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,510
Is this how you honor Dad's memory?

717
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,000
What's there to honor or dishonor?

718
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,510
The year you turned sixteen.

719
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,270
we got a divorce.

720
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:52,920
What did you say?

721
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,720
Back then,

722
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,070
you were in high school,

723
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,920
about to take college entrance exams.

724
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,310
We didn't want to affect you,

725
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,720
so we decided to keep it secret.

726
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,440
In the end,

727
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,510
you didn't get into
your dream college and

728
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,400
wanted to pursue graduate studies.

729
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,590
Fine.

730
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,070
We kept hiding the truth.

731
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,440
Finally, you finished grad school.

732
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,110
I wanted to tell you,

733
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,310
but then you started dating.

734
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,160
You got a boyfriend and

735
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,110
was about to get married.

736
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,830
Then I thought,

737
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,480
what if his parents knew

738
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,960
your parents split at this age?

739
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,240
Wouldn't that be embarrassing?

740
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,350
So,

741
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:43,920
I waited again.

742
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,270
I waited till your daughter was born.

743
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,550
I helped raise the third generation.

744
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,830
Finally, when she started school,

745
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,720
your dad got cancer.

746
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,720
My whole life has been spent waiting.

747
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,720
But,

748
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,750
the day your father died,

749
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,030
I suddenly realized.

750
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,720
At my age,

751
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,790
I could die anytime.

752
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
So I can't wait anymore.

753
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,640
I don't want to wait anymore.

754
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,790
I need to start my new life.

755
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,030
Do you understand?

756
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,510
Thank you.

757
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,590
Here.

758
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,230
Ms. Sun.

759
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,510
Now all concerns should be gone?

760
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,000
Then let's...

761
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,110
Sixteen years old.

762
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,400
Sixteen years old.

763
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,440
How could this happen

764
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,550
when I was only sixteen?

765
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,030
Manli,

766
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,880
I'm sorry.

767
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,320
I really don't know what to say.

768
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Stop thinking about it.

769
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,800
Go home and get some rest first.

770
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,440
Manli,

771
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,070
my mom's insurance policy,

772
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,440
can you help delay it a bit longer?

773
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,960
Yes, they've been together five years,

774
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,190
but...

775
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,280
But that man

776
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
is 20 years younger than Mom.

777
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,550
Right?

778
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,630
I can't feel at ease.

779
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,510
Don't worry.

780
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,230
I'll help figure something out.

781
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,510
Thank you.

782
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,190
Should we take this case or not?

783
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,480
Yes.

784
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,190
But don't ruin families.

785
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,920
Lady, we're insurance sales,

786
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,630
not private investigators

787
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,190
much less neighborhood committee heads.

788
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,800
These mother-daughter conflicts,

789
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,880
what's it got to do with us?

790
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,000
Let me ask you.

791
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,550
For an insurance agent,
what do you think

792
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,400
their core competency is?

793
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,000
I told you long ago.

794
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,920
Professional capability.

795
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,070
Yes and no.

796
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,230
What exactly do you mean?

797
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,670
In the past few years,

798
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,230
I took some detours.

799
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,030
I kept trying to look wealthy.

800
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,590
Thought if I appeared rich,

801
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,110
clients would come to me.

802
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,440
Looking back now,

803
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,000
I went too far.

804
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,800
So now you agree with me?

805
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,360
Actually no.

806
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,760
Computers can do what you do better.

807
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,550
At best you're a repeater.

808
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,030
I...

809
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,030
I'll stop.

810
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,800
Last night I thought all night.

811
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,590
I, Hu Manli, worked 20 years

812
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:46,960
and did quite well,

813
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,480
not by these superficial things,

814
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,760
but by willing to sit down,

815
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,840
immersing in clients' lives

816
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,440
and understanding their struggles.

817
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,030
Then use insurance methods

818
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,360
to solve their problems.

819
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,320
This case,

820
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,590
I need a perfect solution

821
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,360
that satisfies Ms. Zhou's needs

822
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,760
and also ease Sun Jie's concerns.

823
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,070
Don't look down on me.

824
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,880
Give me three days.

825
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,760
I'll show you what I'm capable of.

826
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,800
Kiddo,

827
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,000
behind every insurance policy

828
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,360
lies a family's social dynamics.

829
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,670
We can't destroy a family

830
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,840
just to make a business deal.

831
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,670
That's evil.

832
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,280
Three days.

833
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,480
Let me think.

834
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,510
I'm done.

835
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,320
Why aren't you done yet?

836

837
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,840

839

You're doing all the work.

840
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,800
That lady does nothing

841
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,360
yet takes half the commission.

842
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,320
She asked for three days

843
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,360
to give client a win-win solution.

844
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,880
But I doubt she understands

845
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,920
the pros/cons of various annuities.

846
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,760
