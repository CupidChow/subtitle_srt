A Better Life

40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Episode 1

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm 39 years old now.

42
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,970
Hard to tell, right?

43
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,240
My son is already 13.

44
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,930
I've been working in Blue Ocean,
Jiangcheng District

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,180
of Shanghai for 20 years.

46
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,880
Over these years,
I've closed 396 deals of various types.

47
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,210
A decade ago,

48
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,000
I achieved my first

49
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,240
Million Yuan Round Table.

50
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,120
Let me explain what that is.

51
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,240
The Million Yuan Round Table is a way of

52
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,680
recognition of agents
in the insurance industry.

53
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,520
Just a few years later,

54
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,930
I made Top of the Table.

55
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,490
Let me tell you.

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,980
That was quite impressive.

57
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,080
Its performance requirement

58
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,940
is triple that of the round table.

59
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,520
It's like the Oscar of insurance.

60
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,520
My biggest deal these years

61
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,220
had eight million in paid premium.

62
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,120
Know what that means?

63
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,080
Paid premium.

64
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,360
It means real money from clients.

65
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,980
They paid me eight million.

66
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,450
What is that?

67
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,840
That's trust.

68
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,560
In insurance, trust is life.

69
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,210
What is this?

70
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,450
These are all affirmations
from my clients.

71
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,490
My dear clients,

72
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,960
love you all.

73
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,240
Cut.

74
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,490
Camera operator,

75
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,930
I'll leave you an editing point here.

76
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,490
Give me a close-up shot, okay?

77
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,960
Is this really necessary?

78
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,560
Close-ups have impact, you know.

79
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,930
Listen.

80
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,770
I shoot short videos
on platforms myself.

81
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,540
I get it.

82
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,610
Let me touch up.

83
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,560
Shoot me from the left side.

84
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,640
My left side looks better.

85
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,290
Okay.

86
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,450
Camera operator,

87
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,730
can you go from the trophy to my face?

88
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,610
Alright.

89
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:29,890
Ready?

90
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,080
Three, two, one.

91
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,520
These are all affirmations
from my clients.

92
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,010
My dear client,

93
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,330
love you all.

94
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:41,840
Cut.

95
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:43,840
Li Shan.

96
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,240
I want to say a few more words

97
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,100
to my son through the camera, okay?

98
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,170
Ms. Hu,

99
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,010
this wasn't in our schedule today.

100
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,240
Since we're here, let's shoot more.

101
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,890
My son's in 8th grade at Whiton.

102
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,290
You know Whiton, right?

103
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,680
The top-ranked
bilingual school this year.

104
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,520
Tuition alone costs over 100K,

105
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,940
not counting summer camps

106
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,780
or tutoring classes.

107
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,450
Which outfit looks better?

108
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,730
We have enough footage.

109
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,170
Next appointment's at ten.

110
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,170
Time to wrap up.

111
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,680
Let's go. Sorry, Ms. Hu.

112
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,840
We have other shoots scheduled.

113
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,010
I know.

114
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,290
Next is Director Zhu
from my company, right?

115
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,770
I know him well. Let me talk to him.

116
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,200
Here.

117
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,090
Let's check out our study.

118
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,900
Come on, Li Shan.

119
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,530
Bring the camera. Come.

120
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,360
To our study room.

121
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,170
Honey.

122
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,440
Let me introduce you.

123
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,120
My husband, Professor Ding of

124
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,000
Philosophy Dept.
at Shanghai Tonghua University.

125
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,200
Sorry to disturb you.

126
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,560
We're here to film Ms. Hu.

127
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:33,930
About what?

128
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,880
They're from a popular web show.

129
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,490
It's called "New Forces in Business",

130
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,850
featuring accomplished people
from all walks of life.

131
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,880
So why interview you?

132
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,610
Because your wife is impressive!

133
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,000
Here's the thing.

134
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,880
Ms. Hu has been
exceptionally selected

135
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,730
as a candidate
for Blue Ocean Insurance Star.

136
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,290
This honorary title
from Blue Ocean Group

137
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,970
is the highest honor
for insurance agents.

138
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,120
We're very curious about

139
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,200
Ms. Hu's 20-year journey
in the industry,

140
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,410
so we came to interview her.

141
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,880
Hear that?

142
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,680
Aren't you the host of Philosopher Says,

143
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,290
Professor Ding Zhiyuan?

144
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,850
That's me.

145
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,170
You've watched his show?

146
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,170
Never missed an episode.

147
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,660
I'm Professor Ding's fan.

148
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,410
Zhiyuan is getting popular now.

149
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,240
Right?

150
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,170
Better wear sunglasses when going out.

151
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:20,980
Okay.

152
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,490
This is the 1985 World Literature.

153
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,220
You've read it too?

154
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,340
Saw it in my professor's office
during undergrad.

155
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,250
May I flip through it?

156
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,050
Be my guest.

157
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,290
Go ahead, take a look.

158
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,460
If you like it, there are so many,

159
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,020
just take a couple.

160
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,340
No, Ms. Hu.

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,980
These hundreds of World Literature are

162
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,730
serial publications.

163
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,220
It's not easy to collect.

164
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,580
If this volume is missing,

165
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,900
the whole set loses meaning.

166
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,780
Got enough material now?

167
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,610
Don't you

168
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,290
still needing to film Director Zhu?

169
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,340
Director Zhu! Yes.

170
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,460
Then I won't keep you.

171
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,620
We'll take our leave.

172
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,180
Sure.

173
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,700
Goodbye, Professor Ding.

174
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,410
Alright.

175
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,780
I'll see them out.

176
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:33,900
Here.

177
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,730
Thank you for your hard work.

178
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,340
Not at .

179
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,140
Don't use my unflattering shots.

180
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,780
Don't worry.

181
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,290
Elevator's here.

182
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,850
Looking forward to your film.

183
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,340
Sure.

184
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,050
Thank you.

185
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,730
Goodbye.

186
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,660
It's just a promo.

187
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,170
She's all over the place

188
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,980
like having hyperthyroidism.

189
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,920
She practically showed off

191
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,780
I don't know how her professor husband

192
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,140
can even tolerate her.

193
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,100
She can be difficult,

194
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,100
but don't underestimate Hu Manli.

195
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,290
She attended vocational school
20 years ago.

196
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,140
Started as Blue Ocean's receptionist,
she's now top sales with

197
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,660
estimated annual income over a million.

198
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,490
She's got some real skills.

199
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,850
Are you going out?

200
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,050
Yes.

201
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,050
Where to?

202
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,810
Got a lecture.

203
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,540
Will you be back for dinner?

204
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,810
Probably not.

205
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,810
Wait a minute.

206
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,410
You're a public figure now.

207
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,660
When you're out,

208
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,610
mind your behavior and image.

209
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,020
Understand?

210
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,540
Okay.

Madame de Pompadour

218
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,300
was the official mistress of
French King Louis XV,

219
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,940
a famous socialite and

220
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,130
a prominent patron of the arts
at that time.

221
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,940
She also had an interest in writing.

222
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,770
Voltaire was among those she sponsored.

223
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,700

and a claim is filed,

270

Ms. Fang,

271
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,980
Director Zhang's team

272
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,100
has a 2K hospitality allowance
this quarter.

273
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,530
Why my team

274
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,370
only has a 1k budget?

275
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,730
Manli dear,

276
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,130
I already told your apprentice.

277
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,340
You have few people.

278
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,370
Only two.

279
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,100
1,000 yuan is already quite generous.

280
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,770
Some teams didn't get even a single cent.

281
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,490
Business negotiations aren't gang fights.

282
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,220
More people doesn't mean better results.

283
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,890
If I alone

284
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,700
can outperform an entire team of 200,

285
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,340
shouldn't we recalculate the numbers?

286
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,300
I'm meeting with Mr. Jin
for year-end report.

287
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,650
So, regarding this situation,

288
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,940
I'll bring it up with him

289
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,370
to hear his opinion.

290
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:17,850
Thank you.

291
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,820
Did you see that?

292
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,010
Such sarcasm!

293
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,730
She close a few big deals
these past years

294
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,300
and has become increasingly arrogant.

295
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,130
Calm down.

296
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,250
Hu Manli

297
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,100
only has one salesperson under her.

298
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,730
Why can she form an independent group?

299
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,650
Ms. Hu is an exception.

300
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,220
Blue Ocean's sales

301
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,420
are divided into two categories.

302
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,770
One is team-based.

303
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,460
It relies on team commissions.

304
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,820
You can easily earn
one or two million a year.

305
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,060
She used to work in teams

306
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,530
for over ten years.

307
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,420
She got stuck at manager level.

308
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,420
Seven years ago,

309
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,890
she closed a 3-million annuity deal,

310
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,700
and everything clicked for her.

311
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,180
Every deal since has been huge.

312
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,180
So she switched to individual sales.

313
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,220
Fewer people,

314
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,370
lower operating costs,
higher performance.

315
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,130
She actually outearns teams now.

316
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,530
Does that give her the right
to be arrogant?

317
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,730
Can't be helped.

318
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,850
Her pleasant demeanor

319
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,850
is reserved for big clients.

320
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,100
Xiaozhou, listen to me,

321
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,890
she's the top salesperson

322
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,980
personally promoted by Mr. Jin.

323
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,100
She reports directly to him.

324
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,530
Don't you dare offend her.

325
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,180
I won't.

326
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,060
Last quarter,

327
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,980
we set key performance indicators.

328
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,130
I've overachieved this quarter.

329
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,180
Except for Mr. Wei.

330
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,460
Mr. Wei, remember him?

331
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,550
I remember.

332
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,820
You've been trying to win him over
for five years.

333
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,610
He's so stubborn,

334
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,250
firmly believes
insurance is just scamming people,

335
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,220
almost like fraudsters.

336
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,940
I won't have it.

337
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,700
There's no tough nut I can't crack.

338
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,530
I guess I've made this pledge.

339
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,180
Mr. Jin, if there's nothing else,
I'm back to work.

340
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,770
We need to talk.

341
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,460
What's up?

342
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,940
What can I do for you?

343
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,340
You're a veteran of Blue Ocean..

344
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,770
You must have been with the company
for 20 years now.

345
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,580
To this very day,

346
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,100
20 years, two months, and 28 days.

347
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,370
Those who
sold insurance with you back then,

348
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,130
if they're still in the industry today,

349
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,890
every single one has become a director,

350
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,060
developing their own client lists.

351
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,490
Only you

352
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,700
are still running sales
on the front line.

353
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,220
I recommend you as

354
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,650
Insurance Star this time

355
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,370
to recognize your dedication

356
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,610
to serving clients all these years.

357
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,340
Mr. Jin,

358
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,850
you've got my back.

359
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,580
I won't let you down.

360
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,180
Manli,

361
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,850
when people reach great heights,

362
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,060
it's natural to want to fly higher.

363
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,980
But remember,

364
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,100
your feet

365
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,650
must never leave the ground.

366
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,060
You've changed quite a bit lately.

367
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,130
Me?

368
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,340
Did someone

369
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,850
file a complaint again?

370
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,580
I'm filing a claim.

371
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,180
You asked for my X-rays.

372
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,460
I've taken them.

373
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,770
When will I get compensated?

374
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,460
A few questions.

375
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,460
You said your finger
was bitten off by a dog.

376
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,340
Yes.

377
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,340
Where did it happen?

378
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,490
East side of our town.

379
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,460
Be more specific.

380
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,530
A convenience store.

381
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,180
Does the store
have surveillance footage?

382
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:54,960
No.

383
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,130
What breed was the dog?

384
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,770
Probably a mutt.

385
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,490
How big was it?

386
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,130
About this big.

387
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:00,790
This big.

388
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,310
Has this dog bitten anyone before?

389
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,060
Does it have an owner?

390
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,380
It's not a stray dog.

391
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,810
Why so nosy?

392
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,010
Are you trying to avoid compensation?

393
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,420
Give me a hard time?

394
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,900
When you sold me the insurance,

395
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,810
you weren't like this.

396
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,440
You made promises.

397
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,250
Said yours was the best.

398
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,940
Go find whoever promised you that.

399
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,010
Let me ask you one last time.

400
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,420
Are you sure the dog bit your finger?

401
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,570
Don't lie.

402
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:24,760
Otherwise,

403
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,530
I can't help you.

404
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,530
If it wasn't a dog,

405
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,420
did I bite myself?

406
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,180
Not a dog bite,

407
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,810
and not self-inflicted.

408
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,620
If it were a dog bite,

409
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,700
your wound would be jagged.

410
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,620
But the X-ray shows

411
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,940
perfectly clean edges.

412
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,250
Care to explain that?

413
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,730
Buddy,

414
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,090
I'm struggling here.

415
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,980
My factory workers need their pay.

416
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,980
- I'm desperate - Enough!

417
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,860
Save the sob story.

418
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,380
This has nothing to do with me.

419
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,810
All I know is it's insurance fraud.

420
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,420
No no no, buddy, buddy.

421
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,900
Just do me this favor.

422
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,620
Alright?

423
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,860
I'll show my appreciation afterward.

424
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:13,880
Really.

425
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,230
I mean it.

426
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,980
Money isn't the issue, thanks.

427
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,220
Sorry.

428
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:20,860
This claim,

429
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,290
we can't pay out.

430
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,140
If I hadn't heard
workers are still waiting for pay,

431
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,290
I'd sue you.

432
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,530
Please leave.

433
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,810
Have some water.

434
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,420
Over these years,

435
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,770
my client base has expanded.

436
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,490
More people in the company envy me.

437
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,700
Many have come to you with complaints.

438
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,460
I'm aware of all this.

439
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,420
But my conscience is clear,

440
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,220
because everything I have now

441
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,770
was earned

442
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,570
through gritted teeth and hard work.

443
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,620
What I've fought for,

444
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,570
I'll protect it fiercely.

445
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,860
No one can take it away.

446
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,010
If you think

447
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,380
I've changed,

448
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,770
that's possible,

449
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,860
But one thing I'll never change.

450
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,900
My approach to work

451
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,900
has always been

452
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,330
wholehearted dedication.

453
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,940
That will never change.

454
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,900
With your word,

455
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,220
I'm reassured.

456
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,460
Director Fang, you needed me?

457
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,420
Shut the door.

458
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,380
Just wanted a casual chat.

459
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,860
Graduate of Futong Law School?

460
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,660
Yes.

461
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,140
You took three years off
after graduation.

462
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,050
Your parents had

463
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,290
no objections?

464
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,770
You've been here almost six months.

465
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,090
How's it going?

466
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,330
I... I'm doing quite well.

467
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,860
I'm not.

468
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,700
Half a year in the company,

469
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,250
and you receive many complaints
before probation ends,

470
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,050
said you caused trouble with claims.

471
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,090
Without proper explanation,

472
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,140
they'll report to Mr. Jin.

473
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,490
I strictly followed

474
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,090
company procedures and rules with

475
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,770
clear conscience.

476
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,220
Good, Xiaozhou.

477
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,980
Claims needs people like you.

478
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:01,990
Thank you.

479
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,010
Here's the background check

480
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,490
for Insurance Star.

481
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,570
Investigate all her cases
from the past 20 years.

482
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,900
Hu Manli.

483
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,050
When do you need it?

484
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,380
The sooner the better.

485
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,900
At the latest,
before the Insurance Star announcement.

486
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,110
Okay, I... I'll try my best.

487
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,460
Then I...

488
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,290
Xiaozhou,

489
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,530
this task was assigned directly
by Mr. Jin.

490
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,980
Keep it confidential.

491
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,420
Any findings,

492
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,810
report directly to me.

493
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,290
It's confidential.

494
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,280
Understood.

495
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,080
Get to work.

496
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,530
I've assigned the investigation task.

497
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,980
Dingding, it's Mom.

498
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,220
Drink your milk.

499
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,220
I want some fruit.

500
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,530
Milk and fruit together causes diarrhea.

501
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,860
Just two blueberries.

502
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,180
English test papers?

503
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,660
Why is there still so much left?

504
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,490
Hurry up.

505
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,810
Got it.

506
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,380
Why didn't you knock?

507
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,530
On the phone?

508
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,980
I brought you some fruits.

509
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,320
I'm...

510
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,370
I...

511
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,180
It was school matters.

512
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,460
Maple Grove Entrepreneurs Book Club.

513
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,570
When is it?

514
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,050
Still on Thursday.

515
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,810
Same time as usual?

516
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,490
What day is today?

517
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,980
Don't stay up too late.

518
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:28,980
Okay.

519
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,980
Ms. Hu,

520
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,220
how does this one feel?

521
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,860
Is it a bit too exaggerated?

522
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,250
Maybe tell me what occasion this is for.

523
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,010
Battlefield.

524
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,250
Battlefield?

525
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,140
I'm going to fight a

526
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,770
family defense battle.

527
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,180
You're so funny.

528
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,250
Ms. Qiu, please.

529
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,940
I'd like to try this one.

530
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,940
Ms. Qiu, I'm sorry.

531
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,420
We only have

532
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,290
one piece per size of this one.

533
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,380
This lady is trying size M.

534
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:54,780
Ms. Hu,

535
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,490
this one's not on sale.

536
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,980
Only one in size M?

537
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,770
Here, let me try it.

538
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:02,700
Okay.

539
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,810
Let her try it.

540
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,770
Might not fit well.

541
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,900
How about checking our new arrivals?

542
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,180
Can her size fit in medium?

543
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,460
Ms. Hu.

544
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,810
You know what?

545
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,980
This Ms. Qiu is quite a legendary woman.

546
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,220
Come in and talk.

547
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,530
Her first husband was an old Hong Kong man.

548
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,570
He died of illness
after they got married.

549
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,810
Later on,

550
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,730
she got with another rich man.

551
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,140
Then three years ago, he died in a crash.

552
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,090
Isn't that creepy?

553
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,900
Husbands die, she inherits.

554
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,380
Two happy events at once!

555
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,460
Why don't I have such luck?

556
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,860
Miss, stop talking nonsense.

557
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,380
But honestly speaking,

558
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,090
in our store,

559
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,770
she's really generous.

560
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,660
Sometimes that Tony,

561
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,860
that's her salesperson,

562
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,700
if his monthly target isn't met,

563
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,250
he'll just call her,

564
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,290
and she comes shopping immediately.

565
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,530
Ms. Qiu, these shoes look
absolutely stunning on you.

566
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,010
This is our new collection.

567
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,330
It's made of genuine lambskin.

568
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,380
Fits like a glove.

569
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,220
This piece really suits you.

570
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,200
This one, then?

571
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,500
Okay.

572
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,640
Here.

573
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:21,800
Let me help.

574
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,810
Do you have this in size 38.5?

575
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,330
Let me check, Ms. Qiu

576
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,140
A gentleman doesn't take
what others love.

577
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,900
You should try this outfit.

578
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,490
Of course not.

579
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,180
In all matters,

580
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,860
first come first served.

581
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,980
You saw it first.

582
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,290
I merely happened to hold it first.

583
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,490
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

584
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,980
Anyone can see it suits you better.

585
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,520
Thank you.

586
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,620
This way, Ms. Qiu.

587
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,570
Let me show you to the fitting room.

588
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,260
Ms. Hu,

589
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,050
why did you give it to her?

590
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,530
She's so extravagant

591
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,770
How could I let her go easily?

592
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,180
Next time she comes in,

593
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,460
Message me immediately.

594
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,700
Just three coincidental meetings,

595
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,330
I'll have her
buying insurance eyes closed.

596
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,620
Maybe we'll go with this one.

597
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,250
Didn't you say it was too flashy?

598
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,700
It's battle armor after all.

599
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,420
Being a bit extravagant is right.

600
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,570
How else would we intimidate opponents?

601
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,250
So profound.

602
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,530
Then I wish you a triumphant return.

603
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,090
Excuse me, where should I park?

604
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,810
Hello, ma'am.

605
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,530
We have no spots left.

606
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,290
Over there, please.

607
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,860
Okay, thank you.

608
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,560
[Ideal Life Isn't Far Away]

609
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
[Welcome Professor Ding Zhiyuan]

610
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,250
Hello ma'am.

611
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,460
May I see your invitation?

612
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,660
Sorry, I forgot to bring it.

613
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,530
My apologies.

614
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,770
No entry without invitation.

615
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,460
So strict.

616
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,460
Mrs. Ding?

617
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,460
Wang Xue.

618
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,460
Hear that? She called me Mrs. Ding.

619
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,290
Ding Zhiyuan is my husband.

620
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:09,770
Welcome.

621
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,460
Just a moment.

622
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,140
Mrs. Ding, this way please.

623
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,490
Today I want to discuss this topic,

624
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,350
("Ideal Life")

625
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,570
Mrs. Ding, what brings you here?

626
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,420
What do you mean by that?

627
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,660
First I'd like to conduct a survey

628
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,810
to everyone present today.

629
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,570
Today's event is for Zhiyuan.

630
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,660
He's the host, I'm the hostess.

631
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,490
If I didn't come,

632
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,530
people might mistake who the hostess is.

633
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,090
That wouldn't be good, right?

634
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,700
...have absolute advantage.

635
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,570
This way please.

636
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,810
No hurry, come here.

637
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,050
I'd like to talk to you.

638
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,050
Do you feel

639
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,330
saying "happy" makes you seem naive?

640
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,490
Wang Xue, right?

641
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,420
You got into
Zhiyuan's grad program last year.

642
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,810
There's much you don't know.

643
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,140
How old are you?

644
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,760
25.

645
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:56,770
Where are you from?

646
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,290
Jiangxi.

647
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,730
Just playing a little joke on everyone.

648
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,530
Don't be fooled by how

649
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,420
charming and eloquent Zhiyuan is here.

650
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,460
Without me,

651
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,380
he wouldn't know how to live.

652
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,810
Must everything be "happy"?

653
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,290
Every night,

654
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,660
he still waits for me to go to bed.

655
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,530
For an old married couple,

656
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,180
you can't draw equals.

657
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,460
Do you understand what I mean?

658
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,430
It's something you realize
while doing things.

659
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:24,690
Yes.

660
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,090
Are you sure?

661
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,090
Yes.

662
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,980
I believe it's something worth pursuing.

663
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,620
It can be planned for

664
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,460
and is attainable through practice.

665
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,380
Happiness itself

666
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,860
isn't an independent entity,

667
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,090
nor a concrete existence.

668
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,810
So you can't pursue it separately.

669
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,810
I believe happiness is a byproduct.

670
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,570
It emerges when

671
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,980
you're pursuing your life's purpose.

672
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,700
A natural additional experience.

673
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,900
So don't chase happiness directly.

674
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,100
What you should do

675
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,140
is pursue self-fulfillment.

676
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,570
Then happiness

677
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,090
will naturally follow.

678
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,530
Thank you.

679
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,490
Many thanks to Professor Ding

680
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,980
for sharing such wonderful insights.

681
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,460
Now we'll move to Q&A session.

682
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,700
If anyone has questions

683
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,460
for Professor Ding.

684
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,620
please raise your hand.

685
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,050
Over here.

686
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,660
I have one.

687
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,010
I have a question.

688
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,810
Okay, the lady at the back

689
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,050
can't get enough of our book club.

690
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,220
Let's have our staff pass the mic.

691
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,500
Thank you.

692
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,180
Professor Ding, hello.

693
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,380
Here,

694
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,460
I want to ask a rather gossipy question.

695
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,090
Gossipy?

696
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,940
Do you consider yourself happy?

697
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,770
That's a difficult question to answer.

698
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,290
What's so hard about it?

699
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,010
Happy means happy,

700
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,460
not happy means not happy.

701
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,220
Right.

702
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,250
Sorry, ma'am.

703
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,770
This question might reveal

704
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,980
Professor Ding's privacy.

705
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,810
Maybe next time if there's a chance...

706
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,180
Sorry, I was presumptuous.

707
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,380
I think Professor Ding

708
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,900
must be happy.

709
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,740
Right?

710
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,250
I don't know how you are at home,

711
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,900
but seeing you today,

712
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,220
radiant and eloquent

713
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,490
with so many VIPs here

714
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,530
as your fans,

715
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,420
you must feel accomplished.

716
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,330
This is a rare opportunity

717
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,530
to be at such a high-end event.

718
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,050
I've written a poem,

719
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,420
dedicating to you.

720
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:52,850
Alright.

721
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,570
What poem is it?

722
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,530
Quite romantic.

723
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,330
You had a hidden talent.

724
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:03,860
What a surprise.

725
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,180
I'll read it now.

726
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,810
When you're by my side,

727
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,290
even night turns to fresh morning.

728
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,770
Besides you,

729
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,730
I desire no other companion
in this world.

730
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,290
Each time my eyes meet yours,

731
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,980
my heart already flies to you.

732
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,530
Professor Ding,

733
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,770
what do think of my poem?

734
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,330
Everyone, Professor Ding has a meeting.

735
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,460
He must leave now.

736
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,900
Our reading session ends here today.

737
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,050
Thank you all for participating.

738
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,730
Excuse me, how do I get to
Maple Grove Book Club?

739
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,860
It has rooms on the 7th,

740
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,260
3rd, and 4th floors.

741
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:10,900
This way?

742
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,740
Take the elevator here.

743
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,090
Give me your ID later.

744
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,820
I'll handle it.

745
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,530
I've said all I needed to say.

746
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,380
Wang Xue,

747
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,860
I came today to tell you.

748
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,690
You're still young.

749
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,380
The road ahead is still long.

750
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,380
Don't ruin your future
in a moment of folly.

751
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,690
Mrs. Ding, I...

752
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,740
I-I really don't know
what you're talking about.

753
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,090
Zhiyuan.

754
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,380
I recited that poem

755
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,260
just to remind you.

756
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,380
Students are young and inexperienced.

757
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,050
But you're the teacher,
you should know better.

758
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,940
How could you take advantage

759
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,940
of your position like this?

760
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,820
No, Mrs. Ding, I...

761
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,380
I didn't, you've got it all wrong.

762
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,340
Professor Ding, please say something.

763
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,010
Enough, no more explanations.

764
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,610
This is just a friendly reminder.

765
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,010
I've made myself clear.

766
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,610
Consider this matter closed.

767
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,160
About changing your tutor,
can you submit the request tomorrow?

768
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,570
Change... change my tutor?

769
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,860
Mrs. Ding, you really misunderstood.

770
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,570
Professor Ding, I'm begging you.

771
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,570
Please say something.

772
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,780
This is truly a misunderstanding.

773
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,170
It really is a mistake.

774
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,380
Ms. Qiu.

775
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,210
What are you doing here?

776
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,460
What a coincidence.

777
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,860
I'm Spring Snow.

778
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,340
The two of us should talk privately.

779
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,610
Are you joking?

780
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,780
Life always plays
all sorts of jokes on us.

781
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,340
I didn't expect this would happen.

782
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,460
I initiated this affair.

783
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,420
Don't blame Zhiyuan.

784
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,780
I won't interfere

785
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,650
with your family affair.

786
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,490
You shouldn't meddle with

787
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,260
him and me either.

788
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,090
Let's pretend nothing happened
and maintain peaceful relations.

789
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,980
You're not young anymore.

790
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,340
Do you realize what you're saying?

791
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,340
Let me remind you.

792
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,460
Ding Zhiyuan is a married man.

793
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,570
What you're doing is immoral.

794
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,420
Morality?

795
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,530
The morality of love
is mutual affection.

796
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,940
Feelings are like clothing:

797
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,380
only the wearer knows comfort.

798
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,130
They can't be forced.

799
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,980
Your moral standards are impressive.

800
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,690
Too bad Zhiyuan and I don't share them.

801
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,740
This book club,

802
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,900
he won't be coming anymore.

803
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,090
You're a respectable figure.

804
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,000
Please respect yourself.

805
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,610
How can you be so confident
that you can make decisions for him?

806
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,010
I won't contact him,

807
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,170
but he might contact me.

808
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,820
Then you overestimate yourself.

809
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,380
I met Ding Zhiyuan at 20.

810
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,380
We dated and married.

811
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,460
What storms haven't we weathered?

812
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,170
The bond between us

813
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,530
can't be broken by

814
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,490
your sweet nothings.

815
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,610
How long since you've been intimate?

816
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,780
Three years?

817
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,160
Five years?

818
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,420
Typical for middle-aged couples.

819
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,650
What does that prove?

820
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,650
Zhiyuan told me

821
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,340
he always thought he was inadequate.

822
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,650
But after meeting me, he realized

823
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,460
he was just inadequate with a certain person.

824
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,420
Hu Manli,

825
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,820
as a fellow woman,

826
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,300
I pity you.

827
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,380
Shameless bitch.

828
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,340
Xiaozhou.

829
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,380
Qiu Lisu.

830
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,130
Are you addicted to being a mistress?

831
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,610
Xiaozhou, you've got it wrong.

832
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,130
It's always a misunderstanding.

833
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,290
How come everything about you

834
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,210
is just a misunderstanding?

835
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,010
Back then, you played mahjong
with my mom and befriended her.

836
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,740
You then seduced my dad and

837
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,740
kicked me and my mom out.

838
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,740
Also a misunderstanding?

839
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,300
Xiaozhou,

840
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,610
I'll explain to you

841
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,980
everything happened back then.

842
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,420
But right now, your dad's company

843
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,940
is in dire straits,

844
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,260
so I was thinking

845
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,820
we could sell our house.

846
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,940
Our house?

847
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,110
Yes.

848
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,050
You called me here,

849
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,050
saying there's
something important to discuss,

850
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,090
just to sell my family home?

851
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,490
Xiaozhou,

852
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,380
I have no other choice.

853
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,490
The education industry
has been struggling.

854
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,090
Zhig Education needs to transform

855
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,420
into Zhig Studio.

856
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,010
Of course, you have inheritance rights
to the house.

857
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,210
If I want to sell it,

858
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,740
I need your consent.

859
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,210
I'll send you the contract later.

860
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,300
I disagree.

861
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,900
It's my family's house.

862
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,210
You can't sell it just like that.

863
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,170
Xiaozhou.

864
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,050
Your father left so suddenly.

865
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,490
He didn't leave a will.

866
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,490
Legally,

867
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,610
this house

868
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,170
only had his name on it.

869
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,050
It's become inheritance now.

870
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,820
Both you and I
have the right to inherit it.

871
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,090
How about this?

872
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,260
After I sell the house,

873
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,420
I can give you 500K.

874
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,050
It's fine if you hate me.

875
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,090
But what needs saving now

876
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,570
is the company your father built.

877
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,420
You know?

878
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,980
Saving the company is your business.

879
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,980
But that is my home!

880
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,300
Stop scheming like this!

881
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,570
Are you saying

882
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,630
the one having an affair with
Professor Ding

883
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,130
is Qiu Lisu?

884
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:14,650
You know her?

885
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,260
She came to the recording once.

886
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:22,530
Zhong Ning,

887
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,050
I know Zhiyuan is popular now.

888
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,210
You're his agent.

889
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,420
But I was the one who recommended him.

890
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,940
You're my best friend.

891
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,610
Show some professional ethics.

892
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,530
Then what do you mean?

893
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,010
Did you know all along

894
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,570
about their affair but

895
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,460
kept it from me this whole time?

896
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,170
Hu Manli.

897
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,260
That's kinda insulting.

898
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,050
Don't take your anger at Zhiyuan
out on me.

899
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,170
Who am I?

900
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,650
I'm his agent.

901
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,570
not his 24/7 personal nanny.

902
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,380
How would I know his dirty laundry?

903
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,900
♫If I close both eyes tonight♫

904
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,780
♫Back to that wishing summer night♫

905
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,540
♫Wind brushes your shaking frame♫

906
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,340
♫That world feels close just the same♫

907

♫If I dare to face the dawn♫

908
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,460
♫Do you know this face you'd drawn♫

909
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,260
♫Gray spirals looped in endless chase♫

910
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,060
♫Tracing tears not words they trace♫

911
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,820
♫How many times must this repeat♫

912
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,340
♫Sighs pull my gaze to retreat♫

913
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,180
♫Sleepless nights, risks untold♫

914
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,980
♫None of it for my own soul♫

915

♫Winds blew, rains poured♫

916

00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,100
♫Love left, hate stayed♫

942
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,980
♫Voice gone, tears paid♫

943
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,620
♫Grew strong, moved on♫

944
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,620
♫Why dwell when it's gone♫
