Here you are.

50
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,780
I was looking for you.

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,610
I have a question.

Here.

53
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,060
What happened?

54
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,100
Ma wanted to place an order with you

55
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,690

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,730
Yeah.

57
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,730
I fired the company.

58
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,570
You fired...?

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,660
How?

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,660
I quit.

61
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,410
I make more money somewhere else.

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,010
Colleagues are just jealous.

You know.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,610
Human nature.

67
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,890
I'm better off without them.

68
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,890
They have to spread rumors about me.

69
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,220
Okay.

76
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,850
Give it to Zhiyuan.

77
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,500

78
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,380

80
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,690
Take it.

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,060

I've told you.

97
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,220
Don't buy this crap

98
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,850
anymore.

99
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,460
Having too much money?

100
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,580
What's wrong?

101
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,460
Act like this?

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,730
Listen to me.

103
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,780
This might have killed you.

104
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,220
Okay.

105
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,140
Take this

106
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:03,930
to Zhiyuan.

107
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,660

111
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,020
The thing you mentioned...

112
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,250
Go on.

113
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,780
You asked

114
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,980
if any wants to buy insurance.

115
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,220
I was skeptical at first.

116
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,170
Then I met a script writer.

117
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,250

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,580

119
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,290
No work today.

120
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,460
You used to talk about work every time.

121
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,610
Shh.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,540
One sec.

123
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,340
Another.

124
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,660
Take it slow.

125
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,900
Hey.

126
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,810
I want your strongest liquor.

127
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,780
I'll file a complaint

128
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,410
if I'm still sober after.

129
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,220

130
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,170
You should roll her over more.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,730
Don't want bedsore.

132
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,660
OK.

133
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:17,730

134
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,730
It's late.

135
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,100
You should go home.

136
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,490
It's fine.

137
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,050
I'll take over.

138
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,340
No.

139
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,610
Okay.

You know her?

158
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,100
Take care of her.

159
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,890
Hey, what's going on?

160
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,010
She got herself drunk

161
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,060
at our bar.

162
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,060
She's a regular.

163
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,180
Made me lose my job.

164
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,730
I'll kill you.

165
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,300
I'll...

166
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,010
Why is she like this?

167
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,220
Get off.

168
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,980

Women are difficult.

175

We're not lovers.

176
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,130
Especially middle-aged ones.

177
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,420
Say something nice to her.

178
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,490

192
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,180
The client wanted to kill herself.

193
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,820
She was begging me,

194
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,700
holding my leg like this.

195
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,100
She has cancer,

196
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,130
and a son with autism.

197
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,610
If I let the company know,

199
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,730
I'm a mom too.

200
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,730
Should I have

201
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,340
watched and stood by?

202
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,850
Okay.

203
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,100
You know nothing.

204
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,180
I...

205
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,420
Nurse.

206
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,490
Can you help?

207
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,700
Hold on a second.

208
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,220
But she...

209
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,580
she...

210
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,300
My secret book.

211
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,820
All my client info is on it.

212

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,100
As long as I have my clients,

215
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,610

216
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,300

Doc.

218
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,420
In a moment!

219
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,220
Be right back.

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,220

228
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,060
Give it to me.

229
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,180

231
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:42,850

Thank you.

237
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:49,980
Hey.

238
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,940
Give back my stuff.

239
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,300
OK.

240
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:52,980
Let me.

241
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,730
You a guardian?

242
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,530
Shameless.

243
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,060
I... am.

244
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,530
Give me that.

245
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,980
He's a fool.

246
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,820
Slower.

247
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,650
Careful.

248
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,610

249

Pay at that desk.

250
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:04,890
Pay up first.

251
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,130
We'll give a stomach pumping.

252
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,650

253
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,460
Here's

254
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,340
the receipt and pills.

255
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,250
Transfer the fee.

256
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,940
Why are you here?

257
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,770
You were drunk last night.

258
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,010
I happened to be here.

259
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,420
Coincidence.

260
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,180
I was sent here.

261
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,220
And you happened to be here.

262
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,530
And you stayed the night.

263
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,010
I was

264
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,100
worried about you.

265
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,370
Doesn't Qiu Lisu

266
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,610
want me dead?

267
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,980
Tell her

268
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,460
it's not that easy.

269
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,130
I have

270
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,850
a piece of advice.

271
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,130
Be honest.

272
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,180
If you're helping her

273
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,700

274
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,700
you should know

275
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,940
she and my ex,

276
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,010
they aren't moral.

277
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,490
If it's for money,

278
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,130
I don't know...

279
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,460
You're young.

280
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,220
You can do anything

281
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,180
to support yourself.

282
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,980
That makes sense.

283
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,180
You're sober.

284
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,100

285
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,580
Venmo me.

286

Please.

287
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,370

What's this about?

298
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,700
You did that to Ms. Hu?

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,980
I wasn't in yesterday.

300
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,850
Just heard about it.

301
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,980
You're so young but ruthless.

302
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,220
What do you mean?

303
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,010
She criticized you.

304
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,130
It's okay you feel bad.

305
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,220
You can't sentence her to death.

306
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,490
No, you're misunderstanding.

307
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,460
I'm not prejudiced against her.

doing my job.

310
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,890
Doing your job?

311
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,650
But you investigated her.

312
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,530
Did I tell you to do that?

313
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,890
Tell me the truth.

314
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,820
Chen Fang instructed me.

315
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,340
Why didn't you tell me?

316
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,420
Chen Fang said it was from Mr. Jin.

317
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,770
I had to keep it secret.

318
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,700
Oh.

319
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,890
I see.

320
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,980
You're such a fool.

321
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,130
Why?

322
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,940
It had nothing to do with Mr. Jin.

323
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,340
You're used.

324
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,610
Chen Fang had a plan.

325
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,340
But they look

326
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,530
close usually.

327
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,890
Why did he

328
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,370
have to do that?

329
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,100

They all wear masks.

332
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,420
Chen Fang envies

Manli's achievements.

wait until now?

336
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,490
That's

337
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,980

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,250
Tell them

395
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,090
I'm not defeated.

396
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,180
I'm still me.

397
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,810
No.

398
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,010
A better me.

399
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,330
Alright.

400
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,980
That's a way.

401
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,490
What if they don't take the bait?

402
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,860
They don't?

403
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,490
Look.

404
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,730
So many comments

405
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,320
and likes.

406
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,180
Look.

407
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,730
Not bad.

408
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,700
If Li Qingqing doesn't care,

409
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,420
there's still others.

410
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,010
You should know about

411
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,860
my business.

412
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,460
The older you are, the more valuable.

413
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,380
There's always

414
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,620
a job for me.

415
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,050
Guess I

416
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,700
was worrying for nothing.

417
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,570
You have connections.

418
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,220
Well done.

419
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,660
I'm an older woman.

420
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,490
Colleagues, family members

421
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,050
trying to hurt me?

422
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,000
Bah.

423
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,860
Just wait and see.

424
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,180
Weina.

425
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,180
Did Hu Manli reach you?

426
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,460
No.

427
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,460
Is she still of value?

428
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,700
Yes.

429
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,770
She's in business for

430
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,490
for decades.

431
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,330
But boss,

432
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,290
I don't understand.

433
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,860
You can find talent internally.

434
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,180
Manger Tang has done a great job.

435
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,860
And she's loyal.

436
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,530
We TSI

437
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,770
focuses on annuity.

438
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,010
Serving big clients needs vision.

439
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,330
I've given her

440
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,660
many chances.

441
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,980
But she just grows...

442
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,290
slow.

443
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,660
So.

444
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,090
About Hu Manli.

445
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,730
What's next?

446
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,570
Except Blue Ocean,

447
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,380
TSI

448
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,730
is her best choice.

449
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,660
But she never called.

450
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,660
Maybe

451
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,810
she doesn't want to take the initiative.

452
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,810
Or

453
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,770
she has better choices.

454
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:22,730
Does she?

455
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,490
Should we act first?

456
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,770
Meeting her up next week?

457
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,620
OK.

458
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,530
Besties,

459
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,620
I got this exam paper

460
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,220
from my son's school.

461
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,050
These are super hard to get.

462
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,490
Save them.

463
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,420
No sharing.

464
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,420
Thank you!

465
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,490
Anything on literature?

466
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,730
Literature papers

467
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,250
from your school, honey.

468
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,140
OK.

469
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,050
Coming.

470
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,570
Hello?

471
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,770
I am.

472
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,010
According to Article 177

473
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,700
of Insurance Law of the PRC,

474
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,220
being authorized,

475
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,530
we decide,

476
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,730
in two years,

477
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,180
Hu Manli can't work in insurance.

478
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,020
[Banned from insurance]

479
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,980
(Two years

480
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,010
out of business.)

481
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,050
Manli's matter blew up so much?

482
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:40,730
Xiaozhou.

483
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,290
Where are you going?

484
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,810
I want Mr. Jin.

485
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,730
Do you have an appointment?

486
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,530
This is urgent.

487
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:11,700
Xiaozhou.

488
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,530
Mr. Jin.

489
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,570
That's the whole story.

490
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,050
You mean

491
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,700
Chen Fang instructed you

492
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,290
to investigated Manli.

493
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,900
Yes.

494
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,980
Chen Fang said

495
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,010
the order was from the management.

496
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,140
Actually,

497
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,770
it was out of personal gains.

498
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,140
So

499
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,570
Chen Fang

500
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,330
was targeting Manli, I think.

501
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,290
I heard

502
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,010
you and Manli

503
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,860
had a fight

504
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,290
because of

505
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,700
some claim.

506
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:54,860
Yes.

507
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,050
She ignored the procedure.

508
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,900
I declined.

509
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,490
That was why

510
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,180
we fell out.

511
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,010
So you hate her.

512
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,940
No.

513
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,180
I don't agree with her work ethics.

514
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,290
But I don't harbor bad intentions.

515
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,860
So you're here for?

516
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,420
I just think you might

517
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,570
want to know the truth.

518
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,290
And?

519
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,980
Hu Manli

520
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,770
can't work in insurance now.

521
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,940
That's a fact now.

522
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,290
What's your point again?

523
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,460
You want to

524
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,220
feel better

525
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,380
by telling the truth.

526
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,730
Right?

527
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:37,810
No.

528
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,620
Mr. Jin.

529
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,490
I don't care what Chen Fang said.

530
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,980
I investigated Manli

531
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,980
purely out of

532
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,980
business.

533
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,660
The point is

534
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,330
you should make the process

535
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,530
fair and honest.

536
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,420
Young man,

537
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,620
you're smart.

538
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,050
But be careful next time.

539
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,090
Mr. Wang.

540
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,420
Hello.

541
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,220
I'm Zhou from Blue Ocean.

542
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,250
Yes yes.

543
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,940
The proposal you mentioned

544
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,860
last week.

545
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,940
We have drafted it out.

546
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,460
When will you be available?

547
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,250
We should meet up for details.

548
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,810
OK?

549
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,010
Sure.

550
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,010
Why?

551
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,700
What is it?

552
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,140
Why was it

553
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:31,860
Hu Manli?

554
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,290
The investigation.

555
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,620
Such a harsh punishment.

556
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,530
You produced

557
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,180
an unconfirmed recording,

558
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,900
breaking her down.

559
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,460
Why target her?

560
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,010
You targeted her.

561
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,050
Because of work,

562
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,090
you guys fell out.

563
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,620
You wanted her finished.

564
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,770
Logical, isn't it?

565
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,490
Everyone here

566
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,420
knows you're at odds.

567
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,330
Right?

568
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,220
Yes.

569
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,490
Mr. Jin bought it.

570
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,140
Xiaozhou.

571
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,420
I know you went to Mr. Jin.

572
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,330
I'll let it pass.

573
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,660
You're still young.

574
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,050
A long way to go.

575
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,090
Think twice next time.

576
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,180
Fang.

577
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,050
I'm young,

578
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,380
not foolish.

579
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,090
I quit.

580
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,700
You...

581
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,810
quit too?

582
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,380
You quit

583
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,660
or you're fired?

584
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,770
I see.

585
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,180
After the dirty work,

586
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,660
you just quit.

587
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,730
You're something.

588
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,220
I'm talking to you.

589
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,940
You want to settle accounts?

590
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,460
You're going the wrong way.

591
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,290
You made a mistake.

592
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,570
So full of it.

593
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,090
Think you can get away

594
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,290
with what you've done?

595
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,700
What goes around...

596
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,900
You still

597
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,490
think

598
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,810
you're framed.

599
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,810
Have you reflected a bit?

600
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,180
You succeeded

601
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,620
because the business was booming.

602
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,620
It had nothing to do with you.

603
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,980
Of course I was wrong.

604
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,660
I shouldn't have met you guys.

605
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,770
You love fame and play dirty.

606
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,420
Yes, your husband cheated on you.

607
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,380
But who

608
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,730
wants a woman like you?

609
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,250
And.

610
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,490
For personal gains,

611
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,620
you ignored

612
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,490
the procedure,

613
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,940
so unprofessional.

614
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,620
Qiu Lisu always picks the same guy.

615
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,490
Such a natural lecturer.

616
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,660
Marke my words.

617
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,490
My ex is a professor.

618
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,380
Work harder if you want Lisu's favor.

619
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,660
You're hopeless.

620
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,810
You want to see Mr. Jin?

621
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,810
Well, if I were you,

622
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,980
I wouldn't go to anyone.

623
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,860
Think about your future.

624
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,860
No one can save you.

625
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,320
[Mr. Jin]

626
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,250
Sorry,

627
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,490
the number you have dialed...

628
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,330
Where's my book?

629
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,780
[I'll mail it to you]

630
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,780
[You're blocked.]

631
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,330
Dad, classroom is over there.

632
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,810
Miss.

633
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,090
That way.

634
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,810
Parents wait outside.

635
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,770
OK.

636
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,010
Hello.

637
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,940
We're here for class.

638
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,810
OK.

639
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,940
That way please.

640
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,300
[I'm interested in your products.]

641
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,100
[Penalty]

642
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,100
[Chunlu]

643
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,730
Chunlu, it's Manli.

644
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,290
Are you in office?

645
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,010
I was passing by.

646
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,250
Downstairs.

647
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,530
Are you free now?

648
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,770
We should grab a coffee.

649
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,620
OK.

650
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,250
See you.

651
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,620
Bye.

652
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,130
Manli.

653
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,300
Your latte.

654
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,340
Thanks.

655
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,940
Something for you.

656
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,130
Oh, you shouldn't have.

657
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,170
This looks expensive.

658
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,900
How come you didn't

659
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,010
call me all this while?

660
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,860
Sorry.

661
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,610
I...

662
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,260
Mom's conditions flared up.

663
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,260
I...

664
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,210
Arthritis?

665
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,690
Yes.

666
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,490
Apply the medical patches I gave you.

667
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,300
OK.

668
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,170
Manli.

669
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,340
How have you been?

670
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,570
Well,

671
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,260
that depends on you.

672
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,530
What do you mean?

673
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,490
Chunlu.

674
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,300
How long have we worked together?

675
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,900
Two years.

676
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,860
How time flies.

677
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:16,860
Yes.

678
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,940
What do you think of me?

679
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,900
You treat me like family.

680
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,300
So, let's talk like family.

681
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,490
You see my situation.

682
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,050
I have clients.

683
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,740
You have a position.

684
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,820
I need you.

685
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,210
You mean

686
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,570
we cooperate.

687
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,090
I introduce clients to you.

688
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:52,740
We'll do a

689
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,380
20-80 split.

690
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,010
Not enough?

691
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,740
30-70 then.

692
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,780
You think it isn't enough.

693
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:18,900
No way.

694
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,980
Manli.

695
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,210
This is sudden.

696
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,900
I don't know how to answer you.

697
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,050
Well.

698
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,050
Manli.

699
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,130
You taught me

700
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,210
and care about me.

701
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,980
I'll listen to you.

702
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,050
Great.

703
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,610
I'll send you docs.

704
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,300
We should go see clients

705
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,900
when you're free.

706
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,820
Let's

707
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,010
secure a deal!

708
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,740
OK.

709
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,940
To work.

710
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,090
To work.

711
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,170
Why quit?

712
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,260
Working with Chen Fang

713
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,610
makes me sick.

714
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,090
So

715
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,940
what's your plan?

716
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,650
Well,

717
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,610
actully,

718
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,170
I've asked around.

719
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,860
I'm an ordinary

720
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,380
law graduate.

721
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,210
I have three gap years.

722
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,900
I don't think

723
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,900
any offices

724
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,090
would want me.

725
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,170
Now

726
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,170
Uber drivers

727
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,380
are everywhere.

728
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,340
What can I do?

729
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,780
I'll

730
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,380
collect junk.

731
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:46,740
Xiaozhou.

732
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,490
You're so lame.

733
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,610
You need your turf to collect junk.

734
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,260
Alright.

735
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,490
I was kidding.

736
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,740
I've had it all planned out.

737
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,260
Sit.

738
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,650
Look.

739
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,210
TSI is hiring.

740
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:02,900
See?

741
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,080
High commission, great tutors.

742
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,860
Join with Li Qingqing, Insurance Queen

743
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,820
to expand your territory.

744
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,340
TSI.

745
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,340
Insurance broker.

746
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,650
I'm going to apply.

747
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,260
You're really selling insurance?

748
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,010
You doubt me.

749
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:22,900
Look.

750
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,610
It might not work before.

751
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,940
This year is different.

752
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,610
More and more joined.

753
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,780
Managers,

754
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,490
docs like you,

755
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,420
laywers,

756
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,260
and college teachers.

757
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,860
There's all kinds.

758
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,490
I have a feeling that

759
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,860
the insurance is transforming.

760
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,610
You said

761
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,820
it's a feeling.

762
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,940
The authorities punished Manli.

763
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,980
It's clearly a sign.

764
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,340
Money won't prioritize.

765
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,050
The industry needs

766
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,460
healthy development.

767
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,210
You know why this company?

768
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,420
TSI was built five years ago.

769
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,340
Flat management.

770
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,010
Newbies like me have

771
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,780
lots of chances there.

772
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,050
This is my chance.

773
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,980
I believe in their

774
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,050
professionalism.

775
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,820
I do.

776
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,210
OK.

777
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,940
Keep up the good work.

778
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:15,650
Fruits.

779
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,300
Be careful.

780
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,420
No, not now.

781
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,130
What's the date?

782
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,860
You're going tomorrow?

783
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,050
Are you ready?

784
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,420
For what?

785
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,170
Shouldn't I just, show up?

786
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,530
Hi, I'm here for onboarding.

787
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,460
Xue Xiaozhou.

788
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,860
This way.

789
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,490
OK.

790
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,820
Here's a pen.

791
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,010
Roll over.

792
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:16,780
Come in.

793
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,940
Hi, Ms. Tang.

794
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,530
I started work here today.

795
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,380
My name is Xue Xiaozhou.

796
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,210
A law graduate from Futan.

797
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,570
I had lawyer certificate at school.

798
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,130
During my free time,

799
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,460
I took exams as a CPA.

800
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,610
Now I'm learning to

801
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,210
be a RFP.

802
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,420
Ms. Tang?

803
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:58,900
Human resources?

804
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,210
What is going on?

805
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,690
This office is for work, not schooling.

806
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,940
I don't need a nerd.

807
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,980
Team meeting.

808
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,170
Tang.

809
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,490
Tang.

810
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,530
Wang will sign next week.

811
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,860
Cheng will pay annually.

812
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,460
Got it.

813
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,260
Ling.

814
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,050
Ling.

815
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,420
Everyone's here?

816
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,610
Let's start.

817
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,740
Tell me about your work last week.

818
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,740
Who's first?

819
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,130
Me.

820
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,130
Listen.

821
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,940
We need to

822
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,690
grab every chance,

823
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,170
every possible client.

824
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,090
For instance.

825
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,130
I manage to give a 10-min speech

826
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,090
at my daughter's school.

827
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,740
I gave every parent present

828
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,420
our company's

829
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,740
booklet.

830
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,530
Even if just one place an order,

831
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,900
I did something.

832
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:44,940
Amazing.

833
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,340
Got a problem?

834
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,900
♫If I close both eyes tonight♫

835
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,780
♫Back to that wishing summer night♫

836
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,540
♫Wind brushes your shaking frame♫

837
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,340
♫That world feels close just the same♫

838
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,740
♫If I dare to face the dawn♫

839
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,460
♫Do you know this face you'd drawn♫

840
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,260
♫Gray spirals looped in endless chase♫

841
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,060
♫Tracing tears not words they trace♫

842
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,820
♫How many times must this repeat♫

843
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,340
♫Sighs pull my gaze to retreat♫

844
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,180
♫Sleepless nights, risks untold♫

845
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,980
♫None of it for my own soul♫

846
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,420
♫Winds blew, rains poured♫

847
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,300
♫Umbrellas broke, we soared♫

848
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,380
♫Sky fell, ground shook♫

849
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,900
♫Through dusk till dawn I stood♫

850
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,860
♫Cars passed, dreams drowned♫

851
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:05,260
♫Every stop's chain unbound♫

852
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,300
♫Moon watched, stars blazed♫

853
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,180
♫Lamps died, connections phased♫

854
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,300
♫Held hands, laughed then cried♫

855
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,580
♫Hearts froze, parts died inside♫

856
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,220
♫Tried hard, spoke true♫

857
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,220
♫Now I'm someone I never knew♫

858
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,220
♫Love came, hate stayed♫

859
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,740
♫I arrived, you frayed♫

860
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,100
♫Voice cracked, tears burned♫

861
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
♫Life lost, lessons earned♫

862
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,700
♫Grew up, let go♫

863
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,700
♫Why cling to old sorrow♫

864
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,060
♫How many loops replay♫

865
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,740
♫Sighs steal my gaze away♫

866
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,260
♫Lost nights, bold bets♫

867
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,900
♫Nothing for my regrets♫

868
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,300
♫Winds raged, storms crashed♫

869
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,980
♫Dawns broke, I held fast♫

870
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,100
♫Cars fled, dreams fled♫

871
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:11,580
♫Every route left dead♫

872
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,100
♫Love left, hate stayed♫

873
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,980
♫Voice gone, tears paid♫

874
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,620
♫Grew strong, moved on♫

875
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:24,480
♫Why dwell when it's gone♫
