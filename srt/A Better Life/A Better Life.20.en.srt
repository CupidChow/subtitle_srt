Episode 20

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,710
Xiaozhou, may I come in?

42
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,220
Yes.

43
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,070
Come in.

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,710
So?

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,870
Any ideas about Zhong Ning's policy?

46
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,840
We could have added a second policyholder

47
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,200
to protect her son's interests,

48
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,950
but

49
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,520
Zhong Ning's parents have passed away.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,120
She doesn't have any
trustworthy relatives

51
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,800
who could serve as guarantors.

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,360
Anyway, I've

53
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,190
thought it through.

54
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,630
The result is:

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,910
before her son comes of age,

56
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,430
if Zhong Ning passes away,

57
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,030
the policy still goes to her ex-husband.

58
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,960
It's only been a few days,

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,080
and you're giving up?

60
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,680
Try to think of another way.

61
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,190
I've done my best.

62
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,150
Xiaozhou,

63
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,030
Zhong Ning is my best friend.

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,430
I can't ignore what happened to her.

65
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,030
Stop pushing me.

66
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,430
There's no other way.

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,630
Didn't you study law?

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,840
Think from your professional perspective.

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,590
See if there's any other solution.

70
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,000
Look at all these books here.

71
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,630
Take time to browse through them.

72
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,910
Maybe you'll get an idea then.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You can't give up so easily.

74
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,710
There must be a way.

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
Think it over again

76
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,910
I'm counting on you.

77
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,460
[Will & Inheritance]

78
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:07,340
[Testamentary trust]

79
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,980
[Testament + Trust]

80
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,120
Testamentary trust?

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,160
Right.

82
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,190
This is a new provision
in the Civil Code.

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,310
It means through legal acts,

84
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,360
you can entrust your estate
to someone else.

85
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,480
This person will

86
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,510
ensure your son receives the money

87
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,830
after he comes of age,

88
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,680
and they can't touch your money.

89
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,480
Simply put,

90
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,160
there's someone overseeing this money,

91
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,950
so your ex-husband can't touch
your policy.

92
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,310
your money,
and what you want to leave your child.

93
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,390
And all of this

94
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,950
as legally protected.

95
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,830
Zhong Ning.

96
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,630
Xiaozhou is a top law school graduate.

97
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,000
He's reviewed countless materials.

98
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,390
If he says it'll work, it will.

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,600
If that's really the case,

100
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,240
that would be wonderful.

101
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,750
If you trust me,

102
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,750
you can entrust me

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,950
to oversee this money.

104
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,190
The law is comprehensive now.

105
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,240
If I ever had designs on your money,

106
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,310
I'd be facing legal trouble.

107
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,270
What are you saying?

108
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
If I didn't trust you,

109
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,630
who else could I possibly trust now?

110
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,070
Alright, let's drop it.

111
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,390
That sounds so ominous.

112
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,000
See, you're doing just fine now,

113
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,480
Right?

114
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
At least,

115
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,480
you'll be around to see Jun grow up.

116
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,720
All this discussion now

117
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,480
is just precautionary.

118
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,240
Right?

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,720
Xiaozhou.

120
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,950
Should I make a will first then?

121
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,190
A testamentary trust,

122
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,800
how does that work?

123
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,360
When can we sign the policy?

124
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,270
There's no rush.

125
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,120
Let's take things one step at a time.

126
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,480
Right, don't worry.

127
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,630
I'll confirm

128
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
and verify the details.

129
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,480
Then wait for my update.

130
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,160
I'll get going now.

131
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Thank you, Xiaozhou.

132
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,360
You seem to be doing well now.

133
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,980
Yes?

134
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,830
How long do you plan to keep working?

135
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,600
If you need care later on

136
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,870
what's the plan?

137
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,680
Your illness...

138
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
Have you told our son?

139
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,800
If you need any help,

140
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,430
just tell me.

141
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,360
Zhong Ning?

142
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,310

What are you looking at?

145
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,120
I really want to know

146
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,510
what I'll look like

147
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
when I'm old.

148
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,200
That's easy!

149
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,630
Excuse me.

150
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,600
Yes?

151
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,270
Do you offer aging makeup photos?

152
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,440
Aging makeup?

153
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,840
No need for that now.

154
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,120
We can generate it with AI.

155
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,030
Really?

156
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,480
Yes.

157
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,480
Use her photo to make one, okay?

158
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,320
Sure!

159
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,720
What age do you want?

160
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,660
Well...

161
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,360

163
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,670
Sure.

164
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,240
One moment.

165
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,940
Okay.

166
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,030
Here, sit down.

167
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,200
Technology is amazing now.

168
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,390
So advanced.

169
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,360
Take a look.

170
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,790
Thank you.

171
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,270
No problem.

172
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:22,670
Good.

173
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,630
You'll still be a beautiful old lady.

174
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,080
Too bad I won't live to see that day.

175
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,030
Take this photo.

176
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,750
Give it to Jun for me,

177
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,000
so he knows what I'd look like

178
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,670
when I'm old.

179
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,320
If you're gone,

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
who'll snitch on Ding Zhiyuan for me?

181
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,270
Just for that,

182
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,440
you must stay alive,

183
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,720
so I can see his miserable end.

184
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,120
Speaking of Professor Ding,

185
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,480
that woman's pregnant.

186
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,940
Oh my.

187
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,000
Good for him.

188
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,360
Old oyster producing pearls - impressive.

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,550
That's nice.

190
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,600
When he needs the plug pulled  one day,

191
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,360
Daer will have someone to consult.

192
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,390
That mouth of yours...

193
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,670
See? She's pregnant at forty-plus.

194
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,550
Right?

195
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,750
Be more positive.

196
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,600
Anything's possible.

197
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,150
Okay?

198
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,720
I'll finish this chapter soon.

199
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,390
Go to bed.

200
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,440
Did you forget what I told you?

201
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,750
I...

202
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:51,790
I mean,

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,790
we need you.

204
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,000
There's a little kitten

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,440
always covered in splotches.

206
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,360
Because it hates baths
and washing its face,

207
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,870
everyone calls it "Little Patch".

208
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,390
It always argues convincingly,

209
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,910
"Why bother
when I'll just get dirty again?"

210
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,510
Zhiyuan.

211
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,510
I hope you'll take prenatal education

212
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,600
more seriously.

213
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,420
Well...

214
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,840
Actually,

215
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,600
you're only two months pregnant now.

216
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,360
Isn't this prenatal education

217
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,960
a bit premature?

218
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,750
No, the doctor said

219
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,200
it already has a pulse.

220
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,630
That means it's already a life.

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,030
It can hear our voices.

222
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,080
I think when Manli had Daer,

223
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,510
there was no prenatal education either.

224
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,510
So I think...

225
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,240
I know

226
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,790
you're not a first-time father.

227
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,480
This child means little to you.

228
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,870
But it's my first child.

229
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,510
I never thought at this age,

230
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,790
I can still get pregnant.

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,510
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,120
The doctor said hormones

233
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,960
would affect my emotions.

234
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,140
Well...

235
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,240
I shouldn't have said that.

236
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,510
So, shall we

237
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,840

Yes, I have.

276

Nonsense! What do you mean "give up"?

277
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,360
You earned this deal fair and square.

278
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,000
This deal wouldn't exist without you.

00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,870

284
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,670
without you, I'm actually

285
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,960
nothing at all.

When people get abandoned,

287
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,200
they tend to look down on themselves.

288
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,240
I was like that after my breakup.

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,720

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,910
Even if no man in this world wants me,

295
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,750
at least I still have my job.

296
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,360
There are still people who need me.

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,200
What?

383
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:38,920
Feeling sorry?

384
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,270
Stop the car.

385
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,680
Get this straight.

386
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,440
You're my girlfriend now.

387
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,720
Can you tell him to get the hell away?

388
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,680
Stop the car!

389
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,070
Stop the car!

390
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,860
[Hu Manli]

391
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,920
Hey, Manli.

392
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,000
Mr. Ai.

393
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,110
When are you free?

394
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,590
Xiaozhou and I want to buy you dinner.

395
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,030
You and Xiaozhou?

396
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,920
How about tonight?

397
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,160
No time like the present.

398
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,750
You're free tonight?

399
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:42,720
Great!

400
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,830
What time and where?

401
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,550
I'll text you later.

402
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,640
Okay.

403
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,110
I'll wait for your message then.

404
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,270
See you tonight.

405
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,920
Xue Xiaozhou.

406
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,720
Hello?

407
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,440
Xiaozhou.

408
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,310
We're meeting clients at six tonight.

409
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,480
I...

410
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,350
I'm not in good shape,
don't wanna meet them.

411
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,350
Have you forgotten
what I said yesterday?

412
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,400
It's just that I'm afraid

413
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,200
I'll leave a bad impression.

414
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,750
Forget it, don't ruin business.

415
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,750
It's fine, Mr. Ai is family.

416
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,440
No, I mean...

417
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,070
The client is Ai Linjiang?

418
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:06,790
Exactly.

419
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,550
Their family started bidding, you know?

420
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,750
I thought we could all
have dinner together.

421
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,240
Play the emotional card.

422
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,160
Okay, I'll go.

423
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,550
Glad to hear.

424
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,440
I'll send you the address later.

425
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,030
Let's wrap up today's discussion.

426
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,720
Any other questions?

427
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,680
No? Get back to work, then.

428
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Ai, stay for a moment.

429
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,680
I'll be away this week.

430
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,440
I've listed all your tasks.

431
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:06,900
Yes.

432
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,550
Professor Ding's submitted topic is fine.

433
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,400
But this book, Astropolitics,

434
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,270
you need to discuss it with him.

435
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,030
Personally I think

436
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,240
the content is too advanced and

437
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,550
too profound for general audience.

438
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,160
We must ask him to change topics.

439
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,000
Got it.

440
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,480
Professor Ding seems different now.

441
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,830
More approachable than before.

442
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,030
Indeed.

443
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,550
The show is at a critical juncture.

444
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,750
He knows what's at stake.

445
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,720
You must take initiative.

446
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,790
Make decisions yourself when needed.

447
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,240
Don't depend on me all the time.

448
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,030
Don't worry.

449
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,550
Just one week, I can handle it.

450
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,400
What if I'm gone longer?

451
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,550
Aren't you only taking one week's leave?

452
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,510
Plans have changed?

453
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,030
You've been with me
for almost two years.

454
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,790
Time to stand on your own.

455
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:03,880
Ning,

456
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,680
are you alright?

457
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,270
Are you really going on vacation?

458
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,720
Where else am I going?

459
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,030
Maybe I'm too used to stress.

460
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,200
Relaxing actually makes me anxious.

461
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,240
You go ahead.

462
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,680
Let me wrap things up.

463
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,240
Okay.

464
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,310
I'm off.

465
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,860
[Jun]

466
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,740
[Call rejected]

467
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,900
[You busy?]

468
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,900
[Free tomorrow night? Dinner with me?]

469
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,620
[Have plans with friends]

470
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,740
[The day after tomorrow?]

471
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,980
[Class]

472
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,620
[You name a time]

473
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:32,380
[Just text me.
I'll reply when I'm free.]

474
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,000
There's no affair.

475
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,160
Jun's dad and I just

476
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,270
have different values.

477
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,880
He wants me to care for
our son and elders.

478
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,110
But I can't endure that life.

479
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,350
That's why we split.

480
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,830
And another thing,

481
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,920
I didn't fight for custody.

482
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,720
So everyone assumes

483
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,160
a woman who abandons her child

484
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,920
must be seeing someone else.

485
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,510
But I wasn't!

486
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,510
Why won't anyone believe me?

487
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,640
I believe you.

488
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,640
Really.

489
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
Working women

490
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,200
can't take care of kids and

491
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,110
have a career at the same time.

492
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,790
With no elders at home to help out,

493
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,000
if you really get custody,

494
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,510
you'd actually harm the kid.

495
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,590
Right?

496
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:43,750
Manli.

497
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,960
Thanks for understanding me.

498
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,680
Why'd you think of buying clothes?

499
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,310
Mr. Ai booked a Michelin restaurant.

500
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,240
I checked.

501
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,750
The per-person cost is quite high.

502
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,550
How's this one, Manli?

503
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,110
I chose well, right?

504
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,030
It looks nice.

505
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,830
No discount on this one?

506
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,400
No.

507
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,110
Then it's not necessary.

508
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,310
Let's wait for a sale.

509
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,440
This one, please.

510
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,830
I'll wrap it for you then.

511
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,480
I'll wear it.

512
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,720
Wait.

513
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,440
You're usually quite frugal.

514
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,000
Why so extravagant today?

515
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,510
This is the one.

516
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,270
Trying to impress Mr. Ai, huh?

517
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,400
Sure.

518
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,590
It's settled then.

519
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,350
When the profits come in,

520
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,510
you're paying for this outfit.

521
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,110
Not my expense.

522
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,000
Yuki.

523
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,960
This coat

524
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,680
was reserved by the manager
for VIP clients.

525
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,270
If your client wants it, place

526
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:04,790
an order.

527
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,640
You hear that?

528
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,880
Take it off now.

529
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,750
Don't make Yuki lose

530
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,550
her job over this.

531
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,000
It's fine, Manli.

532
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:14,880
Let's go to checkout.

533
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,000
Wait.

534
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,750
You snatched the manager's stock.

535
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,200
What about retaliation?

536
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,480
I'm resigning tomorrow anyway.

537
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,510
Couldn't care less.

538
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:25,750
You're job-hopping?

539
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,270
Manli,

540
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,790
I'm opening my own vintage shop.

541
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,790
I'm renovating it now.

542
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,960
Come support my business.

543
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
Nice, becoming your own boss.

544
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,640
Congratulations!

545
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,750
Done chatting? Let's checkout.

546
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,750
Sorry, this way please.

547
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,440
Excuse me?

548
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:49,680
Thanks.

549
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,310
First time strangers,
second time friends.

550
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,440
Add me on WhatsApp?

551
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,000
No need, you have her contact.

552
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:55,640
Thank you.

553
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:57,880
Alright.

554
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,440
Quite a personality.

555
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,400
Don't take it to heart.

556
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,510
His mom just passed away,
and he got dumped.

557
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,680
He's not in a good mood.

558
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,270
You know?

559
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,480
Thanks, I'll be off.

560
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,030
Goodbye.

561
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,720
A single, heartbreakingly handsome guy.

562
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,960
My favorite type.

563
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,550
Cherry foie gras.

564
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,720
Wild yellow croaker.

565
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,880
Snowflake beef cubes.

566
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,160
Any fresh Australian lobster today?

567
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:46,830
Yes, we do.

568
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,640
Get me one.

569
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,350
That's all for now.

570
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,300
[Keep you clothes clean.
Refund it after dinner.]

571
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,240
What's up?

572
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,350
Let's drink?

573
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,920
No, I can't.

574
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,480
Got work to do tonight.

575
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,310
Come on, just a drink.

576
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,310
Actually, I have great news today

577
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,880
to share it with you.

578
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:20,880
Really?

579
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,270
My girlfriend said yes to my proposal.

580
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,030
Congratulations!

581
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,440
I heard from your father about it.

582
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,830
He said you had a girlfriend.

583
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,720
But I didn't expect a wedding so soon.

584
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,750
Quite efficient, I must say.

585
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,750
Who's the lucky girl?

586
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,350
We haven't known each other long.

587
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,960
She's a doctor.

588
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Doctors are great.

589
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,160
Xue...

590
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:49,830
You...

591
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,440
Doctors are good, really good.

592
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,440
Congrats, Mr. Ai.

593
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,030
Steamed yellow croaker
with yellow wine foam.

594
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,030
Cherry foie gras.

595
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,640
Jade jellyfish with sakura shrimp.

596
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,790
Australian lobster baked
with sesame sauce. Enjoy.

597
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,000
Thank you.

598
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,400
Mr. Ai.

599
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,110
Let me toast you.

600
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,350
I'm so happy for you.

601
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,000
Actually I've been pursuing her

602
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,440
for quite a while.

603
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,310
She only agreed to be my girlfriend

604
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,440
last month.

605
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,000
Though we haven't been together long,

606
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,070
she believes

607
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,200
I'm a man she can entrust her life to.

608
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,110
So it's a flash marriage then.

609
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,070
How decisive.

610
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:08,880
Xiaozhou.

611
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,800
Raise our glasses.

612
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,360
Toast to Mr. Ai.

613
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:15,920
Come on.

614
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,230
That's so rude!

615
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,440
I'm genuinely happy for you.

616
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:40,920
Thank you.

617
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,920
But mostly I'm worried.

618
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,070
Marriage is a life-changing event.

619
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,230
Don't ruin everything over some petty

620
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,670
competitive urge.

621
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,150
It harms everyone.

622
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,360
What are you talking about?

623
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,070
Manli.

624
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,960
I think Xiaozhou is right.

625
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,150
Thank you for that.

626
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,360
But what we have

627
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,150
isn't about competition.

628
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,400
Ours is true love.

629
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,630
Of course,

630
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,280
objectively speaking,

631
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,030
she has many suitors.

632
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,880
I am indeed a winner.

633
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,070
How should I put it?

634
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,550
In the real world,

635
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,190
everything is competition.

636
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,360
There's no avoiding it.

637
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,440
Victory and defeat are common in battle.

638
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,190
Don't take it to heart.

639
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,880
Right, Xiaozhou?

640
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:38,840
Here.

641
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,670
To you.

642
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,900
[What's wrong with you?
Don't offend our client.]

643
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,700
[He didn't do anything to you.]

644
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,550
Mr. Ai, here.

645
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,670
A toast to you.

646
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,920
Today's dinner

647
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,440
is to show Xiaozhou and my sincerity.

648
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,440
Compared to those

649
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,190
professional trust companies
and private banks,

650
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,110
it's true,

651
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,590
our qualifications aren't as impressive.

652
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,030
But when it comes to
knowing your family,

653
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,760
I'd say no one can match me.

654
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,840
So Xiaozhou and I

655
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:54,880
want to compete for

656
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,190
this bidding.

657
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,070
Mr. Ai,

658
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,800
if you have any questions,

659
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,510
feel free to ask me.

660
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,070
Manli.

661
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,630
We've known each other for a while.

662
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,070
I certainly trust you on this.

663
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,840
It's just

664
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,800
your colleague here.

665
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,510
Xiaozhou,

666
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,880
are you qualified to bid?

667
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,150
Yes, absolutely.

668
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,400
Let me introduce...

669
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,840
I'd like to hear it from him.

670
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,000
You want to compete.

671
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,960
With what?

672
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,510
Capability matters.

673
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,840
But it's not just about money.

674
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,760
A person's character

675
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,230
is the real core competency.

676
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:17,800
Everything you said
is correct but useless.

677
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,440
You want my business now.

678
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,230
You need my help.

679
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,320
Then act like someone
who's asking for help.

680
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,710
Right?

681
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,320
Here, allow me.

682
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
I'll drink for Xiaozhou.

683
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,800
Bottoms up, as you wish.

684
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,230
Mr. Ai, please have a seat.

685
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,630
Let me be frank with you.

686
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,510
Xiaozhou was rude today

687
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,630
and upset you.

688
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,280
There's a reason for that.

689
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,920
He's been through a lot lately.

690
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,480
Right?

691
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,360
He's still adjusting mentally.

692
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,670
Show some understanding.

693
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,590
Okay?

694
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:34,920
Then tell me.

695
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,670
What happened to you?

696
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,180
Oh my.

697
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,110
Forget it.

698
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,440
Nothing good anyway.

699
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,320
It's getting late.

700
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,960
Let's call it a night, alright?

701
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,630
Manli says it's over, then it's over.

702
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,230
Waiter.

703
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,480
The bill please.

704
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,360
Come on, I'll pay.

705
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,070
Let me.

706
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,630
Bill please.

707
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,480
We...we'll pay

708
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:54,920
I'll pay.

709
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,480
I...we...

710
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,280
- We'll pay. - Let me.

711
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,670
I'll pay.

712
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,360
- Alright, I... - No.

713
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,840
- No. - We agreed before dinner.

714
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,110
This meal is on us.

715
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,630
Xue Xiaozhou.

716
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,190
I'm a shareholder here.

717
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,590
No need for you to compete.

718
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,630
Then I insist.

719
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,840
What's there to compete?

720
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,630
You're drunk.

721
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,150
I'm paying!

722
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,030
I'm not drunk!

723
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,800
Ai Linjiang, I'm sober.

724
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,320
Today I'm competing with you!

725
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,960
You're just an insurance salesman!

726
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,440
What makes you think you can compete?

727
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,760
Why fighting? No!

728
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,000
Call security! Hurry, call security!

729
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,550
Stop! No fighting!

730
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:30,400
Compete?

731
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,000
No!

732
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,670
Stop it! Stop fighting!

733
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:34,840
No!

734
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,280
Pull them apart!

735
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,320
Separate them!

736
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,400
Listen, Ya is my girlfriend!

737
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Stop bothering her!

738
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,030
What do you mean?

739
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,030
Trying to steal my woman?

740
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,920
If it weren't for me giving you business,

741
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,070
you couldn't even afford food!

742
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,230
How dare you challenge me here?

743
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,000
Stop!

744
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,400
Stop fighting already!

745
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:06,510
Sit down!

746
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,000
Xue Xiaozhou.

747
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,590
Look at yourself now.

748
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,800
You're just a loser!

749
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:24,960
What did you call him?

750
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:28,920
Manli

751
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,800
This is between him and me.

752
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,800
None of your business.

753
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,760
It is my business!

754
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,360
He's like a brother to me.

755
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,150
Insulting him is insulting me.

756
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,030
I don't know

757
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,880
what happened between you two.

758
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,760
But I'm telling you, he's no loser.

759
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:46,960
His mother got sick.

760
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,590
He quit school
