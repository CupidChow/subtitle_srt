[Episode 23]

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,920
I hope you won't mind.

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
We need to talk.

43
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,000
I know.

44
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,120
My dad always speaks what's on his mind.

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,510
It's nothing personal.

46
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,870
What are you talking about?

47
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,640
Am I that petty?

48
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,480
Glad to hear that.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,120
I just want to know.

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
Did they say when they'll leave?

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,790
They came to

52
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,750
look after a pregnant you.

53
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,360
I guess it will be a while.

54
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,150
I know.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,750
But look.

56
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,590
My morning sickness has weakened.

57
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
And I have a nanny at home.

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,430
At the firm, I have Jiang.

59
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,470
I can't bear to have the elders

60
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,400
take care of

61
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,000

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,430

66
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,360
In a long term,

67
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,280
it'll be bad for their health.

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,960
Why don't you tell them to go home

69
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,150
later?

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,030
No.

71
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,560
They've just arrived.

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,120
What will they think?

73
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,710
I don't think so.

74
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,000
Dad and Mom are well-educated.

75
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,910
They're no average seniors.

76
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,470
They'll understand.

77
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,560
What do you think?

78
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,430
OK.

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,470
Yes.

80
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,750
I'll make time to talk to them.

81
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,800
It's settled then.

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,910

00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,360
Thanks.

91

92
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,630

96
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,630
I'll pass on that.

97
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,560
People before me must have made

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,390
enough presentations.

99
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,950
I believe you've known the benefits

100
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,950

101
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,950
various plans by now.

102
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,310
Today,

103
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,000
I just want to convey the meaning

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,600
behind legacy.

105
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,800
Tell us.

106
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,950
What do you think

107
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,510
is the most important of inheritance?

108
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,830
Fortune?

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,190
No.

110
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,310
People.

111
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,430
People change.

112
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,120
So in our plan,

113
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,950
we address

114
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,830
eliminating risks people bring.

115
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,600
Here.

116
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,480
Thanks.

117
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,630
Now turn to

118
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,040
page...

119
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,270
Please give us some private time.

120
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,830
Linjiang is

121
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,480
doing the dividing thing.

122
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,750
I can't decide for him.

123
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,510
So

124
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,430
you must've known

125
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,360
Linjiang and Xiaozhou had a fight.

126
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,310
In that way,

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,190
it'll be rude of me to ask for a favor.

128
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,630
Recently,

129
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,000
Xiaozhou told me how he thought.

130
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,560
So I thought

131
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,040
it might inspire your vendors.

132
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,480
Tell me.

133
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,630
What do you think

134
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,510
is the most important

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,390
of a family's legacy?

136
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,830
What?

137
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,190
You dare to come?

138
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,270
You want to threaten us

139
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,360
with Ma Xiaowei?

140
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,120
Don't misunderstand.

141
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,510
When I mentioned people with risks,

142
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,830
I meant you.

143
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,190
I assume everyone designed

144
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,680
their plans based on you.

145
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,600
To be frankly,

146
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,430
you're much better than Xiaowei.

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,560
What about your kids?

148
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,070
Kids after that?

149
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,680
For example.

150
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,190
If Xiaowei's kids

151
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,680
can better protect and even make better

152
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,870
use of the fortune.

153
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,270
Should we change the guardian?

154
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,240
You're saying my kids will

155
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,800
be worse than Xiaowei's?

156
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,190
Kids of me and Ya will be incompetent?

157
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:09,950
I didn't

158
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,310
say that.

159
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,430
But,

160
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,750
there's a theory

161
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,190
called social mean reversion.

162
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,600
You heard of it?

163
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,600
It means

164
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,120
great parents

165
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,240
tend to have average kids.

166
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,270
Of course it's just possible.

167
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,430
But parents usually put high

168
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,510
hopes on their kids.

169
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
In our plan, Xiaowei

170
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,240
is the biggest ticking bomb.

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,800
We deduced a worst case.

172
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,240
How is it?

173
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
One's fortune

174
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,120
is as unpredictable as the weather.

175
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,270
What if

176
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,160
Linjiang...

177
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,190
before

178
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,430
you,

179
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,870
childless?

180
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,270
What to do with Xiaowei?

181
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,920
Let's take it even more extreme.

182
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,310
What if

183
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,360
Xiaowei's the only one left?

184
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,870
This is just an assumption.

185
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,600
But you know better than us

186
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,270
what Xiaowei is.

187
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,750
Xiaozhou studied law.

188
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,310
He tends to look at the bigger picture.

189
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,800
This is his plan.

190
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,600
If you find the time...

191
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,720
Manli.

192
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,840
Thank you for your reminder.

193
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,750
I'll ask my vendor

194
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,840
to consider

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,840
all the risks.

196
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,270
Once a client, always my client.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,910
This is my principle.

198
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:11,550
Sure.

199
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,390
What did Zhonghua say?

200
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,870
Nothing.

201
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,670
Linjiang didn't hit you, did he?

202
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,200
Why would he do that?

203
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,510
But I think

204
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
I pissed him off.

205
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,360
We've tried.

206
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,840
Forget about the result.

207
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,790
Xiaozhou,

208
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,390
you've challenged yourself.

209
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,440
Well done.

210
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,120
OK, see you.

211
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,390
Look at the big mall.

212
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,510
So much clothes.

213
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,240
Dare, pick something for your grandpa.

214
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,790
He's handsome.

215
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,670
Looks good in anything.

216
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,510
I'm almost 70.

217
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,030
It doesn't matter what I wear.

218
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
We should save money for his studies.

219
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,960
Come home in the same plain clothes?

220
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,360
The family will laugh at you.

221
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,240
It's OK.

222
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,720
Mom.

223
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,630
You're going back?

224
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,390
What's the hurry?

225
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,600
No.

226
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,000
We were just talking.

227
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,390
So what's your plan?

228
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,550
I mean if you have one,

229
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,030
tell me in advance.

230
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,360
It's about to be a holiday.

231
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,240
You need to book tickets early.

232
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,550
It's OK.

233
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,320
Here's my plan.

234
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,080
When will be your book meeting?

235
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,910
That must be after the holiday.

236
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,550
I'm thinking about

237
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,550
leaving after your meeting.

238
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,550
Why?

239
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,150
You still don't get it?

240
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,960
Your dad was talking to you about that

241
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,080
Madame something.

242
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,960
He used to teach

243
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,240
and was obsessed with literature.

244
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,670
You won't ask

245
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,790
him to give a speech?

246
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,150
It was just a casual talk.

247
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,480
Don't just decide for me.

248
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,670
I think it's fine.

249
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,080
Quit being modest.

250
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,200
You guys could do a debate,

251
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,200
a hot discussion.

252
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,240
Actually,

253
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,270
it's a good idea.

254
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
I really know about

255
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,510
modern French novels.

256
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,360
That's right.

257
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,120
You two can make a good topic.

258
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,240
Prepare yourself.

259
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,000
Make your son proud.

260
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,360
Zhiyuan.

261
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,360
What do you think?

262
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,320
Mom.

263
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,240
You're...

264
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,120
Of course it's OK.

265
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,440
Great.

266
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,670
It's settled then.

267
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,390
Tell Lisu about it.

268
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,440
Honey.

269
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,270
Go.

270
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,120
Pick an outfit for the occasion.

271
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
It's OK.

272
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,320
It's not.

273
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:49,960
Daer.

274
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Pick something for him.

275
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,150
That, that one.

276
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,360
That one sells menswear.

277
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,910
The restaurant...

278
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,240
Great cooking.

279
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,600
Here's our car.

280
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,080
It's here?

281
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
You should visit your colleagues

282
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,670
on your own.

283
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,120
Won't we go together?

284
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,240
Daer still has classes.

285
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,440
Classes?

286
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,200
Yes, at night.

287
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,750
OK, get in.

288
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,390
OK.

289
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,750
Careful.

290
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,360
OK.

291
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,750
Call me when you arrive.

292
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,480
Yes.

293
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:23,870
Let's go.

294
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,150
Bye.

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,550
Let's go.

296
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,790
I have classes.

297
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,080
All your dishes are here.

298
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,200
Enjoy.

299
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,000
Thanks.

300
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,030
Come on.

301
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,720
This is your favorite.

302
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,510
Dad.

303
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,270
You don't want Grandpa to join.

304
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,080
Nonsense.

305
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,000
When did I say that?

306
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,960
Your bitter smile just now

307
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,200
almost cracked me up.

308
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,150
Really?

309
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,120
Hey.

310
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,870
No talking during meals.

311
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,670
Don't be nosy.

312
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,790
You know now

313
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,000
how many troubles Mom saved for you?

314
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,440
In the past,

315
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,670
Mom arranged everything from tickets,

316
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,750
picking them up, and

317
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,360
their tours in Shanghai.

318
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,600
They visit as they like.

319
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,840
What's the hassle?

320
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,320
After today's shopping with them,

321
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,790
you still say that?

322
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,000
What's bad about hanging out

323
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,670
with them

324
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,120
and buying stuff?

325
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,270
Dad.

326
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,270
Don't you think this is the end.

327
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,630
It's just the beginning.

328
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,750
Beginning.

329
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,600
For instance,

330
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,840
the tickets.

331
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,390
They choose berth trains over

332
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,240
bullet trains.

333
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,670
Bullet trains take only 3 to 4 hours,

334
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,440
while berth ones,

335
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,030
7 to 8.

336
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,670
They can't bear

337
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,960
sitting for hours.

338
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,320
They can lie on berths instead and

339
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,870
have to lie on the lowest one.

340
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,960
And the time.

341
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,630
They leave early in the morning.

342
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,240
So when they arrive,

343
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,480
Granny can still take a nap at home.

344
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,840
And to cap it all,

345
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,270
Mom

346
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,960
needed to guess their minds.

347
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,000
Only in that way would they be nice.

348
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,910
If she got it wrong,

349
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,030
they'd call her thoughtless,

350
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,030
ungrateful,

351
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,080
you name it.

352
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,480
She never told me.

353
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:05,630
Yes,

354
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,550
she did.

355
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,910
But you'd always say,

356
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,510
"She's my mom.

357
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,320
What should I do?"

358
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,390
Hey.

359
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,000
Mom.

360
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,670
Let me take it.

361
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,200
Was it fun?

362
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,240
He's such a big boy.

363
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,150
You could get him a taxi.

364
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,790
It's on my way.

365
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,630
New shoes?

366
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,440
Pretty good.

367
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,270
It wasn't her.

368
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,360
It was...

369
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,510
my parents.

370
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,320
Right?

371
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,390
You don't need to lie.

372
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,000
It doesn't matter.

373
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,270
You don't mind?

374
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,030
I do.

375
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,510
But this is between us adults.

376
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,480
Nothing to do with him.

377
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,390
You're an excellent lady.

378
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,320
Say goodbye to Dad.

379
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,240
Bye, Dad.

380
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,630
What did you get for dinner?

381
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,240
Spaghetti.

382
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,840
Spaghetti.

383
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:25,910
Was it good?

384
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,440
As usual.

385
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,440
Zhiyuan.

386
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,670
Did you book the tickets?

387
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,840
When will they leave?

388
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,960
It's been five days.

389
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,960
No news of our bid?

390
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,790
You'll go to the firm?

391
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,270
Zhonghua's lawyer

392
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,350
just called me.

393
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,350
How is it?

394
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,750
It's all

395
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,680
my fault.

396
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:02,880
It's OK.

397
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,720
We tried anyway.

398
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Baodan.

399
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,240
Come here.

400
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,200
Talk to Dad.

401
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,790
Cheer him up.

402
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,920
Or no one scoops your poops.

403
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,920
You laugh?

404
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,160
We won the bidding.

405
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,310
Why did you

406
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,240
lie to me!

407
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Childish.

408
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,000
You can really put up a show.

409
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,880
With a long face, you still comfort me.

410
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,640
Don't get cocky.

411
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,350
Don't think it's in the bag.

412
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Keep your eyes on the ball till the end.

413
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,110
Yes, madam.

414
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,000
Baodan.

415
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,030
You're such a lucky cat.

416
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:09,880
Come in.

417
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,400
You want me?

418
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,350
Xiaozhou.

419
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,960
Come on in.

420
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,200
Take a seat.

421
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,200
Here.

422
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,270
Congrats.

423
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,440
Another big order.

424
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,920
It's not over.

425
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,200
Sit.

426
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:28,920
Here.

427
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,270
Can you tell me about your client?

428
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,960
We haven't signed.

429
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,030
You'll know.

430
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,440
She introduced, I guess.

431
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,270
Yes, her connections.

432
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,790
You're smart.

433
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,510
I'll be straight to the point.

434
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,350
You can

435
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,880
do better

436
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:55,880
with me.

437
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,350
With you?

438
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,110
How?

439
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,200
Give me this order.

440
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,160
Of course you have the commission.

441
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,310
And I could pay you more privately.

442
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,750
You won't make money?

443
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,750
The firm wants a family office.

444
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,270
I need this

445
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,110
to prove myself to Qing.

446
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,920
If I get in,

447
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,830
I'll reward you generously.

448
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,510
That sounds tempting.

449
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,830
Xiaozhou.

450
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,070
Manli trusts you.

451
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,110
Have her resources

452
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,590
and take them to me.

453
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,200
I'll bring you into the office.

454
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,720
But,

455
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,790
I feel like I can't.

456
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,070
Why?

457
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,550
Betrayal

458
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,590
isn't virtuous.

459
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,880
You have integrity.

460
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,350
Does she have it too?

461
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,310
What do you mean?

462
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,200
She's nice to you

463
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,880
because she doesn't have a position.

464
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,030
She has to rely on you.

465
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,160
You ever thought about

466
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,310
two years later?

467
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,920
Once her ban is lifted,

468
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,310
do you still matter to her?

469
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,510
What do

470
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,110
you think she'll treat you?

471
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,880
Xiaozhou.

472
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,440
She's using you as a tool,

473
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,790
that's all.

474
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,550
Keep that in mind.

475
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,400
You're right.

476
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,880
Thank you.

477
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,790
I need time to figure out

478
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,160
what she is.

479
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,830
But I knew about you

480
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,030
long ago.

481
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,000
When I first got here,

482
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,030
without a client,

483
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,400
you didn't even buy me bubble tea.

484
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,110
And when I had a big order,

485
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,070
you gifted me a dear bag.

486
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,110
Thanks.

487
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,720
But I think it's you

488
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,350
who's making me

489
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,680
feel like a tool.

490
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,440
Xiaozhou.

491
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,030
Mind your manners

492
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,920
while I'm still nice.

493
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,310
I do.

494
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,350
I don't have any strengths

495
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,400
but I can tell who's nice to me.

496
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,070
I don't know

497
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,680
what she'll do to me.

498
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,480
People change.

499
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,110
But I know this.

500
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,200
She'll never

501
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,030
be as bad as you.

502
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,880
Thanks for inviting

503
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,960
and the water.

504
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,070
I'll be off.

505
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,480
You're using the computer?

506
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,960
I'll come later.

507
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,110
Zhiyuan.

508
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,030
You have something to tell me?

509
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,350
No.

510
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,000
When will you stop avoiding me?

511
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,720
Sit down.

512
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,960
Look at you.

513
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,750
Avoiding you?

514
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,640
About your parents.

515
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,270
Listen.

516
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,270
They'll

517
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,240
leave after the book meeting.

518
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,680
Why?

519
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,440
Mom said

520
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,200
I should invite my dad

521
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,160
to give a speech,

522
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,110
to discuss with me.

523
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,480
Mom said...

524
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,750
What do you think?

525
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,590
It's OK to

526
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,000
insert a discussion.

527
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,590
Zhiyuan.

528
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,270
I've been holding

529
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,000
Maple Book Meeting for years.

530
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,790
The guests

531
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,920
are all big bosses

532
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,000
of Shanghai.

533
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,640
They're busy.

534
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,720
They'll give half of a day.

535
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,790
What does it mean?

536
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
They're enthusiastic about culture.

537
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,510
In an event like this,

538
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,510
can you

539
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,750
really invite a middle school

540
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,070
teacher?

541
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,550
My dad knows about literature.

542
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,790
And he's my dad.

543
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,310
I can't turn him down.

544
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,000
I have no issues with your dad.

545
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,480
It's just

546
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,680
work is work.

547
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,790
It's unprofessional of you.

548
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,510
And it downgrades the meeting.

549
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,590
Can you calm down?

550
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,680
I wish I could.

551
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,830
Thought I wouldn't tell you this.

552
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,350
Here, read it yourself.

553
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,110
[Medical Records]

554
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,200
I went to the doc.

555
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,790
They said the baby

556
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
has a stunted growth,

557
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,830
probably

558
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,960
because I have a bad mood lately.

559
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,550
Yes, they're your parents.

560
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,110
But I'm also your family.

561
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,920
And so is your baby.

562
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,000
He's yours.

563
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,270
They wouldn't want anything

564
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,200
to happen to him, would they?

565
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,310
I hope

566
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,070
you think carefully.

567
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,550
Tell them

568
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,790
what you must tell.

569
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,590
OK.

570
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,790
No problem.

571
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,750
It'll be soon.

572
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,440
Thanks.

573
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,480
How's underwriting?

574
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,510
Still in inspection,

575
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,510
in process.

576
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,590
Linjiang's lawyer

577
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,510
keeps pushing me,

578
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,000
asking me if there's any problem.

579
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,350
In this way,

580
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,240
the client will get suspicious.

581
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,750
Did you push underwriting?

582
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,790
Not on phone.

583
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,350
Face to face.

584
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,160
I did.

585
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,750
It's easier to talk face to face.

586
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,000
I even brought them

587
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,920
Starbucks vouchers.

588
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,680
They didn't accept.

589
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,750
You idiot.

590
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,000
They need your coffee

591
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,240
for such a big order?

592
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,350
No, why did they delay it anyway?

593
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,590
Let me remind you.

594
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,750
You rejected Ling

595
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,440
and criticized her harshly.

596
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,240
You mean it's Ling's doing?

597
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,830
Highly likely.

598
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,440
Why?

599
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,480
If I have the order,

600
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,110
she has commission too.

601
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,550
She's hurting both of us.

602
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,510
She just hates you.

603
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,030
You stop her climbing up.

604
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,830
She'll get back at you.

605
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,110
I'll report to Qing.

606
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,680
She won't allow Ling to affect

607
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,400
the firm for personal gains.

608
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,310
That's a taboo.

609
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,680
Don't do that unless

610
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,720
you kick her out for good.

611
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,880
Can I?

612
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,480
Of course you can't.

613
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,270
Ling works for Qing for 3 years.

614
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,920
Will Qing choose you over

615
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,750
Ling?

616
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,480
Look.

617
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,510
Many of my old clients asked

618
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,270
if I was banned.

619
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,880
So I checked and found

620
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,640
Ling knows them.

621
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,510
So Ling not only

622
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,790
wants to ruin Ai's plan.

623
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,720
She wants us to

624
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,640
walk into a dead end.

625
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,200
Hi.

626
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,920
Ms. Sun, long time no see.

627
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,790
You're Tang Ling?

628
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,480
Yes.

629
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,200
We've met years ago.

630
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,070
Hello...

631
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,680
Manli and I are colleagues then.

632
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,240
I drafted the critical illness

633
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,550
plan for you.

634
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,720
Did you?

635
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,790
A small gift.

636
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,480
You're too nice.

637
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,110
Thanks.

638
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,070
Sit.

639
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,510
Yes.

640
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,960
Anything to drink?

641
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,550
Latte.

642
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,590
Miss.

643
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,960
A latte please.

644
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,240
Ms. Tang.

645
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,310
I want to know

646
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,920
why Manli

647
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,550
was banned.

648
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,790
What happened?

649
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,350
She made a mistake,

650
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,640
insurance fraud.

651
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,400
Low moral standards.

652
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,880
I see.

653
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
What about

654
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,480
the plans I bought from her?

655
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,030
There's so many.

656
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,110
Don't worry.

657
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,790
Other agents will take care of them.

658
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,350
That's good.

659
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,350
Good.

660
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,000
It's just...

661
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,510
What is it?

662
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,270
I don't know if I should tell you.

663
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,160
Tell me.

664
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,270
In a case like yours,

665
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,350
your plans are called orphaned policies.

666
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,920
The firm

667
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,750
distributes them to random agents.

668
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,920
And if you renew your plans,

669
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,960
those agents,

670
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,640
according to Blue Ocean's rules,

671
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,160
get no commission.

672
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,270
Do you think

673
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,200
they'll serve you sell?

674
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,160
What to do?

675
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,200
You have me.

676
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
Since you came,

677
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,590
it means you

678
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,270
trust me.

679
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,680
Consult me if you have

680
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,030
any questions.

681
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:14,790
OK.

682
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,480
Of course.

683
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,960
You can also buy insurance from me.

684
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,160
I can do that?

685
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,830
Yes.

686
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,880
But you left

687
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,440
Blue Ocean.

688
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,550
Yes, I'm at an insurance broker company.

689
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,920
We can do any plans

690
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,160
that are on the market.

691
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,720
A company like that?

692
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,640
Ms. Sun.

693
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,160
What do you think?

694
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,790
You can tell me.

695
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,590
OK, Ms. Tang.

696
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,920
I'll be honest with you.

697
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,920
I came because

698
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,350
I want a life insurance for my husband.

699
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,310
I used to come to Manli.

700
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,440
But once you told me about her ban,

701
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,640
I can certainly no longer do that.

702
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,270
The problem is,

703
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,200
you're a broker now,

704
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,030
a middleman.

705
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,640
I need to pay more,

706
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,830
right?

707
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,720
Rest assured.

708
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,720
You'll pay whatever

709
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,550
the insurance firm charges you.

710
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,440
And.

711
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,350
Manli and I are different.

712
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
I always do

713
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,350
win-win deals.

714
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,960
Win-win.

715
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,350
How?

716
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:50,920
OK.

717
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,000
How much do you want for this plan?

718
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,440
Here's the thing.

719
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,240
My husband

720
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,590
is kind of an executive at office.

721
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,240
People all know he has high salary.

722
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,480
But the risks are high too.

723
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,550
And we have a

724
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,790
loan of 5 million.

725
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,590
So what if he...

726
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,240
Right?

727
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,790
I can't imagine.

728
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,590
So,

729
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,720
I want a life insurance of 5 million.

730
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,350
But,

731
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,110
come to think of it.

732
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,270
Premium a year is thousands.

733
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,750
Too expensive.

734
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,240
Madam,

735
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,200
you're joking.

736
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,480
As far as I know,

737
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,510
your husband is an executive.

738
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,200
The premium

739
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,110
is nothing to you.

740
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,790
You're right.

741
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,070
But our bills

742
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,590
are long too.

743
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,590
They say international schools,

744
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,400
huge loans, and being a housewife

745
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,790
makes you go broke.

746
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,550
That's exactly what my family is like.

747
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,240
People might think we lead

748
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
a lavish life.

749
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,550
The truth?

750
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,350
Only I know.

751
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,590
I'm panicked.

752
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,000
It's hard for you.

753
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,640
How about this?

754
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,350
If you buy a plan from me,

755
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,830
I'll give you half of

756
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,000
the first year's commission.

757
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:33,640
Is

758
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,790
that appropriate?

759
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,680
Let me tell you this.

760
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,640
Many agents do so.

761
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,160
It's normal.

762
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,480
Why hasn't

763
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,000
Manli...?

764
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,160
Could she have told you?

765
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,590
Would she be honest?

766
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,480
She hid it from you,

767
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,200
two-faced.

768
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,400
She didn't want to share her interests.

769
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,270
You've been fooled for too long.

770
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,960
So,

771
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,790
Ms. Tang.

772
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,510
You sure you'll give me your commission?

773
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,590
Ms. Sun.

774
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,750
I'm sincere.

775
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,350
It's up to you.

776
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,360
[Got time?]

777
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,070
Manli, you want to see me?

778
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,670
Hi.

779
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,670
Sit.

780
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,630
Do your nails? My treat.

781
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,030
Manli.

782
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,920
I'm busy.

783
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,110
If it's just about

784
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,590
doing nails,

785
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,440
then sorry.

786
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,550
I only save time for the important.

787
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:34,960
Ling.

788
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,320
During the four years,

789
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,360
I taught you a lot,

790
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,760
but never how to destroy people.

791
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,150
You really want Xiaozhou's

792
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,630
order?

793
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,150
Yes.

794
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,480
If he won't give in,

795
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,840
will you continue

796
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,590
informing my old clients

797
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,840
that

798
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,400
I was banned?

799
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,030
What do you think?

800
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,030
It hasn't dried.

801
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,550
No, in a bit.

802
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,110
OK.

803
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,360
Unlock my phone.

804
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,110
What do you want?

805
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,440
Something you want.

806
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
My hands are occupied.

807
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,230
Tap on it.

808
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,360
Li.

809
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,510
Come back later.

810
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,150
OK.

811
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,550
What about this?

812
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,590
If you buy a plan from me,

813
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,110
I'll give you half of

814
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,230
the first year's commission.

815
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,630
Is

816
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,760
that appropriate?

817
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,550
Let me tell you this.

818
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,510
Many agents do so.

819
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,070
It's normal.

820
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,150
Why hasn't

821
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,670
Manli...?

822
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,190
She hid it from you,

823
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,920
two-faced.

824
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,110
She didn't want to share her interests.

825
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,000
You've been fooled for too long.

826
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,630
So some Tang told you

827
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,510
that I was banned due to fraud.

828
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,190
Manli.

829
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,670
We

830
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,360
spent so much on the plan

831
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,190
I bought from you.

832
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,030
Don't you trick me.

833
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,440
Manli told me this.

834
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,760
She's set up.

835
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,480
Right?

836
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
So that's why.

837
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,880
Tang keeps calling

838
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,150
me for a coffee.

839
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:55,510
OK.

840
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,590
I'll decline now.

841
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,480
No...

842
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,320
Jie, how about

843
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,030
doing me a favor?

844
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:09,840
Manli.

845
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,760
I asked Xiaozhou to check.

846
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,710
He said regulatory authorities

847
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,280
crack down on rebate.

848
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,630
With solid evidence,

849
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,480
your license could be revoked

850
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:23,840
for life.

851
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,070
I'll polish your nails.

852
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:51,960
Manli.

853
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,590
I was wrong.

854
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,960
I made a mistake.

855
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,710
For the sake of the 4 years.

856
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:00,630
Can you

857
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,360
spare me?

858
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,710
I meet you today

859
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,880
for this one last lecture.

860
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,110
Selling insurance

861
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,670
is not about getting a plan signed.

862
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,510
As a salesperson,

863
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,230
you serve your client all their life.

864
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,280
Your service starts

865
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,590
the moment the paper is signed.

866
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,630
Without that belief,

867
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,440
you won't excel in this business.

868
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,710
Yes...

869
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,280
Manli.

870
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,960
You're absolutely right.

871
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,000
I was wrong.

872
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,840
You were?

873
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,150
Yes.

874
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,480
How will you change?

875
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,440
I'll listen to you.

876
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,070
In that case,

877
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,230
I guess Zhonghua's plan

878
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,510
will soon pass inspection.

879
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,280
I see.

880
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,510
Rest assured.

881
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,880
I'll watch over this policy personally.

882
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,670
Li.

883
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,280
Coming.

884
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,440
Let me.

885
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,590
All good.

886
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,190
I have this hangnail.

887
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,030
Cut it.

888
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:27,920
OK.

889
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:29,590
Let me do it.

890
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,360
Manli.

891
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,280
I'll get going then.

892
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,000
I'll keep you posted.

893
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,590
Take care.

894
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:21,960
Mr. Ai.

895
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,760
What does Linjiang

896
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,510
think of

897
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,510
your picking us?

898
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,710
He walked away

899
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,110
when he first heard it.

900
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,150
Then

901
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,150
I analyzed and

902
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,550
made him see

903
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,550
the rules lying underneath.

904
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,440
You know about Xiaowei

905
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,440
and consider him

906
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,550
in your proposal.

907
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,440
So the division

908
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,110
is in safe hands with you.

909
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,510
He contemplated after calming down

910
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,800
and listened to me.

911
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,480
I came here to thank you

912
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,400
for burying the past

913
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,280
and choosing us in the end.

914
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,710
How would you thank me exactly?

915
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,510
I'm just one call away

916
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,840
for you anytime.

917
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,550
You lost your license

918
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,480
so you've got free time now?

919
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:29,760
Ling

920
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,670
called you too?

921
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:35,920
Mr. Ai.

922
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,230
Let me explain.

923
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,030
I did lose my certificate

924
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,630
but Xiaozhou works for TSI.

925
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,030
I'll cooperate...

926
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,590
Any difference?

927
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:52,840
Manli.

928
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,030
You

929
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,230
are still you.

930
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,280
I don't care whom you work with,

931
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,400
which firm you go to,

932
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,230
or which title you hold.

933
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,630
I only

934
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,400
acknowledge you.

935
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,360
It's you

936
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,070
who makes me

937
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,510
feel at ease.

938
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,960
Thanks for your trust.

939
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,280
Let's go.

940
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,360
Go.
