A Better Life

40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Episode 2

41
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,620
Zhong Ning,

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,380
do you know their affair all along

43
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,290
and keep it from me this whole time?

44
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,020
Hu Manli!,

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,930
that's kind of insulting.

46
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,850
Don't take your anger at
Zhiyuan out on me.

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,980
Who am I?

48
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,460
I'm his agent,

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,380
not his 24/7 personal nanny.

50
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,130
How would I know his dirty laundry?

51
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,900
You don't believe me?

52
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,820
Fine.

53
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,900
Tomorrow I'll submit my resignation.

54
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,900
I quit managing your precious
Ding Zhiyuan.

55
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,890
An viral scholar's affair
could blow up any second.

56
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,290
This hot potato?

57
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,730
Good riddance.

58
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,410
Okay, okay.

59
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,170
Don't be mad.

60
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,850
I'm just stunned

61
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,890
by something like this.

62
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,010
I can't make sense of it.

63
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,410
Neither can I.

64
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,850
Never thought Professor Ding

65
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,170
would go for this type of women.

66
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,980
What does Zhiyuan see in her?

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,260
Is she richer than me?

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,940
More gentle than me?

69
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,290
Or more cultured than me?

70
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,060
Don't laugh.

71
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,540
On the back of that love poem

72
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,730
she wrote for Zhiyuan,

73
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,940
it was that Madame de...whatever.

74
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,500
I googled this woman!

75
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,450
A professional mistress
who sponsored intellectuals too.

76
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,730
That book club she organized for Zhiyuan
is the same old trick.

77
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,130
I'm doomed.

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,010
You know what they say:

79
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,820
"A shameless mistress isn't scary,

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,060
but a cultured one is terrifying."

81
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,380
Hu Manli.

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,380
You're a top sales performer!

83
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,410
What kind of monsters haven't you seen?

84
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,410
Qiu Lisu is just a woman!

85
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,100
How could she make you doubt yourself?

86
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,890
Do you know what that woman told me?

87
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,660
What?

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,410
That's disgusting.

89
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,130
Although Zhiyuan and I

90
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,570
rarely discuss this sort of thing,

91
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,340
I never doubted

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,690
the bond between us as husband and wife.

93
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,850
Hearing her say that today,

94
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,290
I just couldn't hold it together.

95
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,100
It's just making love to your husband.

96
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,500
You didn't pay attention before,

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,730
but you can change that now.

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,780
How?

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,460
I could never do such things.

100
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,660
Hu Manli.

101
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,410
You better think clearly.

102
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,540
Do you want this man or not?

103
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,340
No one can take

104
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,780
what should be mine.

105
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,780
Then we must find a way.

106
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,930
Learn her skills to fight her.

107
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,730
I don't get it.

108
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,250
Cater to his tastes to reconcile.

109
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,220
Understand?

110
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,370
Dad,

111
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,540
can you pick up Dingding later?

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,540
Zhiyuan and I are both busy lately.

113
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,930
Look after Dingding for a few days.

114
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:01,930
Okay, thanks.

115
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,780
You're right.

116
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,250
I'll use the same method on her.

117
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,860
Exactly.

118
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,610
Zhiyuan.

119
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,580
I acted impulsively today,

120
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,900
but I don't regret it.

121
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,850
Though we've just met,

122
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,980
I can't watch you

123
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,020
stuck in

124
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,490
a relationship that drains you

125
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,410
and sink in misery.

126
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,220
If this continues,

127
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,650
you'll burn yourself out completely.

128
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,540
This is absolutely
not what I want to see.

129
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,060
So today,

130
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,250
I decided to be reckless for once.

131
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,930
Not for myself,

132
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,340
but for you.

133
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,610
Rome wasn't built in a day.

134
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,900
The problems between her and me

135
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,290
have nothing to do with you.

136
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,610
It's just that,

137
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,020
she and I are married for
more than ten years.

138
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,220
Also, we have a child together.

139
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,250
If it's because of the child,

140
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,410
I believe you two

141
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,580
should make a clean break instead.

142
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,900
How could a man who's drained

143
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,980
all affection from his marriage

144
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,610
still have energy to be a good father?

145
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,460
If you return to the family
for the child,

146
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,140
do you think Hu Manli

147
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,460
would just pretend nothing happened?

148
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,610
Would she simply let you off?

149
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,540
There's still

150
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,170
a long road ahead.

151
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,540
Zhiyuan,

152
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,930
whatever decision you make,

153
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,140
I'll accept it

154
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,460
and support you.

155
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,410
Just remember,

156
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,900
when you turn around,

157
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,220
I'll always be behind you,

158
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,810
waiting for you.

159
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,220
You're back.

160
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,060
Why are the lights off?

161
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,530
Just say what you want to say.

162
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,220
Come here.

163
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,850
No, I'll stay sitting here.

164
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,060
Come here now.

165
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,730
I'm staying here, I...

166
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,420
What are you trying to do?

167
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,850
Look how I'm dressed.

168
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,180
What do you think I want?

169
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,220
Anyway,

170
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,980
we're still married, right?

171
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,610
After everything today,

172
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,370
I think we should talk calmly,

173
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,770
instead of all this nonsense.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,610
What happened today

175
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,850
makes me angry

176
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,300
and hurt.

177
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,220
But listen,

178
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,770
I can forgive you,

179
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,370
as long as you promise me,

180
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,060
no more book clubs and

181
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,890
not seeing that woman again.

182
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,220
Then I can pretend

183
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,890
nothing ever happened.

184
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,770
When couples married for long,

185
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,340
all feelings fade over time.

186
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,100
It's the same for everyone.

187
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,730
In the past,

188
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,250
I did neglect you because of work.

189
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,370
That was my fault.

190
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,250
I'll change.

191
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,220
Okay?

192
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,460
Let's work on it together.

193
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,420
We can definitely go back to
how we were.

194
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:10,940
Alright?

195
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,020
Manli!

196
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,580
Hu Manli!

197
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,910
I'm begging you.

198
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,130
At least change out of these clothes.

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,180
I really can't take this.

200
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,610
What do you mean?

201
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,820
A woman is taking the initiative,

202
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,770
and this is how you treat me?

203
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,340
So much happened today.

204
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,220
Now isn't really the right time.

205
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,300
Then pick a time.

206
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,460
Tomorrow or the day after?

207
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,490
How can you

208
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,130
schedule such things?

209
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,770
With other women, no scheduling needed.

210
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,490
Sparks fly when they may.

211
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,370
But with your wife, you need a schedule!

212
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,100
Otherwise,

213
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,580
I'll probably die before it happens.

214
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:15,660
You...

215
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,980
I have nothing to say
to someone like you.

216
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,980
Excuse me?

217
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,770
You're the one who cheated!

218
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,250
You betrayed me!

219
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,630
Not only didn't I blame you,

220
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,060
I even tried to fix things with you.

221
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,770
What more do you want?

222
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,340
I don't want anything.

223
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,420
I'm just tired.

224
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,370
I need some space.

225
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,530
You're crazy! What are you doing?

226
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,490
Tell me.

227
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,820
You already know everything.

228
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,700
What more is there to say?

229
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,890
Why could you do it with her

230
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,700
but not with me?

231
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:07,770
Tell me.

232
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,530
Tell me!

233
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,300
What are you doing?

234
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,130
Are you gonna talk?

235
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,340
Are you gonna tell me?

236
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,990
What are you doing?

237
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,530
You're insane!

238
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,220
Tell me!

239
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,980
What are you doing?

240
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,220
Give it back!

241
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,530
Give it back! Give it back!

242
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,700
Tell me!

243
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,250
Give it back!

244
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,530
Give it back to me!

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,890
Because I love her!

246
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,700
What did you say?

247
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,530
I said I love her.

248
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,080
The moment I see her,

249
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,340
she's the only one I ever want.

250
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,490
Forever!

251
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,610
I feel she and I

252
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,770
are completely compatible!

253
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,220
Completely compatible? I'm your wife!

254
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,890
You stand before me,

255
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,060
saying you love another woman.

256
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,610
What am I then?

257
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,130
Tell me.

258
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,300
What am I?

259
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,420
What am I?

260
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,100
You simply don't realize it.

261
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,890
Over the years,
I've grown afraid of you,

262
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,820
Afraid of me?

263
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,610
Afraid of what?

264
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,180
I get nervous when you approach me.

265
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,460
I dread your constant nagging,

266
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,940
about houses, cars, money,

267
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,700
the things I hate most!

268
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,180
Don't you live in this house?

269
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,940
Don't you drive these cars?

270
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,420
Don't you spend that money?

271
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,030
Here we go again.

272
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,250
Hu Manli, don't you see

273
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,220
what you've become?

274
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,220
What have I become?

275
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,370
Richer and more powerful!

276
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,700
I'm upsetting the noble Professor Ding.

277
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,340
How strange.
I was just like this before.

278
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,700
Why didn't you complain then?

279
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,460
Back then you needed me.

280
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,700
You needed my money
to support the family.

281
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,490
You needed me to pay for your degree.

282
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,580
Stop it.

283
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,490
I was just as money-driven before

284
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,940
Why no objections back then?

285
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,630
Now that you're successful,

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,130
you won't take orders anymore.

287
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,850
Listen, Ding Zhiyuan.

288
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,770
Your success is all thanks to me.

289
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,850
Even Zhong Ning came through
my connections.

290
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,490
Without me, Ding Zhiyuan,

291
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,850
you're nothing at all!

292
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,770
Everything came from you?

293
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,460
Fine.

294
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,530
Take it back.

295
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,180
I'll return it all.

296
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,730
Everything you gave, I'll return them.

297
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,850
If it all came from you,

298
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,100
then I'll give it all back.

299
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,460
If you're not satisfied,

300
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,850
go report me to the school.

301
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,250
Have them fire me.

302
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,420
Take everything back.

303
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,940
Ruin my reputation.

304
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,130
Make me infamous forever.

305
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,100
Hu Manli, I'm telling you.

306
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,370
I can overlook all these things,

307
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,340
but you can't trample on my dignity

308
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,850
or insult my character!

309
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,890
Zhiyuan,I'm sorry.

310
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,060
I'm so sorry.

311
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,890
Stop it! Don't be mad.

312
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,250
Forgive me! I'm sorry.

313
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,850
Zhiyuan, I'm sorry.

314
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,130
What I said earlier
was just anger talking.

315
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,300
I-I-I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

316
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,010
From now on,
things you don't want to hear,

317
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,130
I'll never say again.

318
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,170
Things you don't want to do,

319
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,010
I won't force you either.

320
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,850
Okay? Zhiyuan, forgive me.

321
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,300
I was wrong, don't be angry, okay?

322
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,100
Hu Manli.

323
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,770
I want a divorce.

324
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,060
What did you say?

325
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,530
I said I want a divorce.

326
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,220
No!

327
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,530
I said it! I want a divorce!

328
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,090
Listen to me.

329
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,490
I love her.

330
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,770
And she loves me.

331
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,090
Most of my life is already gone.

332
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,250
Now,

333
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,460
it's time I live for myself.

334
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,010
I won't do it!

335
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,420
Come back here!

336
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,940
Come back!

337
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,620
Come back!

338
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,380
Pony flies. Pony flies.

339
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,860
After Dad finishes up,

340
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,140
Mom will take you to get some sun.

341
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,570
Dad's here.

342
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,220
Dad's here! Let Dad eat.

343
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,380
Go to Daddy.

344
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,290
Daddy's here.

345
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,050
[Doctoral Degree Certificate]

346
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,460
Late again today.

347
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,660
Working overtime again?

348
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,460
Too busy.

349
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,730
If you ask me,

350
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,290
when work gets busy

351
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,940
missing one day occasionally is fine.

352
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,460
I'm always here, don't worry.

353
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,180
It's alright.

354
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:55,770
Let me.

355
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,660
You scared me.

356
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,620
You're still here?

357
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,620
Waiting for your shift ends.

358
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,330
It's pretty safe now,

359
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,700
but you're so beautiful.

360
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,940
I worry someone might harass you.

361
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,050
That makes sense.

362
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,700
Here.

363
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,810
You bought this?

364
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,900
I ran several kilometers

365
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,380
just to get this for you.

366
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,290
I was afraid they'd close.

367
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,090
I'm exhausted.

368
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,570
You've worked all day.

369
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,900
You take care of your mom at night.

370
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,810
Yet you invent new ways
to cheer me up.

371
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,580
Aren't you tired?

372
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,010
Of course I am, but what can I do?

373
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,010
I fell in love with such a foodie.

374
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,620
Xue Xiaozhou!

375
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,090
What did you just say?

376
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,290
You're the foodie here!

377
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,380
Look.

378
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,700
They got a new cat.

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,250
[Pet's Home] So special - it's black.

380
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,460
What's special about black?

381
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,860
See how adorable it is?

382
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,090
Where? It's ignoring you.

383
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,810
You just don't get it.

384
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,420
I like how it ignores me.

385
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,620
So aloof and cool.

386
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,620
Let's go check it out.

387
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,660
Is this their cat tag?

388
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,700
This one.

[Devon Rex: 3,999 Yuan]

390
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,900
So expensive!

391
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,280
It's okay. Let's go inside.

392
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:54,770
Come on.

393
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,940
Let's go.

394
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,810
No, it's okay.

395
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,420
It's fine.

396
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,010
Let's leave.

397
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,380
We can adopt one some day.

398
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,620
Adoption over shopping.

399
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,430
Let's go.

400
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,460
So expensive.

401
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,530
Xiaozhou,

402
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,940
your stepmom is way out of line.

403
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,460
Right after your dad passed away,

404
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,980
without a second thought,

405
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,460
she cut off your living expenses.

406
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,940
And now,

407
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,530
she wants to sell your inherited house.

408
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,140
I refused.

409
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,090
500,000 is indeed too little.

410
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,620
Your family's house

411
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,860
can at least

412
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,730
sell for

413
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,860
eight to ten million.

414
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,050
Maybe negotiate with them

415
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,420
for a fifty-fifty split?

416
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,420
It's not about the money.

417
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,220
True, now's not the right time to sell.

418
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,010
It's not... I mean...

419
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,380
Because it's home to me.

420
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,700
Home isn't for selling.

421
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,180
Xiaozhou.

422
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,860
Emotionally, I understand you,

423
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,730
but you should consider reality too.

424
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,330
Right?

425
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,900
When your dad was alive,

426
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,490
you had the best of everything.

427
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,940
But right now,

428
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,980
your rent, daily expenses,

429
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,050
plus your mom's nursing fees

430
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,380
have almost drained our savings.

431
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,290
I know.

432
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,810
That's why I took the job at Blue Ocean.

433
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,490
But even if you become
a regular employee next month,

434
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,140
your salary would only be
seven, eight thousand.

435
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,660
That won't even cover the rent.

436
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,340
What do you do then?

437
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,560
Ya,

438
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,160
come here.

439
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,770
I have an idea.

440
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,090
I want to switch from office to sales.

441
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,940
You plan to sell insurance?

442
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,660
Wouldn't that earn more?

443
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,570
But you...

444
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,330
Are you sure?

445
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,180
I didn't tell you before

446
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,250
because I was hesitating too.

447
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,980
But recently,

448
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,180
I read our top sales agent's resume.

449
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,670
A vocational school graduate.

450
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,460
20 years ago, she was our receptionist.

451
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,420
Xiaozhou,
education doesn't mean everything.

452
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,050
I know, that's not what I meant.

453
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,090
I'm not looking down on her

454
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,880
because of her education.

455
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,050
I think with my higher education,

456
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,620
my starting point should be higher.

457
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,570
I want to give it a try.

458
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,010
What if it works?

459
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,980
I agree.

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,330
I support you.

461

Wait, you...you're not lying to me?

462
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,660
You really think I can do it?

463
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,050
Of course! You're a law graduate.

464
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,220
If you sell insurance,

465
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,570
it'd be an unfair advantage.

466
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,810
You could easily outperform them.

467
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,250
Okay, I'll follow your lead.

468
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,380
Might as well try it.

469
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,330
Go for it.

470
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,330
Alright, go for it.

Xianglin's Wife is hailed as
the philosopher of Luzhen.

473
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,620
She fires rapid questions in the story.

474
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,420
Do souls exist after death?

475
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,330
Is there a hell?

476
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,770
Can deceased family members reunite?

477
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,490
Xianglin's Wife asks these

478
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,140
because of her miserable life.

479
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,330
But these questions

480
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,180
are unavoidable life questions

481
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,140

Don't be foolish, Zhiyuan.

Zhiyuan! Zhiyuan!

570
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,700
Ma'am, are you okay?

571
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:38,920
Let's go.

572
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,380
Let's go.

573
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,330
Ma'am,

574
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,620
what could possibly be so troubling?

575
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,900
Ma'am, are you okay?

576
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,330
It's nothing.

577
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,810
I lost something.

578
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,490
Why didn't you call for help?

579
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,980
You just jumped?

580
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,050
What if something happened?
Who'd be responsible?

581
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,490
Here, let me help you up.

582
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,490
I'm fine.

583
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,330
It's alright.

584
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,140
If I die, then I die.

585
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,010
No problem.

586
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,810
♫Wave once more then release♫

587
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,810
♫One last wave to false peace♫

588
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:19,450

589
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:26,250

♫Glance back where shadows hide♫

Parting ways with no regrets.

619

Wishing us both happiness apart.

620
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,650
You'll regret this.

621
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,420
Someday,

622
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,090
You'll beg me to come back to me.

623
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,920
♫That fire won't subside♫

624
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,780
About the breakup,

625
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,460
don't tell anyone yet

626
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,570
Why?

627
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,530
My dad has high blood pressure.

628
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,260
I'm afraid the shock might be too much.

629
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,610
Our son's in his
sensitive teenage years.

630
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,820
I don't want it affecting his studies.

631
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,600
Okay.

632
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,610
I'll do that.

633
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,340
Manli, your coffee.

634
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,380
Thank you.

635
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,460
Manli, why are your eyes so swollen?

636
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:54,860
Caught a cold too?

637
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,340
Not really.

638
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,980
Probably drank too much water
before bed.

639
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,420
This is the medicine
I got from the company last time.

640
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,010
Keep it just in case.

641
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,490
Thanks.

642
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,570
By the way,

643
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,780
about the insurance claim
for Mr. Ai's family,

644
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,090
why was it rejected?

645
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,900
He said the documents were incomplete,

646
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,490
missing Mrs. Ai's death certificate.

647
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,210
That's ridiculous.

648
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,210
Who would fake a death for insurance?

649
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,010
Exactly.

650
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,010
Tell them to proceed first.

651
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,010
We'll submit it later.

652
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,170
I did.

653
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,650
But the new claims officer
won't approve it.

654
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,940
New guy?

655
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,130
What's his name?

656
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,820
Xue Xiaozhou.

657
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,690
He's very stubborn.

658
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,210
Won't budge either way.

659
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,740
Xu, it's Hu Manli.

660
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,170
Ms. Hu!

661
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,940
I'm free, go ahead.

662
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,820
I want to ask about someone

663
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,460
in your claims department.

664
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,050
Did someone named

665
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,380
Xue Xiaozhou join you?

666
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,980
One moment please.

667
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,980
Is he connected to clients

668
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,380
or from within our group?

669
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,170
Neither.

670
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,050
Neither.

671
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,340
Then this young man

672
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,940
might be a bit too eager to impress.

673
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,530
He's only been here a few months.

674
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,380
He hasn't fully grasped

675
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,610
the company's internal situation yet.

676
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,260
Alright, I understand.

677
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,340
Xu.

678
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,490
how was that Pu'er tea
I gave you last time?

679
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:25,600
Good.

680
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,650
It really warms the stomach.

681
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,210
Thanks, thanks for that.

682
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,380
You're welcome.

683
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,050
Bye.

684
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,820
Goodbye.

685
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:37,940
Manli.

686
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,480
So?

687
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,340
No special background.

688
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,420
Not related to anyone either.

689
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,420
What's going on?

690
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,120
Come in.

691
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,050
Xu.

692
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,300
Mr. Xu.

693
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:55,650
Ms. Hu.

694
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,490
Xue Xiaozhou.

695
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,980
Hello, I'm Hu Manli.

696
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,940
Hello.

697
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,610
There's a death claim case.

698
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,610
Are you handling it?

699
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,940
Deceased.

700
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,570
Female, 55 years old, lung cancer.

701
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,570
Passed away one month ago.

702
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,570
Missing the hospital death certificate.

703
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:14,940
Good memory.

704
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,610
The documents were incomplete.

705
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,380
It was indeed our oversight.

706
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,340
But please be considerate.

707
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,690
The client's family
has funeral arrangements.

708
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,460
When submitting materials,

709
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,780
oversights are inevitable.

710
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,420
I've asked the client to supplement it.

711
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,420
It'll be delivered soon.

712
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,980
Okay, how long will it take roughly?

713
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:32,860
Very soon.

714
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,260
How soon is "very soon"?

715
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,940
I'll monitor it, rest assured.

716
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,090
Meanwhile,

717
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,820
please expedite the review.

718
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,650
Aim for payment by next Wednesday.

719
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,260
Sorry, incomplete materials
can't be processed.

720
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,050
Next Wednesday might be unrealistic.

721
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,090
Shall we exchange WeChat?

722
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:56,600
Okay.

723
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,900
Let me scan you.

724
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:00,640
Here.

725
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,210
Accept the request.

726
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,130
It's hot.

727
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,050
Let me buy you an iced latte.

728
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,090
Be it us agents or claims department,

729
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,860
we're all serving the clients.

730
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,780
Be considerate.

731
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,560
Ms. Hu,

732
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,570
there are
hundreds of claims clients daily.

733
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,820
None can afford to wait.

734
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,210
Even if you bring a knife,

735
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,420
I still have to follow procedures,

736
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,300
let alone a latte.

737
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:37,910
Right?

738
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,460
Young man.

739
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,420
You're building an image, huh?

740
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,130
What image?

741
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,940
Cold, unapproachable persona.

742
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,260
Stick to principles, follow rules.

743
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,080
Yes,

744
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,690
people respect those with conviction.

745
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,980
As a newcomer,

746
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,780
it's impressive you grasped that.

747
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,210
But your approach needs refinement.

748
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,740
Should've taken my coupon.

749
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,780
Know when to quit while ahead.

750
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,090
Or else?

751
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,380
Handle claims carelessly.

752
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,900
I can't stop complaints if they come.

753
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,380
I'm legally compliant, so complain away.

754
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,740
Quite the strong personality.

755
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,090
You're a claims adjuster,

756
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,980
yet you act like a superhero.

757
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,940
Thanks for the compliment.

758
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,340
Can't reach it but aspire to.

759
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:44,910
Great.

760
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,260
You're amazing.

761
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,690
I'm waiting for you up ahead.

762
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,420
Sorry, Mr. Xue.

763
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,010
Chunlu, let's go.

764
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,490
My apologies.

765
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,000
Coming.

766
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,380
We cannot

767
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,170
afford to offend the claims department.

768
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,210
Otherwise the follow-up work
won't go smoothly.

769
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,300
So what if I offended him?

770
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,870
A new hire of few months
dares to offend me.

771
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:05,610
Is he out of his mind?

772
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,490
But...

773
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,420
No buts.

774
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,260
Many companies want to poach me.

775
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,820
These Blue Ocean folks don't get it.

776
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,940
Giving me attitude?

777
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,980
Manli,

778
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,490
are you job-hopping?

779
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,900
Of course not.

780
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,690
Mr. Jin treats me so well.

781
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,210
Jump ship right after Insurance Star?

782
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,650
I could never do such a thing.

783
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,260
Chunlu, no offense but

784
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,650
he doesn't know my market value.

785
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,490
You should show him where you stand.

786
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,610
You even apologized to him.

787
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,340
How embarrassing!

788
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,130
I get it now, Manli.

789
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,460
I'll be more careful next time.

790
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,490
Get to work.

791
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,170
I need to call Mr. Ai.

792
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,040
Okay.

793
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:40,640
Come here.

794
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,460
What's up?

795
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,340
It's compliance training later.

796
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,340
Sign attendance for me.

797
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,740
Me again?

798
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,610
Mr. Ai?

799
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,130
This is Manli.

800
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,210
My condolences.

801
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:53,900
What unfortunate timing.

802
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,210
Our claims adjuster
is also having a funeral.

803
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,660
♫If I close both eyes tonight♫

804
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,540
♫Back to that wishing summer night♫

805
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,300
♫Wind brushes your shaking frame♫

806
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,100
♫That world feels close just the same♫

807
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,500
♫If I dare to face the dawn♫

808
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,220
♫Do you know this face you'd drawn♫

809
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:31,020
♫Gray spirals looped in endless chase♫

810
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,820
♫Tracing tears not words they trace♫

811
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,580
♫How many times must this repeat♫

812
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,100
♫Sighs pull my gaze to retreat♫

813
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,940
♫Sleepless nights, risks untold♫

814
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:50,740
♫None of it for my own soul♫

815
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,180
♫Winds blew, rains poured♫

816
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,060
♫Umbrellas broke, we soared♫

817
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,140
♫Sky fell, ground shook♫

818
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,660
♫Through dusk till dawn I stood♫

819
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,620
♫Cars passed, dreams drowned♫

820
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:05,020
♫Every stop's chain unbound♫

821
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,060
♫Moon watched, stars blazed♫

822
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,940
♫Lamps died, connections phased♫

823
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,060
♫Held hands, laughed then cried♫

824
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,340
♫Hearts froze, parts died inside♫

825
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,980
♫Tried hard, spoke true♫

826
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,980
♫Now I'm someone I never knew♫

827
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,980
♫Love came, hate stayed♫

828
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,500
♫I arrived, you frayed♫

829
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,860
♫Voice cracked, tears burned♫

830
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,860
♫Life lost, lessons earned♫

831
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,460
♫Grew up, let go♫

832
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,460
♫Why cling to old sorrow♫

833
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:44,820
♫How many loops replay♫

834
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,500
♫Sighs steal my gaze away♫

835
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,020
♫Lost nights, bold bets♫

836
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,660
♫Nothing for my regrets♫

837
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,060
♫Winds raged, storms crashed♫

838
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,740
♫Dawns broke, I held fast♫

839
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,860
♫Cars fled, dreams fled♫

840
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:11,340
♫Every route left dead♫

841
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,860
♫Love left, hate stayed♫

842
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,740
♫Voice gone, tears paid♫

843
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,380
♫Grew strong, moved on♫

844
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,380
♫Why dwell when it's gone♫
