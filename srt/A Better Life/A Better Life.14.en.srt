Look at how think you are.

00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,870
You might not fight me.

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,710
That's not the problem.

Hi.

66
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,800
Why does it feel so awkward?

67
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,080
You can call me

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,280
brother.

69
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,150
No.

70

If he calls you brother,

71
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,960
I'll be your aunt.

76
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,560
That's quick, Mom.

77
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,400
What is?

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,560
Dad just left,

79
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,840
and you found another man.

80
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,000
A young guy.

81
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,680
Hey, stop that.

82
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,280
I don't mind. I'm open-minded.

83
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,630
Shhh.

84
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,680
Do your homework.

85
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,910
I don't think I can live her.

86
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,840
You don't?

87
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,560
I finally found you a room.

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,710
You gave up on your own.

89
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,310
Don't say I didn't help later.

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,000
No, I won't. Thanks.

How long will you be staying?

96
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,030
At least one week.

97
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,240
OK. I'll take a 2,000

98
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,910
deposit.

99
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,840

100
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Or group purchase price?

Any discounts on any apps?

Sorry.

And we didn't...

105
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,830
You have a cat, sir?

115
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,870
Sorry.

Sorry.

00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,390
How much?

121
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,160
300 per night.

If necessary,

129
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,920
I can live at my classmate's place.

130
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,950
But you have to persuade my mom.

131
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,630
No no no, you're mistaken.

132
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,680
I don't want you home.

133
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,870
No, I want you to be home.

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,800
All the time.

135
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,430

136
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,920

Yes yes yes, but

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,870
it has to live with me.

142
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,830

Baodan.

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,560
It's called Baodan.

153
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,600
Mom, I promise.

154
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,120
If you keep Baodan,

155
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,390
I'll be among top 10

156
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,600
in the next English exam.

157
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,870
Thank you.

158
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,750
You'd better get an average

159
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,160
score first.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,190
Bad at English?

161
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,430
Simple.

162
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,310
I tutor him.

163
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,240
I'm good.

164
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,630
I got 145 points in English in NCEE.

165
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,950
I passed the CET-6 exam as a freshman.

166
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,240
I became an interpreter next year.

167
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,870
Did you?

168
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,480
But that still

169
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,360
doesn't make you a good teacher.

170
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,390
Not a problem.

171
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,950
I promise.

172
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,430

173
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
this semester, no,

174
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,360

175

he's be among top 10.

176
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,040
Or I got kicked out with the cat.

177
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,600
Yes, Mom, I'll work hard.

178
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,950
If I fail,

179
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,360
you kick me out too.

180
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,630

181
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,800

Get an agreement?

186
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,480

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,360

If you fail...

191
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,440
I, he, and the cat, we all go.

192
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,600
Where would you go?

193
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,550
If you fail,

194
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,390
I won't make things difficult.

195
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,390
Let's talk about intermediary fee.

196
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,910
I take 80%, you 20%.

197
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,120
20%.

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,360
You really take me as an idiot?

199
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,120
No.

200
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,600
This is negotiation.

201
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,870
You need to talk.

202
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,750
Why don't you both take a step back?

203
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,080
For my sake.

204
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,240
For the sake of Dingding,

205
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,270
I'll elaborate for you.

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
You take 20% of the fee

207
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,600
and a big advantage.

208
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,670
In a neighborhood like this,

209
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,600
with such living conditions,

210
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,670
even a single room

211
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,750
costs 3,000.

212
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,390
I'll charge 200 for food.

213
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,360
200?

214
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,630
What do you eat every day?

215
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,910
Truffle?

216
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,030
Is manpower free?

217
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,320
This is a private kitchen.

218
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,750
You pay at least 500 per person

219
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,670
for a meal like this out there.

220
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,510
Don't push it.

221
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,000
200 a day.

222
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,670
That's 6,000 a month.

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,870
And cleaning.

224
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,270
A cleaner charges 50 per hour.

225
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,150
And I need to book them 3 days ahead.

226
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,150
In all,

227
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,870
that'll cost 2,000 a month.

228
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,630
You have to pay me

229
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,200
almost 10,000

230
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,150
just by living here.

231
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,030
Won't you pay?

232
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,600
Hey.

233
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,080
If you put it that way...

234
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,510
OK. Here's what I think.

235
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,870
Listen carefully.

236
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,790
With my resume,

237
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,390
I can charge 200 per hour

238
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,320
for 1:1 tutoring.

239
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,030
That's 400 a day here.

240
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,960
What about a month?

241
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,630
12,000.

242
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:30,960
In that way,

243
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,120
you have to pay me instead.

244
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,000
You're such a nerd.

245
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,080
Wrong.

246
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,030
My 10,000

247
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,080
is a definite investment.

248
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,200
You'll have my food,

249
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,240
live in my house.

250
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,360
But the outcome of

251
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,440
your tutoring is indefinite.

252
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,390
Now apart from my investment on you,

253
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,960
I take risks.

254
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,600
If his grades drop

255
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,840
after your tutoring,

256
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,960
what can I do?

257
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
Impossible.

258
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:57,960
Anything

259
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,480
is possible.

260
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,000
I remember someone saying:

261
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,720
I'll never work with you.

262
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,670
Blah blah blah.

263
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,550
Didn't they apologize to me

264
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,670
and go back on their word?

265
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,270
Why are you bringing that up now?

266
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,840
Mom.

267
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,440
Easy. Be nice.

268
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,870
Calm down.

269
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,030
To think I'll risk

270
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,630
my son's future

271
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,910
for 10% commission.

272
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,440
I'll lose big.

273
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
OK, for the sake of Dingding.

274
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,390
Just in case his grades drop,

275
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,120
I'll give you 10%.

276
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,150
Add that one.

277
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,240
Deal.

278
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:57,870
Done.

279
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,320
This is sudden.

280
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,440
I'll have a cat now.

281
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,870
Take a look.

282
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
[Deal!]

283
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,000
Show me your diploma

284
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,630
and whatever certificates you got

285
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,440
later.

286
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,360
I'll verify.

287
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,510
Hu Manli.

288
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,270
You had all this planned out

289
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,320
from the moment

290
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,550
I asked you for help.

291
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,670
Young man,

292
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,120
think positive.

293
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,600
This is exchanges of resources.

294
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,510
We then know each other better

295
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,200
and work more closely.

296
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,150
- Isn't it nice.
- Fine.

297
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,440
Whatever you say.

298
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,200
Leave the cat alone.

299
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,870
The teacher is in front of you.

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,080
Ask him to check your homework.

301
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:10,910
Hey.

302
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,840
What is it?

303
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,720
Starting tonight?

304
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,960
Yes.

305
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,440
You won't stay tonight?

306
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,240
I...

307
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,720
Do what she says, Mr. Xue.

308
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,120
Baodan, let's go.

309
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,030
Follow me.

310
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,150
Homework, no cat.

311
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,240
Got it.

312
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,030
Wait a sec.

313
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:28,910
I'll...

314
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,910
Let me do it.

315
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,910
Help him with homework.

316
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,480
Dingding, keep the cat off the bed.

317
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:34,910
It's dirty.

318
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,670
OK?

319
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,320
You finished?

320
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,480
That's all.

321
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,120
OK.

322
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:49,720
Thanks.

323
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,790
Coming right up.

324
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,790
Mr. Ai,

325
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,270
it'll be my treat.

326
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,550
Can't let a girl pay.

327
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,440
I'll do it.

328
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,720
No.

329
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,240
I should thank you for your humidifiers.

330
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,550
I never asked a girl out.

331
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,960
Thought flowers won't go wrong.

332
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,790
Sorry about that.

333
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,120
I asked my friends.

334
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,270
They say docs are always washing hands.

335
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,270
And it gets dry in winter.

336
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,790
So I donated humidifiers.

337
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,120
But don't feel burdened.

338
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,600
It's for the hospital,

339
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,670
not you.

340
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,750
Folk there took good care of my mom

341
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,030
during her last days.

342
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,600
I really appreciate it.

343
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,240
This

344
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,790
is for you only.

345
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,630
This is...

346
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,750
That was thanks.

347
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,750
This

348
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,960
means goodwill.

349
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,360
Mr. Ai.

350
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,320
I speak

351
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,750
what's on my mind.

352
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,670
Me too.

353
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,750
Guess many girls

354
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,510
like your present.

355
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,510
Do you?

356
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,480
They like you too.

357
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,120
Why

358
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,320
get the cold shoulder from me?

359
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,390
Nice.

360
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,510
Keep up the good work.

361
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,600
I live in that lady's home.

362
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,840
I just tutored his son.

363
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,030
She let me live

364
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,240
in this study.

365
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,080
That's good.

366
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,510
Here's Baodan.

367
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,120
Are you mad?

368
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,240
Don't worry.

369
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,360
I just live here.

370
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,790
And his son is home too.

371
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,670
Why should I be?

372
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,270
I think she's nice.

373
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,440
Work with her nicely.

374
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,240
I will.

375
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
[Top broker gets a car!]

376
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,150
Tomorrow 2 PM.

377
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,150
Ms. Duan will talk about your mom's surgery.

378
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,270
Don't be late.

379
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,670
I've set an alarm clock.

380
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,000
Xiaozhou.

381
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,030
Have fruits. Can I come in?

382
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:55,960
Yes.

383
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,360
Have some fruit after dinner.

384
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,670
Ya, gotta go.

385
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,110
you were video calling?

386
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,960
Sorry.

387
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,350
I want to ask.

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,030
The best broker

389
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,960
of Q1 gets a car

390
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,270
at TSI?

391
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:26,920
How did you know?

392
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,160
From the group chat.

393
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,000
That's it then.

394
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,790
Verify for me please.

395
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,790
Ask your director.

396
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,830
By the way.

397
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Whose team are you on?

398
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,550
You won't know.

399
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,400
20 years in this business,

400
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,920
I know any brokers

401
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
that have made a name.

402
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,160
You know Tang Ling?

403
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,510
I do, really.

404
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,960
You work under her?

405
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,200
She was my disciple.

406
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,830
Is that real?

407
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,680
But she...

408
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,920
Be careful

409
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,720
when you

410
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,510
work with her.

411
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,880
I see why.

412
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,070
Brought so much stuff.

413
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,750
Put shoes outside.

414
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,590
It'll be smelly here.

415
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,310
Got it.

416
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,110
Careful not

417
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,720
to let the cat scratch.

418
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,440
You trimmed its nails?

419
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,590
It's well-behaved.

420
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,750
Go verify for me tomorrow, OK?

421
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,640
See if you have that rule.

422
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,880
What do you really want?

423
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,960
Don't ask.

424
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:28,920
Fruit.

425
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,750
Was that your boyfriend?

426
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,480
I didn't answer you.

427
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,960
Affection is complicated.

428
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,750
I like you

429
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,960
for your looks,

430
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,350
character,

431
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,920
job, and loyalty you showed

432
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,590
in your last relationship.

433
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,750
Loyalty...

434
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:04,680
Yes.

435
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,880
I think

436
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,960
if it were another girl,

437
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,790
she might choose me

438
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,400
over her poor ex

439
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,240
instantly.

440
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,640
But I'll despise her.

441
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,270
And you

442
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,510
are not that kind of girl.

443
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,750
What if

444
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,750
I am?

445
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,720
I

446
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,270
don't think so.

447
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,000
I've decided to

448
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,160
break up.

449
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,510
For me?

450
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,000
For I can't see

451
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,200
a future in him.

452
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,200
Do you

453
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,480
still think

454
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,510
I'm worthy of you?

455
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,100
[Asleep?]

456
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,100
[I know you're up. Open the door.]

457
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,070
Xiaozhou?

458
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,640
Open the door.

459
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,510
Are you asleep?

460
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,830
I'm coming in.

461
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,680
I knocked for ages.

462
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,920
Wh-what do you want?

463
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,270
What do you mean?

464
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,880
This is my house.

465
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,750
Dressed up in the middle of the night?

466
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,030
What, what are you doing?

467
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,920
I look bad?

468
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,240
No.

469
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,880
No, madam, don't.

470
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,030
Don't.

471
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm not that kind of guy.

472
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,070
I want the lamps.

473
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,270
For what?

474
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,030
Go away.

475
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,550
I shoot short videos.

476
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,680
I put my lamps here.

477
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,160
You saw my Xiaohongshu?

478
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,510
Learn from it.

479
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,070
Why else do you think I went to your room?

480
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
You think I wanted you?

481
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,240
No...

482
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,790
Who do you think you are?

483
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,270
I'd rather want

484
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,440
reputation than an average guy like you.

485
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,200
It's all misunderstanding.

486
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,270
It really is.

487
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,880
You wanted to save money for you mom

488
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,680
so I let you in.

489
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,590
Think about it now.

490
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,920
Really it doesn't seem appropriate.

491
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,830
What does that mean?

492
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,640
I mean

493
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,400
you could move out tomorrow

494
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,830
to avoid me, you potential admirer.

495
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,680
No, I won't do that again.

496
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,920
We'd better make this clear.

497
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,440
No, I...

498
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,030
I have to teach Dingding, remember?

499
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,440
You might set a bad example for him.

500
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,160
Plug it for me.

501
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,920
Madam, I know I was wrong.

502
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,510
Give me another chance.

503
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,400
You really do?

504
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,590
Yes.

505
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,830
OK. For this once.

506
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,110
How about...

507
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,200
About what?

508
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,310
You have more requests?

509
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,750
The commission ratio

510
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,480
is set in stone.

511
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,350
You know my mom's conditions.

512
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,030
I have conscience, OK?

513
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,640
Listen.

514
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,960
Introduce your girlfriend to me.

515
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,110
Why?

516
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,880
She's a doctor.

517
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,960
She knows people.

518
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,030
All that matters for brokers

519
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,790
is connections.

520
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:05,880
She doesn't

521
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,000
actually know many people.

522
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,440
You rely on me for living

523
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,510
and work.

524
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
You won't share your resources?

525
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,030
Let me remind you.

526
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,640
We're not related.

527
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,350
I know I'm trouble.

528
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,240
But I can't make her

529
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,350
do more for me.

530
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,350
She stayed on my worst days.

531
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,400
She looks

532
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,070
after my mom at hospital.

533
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,550
I can't sell her

534
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,310
for commission.

535
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,790
I really can't.

536
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,590
But I'm aware too.

537
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,160
You see it

538
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:46,880
unfair.

539
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,720
In that case,

540
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,000
we can talk about the ratio

541
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,200
if you promise not to disturb her.

542
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,550
You know how to care for girls.

543
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,790
What's there to talk about?

544
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,400
It's 30-70. You want 20-80?

545
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,720
If that's what you really want.

546
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,070
20-80 it is.

547
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,030
Me 80, you 20?

548
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,550
Even the biggest exploiter can't do it.

549
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,880
You agree?

550
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,000
You give in

551
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,440
for a woman again and again?

552
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,830
Then I'll...

553
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,960
Forget it. Never mind.

554
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,310
It's OK.

555
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,160
The lighting sucks.

556
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,400
You want to sleep?

557
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,270
Adjust lighting for me.

558
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,720
Hold it.

559
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,310
Come here. Careful.

560
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,110
Quiet.

561
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,400
Sit.

562
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,030
Yes.

563
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,550
Make it face me.

564
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,510
See? Reflecting lights.

565
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,200
Too sideways. Go back.

566
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,200
More.

567
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,830
OK, stay still.

568
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,920
Can you hold on?

569
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,750
I'll start.

570
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,750
Don't talk.

571
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,000
Start.

572
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,830
Hi, dear clients.

573
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,960
Love you.

574
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,240
I'm Gu Yuehu, here to help.

575
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,510
Today I want to teach you how to

576
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,920
make your family closer with insurance.

577
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,030
Human life...

578
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,790
Hold it.

579
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,720
Achoo!

580
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,550
I'll reshoot.

581
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,350
I start over.

582
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,750
So weak.

583
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,440
Alright now?

584
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:26,960
Stay still.

585
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,440
Up, up.

586
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,400
To my face.

587
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,750
Look, don't move.

588
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,830
To the right a little.

589
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,270
No more sneeze.

590
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,550
I'll wait until you finish.

591
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,350
Eat up.

592
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,510
Wake up.

593
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,000
I told you, recite loud.

594
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,400
Out loud.

595
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,400
Use all your senses.

596
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,440
Hurry up.

597
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,590
Five minutes.

598
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,510
You haven't had a bite.

599
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,400
You're going to be late.

600
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,510
I have one mouth.

601
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,440
You want me to recite and eat

602
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,200
at one time?

603
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,110
If I were you,

604
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,000
I would've recited one word now.

605
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,440
What now?

606
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,680
Early in the morning.

607
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,680
Look at you.

608
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,200
God of Fortune will avoid you.

609
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,110
He might be lazier than me.

610
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,270
Or we would've all been rich.

611
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,830
You know how to talk.

612
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,030
Sober up.

613
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,000
We don't work nine to five.

614
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,790
Why woke me up now?

615
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,160
Time waits for no man.

616
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,750
Find clients now.

617
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,110
Check your phone.

618
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,200
I sent you a few

619
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,750
potential customers.

620
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,680
Visit them from now on.

621
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,240
We have a team meeting today.

622
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,270
What did you way?

623
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,510
I couldn't hear.

624
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,200
I said

625
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,030
we have a team meeting.

626
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,070
So you'll go to the firm?

627
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,920
Give Dingding a ride.

628
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,270
Why?

629
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,070
The agreement says

630
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,110
I tutor him,

631
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,640
not babysitting.

632
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
The delivery guy even takes out my trash

633
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,880
on his way back.

634
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,400
You need to be service-minded.

635
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,000
To make your client stay.

636
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,000
It's the same for tutoring,

637
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,830
and selling insurance.

638
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,750
This is for your own good.

639
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,480
Mom.

640
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,720
You guys are so full of it.

641
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,160
I just love to watch you guys fight.

642
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,000
Go on.

643
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,030
You finish your meal.

644
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,960
Hurry up.

645
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,110
I'll punish you if he's late.

646
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,480
Then what's there left

647
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,310
for you to do?

648
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,480
Me?

649
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,400
Call clients from home.

650
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,550
Not good?

651
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,880
Let's exchange.

652
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,310
I drive him to school.

653
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,400
You call clients.

654
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,680
You applied cream?

655
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,640
Yes.

656
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,200
Lift your hair.

657
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,590
All pimples.

658
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,350
You'll ruin your face.

659
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,960
You're stressed

660
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,310
so you curse me?

661
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,510
Annoying.

662
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,310
Why am I stressed?

663
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,110
Thanks to him.

664
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,310
Eat.

665
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,030
Everything ready?

666
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,240
Yes.

667
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,720
What time is it?

668
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,440
In five minutes.

669
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,880
The elevator is here.

670
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,590
Hurry.

671
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,070
Coming.

672
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,110
What's the hurry?

673
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,640
Come on.

674
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,070
Go.

675
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,350
Careful on the way.

676
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:43,960
Got it...

677
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Focus during class.

678
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,000
Dingding.

679
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,480
How could you put up with her for years?

680
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,550
You have my pity.

681
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,920
Bro.

682
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
I'll tell you the truth.

683
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,640
You have to be strong

684
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,960
to live at No. 502.

685
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,240
In the future,

686
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,110
the charismatic Ms. Hu will always

687
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,510
keep you company.

688
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,270
Not bad.

689
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,240
You'll be my big brother.

690
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,310
Can I call you boss?

691
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,720
OK, Xiaozhou.

692
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,030
As we all know,

693
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,030
in less than 2 months, Xue Xiaozhou

694
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,160
had 2 annuity policy signed,

695
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,590
breaking records.

696
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,830
Let's congratulate him.

697
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:34,920
Amazing.

698
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,480
You must be curious

699
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,640
how he turned the tables

700
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,880
in such a short period.

701
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,790
Beautiful.

702
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,440
Let's ask him

703
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
to share his experience.

704
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,110
Nothing to share.

705
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,880
Please.

706
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,000
Give it up!

707
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,680
Thanks.

708
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,200
Actually,

709
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,270
I work the same way

710
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,440
like you.

711
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,960
I cold called all the time,

712
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,030
and then got lucky.

713
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,160
I made that order.

714
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,270
So modest.

715
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,790
And the one next to that?

716
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,270
Got lucky too.

717
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,240
I'd also cold called them.

718
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,240
Come on.

719
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,960
Through cold calls,

720
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,790
you can't even get basic customers.

721
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,680
You'll follow up on clients for long

722
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,310
before getting an annuity order.

723
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,590
Yet he got the orders just like that?

724
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,920
Nonsense.

725
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,550
So

726
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,830
what can you share with them

727
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,310
about these two orders?

728
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,960
Do your best and leave

729
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,200
the rest to fate.

730
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,920
I was lucky.

731
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,790
As if.

732
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,440
Well said.

733
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,920
Well said.

734
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:08,960
Sit.

735
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,440
Luck is part of your strength.

736
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,800
We brokers

737
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,800
need to take the initiative.

738
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,710
To boost our morale,

739
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,800
the firm sets brand new policy.

740
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,000
During October and New Year,

741
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,880
the first one on the performance chart

742
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,320
gets a luxury car.

743
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Won't you go for it?

744
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,160
♪A dream I can't wake from♪

745
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,900
♪Who sleepwalks through the haze♪

746
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,920

♪No shared pain we can recall♪

750
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,420
♪Our pains♪

751
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,420
♪Each bloom in separate ways♪

752
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,920
Xiaozhou.

753
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,480
You go sit beside the window.

754
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:41,880
Good view.

755
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,960
I'll help.

756
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,920
What is it?

757
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,360
Let me help.

758
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,670
Let's go.

759
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,190
Isn't it that desk with good feng shui?

760
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,110
He'll sit there?

761
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,480
Isn't that place for you?

762
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,110
I said

763
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,630
it's a desk for the best broker.

764
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Until now,

765
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,800
all of you, combined,

766
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,400
can't compare to Xiaozhou.

767
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,960
Come on.

768
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,000
Yichang.

769
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,000
Help him move.

770
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,800
OK.

771
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,110
Let me.

772
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,110
It's OK.

773
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,760
Sorry.

774
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,960
Careful.

775
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,190
Thanks.

776
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,840
Come sit.

777
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,800
Looks better.

778
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:00,760
Work hard.

779
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,150
Keep up the good work, everyone.

780
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,800
Keep up the good work!

781
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,920
Hello, madam.

782
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,710
How can I help you?

783
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,400
It's Monday.

784
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,760
Can I use a group purchase voucher?

785
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,440
Yes.

786
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,030
Let's make sure.

787
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,190
I can have this

788
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,550
set meal worth 249

789
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,000
with a coupon voucher I bought for 49.9?

790
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,510
Yes.

791
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,400
No extra fee?

792
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,000
No.

793
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,480
Service charge?

794
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,230
No.

795
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,440
Can I get another empty cup for free?

796
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,280
Yes.

797
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,230
Is this service time-limited?

798
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,280
No.

799
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,550
If there's any hidden tricks,

800
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,070
tell me in advance.

801
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,960
I have a bad temper.

802
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,670
We won't trick our customers.

803
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,510
Rest assured.

804
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,590
Redeem this voucher please.

805
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,590
You can wait until you finish.

806
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,360
No, I want to pay now.

807
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,320
Go on.

808
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,320
OK.

809
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:12,880
Be right up.

810
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,880

Manli.

850
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,440
Over here.

851
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,840
You're here.

852
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,800
- Sorry…
- Sit!

853
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,960
Long time no see.

854
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,190
I delivered books for Yaoyao.

855
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,960
She left them home again?

856
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,230
Exactly.

857
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,630
I just returned home

858
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,920
from school.

859
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,190
The teacher called.

860
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,070
She forgot her math exercise book.

861
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,670
I went to her room.

862
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,110
It's right on her desk.

863
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,510
I have to clean up

864
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,840
every mess she made.

865
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,670
So annoyed.

866
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,710
Don't be...

867
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,550
Bad for your health.

868
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,480
Kids are just like that.

869
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,480
I ordered the signature cake stand.

870
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,480
Try it.

871
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,280
OK.

872
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,510
What else do you want?

873
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,880
Tea is OK.

874
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,670
Just tea?

875
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,360
Yes.

876
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,480
Thanks.

877
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,190
I was hanging out nearby.

878
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,110
I remember you told me

879
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,030
you lived here.

880
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,710
So I tried texting you.

881
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,880
Turned out you are available.

882
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,550
Yes, I live just nearby.

883
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,710
You renewed your health insurance?

884
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,720
Yes, I did. The one you mentioned...

885
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,000
Bye.

886
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:31,880
Miss.

887
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,840
Get me another cup, please.

888
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,320
OK.

889
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,000
Thanks.

890
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,630
Qian, over here.

891
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,800
Look at her.

892
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,710
She's seen several clients

893
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,550
and didn't even touch the desserts.

894
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,070
Oh my.

895
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,110
Insurance broker.

896
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,000
Classic.

897
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,070
See?

898
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,800
She always asks them

899
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
if they want anything else.

900
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,840
But she has placed

901
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,400
an empty cup

902
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,590
in front of them.

903
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,070
No one will order anything.

904
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,550
They'll just have water like her.

905
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,480
She really makes this 49.9 meal

906
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,590
look like

907
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,000
a 499 one.

908
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,070
I have a meeting to attend.

909
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
I'll take my leave.

910
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:56,920
Look.

911
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,070
I'll offer more proposals.

912
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,630
Talk later, OK?

913
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,400
Many choices.

914
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,280
No problem.

915
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,150
See you.

916
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,030
Sure.

917
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,440
Bye.

918
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,550
Let's call it a day.

919
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,880
I can finally eat.
