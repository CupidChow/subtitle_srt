A Better Life

40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Episode 34

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,310
I'm sorry

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,710
for disturbing you at this hour.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,640
It's okay.

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,870
It's fate that brought us together
since we bought your house.

45
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,430
It's just that...

46
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,710
Is something bothering the child?

47
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,790
He kept crying at our place.

48
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
We ran out of ideas.

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,120
Hence, we called the agent,

50
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,200
and that's how we found you.

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,870
Thank you so much.

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,640
I'm really sorry

53
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,560
to have troubled you.

54
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,040
It's fine.

55
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,760
Baby,

56
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,510
say goodbye to them.

57
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,000
Goodbye.

58
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,870
Say goodbye to the lady as well.

59
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:04,840
Goodbye.

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,790
We'll be leaving now.

61
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,560
Thanks again.

62
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,310
You're such a good girl.

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,080
What happened exactly?

64
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,840
You can't just tell us
you're running away from home.

65
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,710
What's wrong?

66
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,960
Is there something that you can't tell me?

67
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,310
Give it a rest,
it's good enough that he's okay.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Let's discuss it at home.

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,630
Dingding,

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,710
Mom and Dad are both here for you.

71
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,280
Can you tell us what's wrong?

72
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,400
Tell me.

73
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,870
Yes,

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
why did you feel like
you had to run away from home?

75
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,560
So many of us were looking for you.

76
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,590
It's all my fault.

77
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,240
I won't do it again.

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,750
Dingding, if something had happened
to you tonight...

79
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,080
How would I go on living?

80
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,030
If something's on your mind,
tell me.

81
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,360
I won't blame you.

82
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,310
Will you tell me, please?

83
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,080
Tell me what's wrong.

84
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,360
What is it?

85
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,430
What's wrong, Dingding?

86
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,280
I don't want to apologize.

87
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,030
I didn't do anything wrong.

88
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,840
I don't know what I should do anymore.

89
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,630
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,960
Sorry, it's my fault.

91
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,710
Who is it?

92
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,190
Who made you apologize?

93
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,120
Was it the teacher or one of the parents?

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,470
Who made you apologize, Dingding?

95
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,280
Tell me.

96
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,030
Ding,

97
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,870
you were the one who ran away from home.

98
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,870
How could you blame it on me?

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,920
You said if I don't apologize

100
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,510
the parent will cause a scene,

101
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,510
and my mom will be incriminated.

102
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,600
She is already stressed enough.

103
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,240
I can't burden her anymore.

104
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,310
But I don't get it.

105
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,830
Why do I need to apologize?

106
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,190
I didn't do anything wrong.

107
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,430
I don't get it.

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,510
I really don't know what to do anymore.

109
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,630
I...

110
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,560
I...

111
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,680
Did you really say that to him?

112
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,270
No matter what,

113
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,430
we should clarify the situation first.

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
So it's now my fault?

115
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,120
Zhiyuan,

116
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,120
Ding has always had an issue with me.

117
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
You know that.

118
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,270
Did you force my son to apologize?

119
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,560
Hu Manli,

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,070
I did it for his own good.

121
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,430
Did you or did you not do it?

122
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,390
I did.

123
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,070
But...

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,190
Mom!

125
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,680
Manli! Mom!

126
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,800
What are you doing, Mom!
Don't do this.

127
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,680
Manli!
Mom, why are you like this?

128
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,390
Mom, it's my fault. Please don't do this.

129
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,750
I was wrong.

130
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,430
It's all my fault.

131
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,630
I shouldn't have let you live
at someone else's house

132
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,070
and let you be bullied like this.

133
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,240
Don't cry.

134
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,680
It's all my fault.

135
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,310
No matter how difficult life gets,

136
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,070
I will never let you live
with someone else again.

137
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,240
I was wrong.

138
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,950
I will never hand you over
to someone else again,

139
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,480
Dingding

140
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,160
It's my fault.

141
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,870
Don't cry.

142
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,190
Don't cry anymore.

143
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,070
Let's go.

144
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm sorry, Dingding.

145
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,560
Mom...

146
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,360
say no more.

147
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,750
No one is allowed to say "sorry" again.

148
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,240
I won't say it,

149
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,120
and you should not either.

150
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,070
Mom,

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,920
where are we going now?

152
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,160
We're going home.

153
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,070
We don't have a home.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,630
Wherever you are...

155
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,270
that's where home is

156
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:18,830
Mom,

157
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,360
Xiaozhou is right.

158
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,630
As long as we're together, that's home.

159
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,310
Yuki,

160
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,040
thank you for today.

161
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,430
and thank Mr. Li for me.

162
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,680
It's nothing, Manli.

163
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,920
It's getting late.

164
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,430
Take the child home and get some rest.

165
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,000
Goodbye.

166
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,510
Thanks for everything.

167
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,270
Oh.

168
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,390
About what happened today...

169
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,920
thank you.

170
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,510
I'm sorry,

171
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,600
but I can't reciprocate your feelings.

172
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,830
Xue Xiaozhou,

173
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,800
did you really think
that I was running around all night

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
just to please you

175
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,120
so that you'd fall in love with me?

176
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,190
You think too highly of yourself.

177
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,430
Everything I've done

178
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,240
was all for Manli.

179
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,320
Well then, that's great.

180
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,630
I'll thank you on her behalf.

181
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,150
Also...

182
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,840
can you help me persuade Manli

183
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,270
to seriously consider the suggestion
I gave last time.

184
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,550
What suggestion?

185
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,080
My dad

186
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,360
may not be as educated as Manli's ex-husband

187
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,670
But for one

188
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,270
he's really rich.

189
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,360
Secondly,

190
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,510
he's not a bad person.

191
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,840
And thirdly,

192
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,630
he likes Manli.

193
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,150
With him supporting her,

194
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,750
Manli would be able
to take better care of the child

195
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,630
Where is Daer?

196
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,240
In the room.

197
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,720
Is he okay?

198
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,480
He's fine.

199
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,360
Thank you for today.

200
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
Go get some rest.

201
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,960
You too.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,630
Zhiyuan,

203
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,440
please let me explain.

204
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,600
I've never dealt with something
like this before either.

205
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
At that time, the teacher said...

206
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,150
the parents wanted to escalate things.

207
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,670
I panicked.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,390
So I thought if I could get Ding
to apologize

209
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,840
the whole thing would be resolved.

210
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,630
If it was really out of good intentions,

211
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,080
why did you have to bring up Hu Manli?

212
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,270
Ding doesn't listen to me.

213
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,510
I know he cares about his mother.

214
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,080
I had no other choice...

215
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,120
that's why I used this approach.

216
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,150
You knew he cared about his mother...

217
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,150
yet you used it to hurt him.

218
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,080
What did the child do to deserve this?

219
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,600
How did you become like this?

220
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,390
How did I become like this?

221
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,480
How did I become like this?

222
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,200
Maybe you should ask yourself that.

223
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,480
Ask me?

224
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,630
You still keep the birthday gift she gave you.

225
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
That suit. Do you remember?

226
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,360
What does that prove?

227
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
What are you trying to imply?

228
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,550
Put aside the fact that she's Ding Daer's mother

229
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,390
even if she's just a normal friend,

230
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,150
keeping the gift shows courtesy and respect.

231
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,840
A normal friend?

232
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,240
Would you pay the nursing home expenses

233
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,080
of a normal friend's father?

234
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,750
It's 200,000 yuan a year!

235
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,000
How did you find out about it?

236
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,600
If you have nothing to hide,

237
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,080
why wouldn't you let me know?

238
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,150
It's getting late.

239
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,510
I do not wish to talk about it.

240
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,510
Don't go.

241
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,320
Can you feel it?

242
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,360
The baby is moving.

243
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,790
Our child.

244
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
He wants to know too.

245
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,870
Why is his father doing this?

246
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,790
Don't force me.

247
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,910
Don't you force me!

248
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,390
You don't care about your child,

249
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,550
but you're caring for your ex-wife's father?

250
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,870
Why is that?

251
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,480
No matter what,

252
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,600
you'll need to give both of us
an explanation today.

253
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,670
You thought I wanted to do this?

254
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,870
I was with her for over a decade,

255
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,510
but I never gave her anything.

256
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,630
In the end, I cheated on her.

257
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,000
I was the one who hurt her.

258
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,840
Aside from money,

259
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,240
what else can I use to make it up to her?

260
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,630
Even money can't make up for a tiny bit.

261
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,910
Who was the one who said back then

262
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,720
that in that marriage with her

263
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,200
he was tormented

264
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,910
like a walking corpse?

265
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,120
You said I was the one who saved you.

266
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,080
How did it suddenly become that you owe her?

267
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,790
Then what about me?

268
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,360
What do I mean to you?

269
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,870
Now that you're criticizing yourself,

270
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,840
Is it fair for me?

271
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,630
Maybe I was living too good a life back then.

272
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,080
I thought that those good times

273
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,440
was so ordinary

274
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,910
that I took it for granted.

275
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,910
So I was unsatisfied.

276
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,910
I kept focusing on her flaws,

277
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,030
exaggerating them over and over again.

278
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,270
You regret it now?

279
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,270
Do you?

280
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,960
Ding Zhiyuan,

281
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,480
please tell me honestly.

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,720
Do you regret it?

283
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,030
Does saying any of this even matter now?

284
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,870
Lisu,

285
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,120
we have feelings for each other.

286
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,840
And you're carrying my child now.

287
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,080
I'm responsible for you.

288
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,960
Regret or not,

289
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,670
it doesn't matter.

290
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,600
Right now, I'm by your side.

291
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,910
this is our reality.

292
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,480
Don't overthink the rest.

293
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,390
Ding,

294
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,320
you'll be late for school.
Are you up yet?

295
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,630
It's time to wake up, Ding.

296
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,080
Hu Manli.

297
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,240
I'm coming in.

298
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,790
Xiaozhou,

299
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,080
thank you for taking me in these past few days.

300
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,840
Now that Ding is back with me,

301
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
it's not convenient for me to keep staying here.

302
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,030
So,

303
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,440
let's leave it at that.

304
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,870
I wish you all the best in the future.

305
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,000
Take a look at this

306
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,840
"Let's leave it at that."

307
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,390
It's not for you to decide.

308
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,720
He really has fallen deep for you.

309
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,510
Even I'm touched by him.

310
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,600
Don't you feel a thing?

311
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,910
Manli,

312
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,200
I'm telling you.

313
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,720
It's okay to like Xiaozhou.

314
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
You deserve him.

315
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,150
It's perfectly natural to fall in love.

316
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,150
It's no big deal.

317
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,910
You don't have to feel awkward about it.

318
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,000
You know, Xue Xiaozhou and I,

319
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,240
it's a strange story.

320
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,630
At first, I hated him.

321
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,440
Later on, I learned about his family situation,

322
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,910
I felt sorry for him.

323
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,750
And then,

324
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,120
I started seeing him as family.

325
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,790
I do like him,

326
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,870
but not in a romantic way.

327
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,550
You get it, right?

328
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,270
But he's being so persistent.

329
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,150
A rich man's daughter likes him

330
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
and the boss wants to promote him.

331
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,440
He's a smart guy.

332
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,270
Give him some time

333
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,240
He should know

334
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,080
what's best for him.

335
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,750
What are you going to do now?

336
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm so annoyed, I need to be alone.

337
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,080
Back then, when Mr.Jin offered me
an opportunity,

338
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,200
I turned it down too quickly.

339
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,270
If I had known, I should've just taken it,

340
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,960
and cut ties with all these men.

341
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,910
That's right.

342
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,910
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

343
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,030
And put those men aside.

344
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,110
I still have several sessions left on my card.

345
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,680
Do a few more treatments today

346
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,440
to use them up.

347
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,590
Ladies, we can begin now.

348
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,750
Do it with me?

349
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,160
I'm not doing it, you go ahead.

350
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,480
Then you'll have to wait a long time for me.

351
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,510
It's fine. I'm not working anyway.

352
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,640
I've got plenty of time.

353
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,030
Let's change into the robe first.

354
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,790
Okay.

355
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,830
Go on and get changed.

356
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,110
Just nap a bit on the side.

357
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,070
Don't worry about me.

358
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,240
I'm coming.

359
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,880
Did you forget something?

360
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,400
Zhong.

361
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,030
Are you looking for Manli?

362
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,750
She went out to meet a client.

363
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,550
Sorry to bother you.

364
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,310
Wait.

365
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,750
Let's have a chat.

366
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,750
I know everything about you and Manli.

367
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,310
Zhong

368
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,440
I'm serious

369
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,400
about Manli.

370
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,510
I believe you.

371
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,070
But have you thought about

372
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,070
how does she feel about you?

373
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,310
I think

374
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,070
she likes me too.

375
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,200
And then what?

376
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,960
So what if she does?

377
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,550
Zhong, what are you trying to say?

378
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,000
She's 11 years older than you.

379
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't care.

380
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,030
You don't care?

381
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,720
Just because you don't care

382
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,830
will everything be fine?

383
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,400
Do you think that an 11-year difference

384
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,070
is only a matter of numbers?

385
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,160
You're wrong.

386
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,350
The 11-year gap

387
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,750
means that she's had to bear much more than you.

388
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,030
I understand.

389
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,240
But I want to face it with her.

390
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,720
Xiaozhou,

391
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,350
some things

392
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,110
can only be faced alone.

393
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,830
Do you understand what I mean?

394
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,030
Zhong, thank you for telling me this.

395
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,400
But I'm really anxious right now.

396
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,000
I want to do something for her.

397
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,480
Right now,

398
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,510
doing nothing

399
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,070
is the best choice.

400
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,270
But I...

401
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,160
can't do that.

402
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,070
Xiaozhou,

403
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,550
try to think from Manli's perspective.

404
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,510
She's unemployed,

405
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,200
divorced,

406
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,440
sold her house,

407
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,270
and her father is sick.

408
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,510
Life is suffocating her.

409
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,000
At a time like this,

410
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,750
you're adding pressure to her

411
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
by wanting her to start

412
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
a relationship that most people
wouldn't understand.

413
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,880
Do you really think

414
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,270
this is good for her?

415
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,160
And can she accept it gladly?

416
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,350
Right now

417
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,350
what she needs

418
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,720
is time and space

419
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,310
to get her life in order.

420
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,200
Zhong, I...

421
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,070
I understand now.

422
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:00,790
If...

423
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,240
I meant if...

424
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,550
Hu Manli encounters any more problems,

425
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,070
could you tell me?

426
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,510
I'll help her solve them

427
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,200
without letting her know.

428
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,830
Would that be okay?

429
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,350
Okay.

430
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,350
Thank you.

431
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,310
Let's say...

432
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,720
just hypothetically.

433
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,440
If you were to find someone new,

434
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,000
what would the requirements be?

435
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,960
Find someone new?

436
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,350
If I really do find someone new,

437
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,750
first and foremost

438
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,720
He must be someone that Ding could accept.
Am I right?

439
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,550
You're right. What about the second point?

440
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,070
Secondly...

441
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,880
He must be able to accept Ding.

442
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,160
Daer,

443
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,790
Over here!

444
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,960
Pass the ball!

445
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,480
Ding!

446
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,350
Ding Daer!

447
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,480
Hurry, guard him!

448
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,480
Wait for me a second.

449
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,070
Over here.

450
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,550
Here.

451
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,480
Hurry, hurry!

452
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,110
Xiaozhou,

453
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,350
why are you here?

454
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,550
I'm here to bring you some warmth.

455
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,400
You're here to ask about my mom,
aren't you?

456
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,510
Good luck!

457
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,640
You fought with her?

458
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,070
Let's go!

459
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,480
She told you that?

460
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,550
Even I can see it.

461
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,550
That morning, I wasn't even awake yet...

462
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,440
and she dragged me to Zhong Ning's house.

463
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,720
What did you do to make her that mad?

464
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,160
Did you deduct her payment?

465
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,480
I'm telling you, that's her bottom line.

466
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,240
You better not cross it.

467
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,790
Otherwise, she'll go all out on you.

468
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,920
I'm not that kind of person.

469
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,000
Do you really think I'm that kind of person?

470
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah, I think you are.

471
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,310
Seriously...

472
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,750
Good luck in the next half.

473
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,270
Wha...what do you think of me?

474
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,350
In what way?

475
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,350
In all ways.

476
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,310
You're quite a nice person overall.

477
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,000
You're acceptable.

478
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:01,960
Honestly?

479
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,640
Pass it to me?

480
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,350
Wait, why are you so serious all of a sudden?

481
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,480
What are you trying to do?

482
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,920
I'll shoot the goal.

483
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,000
Haven't I always treated you like my best buddy?

484
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,550
No, I...

485
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,790
I wanted to ask

486
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,030
if you can accept me

487
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,720
with your mom...

488
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,200
Haven't I always accepted it?

489
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,070
Both of you are pretty great working together,
right?

490
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,790
Alright, I get it.

491
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,310
I'll talk to her when I get back.

492
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,240
I'll tell her not to be angry with you.

493
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:23,750
Is that alright?

494
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,440
No,

495
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,790
what I mean is, can you accept...

496
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,270
me and your mom being together?

497
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,750
What kind of "together"?

498
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,960
Just...

499
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,030
just like your dad and your mom...

500
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,400
like, really together.

501
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,440
No, don't do that...

502
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,510
I'm serious.

503
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,830
Daer, I...

504
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,790
I really, truly like your mother

505
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,310
and I want to be with her.

506
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,480
I know it sounds a little iffy...

507
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,270
But it's the truth. I can't lie to myself.

508
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,590
So now...

509
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,310
I need your support.

510
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,070
This... this is way too dramatic.

511
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,000
Let me take a break and think about it.

512
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,640
What should I call you?

513
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,590
You don't have to change how you call me.

514
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,350
You don't need to call me Dad.

515
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,640
You... can just call me Bro.

516
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,240
Wait, no. That's not right either.

517
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,750
You can call me...

518
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:14,920
Uncle.

519
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,030
Yeah, just call me Uncle.

520
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,920
Because your mom told me before...

521
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,790
If she ever finds a new partner,

522
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,960
her main consideration would be you.

523
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,310
So I'll need you to accept me. Acknowledge me.

524
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,030
Only then will there be a chance
for me and your mom.

525
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,720
Ding Daer!

526
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,110
You're up!

527
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,750
I'm coming!

528
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,350
I gotta go.

529
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,240
No...no...

530
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,110
Daer, this is really important.

531
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,720
It's really important.

532
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,880
I... I'm being serious.

533
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,200
I want to take care of your mom.

534
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,070
I want to treat her well.

535
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,640
And I also want to take care of you.

536
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,720
Do you understand?

537
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,440
So...

538
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,920
can you accept it

539
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,510
if your mom and I were together?

540
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,160
This kind of thing...

541
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,880
You should ask Mom instead.

542
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,790
I'm quite sure...

543
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,400
I think

544
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,240
your Mom likes me too.

545
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,240
Otherwise, she wouldn't be hiding from me,

546
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,640
am I right?

547
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,200
Daer,

548
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,480
Right now,

549
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,440
I just need an answer from you.

550
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,590
Again, again!

551
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,160
I'm fine with anything.

552
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,160
You're fine with anything?

553
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,070
I just want my Mom to be happy.

554
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,030
That's not a problem,

555
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,240
she'll definitely be happy.

556
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,640
So you agree?

557
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,400
I'm going to play soccer now.

558
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,000
Hang on...

559
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,880
I mean, Daer...

560
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:28,880
Come Daer!

561
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,680
Pass the ball, Daer.

562
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,070
Then I'll take is you've agreed.

563
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,000
Don't go back on your words later.

564
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,200
I received your resignation letter.

565
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,110
I like you, Hu Manli

566
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,590
Xiaozhou,

567
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,960
you might still be too young.

568
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,110
You're unable to understand
your feelings for me.

569
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,920
Actually, these feelings

570
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,200
are very likely just friendship.

571
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:37,720
At most...

572
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,750
maybe just a tiny bit more...

573
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,550
No, I'm very clear-headed.

574
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,070
I can say it again.

575
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,310
I like you.

576
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,110
It's the kind that a man has for a woman.

577
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
But I see you as a younger brother.

578
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,240
Are you concerned about what others
would think?

579
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,240
You don't need to worry about that

580
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,510
Even Daer doesn't object to it.

581
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,960
What do you mean?

582
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,110
Before I came to you,

583
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
I've talked to Daer first.

584
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,680
He said it very clearly that

585
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,960
he only wants you to be happy.

586
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,440
Everything else is...

587
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,880
Who told you to find Dingding?

588
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,510
Why did you tell him all that?

589
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,720
He's just a kid.

590
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,440
I'm sorry, Hu Manli.

591
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
I know it was a bit reckless,

592
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,000
But I remembered you said

593
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,440
if you were to date again,

594
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,110
you'll need Daer's approval.

595
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,550
I'm really...

596
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,350
So I went and asked him.

597
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,350
There are many things
that I didn't want to say...

598
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,110
but you forced me to.

599
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,480
You think you're better than me now, huh?

600
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,480
As long as you accept me,

601
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,590
I would never reject you.

602
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,480
You think just because I've been divorced,

603
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,310
and my career is declining,

604
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,550
I'm bound to accept you?

605
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,240
No

606
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,350
How do you know...

607
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,960
that I don't have better options other than you?

608
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,830
Are you talking about...

609
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,240
Li Fendou?

610
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,790
Is he better than you?

611
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,200
Impossible.

612
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,550
Yuki told me you've rejected him.

613
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,640
Who said I rejected him?

614
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,110
He courted me even more than you did, okay?

615
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,750
Is it about money?

616
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,790
I'll have money too.

617
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,750
I'll work very hard.

618
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,440
I've taken over Li Qingqing's position...

619
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,480
I'll have lots of chances to earn
a lot of money.

620
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,920
Your future, and Ding's future...

621
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,160
I can take care of all of it.

622
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,960
Even if you

623
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,350
work to your limit,

624
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,160
you're only a high-level employee.

625
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,030
No matter how hard you try in this life...

626
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,400
you'll never catch up to Li Fendou.

627
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm already at this age.

628
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,750
I can't wait...

629
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,200
and I can't afford to lose anymore.

630
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,070
Look at you,

631
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,830
we could have ended things peacefully.

632
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,070
But you insisted on making things ugly.

633
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,590
I've said everything I needed to say...

634
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,270
Whether you listen or not is up to you.

635
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,590
- Hang on
- I'm leaving...

636
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,200
- Don't go!
- Goodbye.

637
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,960
Let's not meet again.

638
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,880
Hu Manli, wait a second.

639
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,510
What are you doing?

640
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,480
Wait a moment.

641
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,310
You like it, huh?

642
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,830
It's yours... I wish you all the best.

643
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,240
In this phone book,

644
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,070
every single phone call...

645
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,030
was made by both of us together.

646
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,720
We visited every client together.

647
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,590
We went through...

648
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,400
our most difficult times together.

649
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,350
Right here, in this cafe...

650
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,590
was where we discussed the deal with Ma Xiaowei.

651
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,590
It was right here,

652
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,920
where we shared our bonuses,

653
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,960
where we argued.

654
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,640
I even...

655
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,160
I even tore up a contract right here.

656
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,480
When I was being bullied...

657
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,000
you stood up for me

658
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,480
and scolded them back.

659
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,510
When I achieved something

660
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,640
you were proud of me.

661
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,590
These memories

662
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,750
are the most beautiful

663
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,480
and most precious to me.

664
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,640
But to you...

665
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,200
are they all fake?

666
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,750
Do they mean nothing at all?

667
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,920
Have you forgotten them all?

668
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,200
Hu Manli...

669
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,000
What are you doing?

670
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,200
Stop it.

671
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,070
Can I forget them now?

672
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,160
I don't want to live like this anymore.

673
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,030
I don't want to grovel to sell insurance.

674
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,400
I don't want to keep watching
other people's faces.

675
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,590
This is my only chance in life
to turn things around.

676
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,110
Please let me go.
Just let me go, okay?

677
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,070
Mr. Jin.

678
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,510
Mr. Jin

679
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,720
Hu Manli, reporting for duty.

680
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,480
I'm so glad you came.

681
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,270
Have a seat.

682
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,400
What made you change your mind?

683
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,510
It's a long story.

684
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,750
Recently, a client

685
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,880
really touched me.

686
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,880
Why did Tao pass so suddenly?

687
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,630
She fell at the recycling station...

688
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,550
and had a heart attack.

689
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,190
A heart attack?

690
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,480
She kept complaining that her chest hurt

691
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,030
but she was too frugal to get it checked.

692
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,710
Who would've thought that a fall
would trigger it?

693
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,920
It happened at night.

694
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,440
No one noticed it

695
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,630
until the next morning

696
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,190
when someone came to sell scrap...

697
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,710
She was already gone by then.

698
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,880
Xiaoxuan,

699
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,550
You just had a miscarriage.
You shouldn't cry.

700
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,510
Your health comes first.

701
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,510
Drink the soup.

702
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,840
You had a miscarriage?

703
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,550
The baby is gone?

704
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,480
It's my fault.

705
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,000
I didn't listen to my mom.

706
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,320
What happened?

707
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,280
Where is your husband?

708
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,550
Where did he go?

709
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,960
The miscarriage... was because of him.

710
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,190
My mom had just passed away,

711
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,000
and he came asking for money to pay
his gambling debts.

712
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,880
I told him no.

713
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,000
Then he asked for a divorce.

714
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,320
I got so upset

715
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,070
that I lost the baby.

716
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,110
He said that my mom's inheritance

717
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,920
counts as our marital property.

718
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,280
The court would give him half of it.

719
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,760
This whole thing made me realize,

720
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,480
Tao wasn't after the returns...

721
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,840
nor was she guarding against her son-in-law.

722
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,510
She just wanted retirement insurance.

723
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,400
What do you mean?

724
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,000
If...

725
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,670
I had noticed earlier
that she wasn't feeling well,

726
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,630
and persuaded her to get
the retirement insurance sooner,

727
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,360
with the services provided by
the Blue Ocean Centenarian Package

728
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,510
an alert could have been sent when she fell.

729
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,000
And maybe Tao wouldn't have died.

730
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,960
This tragedy might never have happened.

731
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,110
You're right...

732
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,510
That day, when I walked out of
the recycling station...

733
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,360
I saw many people

734
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,550
who are like Tao.

735
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,920
And I thought...

736
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,440
there are still countless parents
just like Sun Atao,

737
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,880
who worked hard their whole lives

738
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,230
and now that they're old

739
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,480
they should be enjoying life.

740
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,670
But their hearts and minds are filled
only with their children.

741
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,630
No one told them that

742
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,630
They could take care of both at the same time.

743
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,710
So, Mr. Jin,

744
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,590
I want to be that person.

745
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,840
I don't want Tao's tragedy to happen again.

746
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:26,920
Alright.

747
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,000
That's exactly the attitude I want from you.

748
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,840
But I have to remind you again,

749
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,510
this is an internal position.

750
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,670
The pay isn't as high as selling insurance.

751
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,670
Mr. Jin,

752
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,110
the salary at Blue Ocean

753
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,710
is considered high in the industry.

754
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,960
It's enough to support my whole family.

755
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,110
The promotional department is
short-staffed right now.

756
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,440
You'll need to lead the team,

757
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,360
and to go door to door in each neighborhood

758
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,960
to promote our services.

759
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,070
For someone

760
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,480
who was once a million-dollar earner,

761
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,670
can you handle this kind of work?

762
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,150
Well,

763
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,000
I guess I'm destined to stay grounded.

764
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,400
You saw how quickly I got carried away
when I lost touch with reality

765
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,030
and trouble found me from every direction.

766
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:06,920
What else can I do?

767
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,670
Alright.

768
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,070
Welcome home.

769
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,920
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

770
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,190
Ms. Hu,

771
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,320
Welcome back.

772
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,320
Let me introduce myself first.

773
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,280
My name is Yu Yuan.

774
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,030
I'm in charge of the "Elderly Care" project
for now.

775
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,710
Mr. Yu, please take a look.

776
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,510
This is a proposal

777
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,360
that I drafted overnight for promoting
the Elderly Care project.

778
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,030
Please have a look.

779
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,190
Here's what I'm thinking...

780
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,150
The entire promotional team

781
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,670
will be split into pairs.

782
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,150
Each pair will scout suitable neighborhoods

783
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,360
to promote the Tianyang Nursing Home

784
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,190
that our company has invested in.

785
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,030
We'll select one elderly person per neighborhood

786
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,630
to experience a free one-month trial stay.

787
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,110
Yes.

788
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,880
We will have requirements for
the participants.

789
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,880
First, they must be over 60 years old

790
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,880
and be in good health.

791
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,230
I will also form a team myself.

792
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,440
Everyone can choose their own partner freely.

793
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,110
Chunlu used to work with me before.

794
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,030
Why don't we team up this time?

795
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,000
Sure, I'd be happy to.

796
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:25,960
Thank you, Manli.

797
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:26,960
No problem.

798
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,840
Your proposal looks solid.

799
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,230
I'll get it submitted as soon as possible.

800
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,320
If the company approves it,

801
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,480
we'll proceed with this plan.

802
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,510
Alright.

803
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,110
Everyone,

804
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,150
the Elderly Care promotion team

805
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,550
is officially established today.

806
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,030
The institution has already sent
a lawyer's letter.

807
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,070
We're six months overdue on the repayment.

808
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,550
Try negotiating with them again.

809
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,360
Ask them for more time.

810
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,320
This is already after a previous extension.

811
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,320
Ms. Qiu,

812
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,840
if we can't come up with a solution soon,

813
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,510
Not just Zhig,

814
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,110
even all of Mr.Xue's personal assets

815
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,440
will be seized and auctioned off

816
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,150
to repay debts.

817
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,000
How much are we short

818
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,760
on this repayment?

819
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,760
Excluding accounts payable,

820
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,000
we're short five million yuan.

821
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,230
What about including accounts payable?

822
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,710
Ms. Qiu...

823
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,150
those payables have been overdue for a year.

824
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,590
The campus's renovation company

825
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,630
called me again.

826
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,110
They said if we don't pay them soon,

827
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,440
I should watch my back when I'm out.

828
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,880
What are you afraid of?

829
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,320
If Zhig goes under,
they won't get a cent anyway.

830
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,150
Just tell me

831
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,760
how much do we short
after adding accounts payable?

832
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,550
Around seven million yuan.

833
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,070
The banks aren't approving anymore
loans for us

834
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,230
and the business contacts we've
already borrowed from

835
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,440
have all helped out once.

836
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,670
Leave me alone for now.

837
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,960
Let me think of something.

838
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,920
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

839
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,230
Ms. Qiu,

840
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,280
the stationary suppliers have gathered
a bunch of people to block the entrance.

841
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,320
They're trying to break in.

842
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,320
Then call the police!

843
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,110
I did. The police are on their way.

844
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,480
Security can't hold them back anymore.

845
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,320
Then have Mr. Huang wait for me
in the basement garage.

846
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,510
He was dismissed by you last week.

847
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,440
Help me hold them off.

848
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,760
I'll leave through the back door.

849
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:33,710
Alright.

850
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,710
Get out of the car!

851
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:44,480
Pay back our money!

852
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,110
Hurry up!

853
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,960
Pay up!

854
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:46,630
Pay the money!

855
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,710
Get out of the car and pay up!

856
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:48,400
Get off the car!

857
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,150
Get out of the car and pay the money!

858
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,230
Pay us our money!

859
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,360
Get out of the car now!

860
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:51,880
Pay us back the money!

861
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,880
Move aside!

862
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,320
Pay back the money!

863
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:53,670
Hurry up!

864
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,440
Move aside!

865
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,030
Get off your car!

866
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,030
Pay up!

867
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,840
Dont' run! Pay us back the money!

868
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,000
Stay where you are!

869
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,710
Pay us back!

870
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,400
Don't run! Pay up!

871
00:42:59,400 --> 00:42:59,760
Pay the money!
