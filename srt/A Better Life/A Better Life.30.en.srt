[Episode 30]

41
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,310
I thought

42
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,280
you were honest.

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,040
Didn't expect you to play tricks.

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
No, I didn't know.

45
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,560
You should go.

46
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,510
Listen to me.

47
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,510
Mr. Gu.

48
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,400
What want you want?

49
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,590
Yes, I conceded points on purpose.

50
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,350
To be honest.

51
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,710
I wanted to butter you up.

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,920
But I don't

53
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,920
just butter anyone up.

54
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,310
What do you mean?

55
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:58,790
I

56
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,680
never kiss up to people.

57
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,200
People I like or hate...

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
For example, this water.

59
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,560
A bottle of water

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,030
is just water.

61
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,120
I don't use it

62
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,080
to flatter anyone.

63
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,630
When you try to butter anyone up,

64
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,190
you feel pathetic.

65
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,150
So I swore.

66
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,430
I won't feel that way.

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,360
But I changed my mind

68
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,840
because of you.

69
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,120
I really

70
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,630
want to

71
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,630
befriend you.

72
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,120
When we first played,

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
I won.

74
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,630
You weren't upset

75
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,430
and generously

76
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,870
added me to your group.

77
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,560
You shared precious connections

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
with me.

79
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,960
I was really really touched.

80
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,520
If I hated you,

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,310
I'd rather pick up trash on street

82
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,080
than try to flatter you.

83
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,190
I revere

84
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,430
you.

85
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,120
I want to be friends with you.

86
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,120
I also request to join Wolf Tennis Team.

87
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,960
Can I?

88
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,120
So you don't see it as flattery.

89
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,120
No.

90
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,310
It's a gesture of goodwill.

91
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,150
You're eloquent.

92
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,710
Here.

93
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,870
Refill your energy and get on the court.

94
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,630
OK.

95
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,430
Come on.

96
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,310
No fun if you concede points, OK?

97
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,630
Come on.

98
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,560
I won't.

99
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,030
OK.

100
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,910
You can't.

101
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,280
Come in.

102
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,030

103
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Sign here if everything's OK.

104
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,630

107
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,750
from our group chat wanted to meet you.

108
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,000
Since you called,

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,750
I won't decline.

110
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,000
How about this?

111
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,360
It's better to do it now.

112
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,430
He comes to you today.

113
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,430
OK?

114
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,920
You can judge by yourself.

115
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,920
Here's the thing.

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,310
I think he's nice,

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,040
honest.

118
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,510
Or I wouldn't call you.

119
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,360
Right?

120
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,680
Today?

121
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,430
2 PM.

122
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
You'll meet Mr. Zhang.

123
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,160
I need to get going.

124
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,240
If he doesn't mind,

125
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,630
he can talk to me while

126
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,750
I'm on the way.

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,510
OK.

128
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,430
I'll tell him to go.

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,070
OK.

130
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,920
Well done.

131
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,870
He went to Mr. Gu.

132
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,120
Mr. Li.

133
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,630
Let me introduce myself.

134
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,430
I'm Hu Manli,

135
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,800
assistant from

136
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,190
TSI family office.

137
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,070
I know you're in need lately.

138
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,310
Hope you can give us a chance.

139
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,040
Know I'm in need?

140
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,000
I need a lot of things.

141
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,240
Go to Legal Department.

142
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,950
We'll definitely take your project.

143
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,240
Why?

144
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,680
I know your daughter Li Yu.

145
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,600
We know your family

146
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,510
better than other family offices.

147
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,800
When did you know Ke?

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,720
Yuki used to work in a luxury shop.

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,070
I'm her client.

150
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,270
When you have time,

151
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,390
I'll bring my leader to you.

152
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,040
Let's see.

153
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,190
Why is it you?

154
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,430
Your boss?

155
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,240
Bo...

156
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,070
Ms. Yan.

157
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,600
Mr. Li.

158
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,160
My leader's here.

159
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,070
Hello, Mr. Li.

160
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
Xue Xiaozhou of TSI.

161
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,190
You're him?

162
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,240
You have means.

163
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,480
You went to Gu,

164
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,720
and had her block me here.

165
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,750
I have to place my order with you?

166
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,240
No...

167
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,310
I came here on my own.

168
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,270
Nothing to do with him.

169
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,510
You don't know what she's doing?

170
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,750
How are you managing the office?

171
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,190
You're right.

172
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,510
This is my problem.

173
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,800
Sorry for troubling you.

174
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,680
I'm really sorry.

175
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:12,870
Never mind.

176
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,070
Get in.

177
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,560
You can go.

178
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,870
It's OK.

179
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,950
You should talk alone.

180
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,750
Mr. Li.

181
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,510
There's an emergency.

182
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,480
I spotted stains

183
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,270
just now.

184
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,240
What...

185
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,600
Now?

186
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,240
I'll meet a ministry officer.

187
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,120
What should I wear?

188
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,600
I'll get one new.

189
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,240
Mr. Zhang will be off work by then.

190
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,720
Let's go...

191
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,630
Wait.

192
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,120
Mr. Li.

193
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,040
Calm down.

194
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,310
Two minutes.

195
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,630
I'll handle this, OK?

196
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,600
What do you want?

197
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,160
Look.

198
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,040
On the collar?

199
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,510
Yes.

200
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,630
No other stains?

201
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,000
No.

202
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:03,950
Let me.

203
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,510
What's she doing?

204
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,950
It should be OK.

205
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,070
Can she even do that?

206
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,390
We're kind of in service business.

207
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,120
Mr. Li.

208
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,790
Look.

209
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,870
Is it nice?

210
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,120
Mr. Li.

211
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,630
I helped you with the clothes.

212
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,600
Then will you like us

213
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,030
more than

214
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,320
other offices?

215
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,240
He's in a rush.

216
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,870
Yan, pay her.

217
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,870
Thank her.

218
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,480
No.

219
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,790
I didn't mean that.

220
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,510
You go ahead.

221
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,630
Smooth meeting.

222
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,390
Bye...

223
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:02,840
Thank you.

224
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,600
You're welcome.

225
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,630
Drive safely.

226
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,870
Ride safe.

227
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,870
Mr. Li.

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,790
This is a previous

229
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,080
example of our client.

230
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,200
Their family is complicated.

231
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,240
The client has an illegitimate son.

232
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,360
And we focus on

233
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,440
eliminating risks brought by people.

234
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,240
We ensure the client's

235
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,510
legacy is safely inherited.

236
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,200
We named it EverGreen.

237
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,080
Please have a look.

238
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,270
Here.

239
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,200
Mr. Li.

240
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,720
Ms. Yan.

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,480
Mr. Xue.

242
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,790
Wait for my call.

243
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,320
How was it?

244
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,240
You said you were taking care of Dad.

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,720
Actually,

246
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,320
you tried to block Fendou.

247
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,270
Right?

248
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,200
I didn't.

249
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,390
Tell me.

250
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,750
why were you at the parking lot?

251
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,270
If I hadn't

252
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,910
fixed his clothes,

253
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,360
he might be

254
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,550
delayed.

255
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,270
Right?

256
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,480
In that way,

257
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,270
he'll sure

258
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,550
like us more.

259
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,840
You think he likes it?

260
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,360
He asked Yan to pay you.

261
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,550
You couldn't see?

262
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,750
I think you're really...

263
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,670
What?

264
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,480
Say it.

265
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,750
Tell me.

266
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,840
Forget it.

267
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,270
You think I blocked him

268
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,670
and cleaned his clothes.

269
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,240
That's degrading.

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,870
Something to despise.

271
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,510
Right?

272
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,670
You said it.

273
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,270
Oh, I forgot.

274
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,030
I'm just an assistant.

275
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,870
If people think little of me,

276
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,000
it'll put you to shame.

277
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,510
Sorry, boss.

278
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,360
I embarrassed you.

279
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,150
Mr. Li.

280
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,720
I sounded Ke out.

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,200
She did know Manli.

282
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,840
And the way I see it,

283
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,030
they're on good terms.

284
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,120
How good?

285
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,670
She asked how I met Manli.

286
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,910
I said on business occasions.

287
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,270
She strongly recommended Manli to help

288
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,000
with the family office.

289
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,150
Man is like

290
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,200
Ke's mom.

291
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,750
She always carried a big bag

292
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,150
where you could find everything.

293
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,790
Always enthusiastic.

294
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,320
OK.

295
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,240
I see.

296
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,870
What did you see?

297
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,480
Maybe Manli

298
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,150
could talk to Ke smoothly.

299
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,240
I didn't mean to insult you.

300
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,360
Just talking about the facts.

301
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,320
Nothing I can do even if you did.

302
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,550
You're the boss.

303
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,840
I was wrong.

304
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,390
I apologize.

305
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,510
Look.

306
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,790
It's Yan. We have chances.

307
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,620
[Yan: Let's discuss more.]

308
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,000
Nothing to do with me.

309
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,550
It's your credit.

310
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,320
Sorry.

311
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,480
I was anxious.

312
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,360
Sorry.

313
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,440
Xiaozhou.

314
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,030
You get to meet clients in your way.

315
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,910
Which I don't agree.

316
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,080
But I cooperate.

317
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,840
I didn't pester Fendou.

318
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,120
I came to him

319
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,240
because I found

320
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,240
a connection in this case.

321
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,630
Who?

322
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,270
Remember Yuki?

323
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
The salesgirl.

324
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,200
She sells clothes to Fendou?

325
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,200
She's his daughter.

326
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,510
You...

327
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,120
How did you know?

328
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,270
I bought Fendou's autobiography.

329
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,840
I found

330
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,150
Yuki's Chinese name

331
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,750
is the same as Fendou's daughter's.

332
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,390
And some info also matches.

333
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,390
So I tried to confirm with Yuki.

334
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,480
Sure enough.

335
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,390
Why didn't you tell me?

336
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,790
So I tried to get close to Fendou

337
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,870
with Yuki's name.

338
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,360
I wanted him to make time for you.

339
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,790
You couldn't tell me that?

340
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,480
You said you wanted to lead,

341
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,750
to prove yourself.

342
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,550
If I steal your show,

343
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,600
you'll hate me.

344
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,320
Thanks.

345
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,670
For boosting my confidence.

346
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,240
Thanks.

347
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,670
I'm also new

348
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,360
with family office work.

349
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,550
I'm also trying.

350
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,150
I have to admit

351
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,440
you're better than me in some ways.

352
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We're good?

353
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:58,910
I'm busy.

354
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,870
Hey.

355
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,630
How come

356
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,030
Gu Tianming put in good word for you

357
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,910
in front of Fendou?

358
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,150
I played tennis

359
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,600
with him for a whole week.

360
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,320
I lost to him.

361
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,440
Lost?

362
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,360
On purpose?

363
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,440
Of course.

364
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,550
This isn't like you.

365
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,550
And?

366
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,960
I told him the truth.

367
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,630
I lost to butter him up

368
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,910
because

369
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,840
his good character is worth it.

370
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,670
I won't flatter people I don't respect.

371
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,510
This is my bottom line.

372
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,200
You've grown.

373
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,510
That sounds nice.

374
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,150
I seem to see a silver light of hope.

375
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,320
I can follow your lead now.

376
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,960
Well, you need to behave yourself.

377
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,960
I won't let you down.

378
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,510
Had dinner?

379
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,350
I've got only noodles.

380
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,310
How about some eggs?

381
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,110
Vegetables?

382
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,830
Hi, who is that?

383
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,680
Is that Manli?

384
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,720
I'm Sun Atao.

385
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,000
Remember me?

386
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,550
Hold on.

387
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,350
I have bad signal.

388
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,510
Let me go somewhere further.

389
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,030
Atao.

00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,200
Manli.

587
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,310
We simply need a talk.

588
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,920
We can do it anywhere.

589
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,590
Why go to this fancy place?

590
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,790
Atao.

591
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,160
I told my boss about your case.

592
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,960
He cares about it.

593
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,350
His treat.

594
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,550
But you're so young.

595
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,920
He is.

596
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,000
But all he handled is big orders.

597
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,110
What a talent.

598
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,830
Atao.

599
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,510
You can buy an annuity product.

600
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,200
What's the

601
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,720
rate?

602
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,510
We don't call it rate.

603
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,720
We call it benefit.

604
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,790
At most nearly 3%.

605
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,350
3%.

606
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,640
Financial products at banks give me 4%.

607
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,000
Annuity is break-even.

608
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,960
Low risks.

609
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,200
You made this money hard.

610
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,510
Penny by penny.

611
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,680
The product has to be break-even.

612
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,110
But the manager said

613
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,960
they hadn't suffered losses.

614
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
It's always 4%.

615
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,070
Will they write that down

616
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,400
in the contract?

617
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:01,830
Right.

618
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,240
He told me that.

619
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Could he lie?

620
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,720
Those products are all risky

621
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,480
unless it's clearly stipulated.

622
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,510
No...

623
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,720
The manager is even

624
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,310
older than Manli.

625
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,680
He also said this.

626
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,830
If I deposit at his bank,

627
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,440
he'll request cooking oil for me.

628
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,680
I'll give you that in private.

629
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,920
I know you can't do this.

630
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,240
I'll give you the best virgin olive oil.

631
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,480
OK?

632
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,510
Three.

633
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,680
Really?

634
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,160
Really.

635
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,310
So.

636
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,000
How is your annuity

637
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,550
different from banks' products?

638
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,590
Look.

639
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,350
I've calculated.

640
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:40,790
See?

641
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,270
If you buy our product,

642
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,720
OK,

643
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,030
the value will exceed premiums in years.

644
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,200
Over 3,020,000 of cash value.

645
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,400
In 10th year,

646
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,640
its value

647
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,750
is 3,588,900.

648
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,590
Almost 3,590,000.

649
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
What is

650
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,110
cash value?

651
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,160
In general,

652
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,480
it's the principal plus benefit.

653
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,350
Annuity products meet your every needs.

654
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,830
The value keeps increasing in decades.

655
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,590
Atao.

656
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,440
Think of

657
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,160
the bigger picture.

658
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,750
You know?

659
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,750
Decades are long.

660
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,720
I don't know if I'll live that long.

661
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,440
You'll have longevity.

662
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,440
You saved money.

663
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,880
If you can spend it,

664
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
leave it to your daughter.

665
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,510
Grandchildren.

666
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,000
They all benefit.

667
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,830
If my daughter gets married,

668
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,270
will my son-in-law share?

669
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,720
Yes, they're family.

670
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,310
Right?

671
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,440
But your rate

672
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,200
is still low.

673
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,790
Not a good deal.

674
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:52,750
Atao.

675
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,680
If you're still hesitating,

676
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,160
you can go compare more.

677
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,480
You have her number.

678
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,960
When you decide,

679
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,160
call her.

680
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:02,880
OK?

681
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,350
We won't keep you anymore.

682
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,960
We'll be off.

683
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,350
Leaving?

684
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,070
You have other questions?

685
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:11,720
No.

686
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,920
We'll leave.

687
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,200
Thanks.

688
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:23,790
Xiaozhou.

689
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,000
Xiaozhou.

690
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,270
You go back to company.

691
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,920
I'll continue with Atao.

692
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,030
One step away from getting the deal.

693
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,400
I can't give up.

694
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,440
Manli.

695
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,200
We've got only 24 hours a day.

696
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,400
Atao is our client.

697
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,750
So is Fendou.

698
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,070
They entrusted so much money to us.

699
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,790
Yet we spend energy and time

700
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,750
on others?

701
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,240
Is it fair?

702
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,000
Atao makes money hard.

703
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,480
The banks' products

704
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,000
do look better than ours.

705
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,750
But the rates keep dropping.

706
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,000
It might be soon lower than ours.

707
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,720
She'll suffer losses.

708
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,110
Don't worry.

709
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,590
I'll surly deal with

710
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,310
Atao's case.

711
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,160
But I need you

712
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,590
on this one.

713
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,680
You're close to Yuki.

714
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,240
That gives us the upper hand.

715
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,830
I really need your help.

716
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,310
You're my boss.

717
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,790
It's only fair I listen to you.

718
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,030
I'll do as you say.

719
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,400
After this,

720
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,750
you can do whatever with

721
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,720
Atao's plan.

722
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,750
Even if you want to switch to recycling,

723
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,240
I'll agree.

724
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,440
What?

725
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,750
You're driving me away?

726
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,440
Not that easy.

727
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,790
Don't touch me.

728
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,720
Mr. Xue.

729
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,750
Mr. Xue...

730
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,480
Mr. Xue.

731
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,350
Mr. Xue.

732
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:50,790
Morning, Weina.

733
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,160
Morning.

734
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,680
I was just looking for you.

735
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,790
What's this?

736
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,480
Fortune forum led by Tonghua University.

737
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,640
Many famous chairmen and professors

738
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,070
will attend.

739
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,110
For me?

740
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,310
I'll see if I have time.

741
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,880
Mr. Xue.

742
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,350
Qing worked hard

743
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,110
to get this invitation.

744
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,550
Many wanted it.

745
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,030
But she kept it

746
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,720
for you.

747
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,200
Thank her for me.

748
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,160
I'll attend.

749
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,200
Elevator arrives.

750
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,830
Take this.

751
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,240
Mr. Xue.

752
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,400
Qing really

753
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,920
makes a good boss.

754
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,110
How so?

755
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,960
Weina

756
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,480
gave it to you

757
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,400
in front of a crowd,

758
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,790
because Qing wanted Ling to

759
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,000
hear about this.

760
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,830
She wants to keep you guys fighting.

761
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,680
Save your time for me.

762
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,200
What?

763
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,880
I'm going?

764
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,160
At such a high-end forum,

765
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,000
no one speaks human language there.

766
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,590
You'll regret when I doze off halfway.

767
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,070
I can go find customers instead.

768
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,070
Don't bury your head in work.

769
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,590
Look up at the heavens.

770
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,310
That's exactly how they talk.

771
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,240
Cheesy.

772
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,790
OK, just follow my lead then.

773
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,000
Got it, boss.

774
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,070
A bad temper at a tender age.

775
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,590
What?

776
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,550
Thanks for your hard work.

777
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,640
How is it?

778
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,400
Almost finished.

779
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,680
Conclusion?

780
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,350
Tempted?

781
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,720
For what?

782
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,000
You forgot.

783
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,640
Yuki likes you.

784
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,310
Consider marrying

785
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,310
into her family?

786
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,920
Saves you decades of work.

787
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,590
I have many decades.

788
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,240
Thanks a lot.

789
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,640
Really.

790
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,350
Yuki is nice.

791
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
If you get together with her,

792
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,000
her dreams will come true,

793
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,920
you'll succeed,

794
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,830
and Fendou will have an heir.

795
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,480
It's not even a win-win deal.

796
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,960
It's triple-win.

797
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,480
Plus me.

798
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,640
I can also benefit.

799
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,720
Quadruple-win. Win big.

800
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,680
So you're tempted.

801
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,110
You look great too.

802
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,240
And Fendou's single.

803
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,750
You can try.

804
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,270
I am.

805
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,480
But I'm divorced.

806
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,790
An assistant for her young boss.

807
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,720
I have a son they don't want.

808
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,590
I know what I'm worth.

809
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,590
The worst in the marriage market

810
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,830
in the park.

811
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,880
OK, stop.

812
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,400
Don't say that about yourself.

813
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,070
I'm joking.

814
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,720
I do like myself.

815
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,310
I don't want to remarry.

816
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,030
No.

817
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,750
I won't take it.

818
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,960
But there's always

819
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,350
good guys.

820
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,680
If,

821
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,110
just if

822
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,240
you want to date,

823
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,790
what will he be like?

824
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
Dating.

825
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,350
Well.

826
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,880
First of all,

827
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,800
Dingding must like him.

828
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,670
And?

829
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,230
And.

830
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,400
And...

831
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,360
He also

832
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,960
likes Dingding.

833
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,670
Yes, OK.

834
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,630
Then?

835
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,550
Then he must be good to me.

836
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,030
He must be financially OK.

837
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,550
He can't drag me down.

838
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,190
Looking after you, making money...

839
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,280
It should be OK.

840
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,840
Who is it?

841
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,110
Someone fancies me?

842
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,190
You match us up?

843
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,480
Who?

844
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,550
Just a casual chat.

845
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,070
I've checked.

846
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,280
In the whole family trust,

847
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,920
Fendou cares the most about his heir.

848
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,320
There's these possibilities.

849
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,230
His daughter,

850
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,030
son-in-law,

851
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:58,960
or,

852
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,070
professional managers.

853
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,920
I don't think he likes either of them.

854
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,030
I'm seeking other ways.

855
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,400
Others.

856
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,510
In his book,

857
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,760
he didn't mention other ways.

858
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,590
You can sell by reading books?

859
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,590
So you just keep repeating things.

860
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,550
Don't hurt my passion.

861
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,320
Tell me.

862
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,030
You see.

863
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,000
He's 49, young.

864
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,030
He can have a new heir.

865
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,760
He wants to...

866
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,360
have a new heir.

867
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
Why won't he tell his daughter?

868
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,150
You'll have to consider

869
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,670
Daer's feelings when you remarry.

870
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,710
Yuki's 27.

871
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,150
Fendou has to consider

872
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,510
her feelings.

873
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,960
It's hard to tell.

874
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,400
Behind

875
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,480
every policy,

876
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,000
there's a family full of stories.

877
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,190
Manli.

878
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,000
You have a long way to go.

879
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Good job.

880
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,800
You understand so fast.

881
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,030
Big progress.

882
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,070
Milk?

883
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,190
OK.

884
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,800
You mean

885
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,960
I can solve this

886
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,480
by having a baby.

887
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,760
Yes.

888
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,070
It's novel.

889
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,320
Do you think

890
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,440
new money like me

891
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,840
don't care about women's feelings?

892
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,230
We didn't mean that.

893
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,710
This is just a possible solution.

894
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,670
There will always be only

895
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,110
one Mrs. Li.

896
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,800
Yes, but.

897
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,030
You're young.

898
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,550
You might meet someone.

899
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,000
Then you can have kids.

900
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,440
That crossed

901
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,320
my mind too.

902
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,920
But when I'm gone,

903
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,670
what if they join hands

904
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,880
with their mom to bully Ke?

905
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,030
How can I meet

906
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,440
Ke's mom in the underworld?

907
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,920
You know Ke?

908
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,110
Yes.

909
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,230
No wonder.

910
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,190
She recommends you guys.

911
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,150
You're close.

912
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,030
Does she really?

913
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,190
Don't misunderstand.

914
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,190
I didn't tell her a thing.

915
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,110
Yuki and I

916
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,030
just get along.

917
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,800
As a dad,

918
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,510
I can't convince her

919
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,630
on some matters.

920
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,150
Maybe you

921
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,760
could talk.

922
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,230
You mean

923
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,000
you want us to convince her to marry.

924
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,480
If the heir is Yuki's kid,

925
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,110
the plan you want

926
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,840
is the least risky.

927
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,550
Right?

928
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,230
Smart.

929
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,190
You're smart.

930
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,000
And Ke trusts you.

931
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,150
I believe

932
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,110
you can accomplish the mission.

933
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,550
What do you think is the next?

934
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,190
Find a suitable way

935
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,800
to talk to Yuki.

936
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,030
You see Fendou's needs reasonable?

937
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,840
He needs to

938
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,880
guarantee his daughter's future.

939
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,960
I don't see a problem.

940
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,840
But he never considers how Yuki feels.

941
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,400
Yuki isn't on good terms with him.

942
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,280
Now if she knows his dad's idea,

943
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,150
the family ties will be severed.

944
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,150
So he needs

945
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,150
mediator.

946
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,480
You're the best candidate.

947
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,110
I'm not doing this.

948
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:27,670
Hey.

949
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,920
Who else then?

950
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,030
You're Yuki's friend.

951
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,670
And it's easier for you to

952
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,280
talk about giving birth.

953
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,880
How can I...

954
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,590
If I were Yuki, I'd feel like

955
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,760
a tool for carrying a baby.

956
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,440
If this won't work out,

957
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,590
not to mention you,

958
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,590
I'll pack up and leave.

959
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:49,840
What do you mean?

960
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,190
Before you joined, the firm

961
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,110
did a background check.

962
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,590
Qing

963
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,510
disagreed.

964
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,760
But I vouched for you

965
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,960
with Fendou's project.

966
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,400
If this fails,

967
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,550
none of us ends up well.

968
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,150
You stupid.

969
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,190
It's fine if she rejects me.

970
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,400
Why did you vouch?

971
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,400
I can make a living with any jobs.

972
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,840
But your career is booming.

973
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,000
Why consider me?

974
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,280
It's no use now.

975
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,880
We have to talk to her.

976
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,710
But I'm concerned.

977
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,960
What if

978
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,280
they fall out due to this?

979
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,030
We'll be sinners.

980
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,440
Manli.

981
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,230
We might fail

982
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,360
but still maybe we'll succeed.

983
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,710
We have to try.

984
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,800
And the way I see it,

985
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,400
Yuki's shop is running badly

986
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,400
without her father's

987
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,630
support.

988
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,840
We try to talk to her,

989
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,030
and maybe,

990
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,670
we'll ease their tension.

991
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:49,760
OK?

992
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,510
(Sun Atao)

993
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,070
(Born in 1962)

994
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,670
Daughter.

995
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,070
Xiaoxuan.

996
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,550
Liu Xiaoxuan.

997
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,920
25.

998
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,590
Husband dead.

999
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,400
Father & daughter.

1000
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,280
Son-in-law?

1001
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,590
If my daughter gets married,

1002
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,070
will my son-in-law share?

1003
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,360
Yes, they're family.

1004
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,030
Right?

1005
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,150
Son-in-law.

1006
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,880
Son-in-law.

1007
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,920
I know what to do with Atao.

1008
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,480
What?

1009
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,230
I thought she cared about benefits.

1010
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,070
But then I guess her

1011
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,880
daughter is going to marry.

1012
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,800
And Atao doesn't like the guy.

1013
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,840
Really?

1014
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,000
A woman's intuition.

1015
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,550
So in this case,

1016
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,630
I'll tell her this.

1017
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,670
Though its benefits are smaller,

1018
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,480
an insurance plan prevents

1019
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,590
her son-in-law from sharing the money

1020
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,070
after she passed away.

1021
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,360
I can convince her this way.

1022
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,030
I see.

1023
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:50,960
Ready?

1024
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,590
To where?

1025
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,760
Yuki's shop.

1026
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,360
