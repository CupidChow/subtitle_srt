Mr. Hu.

40
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,230
Here's your rice.

41
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,680
How do you

42
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,150
think of it?

43
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,350
I still have two pages to read.

44
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,350
Yes yes.

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,070
Um...

46
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,870
Here's another thing.

47
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,950
What now?

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,480
It...

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,680
It occurred to me that

50
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,680
my grandson

51
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,870
and daughter are coming for dinner.

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,630
I have to make food.

53
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,150
No, I should

54
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,840
clean first.

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,630
They like things to be clean.

56
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,630
Clean freak, you know?

57
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,430
(Clean freak?)

58
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,680
Legs up.

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,430
OK.

60
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,960
Mr. Hu.

61
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,150
I've

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,590
moped three times.

63
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,030
Is it clean enough?

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,360
Sit.

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,630
Do

66
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,310
you finish these booklets?

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,680
These are bad.

68
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,400
Give me material on

69
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,470
your annuity products.

70
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,840
Show me that.

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,750
You're over 60.

72
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,310
Annuity doesn't fit.

73
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,870
I think it does.

74
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,360
Give me that.

75
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:44,870
Alright.

76
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,120
This one.

77
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,360
This

78
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,840
one?

79
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,310
What?

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,710
So fast?

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,470
I've read everything on it.

82
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,630
What's there to read?

83
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,800
Xiaozhou.

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
Increasing term life insurance.

85
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,240
That's something.

86
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,910
Xiaozhou, you're amazing.

87
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,120
It never rains

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,390
but it pours.

89
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,270
You bet.

90
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Here, let me take a look.

91
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,800
Where is this client from?

92
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,870
Increasing death benefit.

93
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,270
Passing through.

94
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,560
The application you want.

95
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,070
Thanks.

96
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:28,830
No need.

97
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,600
Amazing.

98
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,240
You see?

99
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,310
Learn from him.

100
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,950
Remember Ling's words.

101
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,240
Work hard,

102
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
get orders.

103
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,680
That's right.

104
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,390
Learn from Xiaozhou.

105
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,310
[Xue did it.]

106
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,430
Not bad.

107
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,680
Heard you sold an increasing death benefit.

108
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,560
Show me the policy.

109
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,950
It's not ready.

110
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,000
The client would sign tomorrow 10 AM.

111
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,070
How old are they?

112
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,800
66.

113
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,680
Where from.

114
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,430
Local.

115
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,390
Where do they live?

116
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,270
Xinjing Third Village.

117
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,600
By the way.

118
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,040
I checked.

119
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,510
The first five brokers who

120
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,800
make such orders

121
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,480
can have a check-up at the firm's cost.

122
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,600
My application.

123
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Please sign.

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,310
Come in.

125
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,430
I see. Put it there.

126
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,870
Sign now.

127
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,480
It won't take time.

128
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,600
[Application]

129
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,310
Just a second.

130
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,270
What's the hurry?

131
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,040
I promise

132
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,560
you'll get this bonus

133
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,560
when the client signs.

134
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,560
OK?

135
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:49,800
That's it.

136
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,920
I need to talk to Yichang.

137
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,950
You should leave.

138
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,040
You don't think

139
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,870
he'll make the order?

140
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,270
Not fit for clients over 60.

141
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,120
Right.

142
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,160
Medium and long-term products like this.

143
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,510
You need over 20 years

144
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,270
to get good benefits.

145
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,360
Why buy it when you're 60?

146
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,390
Bad deal.

147
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,360
This order smells fishy.

148
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,870
He said the client lives in Xinjing.

149
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,720
If I'm correct,

150
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,920
you've

151
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,270
cold-visited (for the first time) there.

152
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,870
Yes.

153
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,920
An old neighborhood

154
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,720
where local elders live.

155
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,270
They turn away the moment

156
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,360
they hear insurance.

157
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,600
Not a chance of

158
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,390
a potential client.

159
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
You couldn't

160
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,190
but he did it on his first time.

161
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:48,920
Exactly.

162
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,190
I don't buy it.

163
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,830
Tomorrow 10 AM.

164
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,600
We'll see.

165
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
You're going...

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,750
He looks eager.

167
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,310
He turned the tides.

168
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,750
Going all out for one customer.

169
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,070
It doesn't make sense.

170
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,680
There's fruits.

171
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,270
Give me one.

172
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,160
It's for clients.

173
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,800
Not here yet?

174
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,190
No.

175
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,070
Didn't come?

176
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,360
Not here now?

177
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,800
Such unreliable clients these days.

178
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,600
What can we do?

179
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,240
Sorry, the number you dialed...

180
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,080
Please redial later.

181
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,440
Where's your client?

182
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,910
Not here yet.

[Bonus Application]

184
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,550
Stood him up.

185
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:36,750
Mr. Hu.

186
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,840
I'm Xue.

I'm Xue Xiaozhou.

00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,720
Are you home?

190
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Why do you want him?

191
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,320
He's not in.

192
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,030
Where is he?

193
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,360
I don't know.

00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,150
Thank you, ma'am.

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,120
I waited for a day.

197
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,910
Did something come up?

198
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,390
Why are you here?

199
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,240
I

200
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,030
thought we'd

201
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,630
sign at our company?

202
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:36,790
Mr. Hu.

203
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,670
What do you want?

204
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,150
I...

205
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,870
You

206
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,480
want to barge in?

207
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,840
I'll call the police.

208
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,630
Hu.

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,790
What's the matter?

210
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,840
Nothing.

211
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,360
He was at my door when I came back.

212
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,720
I don't know him.

213
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,120
I...

214
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,030
Is it a swindler?

215
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,720
Should I call the police?

216
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,600
I'm not a swindler.

217
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,750
So all the things you asked me to do...

218
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,840
You were toying with me.

219
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,750
Mr. Hu.

220
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,670
Mr. Hu.

221
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,240
Didn't I tell you to ignore him?

222
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,240
Why did you act on your own?

223
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,720
He's dishonest.

224
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,270
I taught him a lesson.

225
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,360
He takes pride in his job.

226
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,080
If you push him,

227
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
he could do anything.

228
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,960
So what to do now?

229
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,870
He's blocking me downstairs.

230
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,000
What if I go down,

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,440
and he stabs me in the back...

232
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,870
Now you know the consequence.

233
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,480
You're unreasonable.

234
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,390
Come one.

235
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:34,960
Help me.

236
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,240
Make him go.

237
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,200
Sorry.

238
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,960
Coincidence.

239
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,750
You followed me?

240
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Who?

241
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Only you can come to

242
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,670
this neighborhood?

243
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,870
What?

244
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,150
Turned down again?

245
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,320
How many times?

246
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,630
Mock me as you wish.

247
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,320
I didn't.

248
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,790
Why should I?

249
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,030
I want you to keep your promise.

250
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,550
What promise?

251
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,550
Cooperate?

252
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,320
Yes.

253
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,360
No way.

254
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,670
I knew it.

255
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,790
It's late.

256
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,510
Hungry?

257
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,440
My treat.

258
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,750
So messy.

259
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,840
I'll help organize.

260
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,120
Let's go eat.

261
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,550
Wonton coming.

262
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,120
Thanks.

263
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,870
Enjoy.

264
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,510
Thank you.

265
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,790
Want five-spice powder?

266
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,080
I'll have some.

267
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,870
I wiped your spoon.

268
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,030
Eat.

269
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,600
OK, you can watch me eat.

270
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,600
I was a receptionist at Blue Ocean.

271
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,830
Mr. Jin gave me a chance

272
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,680
to try selling insurance.

273
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,640
I had a position

274
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,400
but no resources or connections.

275
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,920
I could only cold-visit everywhere.

276
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,550
People often called me a swindler.

277
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,480
I need to serve

278
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,110
the clients,

279
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,440
doing laundry

280
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,400
taking care of children,

281
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,350
and running errands.

282
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,920
I even cared for bedridden elders.

283
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,160
But in vain.

284
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,350
I had no orders.

285
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,720
On many days,

286
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,640
I wore myself out,

287
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,030
feeling cold and hungry,

288
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,240
without a penny in my pocket.

289
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,240
I'd have the cheapest wonton

290
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,720
at a stall

291
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,240
at that dusty roadside.

292
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,270
When I was full, I just couldn't

293
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,000
take it lying down.

294
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,070
Why couldn't I do it?

295
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,550
I was no worse than others.

296
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,030
Young man.

297
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,680
I'm not here to mock you.

298
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,160
How should I put it?

299
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,790
I was pissed when

300
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,960
I saw you at Mr. Ai's office.

301
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,720
But the scene of you being criticized

302
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,200
made me go back 20 years ago,

303
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,440
when I just stepped into insurance.

304
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,830
I don't need your pity.

305
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,590
I don't pity you.

306
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,110
I value you.

307
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,200
In you,

308
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,000
I see

309
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,030
what it takes

310
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,960
to be an excellent broker.

311
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,070
Surprised?

312
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,830
Stop kidding.

313
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,070
I mean it.

314
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,440
Of course we're different.

315
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,310
But I know.

316
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,000
You have your principles

317
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,110
and stick to them.

318
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,880
You don't have to play nice.

319
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,880
Young man.

320
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,270
Don't take yourself too seriously.

321
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,070
You can take a horse to the water

322
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,640
but you cannot make him drink.

323
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
I can work alone without you.

324
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,640
Right?

325
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,440
I just want to tell you.

326
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,240
Don't lose hope.

327
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,880
In times when you feel down,

328
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,960
take good care of yourself.

329
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,160
That's how you can recover.

330
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,030
Got it?

331
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
Eat it while it's hot.

332
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,790
Spray this yummy five-spice powder.

333
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,030
OK? Have some.

334
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,240
You like it spicy?

335
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
How about vinegar?

336
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,030
Eat up.

337
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,070
Tomorrow,

338
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,920
go steal the clients

339
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,480
on my secret book.

340
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,240
I'm OK, really.

341
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,550
I've paid.

342
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,790
Go home when you're done.

343
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,310
I'm off.

344
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,030
Wait.

345
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,400
What?

346
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,830
Should we try?

347
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,310
Try what?

348
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:34,920
You...

349
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,000
said we'd

350
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,680
cooperate.

351
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,510
Playing hard to get.

352
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,750
I have this kind of boy

353
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,270
in the palm of my hand.

354
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,160
Where are you?

355
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,070
So noisy.

356
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,920
Grocery market.

357
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,590
Consumption downgrading?

358
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,590
They sell

359
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,240
the same cherries a lot cheaper here.

360
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,920
I sent you the agreement.

361
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Look through for me.

362
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,750
Check the wording,

363
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,550
any typos.

364
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,510
Don't want the boy to

365
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,350
have a hold over me.

366
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,400
You take 90% commission.

367
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,830
And he still said yes?

368
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,680
I'm just using his title.

369
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,160
He won't do a thing.

370
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,350
What can a puppet want?

371
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,310
Sir.

372
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,310
Get me a carp.

373
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,720
OK.

374
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,270
Not too large.

375
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,350
Sure.

376
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,790
Don't exploit him.

377
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,750
He needs money too.

378
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,270
Playing nice, aren't you?

379
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,680
Negotiation is about making room.

380
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,550
If he's reliable,

381
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,350
a long-time partner,

382
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,960
I won't milk him dry.

383
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Make a fortune together.

384
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,000
I know how to handle

385
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,270
a young boy, OK?

386
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,440
How much is it?

387
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,310
28.

388
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,200
Got it, got it.

389
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:58,790
Don't worry.

390
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,000
Gotta go.

391
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,070
I need to pay on my phone.

392
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:01,960
Bye.

393
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,070
Hi.

394
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,510
This is an agreement I drafted.

395
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,510
If we cooperate,

396
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,590
make it official.

397
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,640
We have an agreement to refer to

398
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,350
if any dispute arises.

399
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,030
Rest assured.

400
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,830
I have this examined by a lawyer.

401
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,400
Top one lawyer.

402
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,400
She charges a lot.

403
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,920
They're all my clients.

404
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,310
You sure?

405
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,480
Yes.

406
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,400
I have many high-end clients like this.

407
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,160
I have many polices

408
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,030
worth a 7-digital price.

409
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,200
So this is illegal.

410
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,400
According to

411
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,590
Insurance Law

412
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,110
my lending my certificate to you

413
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,550
for benefits is illegal.

414
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,510
If any dispute arises,

415
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,110
no articles on this paper

416
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,400
is valid.

417
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,790
I also drafted one.

418
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,640
Take a look.

419
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You introduce clients to me.

420
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,550
I sell to them.

421
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,750
What?

422
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,720
Give my clients to you?

423
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,160
Right.

424
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,030
I'll commission you.

425
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,720
It's my job to

426
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,880
convince them to buy.

427
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,000
You can't handle them.

428
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,920
Listen to me.

429
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,880
Do what I say.

430
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,270
Easy money.

431
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,550
Why go the hard way?

432
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,440
I can't go against rules.

433
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,550
Sign my contract.

434
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,310
What?

435
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,750
Commission.

436
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,680
I take 20%.

437
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,030
You must be mistaken.

438
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,880
I'm not.

439
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,680
Dude,

440
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,160
I make money.

441
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,310
I don't beg.

442
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,030
I know you want to take control.

443
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,400
You're going too far now.

444
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,240
I take 80.

445
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:51,750
You, 20.

446
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,550
I take 80.

447
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,640
Take it or leave it.

448
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,000
Hey, wait.

449
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,400
Let's talk this out.

450
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,200
OK?

451
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,640
Alright.

452
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,440
OK.

453
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,350
We should both take a step back.

454
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,110
Sit.

455
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,240
Sit.

456
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,510
Sit down.

457
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,590
Sit.

458
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,510
You

459
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,680
want it to be illegitimate.

460
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,270
I know.

461
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,480
But I

462
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,200
want money.

463
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,440
Won't you consider that?

464
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,110
70-30.

465
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,270
60-40.

466
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,720
50-50, period.

467
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,790
OK, OK.

468
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,440
Give me the contract.

469
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,350
So annoying.

470
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,880
Read carefully.

471
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,440
It's protection for

472
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,440
both of us.

473
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,880
You're funny.

474
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,030
What?

475
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,400
You'll take it to court

476
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,110
if I breach any articles?

477
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,880
In that case,

478
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,830
I'll be ruthless.

479
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,720
Naive.

480
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
The court is full of

481
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,920
people waiting for their

482
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,590
judgment.

483
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,640
Done.

484
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,240
I trust you.

485
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,200
We're on the same team now.

486
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,000
We can't make money

487
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,790
without trust.

488
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,030
Don't think so.

489
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,110
There's many couples

490
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,160
who betray each other.

491
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,640
Thank you for that.

492
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,880
I'm sorry.

493
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,350
I didn't mean you.

494
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,270
Mocking me?

495
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,960
You've got any decent clothes?

496
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,110
What?

497
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,350
Something that

498
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,240
makes you look sharp.

499
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,350
Why?

500
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,720
Here.

501
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,510
For what?

502
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,510
I asked around.

503
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,240
The client will attend a book meeting.

504
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,920
You can't meet them like this.

505
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,350
I don't queue.

506
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,200
You heard about VIPs?

507
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,790
With me, you don't.

508
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:12,960
Manli.

509
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,830
Yuki.

510
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,680
There's also price adjustment

511
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,070
in men's clothes?

512
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,590
Yes.

513
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,160
Manli.

514
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,960
Who is he?

515
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,350
He's on my team.

516
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,350
A new guy.

517
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,960
He's handsome.

518
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,030
Really?

519
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,830
My son looks so better than him.

520
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,030
Manli.

521
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,030
These are on sale.

522
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,750
Let's see.

523
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,510
This one?

524
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,750
Nice.

525
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,790
Try this.

526
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:48,960
Not bad.

527
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,240
I can't wear this.

528
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:51,720
It...

529
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,160
makes me awkward.

530
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,750
Then don't feel

531
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,200
that way.

532
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,110
Any other types you want?

533
00:28:59,310 --> 00:28:59,960
I go fetch.

534
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,310
No, thanks, bye.

535
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,960
Act your age.

536
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,680
You need to act before clients.

537
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,270
Look decent.

538
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,310
Do I look indecent?

539
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,510
Clothes make the man.

540
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,110
These logos

541
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,160
speak for you.

542
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,640
You show up,

543
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,750
and they know

544
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,440
you're rich.

545
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,240
You don't come to them for money.

546
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,550
Once you look rich,

547
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,110
they take you seriously.

548
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,640
If I were them,

549
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,960
I'd think it's flamboyant.

550
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,750
You see?

551
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,240
Shame that you weren't them.

552
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,400
You're someone who'll sell to them.

553
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,030
Yes, it is acting.

554
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,480
And they know.

555
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,160
But they like

556
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,480
this kind of acting.

557
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,400
Young men just don't get it.

558
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:52,880
Just...

559
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,440
OK, stop.

560
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,750
Hello.

561
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,880
Do you have

562
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,400
anything in black?

563
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,750
Yes.

564
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,680
But

565
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,240
they're not on sale.

566
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,070
How much is it?

567
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,720
This is nice.

568
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,350
Bright colors.

569
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,510
You're not tall.

570
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,440
It'll make you different from the crowd.

571
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,030
Right?

572
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,750
Give us his size.

573
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,000
Thanks.

574
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,160
You're welcome.

575
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,720
Xue Xiaozhou.

576
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,070
What was it?

577
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,590
I'm their VIP.

578
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,590
And you embarrassed me.

579
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,200
I sell insurance, I don't do acting.

580
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,270
This is your costume.

581
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,510
Look at you.

582
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,680
Definitely not some big broker.

583
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,270
I'll deal with the clothes.

584
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,240
Dress up.

585
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,540
[Is that boy seeing anyone?]

586
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,830
Yuki is a sales girl,

587
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,400
but she earns a lot,

588
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,480
and has connections.

589
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,270
How about a coffee?

590
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
[I have a girlfriend.]

591
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,510
Sigh, still not over Qiu Lisu.

592
00:32:59,270 --> 00:32:59,750
Xiaozhou.

593
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,400
Look.

594
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,720
Handsome?

595
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,070
Suit.

596
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,240
For me?

597
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,240
This is for grown-ups.

598
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,880
You'll be 18 soon.

599
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,920
A grown-up.

600
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,750
Put it on.

601
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,310
You shouldn't have.

602
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,680
Your dad

603
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,640
tailor-made this for you.

604
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,000
It's just delivered.

605
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,070
Take a photo.

606
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,000
What was that?

607
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,960
I don't want his stuff.

608
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:33,830
Xiaozhou.

609
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,440
He doesn't live

610
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,880
with us,

611
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,790
but look.

612
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,240
He gives us

613
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,790
food, a house, and everything.

614
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,160
He cares about us.

615
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,790
He owes us.

616
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,590
Yes, we have everything.

617
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,680
The best of everything!

618
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,590
But where's he?

619
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,880
Where?

620
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,350
He's a scumbag.

621
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,830
A bastard.

622
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,310
Yes.

623
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,440
He did many bad things.

624
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,880
But...

625
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,110
He was tricked

626
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,280
by those evil women.

627
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,150
He'll wake up.

628
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,840
He'll come back once he does.

629
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,760
We'll be reunited.

630
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,070
Mom.

631
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,360
Don't.

632
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:25,920
Xiaozhou.

633
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,510
If you still

634
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,880
care about me,

635
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,480
make your dad happy.

636
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,480
When he's happy,

637
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,360
he'll return.

638
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,110
Mom.

639
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,440
Put it on, OK?

640
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,230
Mom.

641
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,400
Try it.

642
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,030
Looks good on you.

643
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,440
Xiaozhou.

644
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,760
I wanted you to deal with the clothes.

645
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,440
Not dealing with me.

646
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,400
Where's the client?

647
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,110
Get changed.

648
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,510
Put on your most costly clothes.

649
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,670
Are we meeting them or not?

650
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,920
OK, I'll go first.

651
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,070
Sit, please.

652
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,710
Give me.

653
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,190
Make a call.

654
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,400
Who?

655
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,110
Who do you think Mr. Wei is?

656
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,960
You meet him as you wish?

657
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,590
I buttered him up for two years.

658
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,550
Then I had his number.

659
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,110
So?

660
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,280
Qiu Lisu held this meeting.

661
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,920
If you don't call Lisu,

662
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,190
how are you going to meet Wei?

663
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,190
So I'm now your connection.

664
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,880
You tricked me.

665
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,480
Why are you yelling?

666
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,760
There's a crowd here.

667
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,800
This is unimportant right now.

668
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,670
Do you want an order?

669
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,840
I do.

670
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,230
But I don't take things from Lisu.

671
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,510
Don't worry about that.

672
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,710
She ditched you after using you.

673
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,400
She's guilty.

674
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,190
You know?

675
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,230
Now show up.

676
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,800
She'll be afraid

677
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,150
you'll ruin her meeting.

678
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,070
Then make a request.

679
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,840
You want to meet Mr. Wei.

680
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,030
She won't say no.

681
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,510
I know human nature.

682
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,800
We're not romantically involved.

683
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,710
Call it whatever you want.

684
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,480
Come on.

685
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,800
Call her now.

686
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,590
I either see

687
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,710
the client right now,

688
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,760
or I leave.

689
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,920
Ms. Qiu, Prof. Ding.

690
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,480
See you.

691
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,480
Stop watching.

692
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,550
When will we meet Wei?

693
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,920
Will we meet him?

694
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,510
You won't call?

695
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,280
No.

696
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,440
What are you doing?

697
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,670
Wang Xue.

698
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,510
It's Manli.

699
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,230
Xue.

700
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,360
Ms. Hu.

701
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,070
Why are you here again?

702
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,480
You call me Ms. Hu.

703
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,630
You still respect me.

704
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,440
Ms. Hu.

705
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,920
Sorry.

706
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,000
I didn't know a thing then.

707
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,280
You know.

708
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,590
Prof. Ding is my mentor.

709
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,480
There's a lot of things

710
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,030
I can't talk about.

711
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,550
I'm so moved.

712
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,280
You still recognize me.

713
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,320
I know.

714
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,070
His affairs had nothing to do with you.

715
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,800
I did you wrong.

716
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,230
I'm here

717
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,230
to apologize.

718
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,280
You don't have to.

719
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,550
It's fine.

720
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:09,920
No no no.

721
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,550
I was terribly wrong.

722
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,670
I liked you

723
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,440
the first time we met.

724
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:16,960
Really.

725
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,070
I thought you wouldn't

726
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,230
forgive me.

727
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,280
There's no such thing.

728
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,000
You were so nice to me.

729
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,110
And.

730
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,400
I'll still look up to you.

731
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,110
Really?

732
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:38,960
I have a favor

733
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,230
to ask.

734
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,590
What is it?

735
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,400
See that guy?

736
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,360
Thank you.

737
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,070
It's OK.

738
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,360
Here.

739
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,440
This way.

740
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,840
Follow me.

741
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:29,480
OK.

742
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,070
Another posture.

743
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,190
It's been ages.

744
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:32,670
Yes.

745
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,400
OK.

746
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,230
Beautiful.

747
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,440
Nice to meet you.

748
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:40,880
It's fine.

749
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,590
I'll greet Mr. Wang.

750
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,550
I play poker.

751
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,800
It's not a dinner without poker.

752
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,630
Yes.

753
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,280
Play at my place.

754
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,320
We should have a class reunion.

755
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:49,840
OK.

756
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,150
Mr. Wei.

757
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,550
Hello.

758
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,150
Excuse me.

759
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,150
I'm Xue, Prof. Ding's assistant.

760
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,000
We met before.

761
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,280
I remember.

762
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,360
What's the matter?

763
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,550
I'd like to introduce...

764
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,360
He's?

765
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:07,960
Mr. Wei.

766
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,840
I'm Xue Xiaozhou,

767
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,880
a broker of TSI.

768
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,510
This is my business card.

769
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,590
Broker.

770
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,630
OK, I'll call you.

771
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,280
May I add you on WhatsApp?

772
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,030
My phone battery died.

773
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,590
I'll add you later.

774
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,880
Sure.

775
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,360
He's also related to Ms. Qiu.

776
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,630
See that guy?

777
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,800
He's related to Qiu Lisu.

778
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,550
Hold on.

779
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,440
Let me think.

780
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,070
He's

781
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,710
related to Ms. Qiu.

782
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,550
So

783
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,590
why are you with him?

784
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,900
♫If I close both eyes tonight♫

785
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,780
♫Back to that wishing summer night♫

786
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,540
♫Wind brushes your shaking frame♫

787
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,340
♫That world feels close just the same♫

788
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,740
♫If I dare to face the dawn♫

789
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,460
♫Do you know this face you'd drawn♫

790
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,260
♫Gray spirals looped in endless chase♫

791
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,060
♫Tracing tears not words they trace♫

792
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,820
♫How many times must this repeat♫

793
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,340
♫Sighs pull my gaze to retreat♫

794
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,180
♫Sleepless nights, risks untold♫

795
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,980
♫None of it for my own soul♫

796
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,420
♫Winds blew, rains poured♫

797
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,300
♫Umbrellas broke, we soared♫

798
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,380
♫Sky fell, ground shook♫

799
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,900
♫Through dusk till dawn I stood♫

800
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,860
♫Cars passed, dreams drowned♫

801
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:05,260
♫Every stop's chain unbound♫

802
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,300
♫Moon watched, stars blazed♫

803
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,180
♫Lamps died, connections phased♫

804
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,300
♫Held hands, laughed then cried♫

805
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,580
♫Hearts froze, parts died inside♫

806
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,220
♫Tried hard, spoke true♫

807
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,220
♫Now I'm someone I never knew♫

808
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,220
♫Love came, hate stayed♫

809
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,740
♫I arrived, you frayed♫

810
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,100
♫Voice cracked, tears burned♫

811
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
♫Life lost, lessons earned♫

812
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,700
♫Grew up, let go♫

813
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,700
♫Why cling to old sorrow♫

814
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,060
♫How many loops replay♫

815
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,740
♫Sighs steal my gaze away♫

816
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,260
♫Lost nights, bold bets♫

817
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,900
♫Nothing for my regrets♫

818
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,300
♫Winds raged, storms crashed♫

819
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,980
♫Dawns broke, I held fast♫

820
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,100
♫Cars fled, dreams fled♫

821
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:11,580
♫Every route left dead♫

822
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,100
♫Love left, hate stayed♫

823
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,980
♫Voice gone, tears paid♫

824
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,620
♫Grew strong, moved on♫

825
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,620
♫Why dwell when it's gone♫
