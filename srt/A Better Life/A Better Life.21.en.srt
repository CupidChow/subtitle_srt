40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Episode 21

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,430
Hello ma'am.

42
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,480
Your bill is 13,800.

43
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,540
Hey.

44
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,430
Um...

45
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,200
Do you have group purchase coupons?

46
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,430
I mean like,

47
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,840
on rating apps,

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
other restaurants offer
discount group coupons.

49
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,000
Which platform do you have them on?

50
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
I'm sorry ma'am.

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,630
We're actually a private club here.

52
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,190
We don't offer discounts
on any platforms.

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,150
The only discount
is through membership cards.

54
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,960
Okay, sure.

55
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,590
Could I get a membership card then?

56
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,360
Certainly, the initial deposit is 100K

57
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,030
with a 5% discount.

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,080
How would you like to pay?

59
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,080
One hundred thousand?

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,710
How could anyone possibly eat that much?

61
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,680
Young lady,

62
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,630
could you ask another guest

63
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,030
to borrow their membership card?

64
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,520
Well...

65
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,710
Maybe I should consult with Mr. Ai

66
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,500
Hey! No!

67
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,280
Go ahead and scan it.

68
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,560
Okay.

69
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,910
Let's go.

70
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,240
Change shoes.

71
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,280
Wait a moment.

72
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't you have anything to say to me?

73
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:20,840
Mr. Ai

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,310
is with Ya now.

75
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,560
How did you know?

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,520
Say something.

77
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,840
Yesterday,

78
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,120
after finalizing Ms. Zhong's deal,

79
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,430
I just

80
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,030
felt completely empty inside.

81
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,710
I can't really describe the feeling.

82
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,560
I just wanted,

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,560
I just wanted to talk to Ya.

84
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,240
So I went to

85
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,310
where she usually plays tennis
with colleagues.

86
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,360
And saw them?

87
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,830
Don't comfort me.

88
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,390
It's fine.

89
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,000
Actually, I can't comfort you.

90
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,720
Ai Linjiang is tall, rich and handsome.

91
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,600
No matter which aspect you look at,

92
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
he has the upper hand.

93
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,270
Hu Manli, you...

94
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,950
Xiaozhou,

95
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,720
I know you're pitiful.

96
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,120
Your mom's gone.

97
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,680
Your girlfriend broke up with you.

98
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,870
However sad or heartbroken you are

99
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,480
behind closed doors,

100
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,870
you can't bring those emotions to work.

101
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,680
To make it worse,

102
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,830
you actually got physical with a client.

103
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,070
He provoked me first!

104
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,560
He crossed the line today,

105
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,630
but you gave him the opportunity.

106
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,270
You told me
you didn't want to see clients,

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,800
But the moment you heard it was him,
you agreed,

108
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,830
even splurged on new clothes.

109
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,480
Trying to compete with him, is that it?

110
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,310
He stole Ya away!

111
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,480
I just can't stand him!

112
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,390
Stole?

113
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,920
What do you think Ya is?

114
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,800
An Ultraman? A Transformer?

115
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,070
She goes to whoever punches harder
between you two?

116
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,270
Yes, he's insanely rich.

117
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,310
What's so great about that?

118
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:16,940
Oh.

119
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,510
From what you're saying,

120
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,190
do you think

121
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,920
Ya is with him for money?

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,270
Do you think Ya is that kind of person?

123
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,160
What are you doing?

124
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
I'm asking Ya

125
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,510
if she's with him for money.

126
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,950
You've completely lost your mind!

127
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,630
Give me my phone.

128
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,870
Hand it over!

129
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,390
Even if Ya is with him for money,
what can you

130
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,070
possibly do?

131
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,830
What do you want to do?

132
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,750
Give me the phone!

133
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,830
Confiscated!

134
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
You wouldn't listen when I'm nice.

135
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,680
Force me to be blunt, is that it?

136
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,240
So what if Ya was your ex-girlfriend?

137
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,630
Can't people break up?

138
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,240
Even married couples can!

139
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,120
She's free to be with whoever she wants!

140
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
That's her right!

141
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,800
You can't prove yourself worthy.

142
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,390
Don't blame others for it!

143
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,190
Staring?

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,720
Staring at me?

145
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,070
It won't help!

146
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,920
Won't listen when I'm nice.

147
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,040
For goodness' sake!

148
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,920
Are you okay?

149
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,800
I was afraid to come out.

150
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,750
None of your business.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,720
Go do your homework.

152
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,040
I've already finished.

153
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,040
Also memorized everything for tomorrow.

154
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,870
Also I want to report to you.

155
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,950
I got 88 on this month's English test.

156
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,390
Ninety is within reach.

157
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,070
Not bad.

158
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,830
Keep up the good work.

159
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,360
At least there's one thing
that makes me happy.

160
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,630
Get me a glass of water.

161
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,160
What exactly did Xiaozhou do wrong for you to

162
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,680
talk to him like that?

163
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,000
Let him go.

164
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,040
This is infuriating.

165
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,910
Hurry up.

166
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,720
Compete with me over women?

167
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,600
If I didn't give you business,

168
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,750
you wouldn't even have food to eat!

169
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,910
How dare you challenge me?

170
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,440
Mom.

171
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,870
Xiaozhou is miserable enough already.

172
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,030
Don't scold him.

173
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,200
What else can I do then?

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,200
Of course, comfort him with kind words.

175
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,840
I've said all there is to say.

176
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,270
He's taking extreme measures.

177
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,320
Then I'm sorry.

178
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,320
I can only scold him.

179
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,080
Aren't you afraid he'll do

180
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,480
something drastic?

181
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,270
Is he worse off than me?

182
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,000
When I was ten,
your grandma passed away.

183
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,550
At 39,

184
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,600
your father had an affair and left me.

185
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,270
And I'm still living just fine.

186
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,030
He'll live.

187
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,720
No, no, no.

188
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,550
Scientific research shows

189
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,550
women have
far greater stress tolerance than men.

190
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,840
What's more.

191
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,550
Mom, you're an iron warrior among women.

192
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,000
What you can handle,

193
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,910
others might not withstand.

194
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,120
Just think how Dad
hides at the slightest problem.

195
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,870
Right?

196
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,270
That's true.

197
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,240
So please stop scolding him.

198
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,600
What if

199
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
he does something reckless?

200
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,390
Who'll tutor me in English?

201
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,660
Oh my.

202
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,790
So tutoring built bonds, huh?

203
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,320
You've become thick as thieves.

204
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:23,740
Look!

205
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
It's ten o'clock.

206
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,150
Stop worrying! Go to sleep!

207
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,630
Pack your schoolbag.

208
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,390
Don't forget things.

209
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,670
Go to bed now.

210
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,790
Xiaozhou.

211
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,670
Want some fruit?

212
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,200
Xiaozhou.

213
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,510
I left something in the study.
Can you open the door?

214
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,870
What are you doing?

215
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,630
Could you open the door?

216
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,000
If you don't open it, I'm coming in.

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,840
Xue Xiaozhou.

218
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,270
What are you doing?

219
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,480
Um...

220
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,080
I...I spoke a bit

221
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,320
harshly earlier.

222
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Please don't take it to heart.

223
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,910
I'm just worried for you, you know.

224
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,390
Hu Manli.

225
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,360
You were right.

226
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,440
I'm really quite despicable.

227
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,120
No no no.

228
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,600
You're amazing.

229
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,550
Really outstanding.

230
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,960
You do have your merits.

231
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,360
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been

232
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,000
able to pull off
Zhong Ning's deal, right?

233
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,120
Stop lying to me.

234
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,790
You already figured out

235
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,720
a solution for Zhong Ning, didn't you?

236
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,150
Two years ago,

237
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,360
you did an educational video
about it online.

238
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,060
Huh?

239
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,080
I did?

240
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,270
Maybe it's been too long, I forgot.

241
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,910
Stop trying to placate me.

242
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,670
Actually I...

243
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,200
Actually my existence

244
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,080
has no meaning at all.

245
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,670
If I die,

246
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,870
in this world,

247
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,320
there wouldn't be any loss.

248
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't be ridiculous!

249
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,360
What was that?

250
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,440
- Xue Xiaozhou! What are you doing?
- Let go!

251
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,910
- You... - Let go!

252
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,550
Xiaozhou, don't scare me.

253
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,360
- Xiaozhou, come down now!
- Let go!

254
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,670
Don't do this.

255
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,790
I'm begging you.

256
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
If you want to die, don't do it here.

257
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,600
If you jump from here,

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,440
my apartment will become stigmatized
and lose value!

259
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,200
Xiaozhou...

260
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,720
Xiaozhou, I was wrong.

261
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,240
Come down now, don't scare me.

262
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,670
No! Don't push me down!

263
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,960
- I don't want to die yet! - Come down!

264
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,150
Get down.

265
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,360
Let go!

266
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,750
I just wanted to stick my head out
to feel the breeze

267
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,030
to clear my mind a bit.

268
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,870
It's the fifth floor.

269
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,550
You wouldn't die from jumping anyway!

270
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,240
Let go.

271
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,440
For real?

272
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,440
Let go now.

273
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,150
Then come down.

274
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,120
Let go.

275
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,720
Come down.

276
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,150
Let go.

277
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,960
Come down already.

278
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,910
Fine, I'm coming down.

279
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,960
My pants! My pants!

280
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,220
Ouch!

281
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,080
Ouch...

282
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,200
Are you crazy?!

283
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,360
You scared me to death!

284
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,240
What are you doing, Hu Manli?

285
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,510
I'm really fine now.

286
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,720
For real?

287
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes.

288
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,870
But

289
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,550
it might still take some time.

290
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,080
Anyway, I've figured it out.

291
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,750
Starting tomorrow,

292
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,630
I'll face life

293
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,670
like an adult.

294
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,480
I'll face reality.

295
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,510
If I still do anything wrong,

296
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,390
you can keep scolding me

297
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,360
until I grow up.

298
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,870
Am I your mother?

299
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,790
Why scare me like that?

300
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,550
Damn it! My legs are weak!

301
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,670
You scared half the life out of me!

302
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,550
You're my sister.

303
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,550
Didn't you just tell Mr. Ai

304
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,720
I'm your little brother?

305
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,200
I'm not your sister!

306
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,390
I took it seriously.

307
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,000
But

308
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,390
calling you "sis" is too cheesy.

309
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll just call you Manli.

310
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,200
Don't touch me!

311
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,030
Geez!

312
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,550
Mom.

313
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,870
Dingding, come here.

314
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,080
Give me a hand.

315
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,790
Hurry up.

316
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,220
Ouch.

317
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,600
What's going on?

318
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,000
Nothing.

319
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,440
He's really...

320
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,510
Just ignore him.

321
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,080
Unbelievable!

322
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,310
Stop spacing out, eat up.

323
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,160
Mom.

324
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,440
You force me to eat breakfast every day.

325
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,720
Why don't you eat yourself?

326
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,400
Why compare with me?

327
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,480
No matter how much I eat,
I only gain weight not height.

328
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,400
Hurry up and eat.

329
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
After dropping you at school,

330
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm going to visit your grandpa.

331
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,180
Oh.

332
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,480
Since you're busy today,
I'll take Daer.

333
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,920
Are you going to the office today?

334
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,680
The underwriting period for
Ms. Zhong's expires today.

335
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,270
I'll follow up.

336
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,960
You alright?

337
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,750
I'm fine.

338
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,480
Are you okay?

339
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
You do have responsibility.

340
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,680
Have this.

341
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,830
And eat an egg.

342
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,750
Careful.

343
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,310
Got it.

344
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,550
Bye.

345
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,160
Don't rush, careful.

346
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,790
Bye, Mom.

347
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,790
Mom will pick you up after school.

348
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,750
Bye, buddy.

349
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,550

[Liking posts on social media]

354
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,880
Liking between colleagues
shows goodwill.

355
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,440
Superiors liking subordinates' posts
shows encouragement.

356
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,350
Subordinates liking superiors' posts
shows alignment.

357
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,350
Do you usually like clients' posts?

358
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,750
Why not?

359
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,790
Why should I?

360
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,200
It's zero-cost. You must do it.

361
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,830
Liking is the lowest-cost
client maintenance.

362
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,480
Understood?

363
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,270
Zero-cost means it's unimportant.

364
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,790
If I like a client's post,

365
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,880
they'll give me the deal?

366
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,000
Clients won't give you business just because

367
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,070
you liked their post.

368
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,880
But those who never like their posts,

369
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,270
they would never consider

370
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,440
because it shows
you don't care about him.

are you at home?

374
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,720
I'll prepare the medicine
and bring it over later.

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,720
You should have finished them this week.

380
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,310
Have you been skipping medicine again?

381
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,160
Let me think.

382
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,880
Yes, yes,
seems like I've almost finished them.

383
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,310
Don't lie to me!

384
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,480
I've let your herbal remedies and

385
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,270
medicinal wines slide.

386
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,110
But you must take
the prescribed medicine properly!

387
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,310
Do you understand?

388
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,160
Got it, got it

389
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,350
I have something to do.

390
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,790
I have an appointment to meet someone.

391
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,070
We'll talk later.

392
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,590
Gosh...

393
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,830
Not a moment of peace.

394
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,640
Attention, guys.

395
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,400
Ling is treating everyone
to lunch today.

396
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,830
Those who want to go
please reply in the group chat, okay?

397
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,000
Great!

398
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,020
But I'm meeting a client tonight.

399
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,900
[Thank you, Ling]

400
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,220
It's just lunch.

401
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,660
[Got it]

402
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,350
Thank you, boss!

403
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,440
Here!

404
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:12,960
Meatballs ready?

405
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,000
Come on, you three.

406
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,160
Come on, let's drink.

407
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,680
Let me propose a toast.

408
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,440
Everyone fill your glasses.

409
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,110
Stand up everyone.

410
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,680
I hereby

411
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,240
wish everyone huge sales every year,

412
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,680
every month,

413
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,070
and every day!

414
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
May everyone become
the best salesperson!

415
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,790
Great!

416
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,350
Cheers!

417
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,830
Bottoms up!

418
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,480
Yes!

419
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Cheers!

420
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,960
Bottoms up!

421
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,440
To Ling.

422
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,960
Is there enough food?
If not, we can order more.

423
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,440
More than enough.

424
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
Every time we dine with Ling,

425
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,110
we always end up stuffed to the brim.

426
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,680
Right! With a boss like her...

427
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,640
Thank you, Ling.

428
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,750
Hey, bring the gifts over.

429
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,880
Everyone, listen up.

430
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
Guys, sit.

431
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,960
As usual,

432
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,590
our team rewards and punishes fairly.

433
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,440
Based on this month's performance,

434
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm personally funding

435
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,510
gifts for everyone.

436
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,830
Great.

437
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,960
Let me see.

438
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,590
Let's see who's first.

439
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,270
Let me see.

440
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,310
Sun Xiaoqiang.

441
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,160
Yes, Ling.

442
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,310
Here.

443
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,640
I love it.

444
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,590
Thank you, Ling.

445
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,160
Glad you like it.

446
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,440
Work harder, keep it up.

447
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,030
Sure.

448
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,920
Back to your seat.

449
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,200
Okay.

450
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,110
Good.

451
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,480
Next one.

452
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,350
This is...

453
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,200
Huang Yu! Still eating? Yours.

454
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,270
Here!

455
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,750
Yours.

456
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Thank you, Ling.

457
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,270
A power bank!

458
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,160
How did you know I lost my power bank?

459
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,200
Lost it?

460
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,590
You can lose anything,

461
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,960
but not the deals!

462
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,480
Right!

463
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:51,920
Good.

464
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I swear: heads may roll, blood may spill,

465
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,510
but the deals stay intact.

466
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,350
The deals must not be lost.

467
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,400
Let's see who's next.

468
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,820
Oh my.

469
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,030
Yang Yichang.

470
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,400
Here!

471
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,070
Yours.

472
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,030
Thank you, Ling.

473
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,480
Tough Shields!

474
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,240
Long live Ling!

475
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,720
Keep it up.

476
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,440
Next.

477
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,270
This one's pretty big.

478
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,400
Whose gift is this?

479
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,200
Whose is it?

480
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Xue Xiaozhou.

481
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,200
Yours.

482
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,240
Have a look

483
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,830
How is it?

484
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,750
Like it?

485
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,110
No.

486
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,640
Ling, this is way too extravagant.

487
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,550
It has to be extravagant!

488
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,200
Xue Xiaozhou is our department's
top performer!

489
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,590
This is what he deserves, right?

490
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,550
Right!

491
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,270
Applause!

492
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,240
Everyone should learn from Xue Xiaozhou.

493
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,920
Understood?

494
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,270
Yes!

495
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,070
Work hard and keep it up!

496
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,070
Take a photo for us.

497
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,310
Okay.

498
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,680
Alright?

499
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,830
Use filter.

500
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,720
Beauty mode.

501
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,480
Over here.

502
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,000
Sure, Ling.

503
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,350
Smile.

504
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:19,960
Smile, come on.

505
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,070
Three, two, one.

506
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:23,790
A few more.

507
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,400
Change position.

508
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,310
Turn around, back-to-back.

509
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,880
Take one back-to-back.

510
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,550
Wrong way.

511
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:30,750
Stay still.

512
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,270
Okay.

513
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,480
Got it.

514
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,030
How is it?

515
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,350
Your legs look super long.

516
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,880
Right?

517
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,550
Send it to Xiaozhou.

518
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,920
Xiaozhou, post it on your Moments.

519
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,310
Okay.

520
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,640
Then everyone likes Xiaozhou's post!

521
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,790
Okay!

522
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,550
Xiaozhou, have a seat.

523
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,640
- Thanks, Ling. - Now.

524
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,750
Let's continue, who's next?

525
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,030
You okay?

526
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,440
Next, Tong Hui!

527
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,880
Here!

528
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,270
Your account got hacked?

529
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,310
Why does it look like
a pyramid scheme?

530
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,110
Finally using your brain.

531
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,790
Tough Shields!

532
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,550
The ultimate winner in life!

533
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,270
Tough Shields!

534
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,030
The ultimate winner in life!

535
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,070
Cheers!

536
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,030
Come on, everyone take a seat!

537
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,790
We'll now

538
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,200
let Xiao Zhou share with us

539
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,400
how to achieve in less than three months

540
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,160
what others
take three years to accomplish!

541
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,960
Applause!

542
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Great!

543
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,790
Great!

544
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,790
Great!

545
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,400
Applause!

546
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,440
Good! Applause!

547
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,110
Bravo!

548
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,160
Bravo!

549
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,160
Good, great!

550
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,550
I, I remember someone once said

551
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,590
that

552
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,680
when selling insurance,
throw shame to the wind.

553
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,550
Don't laugh.

554
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,070
I, I think this is absolute truth.

555
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,680
Why didn't I understand before?

556
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,510
I used to be so pretentious.

557
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,750
Stupid, right?

558
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,000
Just didn't get it at all.

559
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,880
The truth that money's hard to earn
and shit's hard to swallow.

560
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,960
No, seriously.

561
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,070
Wait.

562
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,960
What is dignity?

563
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,880
Can dignity fill your stomach?

564
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,160
No, right?

565
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,550
Can it be spent as money?

566
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,440
No, dignity is useless!

567
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,200
Completely useless!

568
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,750
Worthless!

569
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,160
Applause!

570
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,110
Good!

571
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:01,960
And another saying.

572
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,720
One shouldn't value dignity so much

573
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,510
as to reject money!

574
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,880
Right!

575
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,310
- Right! - In this world,

576
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,510
in our lives,

577
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,510
without money,

578
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,400
you truly can't move an inch.

579
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,510
Right!

580
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,400
Bravo!

581
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,160
Bravo!

582
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,480
Wang Lingling!

583
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,480
You're still eating? Here!

584
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,110
Did you hear what Xiaozhou just said?

585
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,860
Yes.

586
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,960
Do you understand?

587
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,380
Yes.

588
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,070
Put that shirt on.

589
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,440
What? You don't want to?

590
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Then you still don't understand.

591
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,720
Your performance
will still be at the bottom.

592
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,270
Put it on.

593
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,720
Xiaozhou didn't wear it
last time either.

594
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,680
What?

595
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,270
Xiaozhou didn't wear it
last time either.

596
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:05,920
You are

597
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,550
comparing with him?

598
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,590
Aren't you ashamed?

599
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,240
Quickly, put it on.

600
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,960
Wait a second.

601
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,400
The criticism is justified.

602
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,350
Didn't I not wear it last time?

603
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,830
I definitely have to make up for it.

604
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,680
Absolutely right, no problem with that.

605
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:28,790
No problem.

606
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,160
It's just a shirt.

607
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,310
What's the big deal?

608
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,550
Right? Right?

609
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,440
Just a shirt.

610
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:37,830
Do I look good?

611
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,440
Good!

612
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,200
Yes!

613
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,030
It looks quite nice.

614
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,590
What are you filming?

615
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,310
It's not for free.

616
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,720
If you film me,
you have to buy insurance from me.

617
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:47,960
Here.

618
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,830
We... we

619
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,790
We're a major insurance company.

620
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,350
We're called TSI.

621
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,680
Really, in the industry...

622
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,310
Let me give you... give you...

623
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,240
It's in my pocket.

624
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,350
Let me give you...
give you my business card.

625
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,070
If you ever need to buy insurance...

626
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,830
See? See?

627
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,830
Just come find me.

628
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,350
This is our top salesperson.

629
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,270
Thank you.

630
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,070
These are all potential clients!

631
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,110
Things like... elderly care assistance

632
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,920
or kids going to school...

633
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,310
Wait.

634
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,510
What's gotten into Xue Xiaozhou?

635
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,830
Taking care of elders...

636
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,920
How much did he drink?

637
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:17,920
Seriously?

638
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,680
Even buying a burial plot...

639
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,070
Has nothing to do with alcohol.

640
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,070
Life gave him a solid lesson.

641
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,750
Let me tell you.

642
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,270
Someone like him
who thinks so highly of himself,

643
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,790
once he lets himself go

644
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,880
and starts self-deprecating,

645
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,720
he'll go further than anyone else.

646
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,510
Must remember this.

647
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,640
We're TSI.

648
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,030
How does that saying go again?

649
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,550
Life is merciless,

650
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,200
but TSI has compassion.

651
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,270
Come on, slogan time!

652
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,310
Slogan!

653
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,590
Tough Shields!

654
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,270
The ultimate winner in life!

655
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,830
Tough Shields!

656
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,510
The ultimate winner in life!

657
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,110
Tough Shields!

658
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,920
- Next life stage, - Life's big winner!

659
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,720
- Must have it. - TSI!

660
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,790
Thank you.

661
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,000
- Life's big winner! - Thank you.

662
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,640
Tough Shields!

663
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,790
The ultimate winner in life!

664
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,830
Thank you, take it.

665
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,240
- Tough Shields! - Here.

666
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,680
The ultimate winner in life!

667
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,000
Manli, Zhong Ning is your friend, right?

668
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,510
Her case is under my management now.

669
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,880
Today she called me,

670
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,440
asked many questions about claims.

671
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,750
She even asked about suicide payouts.

672
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
I found it very strange.

673
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,200
Maybe you should ask her
what's going on.

674
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,960
I see, thank you.

675
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:23,920
Hello.

676
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,350
Ai, hi.

677
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,590
It's Hu Manli. Is Zhong Ning there?

678
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,310
Ning started her vacation today.

679
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
She's going to the Maldives.

680
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,980
What?

681
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,310
Going to the Maldives?

682
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,510
How come I didn't know?

683
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,920
When is she leaving?

684
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,960
Should be today.

685
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,160
Okay, got it. Thanks.

686
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,960
Zhong Ning.

687
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,480
I need to talk to you.

688
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,110
Message me back
or call when you're free.

689
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,820
[Jun, can you talk to me?]

690
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
[Xiaozhou said
Jun's policy needs extra info]

691
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,000
Zhong Ning.

692
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,920
Where are you?

693
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,400
What's wrong with
Jun's insurance policy?

694
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,150
The company said

695
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,630
the dual recording isn't very clear.

696
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,000
They need you to

697
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,670
re-record it.

698
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:55,920
Manli.

699
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,800
You're lying.

700
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,030
I'm not lying to you.

701
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,960
Then put Xue Xiaozhou on the phone.

702
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,190
He just told me on the call.

703
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,440
We're not together.

704
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,630
Stop lying, Manli.

705
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,150
You're lying to us too, aren't you?

706
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,800
You don't want treatment.

707
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,230
You just want to settle things
and then die

708
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,920
Right?

709
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:21,710
Where are you?

710
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,630
Hello?

711
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:25,920
Hello?

712
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,320
Where are you?

713
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,920
Manli.

714
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,400
Hang up.

715
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,920
Don't hang up!

716
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,880
There really is a problem with the policy.

717
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,800
It can't be processed.

718
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,280
As for the rest,

719
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,590
I don't know how to handle it either.

720
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,960
Let's fix the policy issue first.

721
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,510
Okay?

722
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,920
After that,
I won't care if you live or die.

723
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,880
Where are you?

724
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,880
I'll give you the address.

725
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,920
But you have to
bring Xue Xiaozhou with you.

726
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,070
I promise.

727
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,760
Dammit, what's going on?

728
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,320
Calm down.

729
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,670
Answer the phone.

730
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
What's going on?

731
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,190
Where are you?

732
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,590
Hotpot restaurant.

733
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,280
Sir, could you go
a little faster please?

734
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,150
Okay.

735
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,630
Ling.

736
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,630
Tell me, this Xue Xiaozhou

737
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,400
Is he pretending to be crazy or playing dumb?

738
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,710
If he didn't want to tell us his secret,

739
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,000
he didn't need to go this far, right?

740
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,510
You never know.

741
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,960
Buy insurance from me!

742
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,550
Here you go.

743
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,880
Buy insurance from me.

744
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,710
Someone as handsome as you
selling insurance?

745
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,510
So handsome people can't sell insurance?

746
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,000
But not by shouting like you do.

747
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,000
When you're selling,
you've got to shout.

748
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,230
What's there to be embarrassed about?

749
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,230
You've got to be loud enough
for everyone to hear.

750
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,510
I'm just a lousy insurance salesman, right?

751
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,360
If you're gonna sell,
you better sell properly.

752
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,190
What's the big deal?

753
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,960
Stop filming!

754
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,030
Never seen someone drunk before?

755
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:34,670
What am I doing?

756
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,360
- Don't interfere! - Stop filming!

757
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,710
I didn't say anything wrong, did I?

758
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,360
Why is she here?

759
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,230
What's wrong with filming?

760
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,360

Hurry up!

766

No wait, what's so urgent?

767

769

What do you think you're doing?

777

If you can wear it, why can't I?

778
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,230
Isn't it about maturity?

779
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,320
Isn't maturity just

780
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,510
bowing and scraping,
selling insurance, being a yes-man?

781
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
If others can do it, so can I.

782

Am I not doing well enough?

783

on him alone, is that it?

802
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,630
Think he's got no family to back him up?

803
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,630
Manli, you've got it all wrong.

804

I don't care who else you mess with.

808
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,280
But Xue Xiaozhou is my brother.

809
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,510
If you dare touch him

810
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,630
I won't let you get away with it.

Who helped me through my toughest times?

837

You negotiated deals with me,

Who said you're useless?

845
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,440
You're very useful, you know?

846
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,710
At the very least
during my hardest times,

847
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,230
I couldn't have made it without you.

848

Why are you crying?

849
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,760
Don't cry.

850
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,960
Didn't cry when your mom left.

851

What are you crying about now?

852
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,550
