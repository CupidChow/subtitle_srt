Episode 13

41
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,150
Professor Ding!

42
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,640
Here!

43
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,480
Let me toast you again!

44
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,590
Thank you!

45
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,840
Didn't I ask Ms. Qiu to
give a few suggestions

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,560
about my autobiography?

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,400
You certainly criticized it.

48
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,640
You said...

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,230
You... What was it again?

50
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,040
What?

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Extremely poor taste!

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,230
Sycophantic flattery!

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,790
Nonsense from start to end!

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,910
Accurate!

55
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,150
Particularly accurate!

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,960
I've shown it to so many people.

57
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,240
None dared tell me this!

58
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,750
Only Professor Ding is

59
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,910
upright and unyielding!

60
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,520
I toast to you!

61
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,280
Here!

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,840
No, I can't.

63
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,430
No more, please.

64
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,520
Just one more!

65
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,190
I...

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,910
I really can't drink anymore.

67
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,870
No, I can't.

68
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,360
Zhiyuan.

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,150
Mr. Li's told me many times.

70
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,280
You're his most respected figure

71
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,080
in the cultural circle.

72
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,710
Yes!

73
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,000
He'll be heartbroken if you don't drink.

74
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,710
No, I can't.

75
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,310
How about this?

76
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,150
You drink half, and I drink half, okay?

77
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,030
No, no.

78
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,190
That absolutely won't do!

79
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,710
Professor Ding, a real man

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,310
can't let a woman take the drink for him.

81
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,280
You should cherish the fairer sex!

82
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,840
Last cup.

83
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,310
Last cup.

84
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,470
Last cup.

85
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:15,750
Here.

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,630
Here.

87
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,400
Here, pour me some.

88
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,120
There you go.

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,080
Here!

90
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,080
Straight from the pot!

91
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,280
Last cup.

92
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,960
I respect you!

93
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,560
Alright, we're done.

94
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,000
No more drinking.

95
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,840
Drink some water.

96
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,910
Some water.

97
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,400
Professor Ding.

98
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,080
I

99
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,400
wanted you to write the preface,
but you've been busy.

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,280
So I had someone else write it instead.

101
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,310
Take a look at this.

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,030
If you find it alright,

103
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,150
sign here, and it's as good as yours.

104
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,910
Saves trouble, doesn't it?

105
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,400
Here.

106
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,120
Take a look.

107
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,960
Here we go again. My signature?

108
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,590
Look. It's just a signature.

109
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,800
I won't sign.

110
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,470
See? They've already written it.

111
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,470
Just have a look.

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,000
Just take a look.

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,510
Look, it's quite good.

114
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,480
Why sign if I didn't write it?

115
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,630
Forget it, forget it.

116
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,120
Seriously, I'm done.

117
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,120
Such fuss over one signature.

118
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,070
I know he despises me. I quit!

119
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,060
Oh my.

120
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,190
Mr. Li

121
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,360
Don't say that.

122
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,500
No, forget it.

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,190
The thing is, Zhiyuan,

124
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,830
-I didn't write it.
-he treasures his reputation.

125
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,240
If you use a ghostwriter,

126
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,800
he needs to review before signing it.

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,510
I'm done with this!

128
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,780
Zhiyuan.

129
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,420
Ah.

130
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,560
I...

131
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,260
Uh?

132
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,240
I've reviewed it.

133
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,800
It's passable.

134
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,000
When you have time later,

135
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,700
just give some more feedback.

136
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,220
Hm.

137
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,120
It just needs slight modifications.

138
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,750
Modifications?

139
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,000
For today though,

140
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,600
just sign here.

141
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,160
The publisher is in a hurry.

142
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,360
When the revisions are made,

143
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,190
they'll definitely let you review again.

144
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,600
Right, Mr. Li?

145
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:30,950
Yes!

146
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,480
Right?

147
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,630
Yes, good.

148
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,190
Come on, let's sign.

149
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:35,830
Here.

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,750
Sign?

151
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Over here.

152
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,510
Come.

153
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,310
Here, right here.

154
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,830
Not there.

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,720
The back.

156
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,870
Here.

157
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:50,800
Yes.

158
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,160
Here.

159
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,120
There you go.

160
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,430
Done.

161
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,260
[Ding Zhiyuan]

162
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,680
Signed.

163
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,430
All done.

164
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,950
Are you alright?

165
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,800
Quick!

166
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,480
You okay?

167
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,160
Go on, there!

168
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,310
Are you okay?

169
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,950
So much effort for a signature.

170
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,510
Look at this, he even threw up.

171
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,480
Linjiang.

172
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:35,560
Dad.

173
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,430
What I want to tell you is,

174
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,680
back then, because I was too ambitious,

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,240
I chose your mom.

176
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,800
But all these years

177
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,360
I've only felt guilty toward Ma Xiaowei.

178
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,040
I've never done

179
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,830
anything to betray your mom.

180
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,800
Trust me.

181
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,950
Dad, don't talk about this.

182
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,160
When you were in the ICU,

183
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,920
I already figured it out.

184
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,070
What happened doesn't matter.

185
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,190
Only your health matters.

186
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,950
Let bygones be bygones.

187
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:24,720
Your meds.

188
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,120
Come in.

189
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,360
Mr. Ai, it's us.

190
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,310
You can sit up already? That's great.

191
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,510
Let me take my medicine.

192
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,830
Take it easy.

193
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,360
Thank you for visiting me.

194
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
We're relieved you're okay.

195
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,160
Chen told me what you did

196
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,270
during my coma these days.

197
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,600
I really appreciate your help.

198
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,160
And you too, young man.

199
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,430
I should thank you as well.

200
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,430
My pleasure.

201
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,600
Don't dwell on it, it's all over now.

202
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,800
Focus on recovering.

203
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,600
Surviving disaster brings blessings.

204
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,480
Blessings?

205
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,510
Blessings my foot!

206
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,800
Even my own son wanted me dead.

207
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,240
Where are those blessings?

208
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,800
How can people be so vicious?

209
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,920
Dad, stop thinking about this.

210
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
I'll handle his situation.

211
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,920
Dad! Dad!

212
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:25,830
Dad!

213
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,240
Why are you here?

214
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,000
I came to see my dad!

215
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:27,950
Dad! Step aside!

216
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,510
You can't go in!

217
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:28,950
Why are you here?

218
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,630
Stop! This is a hospital.

219
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,430
- I came to... - Get out!

220
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,270
Let me apologize to Dad!

221
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,680
Dad!

222
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,080
No need.

223
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,630
What I did was too extreme!

224
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,790
I had no choice, Dad!

225
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,510
Please listen to me!

226
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,200
Dad, are you abandoning me? Dad!

227
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,080
- Stop shouting. - Dad!

228
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,200
Linjiang... Linjiang.

229
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,440
Dad...

230
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,390
Let him in.

231
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,670
Dad...

232
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,120
Are you okay?

233
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,440
Dad...

234
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,000
Dad...

235
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,960
I was wrong, Dad.

236
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,960
It was all my so-called friends

237
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,080
who gave me the idea.

238
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,720
I saw you unconscious then.

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,080
I was... I was panicking.

240
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,150
I just... I just...

241
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,910
You wanted me dead, didn't you?

242
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,790
No!

243
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,600
Dad, I'm sorry.

244
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,790
Dad, I'm a bastard!

245
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,440
I'm sorry! I'm an animal!

246
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,440
Please forgive me, Dad.

247
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,790
Okay, stop hitting yourself.

248
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,120
You should leave now, go.

249
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,390
Dad...

250
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,200
Dad...

251
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,440
I'm terrified of poverty, Dad.

252
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,790
We were truly destitute.

253
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,320
Mom cut ties with her family long ago.

254
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,240
She worked any job she could find

255
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,240
just to raise me, Dad.

256
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Dad, it's true!

257
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,080
Ma Xiaowei, stop playing the victim.

258
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,480
If your mother knew

259
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,600
you could do something like this,

260
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,270
she'd regret ever giving birth to you,

261
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,390
Alright.

262
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,960
Xiaowei, you should leave now.

263
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,030
If anything comes up later,

264
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,480
Chen will handle it.

265
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,440
Go.

266
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,720
Go.

267
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,000
Dad... Dad...

268
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,240
Look.

269
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,240
Mom kept

270
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,030
this photo under the pillow.

271
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,630
Look at it, just look.

272
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,270
If Mom knew

273
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,960
you wouldn't take care of me,

274
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,270
she'd die with regrets, Dad!

275
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,320
Dad!

276
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,390
Mom!

277
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,840
Mom!

278
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,510
Mom!

279
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
Why did you even give birth to me?

280
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,510
Why didn't you take me with you
when you left?

281
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,360
Why did you

282
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,320
leave me to suffer in this world?

283
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,240
Mom!

284
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,120
Why?

285
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,840
Enough!

286
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,030
Mom, why?

287
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,240
Just leave now, okay?

288
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,080
Go.

289
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,600
Mom!

290
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,120
Go!

291
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,630
That's enough!

292
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
We'll talk again

293
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,120
about what to do.

294
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,790
Okay, we'll talk later.

295
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,960
Dad, you take care.

296
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,390
Then I'll wait for your call.

297
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,030
I'm leaving now, Dad.

298
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,510
Dad, I'm taking this photo.

299
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,910
Dad, get well soon.

300
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,670
Take good care of Dad.

301
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm leaving, I...

302
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,790
Go.

303
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
Dad... Dad... I'll wait for your call.

304
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,270
Get well soon.

305
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,510
Get out!

306
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,550
What a sin.

307
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,910
It's all my fault.

308
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,360
Linjiang.

309
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,320
I understand.

310
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,840
His matter,

311
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,360
I'll handle it.

312
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,630
Mr. Ai,

313
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,960
you called us here

314
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,960
but won't speak.

315
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,510
That annuity contract,

316
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
let Ma Xiaowei sign it.

317
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,550
No, absolutely not.

318
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,270
No, Mr. Ai.

319
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,480
Your father is soft-hearted.

320
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,870
He wants his son to live comfortably.

321
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
But have you ever considered

322
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,840
if you do this

323
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,320
you might actually harm

324
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,870
that brother you just met.

325
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,960
My father's stance is already clear.

326
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,440
Ma Xiaowei must have that money.

327
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,240
If he's content, I won't object.

328
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,360
The rest isn't my concern.

329
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,200
Your father provides funds,

330
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,150
hoping Ma Xiaowei can live well.

331
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,080
But if someone like him has money,

332
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
what do you think will happen?

333
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,390
That's why Dad structured it
as an annuity.

334
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,270
Only annual dividends,
no principal access.

335
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,630
Living off dividends his whole life?

336
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,080
How's that different from
a worthless man?

337
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,910
What's that got to do with me?

338
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,000
Mr. Ai.

339
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,720
You might not like hearing this.

340
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,630
However much you despise him,

341
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,750
he shares your blood.

342
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,510
If he's really wasted,

343
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,270
would your father be happy?

344
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,150
If he causes trouble later,

345
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,960
could the Ai family just ignore it?

346
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,270
Manli.

347
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,910
When he chooses self-destruction,

348
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,270
I can't control it.

349
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,240
Nor can my dad.

350
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,080
But insurance can manage it.

351
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,360
What do you mean?

352
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,390
Trust fund.

353
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,000
Here.

354
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,080
Right now,

355
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,550
all insurance companies

356
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,120
are lowering trust fund thresholds.

357
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,150
We suggest instead of buying annuities,

358
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,150
set up a trust for Ma Xiaowei.

359
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,510
Simply put, it means every month,

360
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,910
it gives him a fixed living allowance.

361
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,630
I suggest this amount
needn't be too much.

362
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,750
It should just cover

363
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,630
his basic monthly living needs.

364
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,720
How's this different from annuities?

365
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,910
Quite different, actually.

366
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,670
Trust funds can set certain

367
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,870
payment trigger conditions.

368
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,550
For example?

369
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,750
The most important one I think is

370
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,670
making sure Ma Xiaowei
keeps a decent job

371
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,750
and obeys laws and rules.

372
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,270
If he violates regulations,

373
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,390
we can revoke his trust eligibility.

374
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,480
Also, if major life events occur,

375
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,360
like Ma Xiaowei getting married

376
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,480
or having children,

377
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,440
we can set up something

378
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,200
to allow him withdraw
a certain amount of cash at once.

379
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,840
But the key point is,

380
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,750
Mr. Ai,

381
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,840
you must retain

382
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,200
the right to modify payment triggers.

383
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,480
Wealth unearned brings disaster.

384
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,030
The reason we're doing this

385
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,240
is to help Ma Xiaowei
stay on the right path.

386
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,910
In the future, you and your father

387
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,790
will avoid many troubles this way.

388
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,320
Alright, let's do it this way.

389
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,270
You're back.

390
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,670
What are you...

391
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,550
Don't you remember what I told you?

392
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,480
I'm moving to the hospital dormitory.

393
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,320
So soon?

394
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,270
You should move to

395
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,480
a smaller place too.

396
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,150
The landlord just raised the rent,

397
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,270
increased by 1,000 at once.

398
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,670
Forget it, don't move.

399
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,750
I know you can't bear to see me leave.

400
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,030
Neither can I.

401
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,600
But think about it.

402
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,840
This way,

403
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,840
we'll save a lot on rent.

404
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,080
Ya,

405
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
I secured that three million deal.

406
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,080
Really?

407
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,790
Yes!

408
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,480
We can move to another place,

409
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,240
somewhere closer to the hospital.

410
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,440
So you can walk to work.

411
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:41,870
Xiaozhou,

412
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,960
if you really have spare money,

413
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,030
consider your mom's treatment plan.

414
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,840
What treatment plan?

415
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,150
Ms. Duan said

416
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,790
she now qualifies for
stimulator implants.

417
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,030
She can have spinal cord stimulation

418
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,910
for deep brain stimulation

419
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,360
and vagus nerve stimulation.

420
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,030
No, I mean—

421
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,910
Are you saying...

422
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,870
You mean...Mom might wake up?

423
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,720
Ms. Duan said it herself.

424
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,790
There's great hope.

425
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,440
That's wonderful!

426
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,480
That's wonderful, Ya!

427
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,640
Xiaozhou.

428
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,270
You just landed such a big deal.

429
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,070
And now,

430
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,240
your mom's condition looks promising.

431
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,350
I'm so happy for you.

432
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,310
But you...

433
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,240
You're moving away.

434
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,240
See? Even the cat
doesn't want you to leave.

435
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,070
Baodan, you don't want
Mom to go either, right?

436
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,030
Did you hear what it said?

437
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,440
It said it doesn't want you to leave.

438
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,200
Don't go. I can handle many things.

439
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Hello?

440
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,440
You're here.

441
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,400
Okay, I'll be right out.

442
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,000
The taxi driver is here.

443
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,960
Please stay.

444
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,240
Xiaozhou.

445
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,440
Ms. Duan applied for the dorm for me.

446
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,590
It wouldn't be right if I don't go.

447
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,960
Besides...

448
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,030
Your mother's treatment plan

449
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,510
will cost at least 80,000 yuan.

450
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,000
Money should be spent wisely.

451
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,590
Alright. I'll help you with it.

452
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,640
Stay here.

453
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,720
Check if you missed anything.

454
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,200
Take it slow.

455
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,270
Don't. Let me do it.

456
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,920
The car's plate?

457
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,720
T3Y9.

458
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:38,920
Don't go.

459
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:10,830
Baodan.

460
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,720
Come here, let Mom hold you.

461
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,400
Sorry, Baodan.

462
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,720
Mom can only accompany you this far.

463
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,440
Here's the dormitory.

464
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:55,960
Hi, Ya.

465
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,400
Let us help you.

466
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,240
Thank you.

467
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,680
Let me.

468
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,550
No problem, I got this.

469
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,440
It's okay, let me help.

470
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:00,880
I'll take it.

471
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,590
Xiaozhou, this is the girls' dorm.
It's...

472
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,550
It's heavy.

473
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,240
Be careful!

474
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,030
Sorry to trouble you both.

475
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,680
No problem.

476
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,960
She's quite strong.

477
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,750
Text me when you're done unpacking.

478
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,550
Go on up.

479
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,790
Maybe you should go first.

480
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,680
It's fine, I'll watch you go up.

481
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,550
Then I'll be off.

482
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,200
Go ahead.

483
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,000
What's going on?

484
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,310
There, there.

485
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,310
Let me see.

486
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,400
What's wrong?

487
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,590
Come on, it's not a breakup.

488
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,960
I'm fine.

489
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,070
Ya, you...

490
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,160
Trust me.

491
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,480
Days like these

492
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,480
won't last much longer.

493
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,640
Then I'll head up.

494
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,590
Go on.

495
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,350
Goodbye, Xiaozhou.

496
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,510
Take care of yourself.

497
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,880
Go home.

498
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,590
Xue Xiaozhou closed another big deal?

499
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,270
A newcomer who

500
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,790
just joined closed two major deals,

501
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,480
one being a trust fund

502
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,270
Did you really not know at all?

503
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,310
I haven't checked the system yet.

504
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,270
And I never expected

505
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,550
things would progress this fast.

506
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,960
You thought he was useless?

507
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,110
Ms. Li, here's the thing.

508
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,680
This Xue Xiaozhou,

509
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,200
he's really... complicated.

510
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,680
If you say he's capable,

511
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,830
after a whole month,

512
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,720
he hadn't closed
a single basic insurance policy.

513
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,720
Normally he should've been let go.

514
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,270
If you say he's not capable,

515
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,640
he's a law graduate from Futan University

516
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,790
with excellent credentials.

517
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,110
No reason he couldn't succeed.

518
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,640
Then I remembered

519
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,880
you always taught us

520
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,640
to recognize people's talents.

521
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,160
So I thought

522
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,920
for a high-achiever like him,

523
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,200
maybe he should handle premium clients.

524
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,070
So I transferred

525
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,920
my nearly-closed major clients

526
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,790
to him.

527
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,400
Who would've thought

528
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,400
that was

529
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,640
the right move?

530
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,070
So you referred big clients to him.

531
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,400
Surely you're aware of this.

532
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,200
For large-scale orders like these,

533
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
without three to five years,

534
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,480
that level of client trust

535
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,920
could never be established.

536
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,830
Besides,

537
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,750
if Xue Xiaozhou contacted them himself,

538
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,030
no one would even give him the time.

539
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,000
Excellent, Tang Ling.

540
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,830
That shows strategic thinking.

541
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,350
Proves you're growing as a manager.

542
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,680
Thank you, Ms. Li.

543
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,830
Actually, Ms. Li,

544
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,750
I heard the company's new family office

545
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,030
is expanding its team.

546
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,350
Got some thoughts?

547
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,720
I was thinking

548
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,590
more top talents could join our company,

549
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,790
giving us learning opportunities.

550
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,510
I know

551
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,310
you resent me hiring externally.

552
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,350
No, not at all.

553
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,270
Sit.

554
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,200
Tang Ling.

555
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,000
You know I admire your ambition.

556
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,270
But

557
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,030
selling insurance and family offices

558
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,920
are entirely different ball games.

559
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,790
You might not make it through.

560
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,350
Unless

561
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,750
you can prove yourself to me.

562
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,590
Ms. Li,

563
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,680
you mean...

564
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,750
Wasn't I clear enough?

565
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,830
Go ahead.

566
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,550
I'll be waiting for your good news.

567
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,200
Thanks for the opportunity, Ms. Li!

568
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,880
Ms. Li really said that?

569
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,350
Congrats, Ling!

570
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,920
It's too early for congratulations.

571
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,270
Ms. Li made it very clear.

572
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,720
I need to land big clients
to prove myself.

573
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,110
Yichang,

574
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,440
check our current big clients.

575
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,510
See if we can close a deal soon.

576
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,070
Ling,

577
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,270
those clients we're handling,

578
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,350
you know them well.

579
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,880
They're all tough nuts to crack.

580
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,790
What about Xue Xiaozhou's client?

581
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,830
What's their deal?

582
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,830
I find it strange too.

583
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,310
How did he land such big orders?

584
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,590
Two at once no less.

585
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,830
He won't even post on social media,

586
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,270
skips all gatherings,

587
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:12,880
and never seen him

588
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,640
make cold calls.

589
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:14,960
These two people

590
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,720
fell from the sky.

591
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,510
Free pies falling from heaven.

592
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,880
Sounds great.

593
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,750
But pies can kill when falling.

594
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,110
What do you mean?

595
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,790
I suspect

596
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,350
someone's backing Xue Xiaozhou.

597
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,480
Who?

598
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,000
That's exactly

599
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,350
what you need to figure out.

600
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,070
Keep a close eye on him.

601
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,750
See who's helping him.

602
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,070
Got it.

603
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,200
Just like this apple in my hand.

604
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,200
For most people,

605
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,030
it's simply an apple,

606
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,240
nothing special.

607
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,830
But philosophically speaking,

608
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,790
why is it an apple

609
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,440
and not something else?

610
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,310
Why does it exist?

611
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,110
What's its essence?

612
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,030
Where are its boundaries?

613
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,030
I once ate a fruit

614
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,830
called apple-pear.

615
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,160
It was hybridized

616
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,550
from apple and pear grafts.

617
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,270
So the question is

618
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,350
what is its true nature?

619
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,590
Is it an apple or a pear after all

620
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,030
or something entirely new

621
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,960
has fundamental emerged.

622
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,510
The show's click-through rate dropped.

623
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,920
How could this happen?

624
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,920
I thought last episode was brilliant.

625
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,200
That's exactly the problem.

626
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,270
You indulge yourself,

627
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,240
but the audience doesn't buy it.

628
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,960
During the recording just now,

629
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,640
the crew nearly fell asleep.

630
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,920
Didn't you notice?

631
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,350
That only proves

632
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,310
professionals in this industry

633
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,270
are lacking

634
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,440
cultural literacy.

635
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,310
Zhiyuan,

636
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,350
let's stop beating around the bush.

637
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,310
I think

638
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,790
the content we record each episode

639
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,790
could be more down-to-earth.

640
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,550
We should ride trending topics.

641
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,110
It can't be too highbrow.

642
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,160
Alright.

643
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,200
So...

644
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,750
Like what?

645
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,550
For example,

646
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,880
night-time barbecue is trending now.

647
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,310
Could we incorporate that?

648
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,030
This is absolute nonsense.

649
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,680
Barbecue is just barbecue.

650
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,440
How can I relate that to philosophy?

651
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,440
You can talk about an apple
for half an hour.

652
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,790
Why not the same with barbecue?

653
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,550
Zhong Ning,

654
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,160
I expect basic respect from you.

655
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,310
Professor Ding,

656
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,480
respect goes both ways.

657
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,160
Company rents spaces, hires people.

658
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,920
Everything costs money once we start.

659
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,440
If the click-through rate falls short,

660
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,920
the boss will scold me.

661
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,200
I must

662
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,110
show the company some returns.

663
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,880
What you're doing is shortsighted.

664
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,030
Getting impatient after just this long?

665
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,640
The audience needs time to nurture.

666
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,590
But we need to survive first
to nurture them.

667
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,920
If things keep going downhill,

668
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,160
I can't even guarantee
the show's survival.

669
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,510
Zhiyuan.

670
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,590
You don't want

671
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,510
the show to fail so quickly, do you?

672
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,640
Are you threatening me?

673
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,200
It's useless.

674
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,350
Solve your own problems.

675
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,070
Don't drag me into this.

676
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,140
Gosh.

677
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,960
The commission split
has been transferred.

678
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,550
Received it. Thanks.

679
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,310
No, you...

680
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,110
You're leaving already?

681
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,880
What? You got something to do?

682
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,720
Sit, sit down.

683
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,070
What is it?

684
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,480
Nothing major, just...

685
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,110
That...

686
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,720
Should we sign the agreement again?

687
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,350
Are you...

688
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,310
Proactively seeking cooperation?

689
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,000
No way...

690
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,790
Last time, right here,

691
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,160
you said you wouldn't
work with me anymore.

692
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,270
People make mistakes sometimes.

693
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,480
Right?

694
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,070
People?

695
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,270
Me.

696
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,750
Don't talk nonsense.

697
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,350
How could you possibly be wrong?

698
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,000
I... I was.

699
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,160
Impossible, no way.

700
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,790
I... I really messed up.

701
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,590
It was my fault.

702
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,510
What did you do?

703
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,350
Be specific.

704
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,110
You're a good person.

705
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,400
Good person...

706
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,960
Giving me the "good person" speech?

707
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,070
And you're so warm-hearted too.

708
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,830
What a shame.

709
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,110
Me? Just wasted my kindness.

710
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,920
No, you didn't.

711
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,000
Any more?

712
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,550
Yes, of course...

713
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,030
You're stuck?

714
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,750
Brushing me off?

715
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,510
We're done.

716
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,830
You... you...

717
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,350
Can't handle this already?

718
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,100
Huh?

719
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,460
Hey.

720
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,680
Let me tell you.

721
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,790
Many people want to team up with me.

722
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,720
I know, I know.

723
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,830
Because you're

724
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,400
an exceptional insurance agent.

725
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,310
Elaborate.

726
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:39,750
Come on.

727
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,400
Expand on that.

728
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,030
You see,

729
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,110
I've actually learned

730
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,070
so much from you,

731
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,750
like always taking the long-term view,

732
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,920
treating clients like friends.

733
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,640
Beyond their surface needs,

734
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,310
understand their true intentions.

735
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,240
And also...

736
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,310
And this too.

737
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,310
Policies aren't just about fine print.

738
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,920
They involve family relationships.

739
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,480
Right?

740
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,440
And...

741
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,480
There's more?

742
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,590
Damn it.

743
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,880
I only get this small cut from you.

744
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,200
You stole so many skills. What a loss!

745
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:22,960
And...

746
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,720
And...

747
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,510
Just spit it out.

748
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,030
I really can't make up more.

749
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:42,900
Oh!

750
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:43,960
One more thing.

751
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
My hatred for my father

752
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,510
has been let go.

753
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,200
Thank you.

754
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,400
Sincerely?

755
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,480
Truly.

756
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,000
You really should thank me.

757
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,160
How about this?

758
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,400
Adjust the profit split again.

759
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,150
How?

760
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,190
Me 90%, you 10%.

761
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,320
No way, Hu Manli.

762
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,440
Don't push your luck.

763
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,230
You just said you truly thanked me!

764
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,070
Right?

765
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,590
When it comes to money,

766
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,030
true colors show, huh?

767
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,150
60-40.

768
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,150
70-30.

769
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,190
I don't really care anyway.

770
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,030
Right?

771
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,550
With all my client resources,

772
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,190
I could partner with anyone.

773
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,510
Why should I hang myself on your tree?

774
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,280
Bill, please.

775
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,710
No, wait, hold on.

776
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,360
Sorry.

777
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,920
Okay. Fine.

778
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,230
30-70.

779
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,800
It's fixed now, take a look.

780
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,110
You've got better connections.

781
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,440
Do you happen to know if there's

782
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,190
any shared apartments?

783
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,670
The cheaper kind, you know.

784
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,070
I just need one room.

785
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,710
What about your place now?

786
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,480
The landlord wants to raise the rent.

787
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,630
Let him raise it.

788
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,920
This deal's commission won't be small.

789
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,030
My mom might need surgery.

790
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,590
It could cost a fortune.

791
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,670
The doctor said she might

792
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,800
actually recover.

793
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,630
So I figured

794
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,760
I should try to save money first.

795
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,280
That's why my girlfriend

796
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,030
moved into employee housing.

797
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,630
She wants me to find a smaller place.

798
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,480
Alright.

799
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,800
I'll think it over.

800
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,880
Hey, you graduated from
Futan Law School, right?

801
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,230
And?

802
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,710
How were your grades?

803
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,230
Very good.

804
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,630
I got scholarships every year.

805
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,590
What's wrong?

806
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,580
Huh?

807
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,760
Weren't you looking for a roommate?

808
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,440
Then I

809
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,710
need to understand your situation.

810
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,110
You should have better qualities,

811
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,400
so people would want to live with you.

812
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,840
Thanks for that.

[Mandu Garden]

814
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,230

[Selling price: 80K/square meter]

816
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,760
Are you sure about this
upscale neighborhood?

817
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,800
Don't worry, just go.

818
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,960
Baodan, don't worry.

819
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,920
Daddy will take you.

820
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,590
Mr. Chen.

821
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,420
Yes?

822
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,230
Here are some insurance introductions.

823
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,320
I printed them all out for you.

824
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,190
You can use them as food mats.

825
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,400
Read while you eat, okay?

826
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,630
To be honest with you,

827
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,510
I've bought this insurance before

828
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,840
but got scammed.

If you're trying to sell me insurance,

832
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,710
then

833
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,230
please leave.

834
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,550
Take care.

835
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,360
- Scammed how? - Be careful.

836
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,030
What insurance did you buy?

837
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,110
Need me to take a look for you?

838
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,670
It's fine, don't get water on you.

839
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,150
Let's not talk about it.
It was two years ago.

840
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,840
No worries.

841
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,550
I'll leave the documents here.

Hey, I'm downstairs at this complex now.

847
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,670
But are you sure
this is the right place?

848
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,880
Can you see Building 7?

849
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,320
I see it.

850
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,150
Press 502.

851
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,400
Wait here for a moment.

852
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,070
Coming!

853
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,590
What are you doing here?

854
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,440
You asked me to help find an apartment.

855
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,920
Of course
I'd find something good for you.

856
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:16,480
Thanks.

857
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,440
Come on in.

858
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,920
Wait, this complex looks so upscale.

859
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,280
How much is the monthly rent here?

860
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,800
Tell me first so I know what to expect.

861
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,880
Don't worry, it's within budget.

862
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,360
Come in.

863
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,880
You're really letting me live here?

864
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,960
Why else would I invite you in?

865
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,670
No, I can't afford this rent.

866
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,190
And I only need one room anyway.

867
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,550
It's just one room.

868
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:52,510
Here.

869
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,320
This room is yours.

870
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,920
I've already sunned the quilt.

871
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,030
The sheets are all new.

872
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,630
No, wait.

873
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,320
This is your home?

874
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:12,920
So?

875
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,400
The decoration isn't bad, right?

876
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,190
Wait.

877
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
I asked you to find me a place.

878
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,880
And you're making me live in YOUR house?

879
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,630
What's wrong? Isn't this nice?

880
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,550
This...this...

881
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,670
No no, it's not appropriate.

882
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,840
Why isn't it appropriate?

883
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,960
We haven't known each other that long.

884
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,760
A single man and woman under one roof.

885
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,030
Not right.

886
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,150
You're the single man.

887
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,590
And I'm the single woman?

888
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,710
But I'm not worried.

889
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,110
You're as thin as a little chick.

890
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,320
If we really fought, you might not win.

891
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,110
That's not what I'm worried about.

892
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,800
I'm...

893
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,110
