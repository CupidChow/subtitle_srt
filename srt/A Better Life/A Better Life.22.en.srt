[Episode 22]

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,840
Ning.

42
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,280
What are you doing?

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,070
Come back.

44
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,840
Stop there.

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,350
Ning.

46
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,710
You have to arrange

47
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,640
everything for Jun first.

48
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,040
Come here.

49
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,150
I called the insurance company.

50
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,200
They said Jun's plan

51
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,790
gets valid since today.

52
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,910
I bought a critical illness plan.

53
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,360
If I die,

54
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,120
a compensation will go to Jun.

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,750
Do you know?

56
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,030
Now,

57
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,910
no compensation if it's a suicide.

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,800
Come over.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,680
You're lying.

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Why would I?

61
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,520
Ask Xiaozhou.

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,840
Yes, she's right.

63
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,960
They've changed the law.

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,680
Even it's two years later,

65
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,560
no compensation for suicide.

66
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,710
What's point of living?

67
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,240
I'll be a block of wood.

68
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,000
My treatment

69
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,310
will cost all my money left for Jun.

70
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,080
I don't want to drag him down.

71
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,000
Let me tell you.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
All these years,

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,430
the plan I regret the most is yours.

74
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,840
If I hadn't sold it to you,

75
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
you'd be thinking about Jun,

76
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,150
not death now.

77
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,080
You want me to regret my whole life?

78
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,710
Come back.

79
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,430
Don't come over.

80
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,750
Manli.

81
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,240
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,710
What do you want?

83
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,470
Ning, hold on.

84
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,470
Wait.

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,680
Don't come over.

86
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,560
No, don't worry.

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,750
I don't want to save you.

88
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,360
I,

89
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,430
I'm thinking about joining you.

90
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,560
If you'll jump...

91
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,360
Actually,

92
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,240
I wanted to die last night.

93
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,750
I couldn't hold on.

94
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,280
It was hard to

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,310
hold on.

96
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,560
I lost

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,470
all my family.

98
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,360
My girlfriend finally decided to

99
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,120
leave me.

100
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,520
I can feel your pain.

101
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,800
Living

102
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,750
is meaningless.

103
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,120
You could at least

104
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,240
save trouble for people if you're gone.

105
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,630
But you have a son.

106
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,510
You can leave your money

107
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,480
to him.

108
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,310
Me?

109
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
I don't have family,

110
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,120
or money.

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,950
If I die,

112
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,510
I'll have to trouble people to collect my body.

113
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,720
But living is hard.

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,600
Really.

115
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,920
But today, somebody told me that

116
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,720
if anyone bullied me,

117
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,560
she'd step in.

118
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,120
I just realized that

119
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,390
someone cared.

120
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,480
Ning, just wait.

121
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,950
You'll have someone to

122
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,000
make you feel living is worth it.

123
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,430
I won't.

124
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,870
Even Jun hates me.

125
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,750
- Jun!
- Wait!

126
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,510
Come on now.

127
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,360
Jun.

128
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,830
Talk to her.

129
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,120
Why did you get Jun here?

130
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,600
Take him away.

131
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,120
Tell him what you wanted to say.

132
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,830
I won't help.

133
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,830
Jun, talk to your mom.

134
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,310
Jun.

135
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,120
I've got a serious illness.

136
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,040
I can't live.

137
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,630
Take care of yourself.

138
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,000
Jun.

139
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,720
See the photo?

140
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,720
She took it and wanted me

141
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,750
to tell you.

142
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,070
No matter what you think of her,

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,870
she'll love you forever,

144
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,430
till her hair turns gray,

145
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,190
her face gets wrinkled,

146
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,160
and her time comes to an end.

147
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,950
She said

148
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,830
you're the only

149
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,830
one

150
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,160
she cares about in this world.

151
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,040
Mom.

152
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,680
Don't leave me.

153
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,310
I'm missing you every day.

154
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,870
I want to see you age.

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,680
Older than what you look in the photo.

156
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,390
Be with me forever and always.

157
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,480
Mom.

158
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,630
Mom.

159
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,000
Jun.

160
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,480
I can't be cured.

161
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,160
I

162
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,630
won't be able to talk

163
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,720
or walk.

164
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll be bedridden,

165
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,720
burdening you.

166
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,920
It's fine.

167
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,040
As long as you live, for one more year,

168
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,160
a month, a day,

169
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,510
and even a minute,

170
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,270
I'll still have a mom.

171
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,070
Mom, don't die.

172
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,070
I can't live without you.

173
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,160
Mom.

174
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,600
What a day.

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,120
Yesterday it was you.

176
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,190
And just now, Ning.

177
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,720
Oh, my poor heart.

178
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,950
You overthought yesterday.

179
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,190
That today was real.

180
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,360
Scared the hangover out of me.

181
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,120
I was in a hurry to find you

182
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,510
Ling saw me.

183
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,200
She must know we work together.

184
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,000
So be it.

185
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,790
Don't know

186
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,750
how she'll plot from now on.

187
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,630
She must regret the gift for me.

188
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,320
Seen my photos?

189
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,360
Yes.

190
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,080
Ling

191
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,870
was generous.

192
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,390
In an event like that,

193
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,870
you'll give out key chains, file holders, etc.

194
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,630
I started doing that way back then.

195
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,630
This bag

196
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,840
costs thousands

197
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,480
even on sale.

198
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,360
So expensive?

199
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,870
It's yours.

200
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,960
It's your credit anyway.

201
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,440
It's a men's bag.

202
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,000
No.

203
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,480
I can't use it anyway.

204
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,750
It's brand new, unused.

205
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,600
Name your price.

206
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,670
The brand loses value in flea market.

207
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,390
At most 1,000.

208
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,240
Deal.

209
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,550
Manli.

210
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,870
I think

211
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,030
Mom left because

212
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,550
she didn't want to burden me.

213
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,790
She must want me to do something

214
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,360
on my own,

215
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,670
unattached.

216
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,030
Glad that you think like that.

217
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,480
I could use another drink.

218
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,510
What?

219
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,960
You still want to barf?

220
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,960
I meant bubble tea.

221
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,080
Let's go.

222
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,120
It's strong.

223
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,550
Thanks.

224
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,790
So sweet?

225
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,150
It's not cheap.

226
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,200
Such a long line?

227
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,630
I never knew why

228
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,960
Ya

229
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,960
liked bubble tea.

230
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,790
Come to think of it.

231
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,550
Maybe this is one of

232
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,510
her few small blessings in life.

233
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,960
I'm fine, don't worry.

234
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,790
You've

235
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,790
helped me a lot these days.

236
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,440
Thanks.

237
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,630
Don't want that talk.

238
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,240
Walk the walk.

239
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,030
Say it.

240
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,600
Like

241
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,000
the commission distribution.

242
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:49,870
Manli.

243
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,480
You're not a profit-seeking person.

244
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,000
Hey,

245
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,870
you're trying to flatter me?

246
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,630
It won't work.

247
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,440
Stop faking.

248
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,550
I won't give you commission, OK?

249
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,440
I told you.

250
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,270
Don't joke on something like that.

251
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,960
Admit it.

252
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,840
You're a nice a person.

253
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,550
What's the point?

254
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,910
I was nice to my disciple,

255
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,720
and she betrayed me.

256
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,270
I was nice to the scamming client,

257
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,790
and got hurt in the end.

258
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I lost my job.

259
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,390
I was nice to my husband,

260
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,720
and he was nice to others.

261
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,320
He ran away.

262
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,960
I don't see any point

263
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,150
in being a nice person.

264
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,510
I'll never be one.

265
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,440
So you protect yourself by acting like

266
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,080
a profit-seeker.

267
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,600
Right?

268
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm not acting.

269
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
I really love money.

270
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,600
Who doesn't want to be called nice?

271
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
But being nice

272
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,320
has a price.

273
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,270
I can't get it.

274
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,960
Why?

275
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,440
Nothing I can do about it.

276
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,550
I'm

277
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,720
not like young girls there.

278
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
They've got

279
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,510
shoulders to cry on.

280
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,320
I

281
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,550
only have myself.

282
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,960
I told myself.

283
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,600
Stop being nice,

284
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,030
and no one messes up with me.

285
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,120
Manli.

286
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,840
Trust me.

287
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,390
Good things happen to good people.

288
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,790
Young man,

289
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,840
you still have a long way to go before

290
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,510
you can comfort people.

291
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,390
Letting you be nice

292
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,600
is the best gift you get from God.

293
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,670
Look at you.

294
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,150
Even

295
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,670
if hurt,

296
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,600
you still choose to

297
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,000
help those in need.

298
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,720
For you,

299
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,390
kindness is an instinct.

300
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,240
No everyone is capable like you.

301
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,030
You're extraordinary,

302
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,000
so God gifted it to you.

303
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,790
Thanks a lot.

304
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,270
You're a sweet talker after a bubble tea?

305
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,270
Be practical, something solid.

306
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,790
Right here.

307
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,550
Me.

308
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,200
God sent me

309
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,670
to sell insurance for you.

310
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,030
You're acting cute?

311
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,080
Let's head back.

312
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,270
A lot of work to do.

313
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,150
Let's go.

314
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:33,960
Wait.

315
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,790
Who?

316
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,270
Manli.

317
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,790
No.

318
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,510
Your new subordinate.

319
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,480
He's called?

320
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,550
Xue Xiaozhou.

321
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,000
Medium height.

322
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,270
27 or 28.

323
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,320
Skinny.

324
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,670
You know him?

325
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,670
You wanted dirt on Manli.

326
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,960
So I tasked him.

327
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,870
It's a

328
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,240
small world.

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,510
Ling.

330
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,360
You have to

331
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,550
kick him out.

332
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,720
He knows too much.

333
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,750
No.

334
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,840
He's like a kid.

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
He can't know about us.

336
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,440
But Manli

337
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,000
can really swallow her pride.

338
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,960
For money,

339
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,360
she works with her enemy.

340
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,630
She's really out of choices.

341
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,080
Honey,

342
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
what's your plan?

343
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,440
An eye for an eye,

344
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,840
a tooth for a tooth.

345
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,440
Elaborate.

346
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
[Lisu]

347
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,150
Zhiyuan.

348
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,000
Hello?

349
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
I saw your calls.

350
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,200
Is everything OK?

351
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,480
Remember the Sichuan

352
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,360
cuisine restaurant we went to?

353
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,910
I had that Red Oil Wontons.

354
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,200
I remember.

355
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,080
You said they were spicy

356
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,720
and had a lot of water.

357
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,150
Yes.

358
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,200
I want them now badly.

359
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,720
Can you get me some?

360
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:18,870
Now?

361
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,870
Right now.

362
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,150
I want them now.

363
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,440
But I'm occupied.

364
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,870
You can ask Huang to get some.

365
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,480
OK?

366
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,750
I don't think I want them,

367
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,790
it's the baby.

368
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,790
They want Dad to get some for them, OK?

369
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,360
OK.

370
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,750
I see.

371
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,440
I'll be waiting.

372
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,670
Mr. Ding.

373
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,630
Finally.

374
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,440
She's waiting

375
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,000
keenly for your delivery.

376
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,240
It was a long line.

377
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,000
I waited and waited.

378
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,080
Let me take it.

379
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,080
No...

380
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,600
OK.

381
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,590
Eat while it's hot.

382
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:20,830
What's wrong?

383
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,400
What?

384
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,640
Red Oil Wontons they are.

385
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,310
Zhiyuan.

386
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,000
Stop talking.

387
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,030
What? Red Oil...

388
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,920
They're just words.

389
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,640
Huang.

390
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,720
Get rid of them.

391
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,720
I don't want them.

392
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,070
OK.

393
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,240
I want to throw up

394
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,070
hearing or smelling it.

395
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,440
You OK?

396
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,590
Sorry.

397
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,680
I don't know what's wrong with me.

398
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,070
I started craving for Re...

399
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,160
like I was out of mind

400
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,790
after I called you.

401
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,200
But when you got them for me,

402
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,550
the moment I smelled it,

403
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,030
I couldn't take it.

404
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,550
I couldn't eat.

405
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,110
I don't know why.

406
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,400
Sorry.

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,640
Sorry.

408
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:18,960
It's OK.

409
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,680
You're pregnant.

410
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,070
Normal.

411
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,070
Normal.

412
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,920
You're not mad at me?

413
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,720
I'm not.

414
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,000
But I should get going.

415
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,070
I have classes.

416
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,400
Call me if you want

417
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,510
anything else to eat.

418
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,590
Thanks.

419
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,000
Zhiyuan.

420
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,590
I forgot.

421
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,550
The day after tomorrow,

422
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,310
you have antenatal classes.

423
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,240
Doing laundry?

424
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,070
I'll come back later.

425
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,640
You put it wrong.

426
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,480
It should be here.

427
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,720
Not here?

428
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,480
This is for softener.

429
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,790
You should put detergent here.

430
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,960
I've always put it here.

431
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,750
Water flushes here first.

432
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,920
Your detergent won't go down then.

433
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,720
And softener goes down the last.

434
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,510
Can you really do your laundry?

435
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,240
Here.

436
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,480
OMG.

437
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,000
You have gray hair?

438
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,830
I have it since young.

439
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,110
Should I pluck it?

440
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,200
No, it hurts.

441
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,160
Come on.

442
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,720
No...

443
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,030
Come on.

444
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,790
It really hurts.

445
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,240
Come here.

446
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,310
Here.

447
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,830
Let me see.

448
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,720
No, easy.

449
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,550
There's more than one.

450
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,640
OK, stay still.

451
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,270
Still...

452
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,270
I thought about it last night.

453
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,270
I still want to try

454
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,240
on Mr. Ai's plan.

455
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,030
Forget it.

456
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,920
We don't need that.

457
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,720
When you were at the car dealer,

458
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
you said different thing.

459
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,310
It's different now.

460
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,590
Yes, it is.

461
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,400
I also

462
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,510
got discriminated

463
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,680
and see the ugly of the world.

464
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,440
I can feel you.

465
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,590
So I want to fight for

466
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,790
the car.

467
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,270
I need to prove I'm

468
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,240
not a loser.

469
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,110
You remember my fancy talk.

470
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,110
Hold it.

471
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,960
Checking.

472
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,640
Are you done?

473
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,480
Almost.

474
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,070
Done.

475
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,200
This is a young man's head.

476
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,270
You surely didn't hold back.

477
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,920
New car?

478
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,030
Yes.

479
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,510
From Lisu's company.

480
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,550
I can use it.

481
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,550
Zhiyuan.

482
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,110
You're a professor.

483
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,550
A scholar.

484
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,240
You need to keep a low profile in life.

485
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,160
Your current wife

486
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,550
is a big boss.

487
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,960
You should pay

488
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,480
more attention.

489
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,830
You don't want people

490
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,200
calling you a

491
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,310
man living off women.

492
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,920
Dad, it's not what you think.

493
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,400
Apart from my salary,

494
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,200
I have a program online.

495
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,240
I do commercials

496
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,110
and have commission.

497
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,000
How much?

498
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,270
They're all different.

499
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,070
But I'll finally receive

500
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,160
thousands.

501
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,830
That's much.

502
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,240
Hear that?

503
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,160
You won't call him

504
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,270
relying on his new wife?

505
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,030
You won't know who's

506
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,240
living off whom.

507
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,550
Listen to yourself.

508
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,880
Is a professor all about money?

509
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,510
Don't talk like that

510
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,750
when you see her.

511
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,960
You'll embarrass yourself.

512
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,790
Embarrass?

513
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,310
Why?

514
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,590
Zhiyuan is a professor

515
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,920
who makes a huge money.

516
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,830
She divorced too.

517
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,110
Anyway,

518
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,480
she took advantage of Zhiyuan.

519
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,680
Mom.

520
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:48,680
Dad.

521
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,790
When you meet Lisu,

522
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,440
don't say I called you.

523
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,680
Tell her you came on your own

524
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,310
to see us.

525
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,680
You want us to look after her.

526
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,350
Why can't you tell her?

527
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,070
She's having morning sickness badly.

528
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,200
I have to be with her all the time.

529
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,510
With the school and my program,

530
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,030
I'm so

531
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,030
caught up.

532
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,070
I wanted to tell her the truth.

533
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,750
I'm afraid she'll misread me.

534
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,110
I see.

535
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,070
Is your wife difficult?

536
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,790
Don't worry.

537
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,350
This time,

538
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,310
we'll discipline her.

539
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,750
Mom.

540
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,510
Rest assured.

541
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,440
Mom will let her know

542
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,110
who runs this family.

543
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,480
Aunt.

544
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,200
Hi, Uncle.

545
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,070
Hello.

546
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,790
Nice to see you.

547
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,440
Lisu, isn't it?

548
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,920
Lisu?

549
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,640
It's Ms. Qiu.

550
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,440
No, call me Lisu.

551
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,310
If we call you Lisu,

552
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,070
shouldn't you address us differently?

553
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,550
Mom, we're all grown-ups.

554
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,440
Mom.

555
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,350
Dad.

556
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,680
Come on in.

557
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,550
Yes...

558
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:05,830
OK.

559
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,270
Careful.

560
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,750
How's your trip?

561
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,510
It's fine.

562
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,550
This way.

563
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,160
Detached.

564
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,880
Watch the steps.

565
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,030
Mom, Dad.

566
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,240
Guess you didn't have your fill.

567
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
My chef does great cooking.

568
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,680
Try it out.

569
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,480
OK...

570
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,350
Sit.

571
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,830
Take your seats.

572
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,750
Make yourself at home.

573
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,160
Lisu.

574
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,550
Should we

575
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,720
sit like this?

576
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,160
I forgot.

577
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,000
They're used to sitting facing the door.

578
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,680
It's not we're used to.

579
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,830
It's a custom.

580
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,400
Seniors take seats

581
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,480
facing the south.

582
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,750
It's a rule.

583
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,030
Sorry.

584
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,240
I was inconsiderate.

585
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,030
Dad, here.

586
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:58,750
OK.

587
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,750
Thanks.

588
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,510
She's nice.

589
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,720
Don't stand on ceremony.

590
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,480
It's the same wherever you sit.

591
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,310
Sit.

592
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,350
Zhiyuan.

593
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,790
Sit to your dad's left.

594
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,110
Left for the honored.

595
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,400
Switch.

596
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,270
Lisu.

597
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,510
You sit here.

598
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,640
Next to me.

599
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,720
OK.

600
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,880
Dad.

601
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,830
For you.

602
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:27,920
Lisu.

603
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,640
I've been a receptionist

604
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,920
at office

605
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,030
for decades.

606
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,640
I can't shake off my habits from work.

607
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,720
As a leader, you should understand.

608
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,270
Right?

609
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,350
It's OK.

610
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:41,960
Let's eat.

611
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,550
Want juice?

612
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,550
I'll serve you.

613
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,550
OK.

614
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,030
Mom, Dad.

615
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,400
Thank you

616
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,790
for visiting

617
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,510
us.

618
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,880
Make yourself at home.

619
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,790
OK.

620
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,640
I worked on it

621
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,030
and have a few ideas.

622
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,920
See if you like them.

623
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,000
There's always

624
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,720
something missing.

625
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,270
What is missing?

626
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,240
Before today,

627
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,480
I asked the firm's consultants,

628
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,960
heads of the legal department,

629
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,960
GA.

630
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,240
They went through related

631
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,510
cases roughly.

632
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,720
I don't see a problem.

633
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,160
You're an idiot.

634
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,160
You and Linjiang are love rivals.

635
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,510
You've got physical.

636
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,830
Put yourself in his shoes.

637
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,400
If it were you,

638
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,720
would you take his bid?

639
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,000
It's two different things.

640
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,790
If he had a good plan, fine.

641
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,960
You're broad-minded, OK?

642
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,310
But he might be not.

643
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,750
I've made the plans.

644
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,790
It'll be his losses.

645
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,790
You're so careless.

646
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,510
We should consider client's needs,

647
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,160
and what we own.

648
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,920
Something exclusive to us.

649
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,270
Ma Xiaowei.

650
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,590
Bingo.

651
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,960
Come on.

652
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,300
[Ling: Time for a coffee?]

653
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,790
I always wanted to ask.

654
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,550
What's your story with

655
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,960
Ling?

656
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,350
Miss.

657
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,350
Hi.

658
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,400
I'd like...

659
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,480
Sorry.

660
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,000
We're all booked.

661
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,160
No one is available.

662
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,160
I have an event.

663
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,750
Would you help?

664
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,440
Sorry.

665
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,030
I even joined.

666
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,030
There's no one left.

667
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,480
How long will I wait?

668
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,880
At least one and half hours.

669
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,960
That long?

670
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,240
Boss, I can help.

671
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,240
Stop.

672
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,310
Go mope the floor.

673
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,240
Miss, let me help.

674
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,000
Look.

675
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,240
I'm good at it.

676
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,440
Boss, let me try.

677
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,750
You can deduct my salary if I fail.

678
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,070
There's little of your salary

679
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,350
left this month.

680
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,440
You've done it on others?

681
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,000
Yes.

682
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,550
Let's try.

683
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,310
Yes.

684
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,920
Where?

685
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,640
Here.

686
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,110
Careful.

687
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,110
Want any drinks?

688
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,550
No, I'm in a hurry.

689
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,110
Pick your colors.

690
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,880
Look.

691
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,070
Plain, I think.

692
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,440
OK.

693
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,960
Trim them.

694
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,960
That was how I met Ling.

695
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
She had a few deals at first.

696
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,830
Then she ran out of her resources.

697
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,680
She wanted a team.

698
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,790
But I focused on selling.

699
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,070
Building a team takes time and energy.

700
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,920
So I declined.

701
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,480
Then she held a grudge against you.

702
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,720
Not that bad.

703
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,510
Then Li Qingqing started TSI.

704
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,400
Ling wanted to join.

705
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,480
So she bad-mouthed me before

706
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,720
a big customer.

707
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,000
She finally took the client away.

708
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,960
It's kind of an act for Qing.

709
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,310
I never trusted anyone then.

710
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,070
I didn't want to mentor.

711
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,160
But you still taught Chunlu.

712
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,680
That was another story.

713
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,680
So what does Ling really want?

714
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,310
I suppose

715
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,720
she wants to take advantage of you.

716
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,720
What's my advantage?

717
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,830
Your dear me!

718
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,310
What?

719
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,240
Afraid?

720
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,200
Why?

721
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,790
You're not that kind of person.

722
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,510
Hard to tell.

723
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,310
It depends on her offers.

724
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,070
Look at you.

725
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,310
Here you go again.

726
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,680
Just

727
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,240
no more jokes like this, OK?

728
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,400
So

729
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,070
what are you going to do?

730
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,350
Meet her?

731
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,110
Take a guess.

732
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,440
Madam,

733
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,310
for the second layer,

734
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,160
you want silver or gold?

735
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,030
Shiny silver.

736
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,160
Complementing your skin.

737
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,590
Long time no see.

738
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,510
Yes, Manli.

739
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,110
Silver it is.

740
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,640
OK.

741
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,640
You're thinner.

742
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,480
And sharper.

743
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,750
Thanks.

744
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,310
Caffè mocha.

745
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,070
Thank you.

746
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,310
Haven't seen you in ages.

747
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,640
You look younger than before.

748
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,590
It's all money-made.

749
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,070
Every quarter,

750
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,720
I'll get a facial.

751
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
Your face

752
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,310
looks dry.

753
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,830
Shall I introduce my

754
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,640
aesthetician?

755
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,480
Sure, thank you.

756
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,400
Take a look.

757
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,030
Which color would you like today?

758
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:10,880
This.

759
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,640
OK.

760
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,270
Manli.

761
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,680
Remember?

762
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,240
We met at a nail salon 7 years ago.

763
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,830
Ling.

764
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,680
You don't need to bring that up.

765
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,440
I know what's on your mind.

766
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,830
I'm banned from the industry.

767
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,200
But I have clients.

768
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,750
People

769
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,720
are all eying my resources.

770
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,750
You're no exception.

771
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,160
Manli.

772
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,550
I knew you'd misunderstand.

773
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,920
When I knew you came to Xiaozhou,

774
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,790
I felt so bad.

775
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,680
Of all colleagues,

776
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,270
why did you

777
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,110
pick

778
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,240
a guy completely the opposite of you?

779
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,350
I guess

780
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,550
you had your difficulties.

781
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,030
What I fear the most

782
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,790
is your misunderstanding.

783
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,720
This is

784
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,350
a list of

785
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,160
unattended plans.

786
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,270
I've looked through.

787
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,440
If you have them all signed,

788
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,200
the commission will look good.

789
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,350
And.

790
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,030
You can still ask Xiaozhou

791
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,030
to look after your own clients.

792
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,030
You can divide

793
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,750
the benefits on your own.

794
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,350
Manli.

795
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,440
Talk is cheap.

796
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,480
Back then,

797
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,510
we had a misunderstanding.

798
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,590
Now I want to resolve it with what I do

799
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,030
to give us a chance to resume.

800
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,510
OK?

801
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,510
Manli.

802
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,310
Ling.

803
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,720
I'm touched that

804
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,720
you came.

805
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,440
Like you said,

806
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,720
after I got fired,

807
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,830
many

808
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,200
want my resources,

809
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,880
and some want to bring me down.

810
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,680
Only you

811
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,880
offer to help.

812
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,200
Manli.

813
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,030
I owe you.

814
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,110
Stop.

815
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,350
It's in the past.

816
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
I have this

817
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,960
client who wants to buy.

818
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,640
They want annuity plans.

819
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,750
I had Xue drafted a few.

820
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,400
Manli.

821
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,190
I can do it for you.

822
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,630
Don't worry. You'll have

823
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,280
all the commission.

824
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,320
It's a bit of a headache.

825
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,360
What's wrong?

826
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,230
A new broker at Blue Ocean

827
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,110
wants to steal it.

828
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
Who?

829
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,710
A newbie dare do that?

830
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,510
They have backup.

831
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,670
And that is?

832
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,230
Head of

833
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,150
Claims, Chen Fang.

834
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,110
What?

835
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,590
You know him?

836
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,880
Chen...

837
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,110
Chen Fang.

838
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,590
Do you know?

839
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,920
I don't.

840
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,800
Makes sense.

841
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,230
When he joined,

842
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,710
you left Blue Ocean.

843
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,760
Him.

844
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,400
What about him?

845
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,590
He's been helping

846
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,920
this

847
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,880
new female broker with connections.

848
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,000
They all say

849
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,110
she's got good looks,

850
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,030
a good figure.

851
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,710
I guess

852
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,550
they're involved...

853
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,110
you know.

854
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,670
Um.

855
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,150
The newbie.

856
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,440
What's she called?

857
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,230
Called?

858
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,440
I can't recall.

859
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,230
But they all say she's pretty.

860
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,920
Like a model, you know?

861
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,710
No wonder Chen's charmed.

862
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,150
Men are the same,

863
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,000
loving pretty faces.

864
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,030
Hopeless.

865
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,960
That hurts.

866
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,590
Sorry...

867
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,400
I'm sorry.

868
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,150
Careful.

869
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,150
Yes.

870
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,590
Listen.

871
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,550
The new girl at your company?

872
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,360
What's your relationship with her?

873
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,550
What new girl?

874
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,230
Just tell me.

875
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,030
No time for your acting.

876
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,070
Why do you think I'm acting?

877
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,670
What new girl?

878
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,670
You won't admit?

879
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,150
Admit what?

880
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,800
Hey.

881
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,000
Who is it?

882
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,230
What's her name?

883
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:52,960
It's...

884
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,710
I don't know.

885
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,920
I know she's pretty,

886
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,000
looks hot.

887
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,150
Wait.

888
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,440
We don't have a new girl at all.

889
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,190
And looks hot?

890
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,320
What's wrong with you?

891
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,360
Cut the crap.

892
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,670
Tell me.

893
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,320
Why did you help

894
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:14,960
her stealing orders?

895
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,920
I didn't.

896
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,510
Where did this come from?

897
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,630
Wait.

898
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,710
Tell me who it is first.

899
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,800
I don't know.

900
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,360
You're insane.

901
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,760
Did someone tell you this?

902
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,480
Don't ask.

903
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,150
I have to.

904
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,550
Who's spreading rumors about me?

905
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,800
Rumors.

906
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,440
Speak.

907
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,070
Who told you?

908
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,000
Manli.

909
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,510
Manli?

910
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,400
Why did you meet her?

911
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,360
Don't ask.

912
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,000
Just tell me if it's true.

913
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,960
It's not!

914
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,320
If you don't believe me,

915
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,590
Call Cao from

916
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,800
human resources.

917
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,510
Ask him

918
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,710
if there's any

919
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,710
new girl,

920
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,480
anyone who looks hot.

921
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,070
Unreasonable.

922
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,280
OK.

923
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Think I don't dare?

924
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,880
Go on.

925
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,000
Now.

926
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,760
Sure.

927
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,320
I bet

928
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,400
Ling and Chen are fighting hard now.

929
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,960
Ling kicked me out with Chen.

930
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,760
Taking advantage of their

931
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,360
secret relation, I disrupt the pair.

932
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
You just made that person up.

933
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,000
It's easy to see through.

934
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,030
Well well well.

935
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,030
Even when they know the truth,

936
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,840
they'll have trauma.

937
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,360
Suspecting is like a seedling.

938
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,880
You plant it,

939
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,480
it grows big.

940
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,480
They'll feel bad.

941
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,230
Where did you learn

942
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,630
this crooked means?

943
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,190
Don't learn that.

944
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,670
Learn something good.

945
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,070
You have that in you?

946
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,590
OK, I see.

947
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,800
Don't want your dinner?

948
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,630
Not hungry, huh?

949
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,000
Sorry, I'll learn something

950
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,840
good from you.

951
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,840
Clear now?

952
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,400
Rumors?

953
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,920
Sorry.

954
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,190
I was wrong.

955
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,670
Why did Manli

956
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,710
have to say this to me?

957
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,190
I wanted to know too.

958
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,030
Does

959
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,590
she know about us?

960
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,360
She's smart.

961
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,800
Did she see

962
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,150
liked your post?

963
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,230
And Xue Xiaozhou

964
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,110
knows his stuff.

965
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,760
If they work together...

966
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,670
In that case,

967
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,510
I'll root them out.

968
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,280
See this?

969
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,590
General existence of the world.

970
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,280
The architecture.

971
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,880
At ba...

972
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,710
Basic...

973
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:54,760
architecture.

974
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,360
Yes.

975
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,070
The translation is...

976
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,590
Zhiyuan.

977
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,840
Mom and Dad.

978
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:01,880
You're chatting.

979
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,510
I'll come back later.

980
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,030
You want me?

981
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,400
For work.

982
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,320
Your dad and Zhiyuan

983
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
are discussing views on his program.

984
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,150
Lisu, you can tell us.

985
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,590
We're no strangers.

986
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,110
Yes, go ahead.

987
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,880
Here's the thing.

988
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,670
For the next book meeting.

989
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,280
We agreed to talk about

990
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,510
Madame Bovary.

991
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,150
If it's confirmed,

992
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,920
I'll push the following promotion

993
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,840
campaign.

994
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,480
OK, Madame Bovary.

995
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,590
Yes.

996
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,440
What's there to talk about

997
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,510
Madame Bovary?

998
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,880
It's all cheesy stuff from France.

999
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,190
Nothing serious.

1000
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:46,880
Dad.

1001
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,880
It's generally a modern classic.

1002
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,630
In the past,

1003
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,440
it's kind of novel.

1004
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,550
What's good about it now?

1005
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,360
It's overrated.

1006
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,800
Let's not talk about its style.

1007
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,670
The plot.

1008
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,710
An unfaithful girl

1009
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,280
betrays her husband,

1010
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,920
showing her faces everywhere and

1011
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,230
fooling around.

1012
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,840
How could you

1013
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,710
discuss such things publicly?

1014
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,110
Inappropriate.

1015
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,800
Dad.

1016
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,590
Lisu.

1017
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,960
Your dad just speaks his mind.

1018
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,070
你是当代女性You're a modern woman.

1019
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,710
It's natural you go out and do stuff.

1020
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,360
Mom.

1021
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,280
I didn't think that way either.

1022
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,710
You're reminding

1023
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,280
us to look at me that way.

1024
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,920
Lisu misunderstood.

1025
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,590
Help me explain myself.

1026
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,760
Yes.

1027
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,000
You misunderstood.

1028
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,840
Zhiyuan.

1029
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,800
Time for the baby's bedtime stories.

1030
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:57,710
