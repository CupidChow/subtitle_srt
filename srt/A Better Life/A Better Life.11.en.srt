41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,310
OK.

42
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,040
Done. Take a look.

43
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,150
Here.

44
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,790
Pay me.

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,430
Take a good look.

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,080
I need to split half of accommodation

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,430
and transportation fees.

48
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,400
Wow, that's thoughtful.

49
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,280
No need.

50
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,240
I'll cover those.

51
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,630
No, thanks.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,680

He's good at big family legacy cases.

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,800
Should I introduce you?

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,750
I transferred all.

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,400

I'm helping you.

No will.

70
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,280
No will?

71
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,910
In that case,

72
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,910
you'll take half.

73
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,240

either

under the name of his company,

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,080
or mortgaged.

78
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,630
I'm a law graduate.

79
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,590
I would've done it long ago

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,470
if I could.

81
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,080
Bad luck.

82
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,630

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,470
Look.

00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,870
Ai Zhonghua.

89
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,680
Linjiang's dad.

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,120
You've met Linjiang.

91
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,750
He kicked you out last time.

92
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,190
His dad is a collector,

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,520
running an art company.

94
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,030
He's esteemed in his circle.

95
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,430
Collector.

96
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,120
Wants to buy from you?

97
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,120
Am I not good enough?

98
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,800
I just didn't expect

99
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,590
you to be associated with art.

100
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,950
I can enter any circle

101
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,070
I like.

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,430
A regular of mine

103
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,270
introduced me to

104
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,510
Zhonghua.

105
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,120
I follow up on him for long.

106
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
But he didn't like me.

107
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,870
He had his plan with

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,040
another broker.

109
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,120
I remember it all too well.

110
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,040
Such bad weather, making me feel worse.

111
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,830
It'd rain soon but no umbrella.

112
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,360
Your point is...

113
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,390
Hear me out.

114
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,480
They had

115
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,040
introduced some paintings to exhibit.

116
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,120
The deliverymen didn't know about art.

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,560
Just put them outside the warehouse.

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,040
I was worried.

119
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,270
Paintings are sensitive to humidity.

120
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,310
If you put them at the door,

121
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:53,920
they'd be ruined

122
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,390
once it started to rain.

123
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,040
You knew about that?

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,510
I learned.

125
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,510
I learned about art

126
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,800
so I could talk to Zhonghua.

127
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,800
I told Zhonghua about the paintings.

128
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,430
He sure

129
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,480
panicked.

130
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,190
He jumped up,

131
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,360
saying they must be moved.

132
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,310
But it was in the middle of the night.

133
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,160
In the end,

134
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,070
Zhonghua, his wife, I, and Linjiang,

135
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,630
we four,

136
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,000
carried the paintings in

137
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,160
overnight.

138
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,870
You weren't upset about

139
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,630
him rejecting you.

140
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,600
Still helped him?

141
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,680
I was.

142
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
But there's priority.

143
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,430
You couldn't let such valuables

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,870
to go ruined.

145
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,510
He himself would be ruined then.

146
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,000
I couldn't bear to watch that.

147
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,800
Well, after that,

148
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,070
Zhonghua started to see me differently.

149
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,190
So what does he want this time?

150
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,270
Picture.

151
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,560
Annuity.

152
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,040
If we make this happen, it'll be a

153
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,870
much bigger order than Ms. Zhou's.

154
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,600
See?

155
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,920
Isn't it rewarding

156
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,680
to work with me?

157
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,310
Consider yourself lucky, dude.

158
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,360
When do you see him?

159
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,870
Tomorrow.

160
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,070
But you don't have to go.

161
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,920
Manli, I told you.

162
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,480
I'll do the job.

163
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,870
You want to see such VIP as you wish?

164
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,750
Look at you.

165
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,600
What?

166
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,310
Dressed like an idiot.

167
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,630
Hey, you...

168
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,830
I'll wring your finger.

169
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,750
Pointing at me?

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,750
Wait for my call.

171
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,040
OK? Don't rush.

172
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,270
I'll pave the way for you.

173
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,000
Such a stubborn guy.

174
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:52,920
Come in.

175
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,270
Doing calligraphy.

176
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,870
Manli.

177
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,720
Long time no see.

178
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,720
Come sit down.

179
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,870
I brought you some tea.

180
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,600
You don't have to.

181
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,870
Just a little gift.

182
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,750
Did Linjiang tell you?

183
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,390
I switched to a new company.

184
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,830
Yes, sit.

185
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,190
Thanks.

186
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,630
Sit.

187
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,120
It's an insurance broker firm.

188
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
They have various products.

189
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,430
You said you wanted annuity?

190
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,040
Yes.

191
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,270
What's your budget?

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,600
Three million.

193
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,480
OK.

194
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,680
Um.

195
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,160
I have info on you and Linjiang.

196
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,310
I'll have them draft a few plans

197
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:33,920
for you.

198
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,480
No.

199
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,070
It's not for Linjiang.

200
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,510
Mr. Ai, I have to make myself clear.

201
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,830
For annuity product,

202
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,270
the policy holder and the insured

203
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,360
have to be related directly.

204
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,720
He

205
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
is my son.

206
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,120
You have two kids with your wife?

207
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
I didn't know.

208
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,680
My wife didn't give birth to him.

209
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,440
So, Manli, I hope

210
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,720
you'd keep this plan secret

211
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,320
from Linjiang.

212
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,750
OK?

213
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Sorry, Mr. Ai.

214
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,550
I can't

215
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,080
do this.

216
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,150
Why?

217
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,270
He's also my son.

218
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,870
He's qualified.

219
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,360
And,

220
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,750
three million

221
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,550
isn't a small sum.

222
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,120
It's not about that.

223
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,870
Then what?

224
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,510
You feel guilty?

225
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,240
Or...

226
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,150
Mr. Ai,

227
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,120
this might be rude.

228
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,550
I have my principles.

229
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,080
You are really

230
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
putting me in a tight spot.

231
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,270
So you're going...

232
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,550
Sorry.

233
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,270
I should take

234
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,720
my leave now.

235
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,600
Manli.

236
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:14,960
Listen.

237
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,150
What did you think of me

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,270
before you know about my other son?

239
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,200
Mr. Ai.

240
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,030
You're revered.

241
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,670
I look up to you.

242
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,510
You succeed in career

243
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,750
and family.

244
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,200
Yes.

245
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,510
But you didn't expect

246
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,630
me to be morally blemished.

247
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,910
Hi, Xiaozhou.

248
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,000
I massaged her this morning.

249
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,080
Doc says she's stable now.

250
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,480
Wang, go do your thing.

251
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,240
I'll be with her.

252
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,080
My thing is to look after her.

253
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,550
On this day three years ago,

254
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,390
she had an accident.

255
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
It's been three years.

256
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,670
Over the time,

257
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,630
only you never stopped visiting.

258
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,790
Nice young men like you

259
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,550
are rare.

260
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,750
Have water.

261
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:28,840
Thanks.

262
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,510
I'll get some more.

263
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,340
[We need to talk.]

264
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,020
[I'm at Cijin Hospital.]

265
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,510
Are you out of your mind?

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,120
Ma Xiaowei's his illegitimate son.

267
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,030
His wife just died,

268
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,550
and he's buying insurance for Xiaowei.

269
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,910
He's transferring assets.

270
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,910
Zhonghua has his difficulties.

271
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,750
Difficulties?

272
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,000
That was what my dad said too.

273
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,960
Every cheater says so.

274
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,840
But those selfish guys never know

275
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,750
how badly they hurt other people.

276
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,510
Xiaozhou,

277
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,440
I feel you.

278
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,910
I also

279
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
fell victim to disloyalty.

280
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
But Zhonghua is really different.

281
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,320
Such cliché.

282
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,870
Trust me.

283
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,000
It's not what you think.

284
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,720
Then what is it?

285
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,320
It's privacy.

286
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,320
Follow me.

287
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,000
Where to?

288
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,150
She's...

289
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:02,910
My mom.

290
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,480
What happened to her?

291
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,360
She's

292
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,790
bedridden for three years.

293
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,150
I look after her for three years.

294
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,440
Dad.

295
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,440
Dad.

296
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,270
What's up?

297
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,720
Mom says you'll break up.

298
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,630
Is that true?

299
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,670
If it's true,

300
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,030
who do you choose?

301
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,670
Why?

302
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,200
Tell me why.

303
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,000
You saw.

304
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,480
We fight all the time.

305
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,120
We're not meant to be.

306
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,150
You liar.

307
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,360
Is it because of that woman?

308
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,870
She's Mom's best friend.

309
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,200
How could you?

310
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,270
Xiaozhou.

311
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,550
It's all fate.

312
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,600
Nothing you can do.

313
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,080
I don't have choices.

314
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,000
Can you forgive me?

315
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,150
No, I won't, for my whole life.

316
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,080
Xiaozhou.

317
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,510
Her husband and friend betrayed her.

318
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,200
She couldn't take it.

319
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,750
She wouldn't admit it.

320
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,870
So,

321
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,630
she kept telling herself

322
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,440
once Xue Runnian got bored,

323
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,080
he'd come back,

324
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,150
until he had a car accident.

325
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,000
Hurry, Xiaozhou.

326
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm not going.

327
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,150
You dad's nearly gone.

328
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,480
He wants to see you.

329
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,320
Go.

330
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,910
I don't care about him.

331
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,080
Xiaozhou.

332
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,240
He has something important to tell you.

333
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,200
You go, I won't.

334
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm not his wife anymore.

335
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,630
He has another woman now.

336
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,240
But you're still his son.

337
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,080
I'm not.

338
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,480
When he started dating that woman,

339
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,440
he ceased to be my dad.

340
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,670
He doesn't deserve to be.

341
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,870
I'm not his son.

342
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,960
I won't forgive him.

343
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,630
Never!

344
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,630
Mom couldn't see

345
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,080
any hope then.

346
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
She tried to kill herself.

347
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,790
It was too late

348
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,390
when she was found.

349
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,120
She's left in a vegetative state.

350
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,870
She made a bad choice.

351
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,550
Runnian kept saying he felt stressed.

352
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,440
But who doesn't feel that way?

353
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,000
Why

354
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,750
did he have to cheat

355
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,960
to relieve stress?

356
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,480
Of all people,

357
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,750
he did it with Mom's friend?

358
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Manli, I know

359
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,510
Zhonghua must've given

360
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,870
a nice and long speech.

361
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,390
But I have standards.

362
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,910
Cheating is cheating.

363
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,360
I won't deal with him.

364
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,630
What if I tell you

365
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,600
it's really not cheating?

366
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,390
What is it?

367
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,360
I'll tell you know, OK?

368
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,670
But keep this to yourself.

369
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,910
Zhonghua's ex

370
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,000
gave birth to Xiaowei

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
behind his back.

372
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,830
Why did his ex do it secretly?

373
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,720
Zhonghua had just graduated

374
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,350
and was dispatched to a town museum.

375
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,070
He thought the future looked bleak.

376
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,270
So he dated a local girl.

377
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,920
Then.

378
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,400
He met Linjiang's mom.

379
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,270
And Linjiang's grandpa

380
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,270
transferred Zhonghua to a big city.

381
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,030
So he broke up with his ex.

382
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,070
They broke up.

383
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,400
Why didn't the girl have

384
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,790
an abortion?

385
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,240
She loved him. She was obsessed.

386
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,920
Zhonghua didn't know all this time?

387
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,640
He did, later.

388
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
By the time he did, he was married.

389
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,000
Linjiang was three years old.

390
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,240
So he had to support the mother and son

391
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,750
behind everyone's back.

392
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,480
Liar.

393
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,110
He keeps a mistress, that's all.

394
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,920
No, you have to believe me.

395
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,510
So,

396
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,240
she gave birth to his son,

397
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,550
and he couldn't leave them alone, right?

398
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,590
Could he?

399
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,310
So according to you,

400
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,310
all this time,

401
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,550
he's been taking care of the pair.

402
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,030
Then why does he have to buy annuity

403
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,920
for his other son, after his wife died?

404
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,000
I asked that too.

405
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,640
Ma Xiaowei didn't know at first.

406
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,480
One year ago,

407
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,310
his grandpa told him this

408
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,790
before death.

409
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,200
What about Xiaowei's mom?

410
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,270
Passed away a few years ago.

411
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,160
So you can't prove anything.

412
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,550
What do you mean?

413
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,590
You're saying Zhonghua's lying to us?

414
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,550
Us?

415
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,440
I'm not sure if it's you

416
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,960
or Zhonghua

417
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:41,790
that's lying.

418
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,200
What a joke.

419
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,830
What's in it for me?

420
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,400
Money.

421
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,830
And big money from this deal.

422
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,240
Easy. If you want to

423
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,920
convince me,

424
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,070
prove your story.

425
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,270
Tell me, how?

426
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,680
I need to ask him in person.

427
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,750
No.

428
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,590
Why not?

429
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,270
He told me his privacy

430
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,310
and wanted me to

431
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,160
keep it secret.

432
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Then I told you.

433
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,750
You think he'll still talk to me?

434
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,510
OK. He didn't cheat.

435
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,110
Why would he keep Xiaowei a secret?

436
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,000
Why?

437
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,440
Why do you have so many questions?

438
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,510
Ai Zhonghua, a famous collector.

439
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,200
If people knew

440
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,640
he ditched his countryside girlfriend

441
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,920
relied on his father-in-law, and

442
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,920
have an illegitimate son,

443
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,720
how would they think of him?

444
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,480
OK, I see.

445
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,350
Such a hassle talking to you.

446
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,440
You won't let me go to Zhonghua

447
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,310
because you made that up.

448
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,240
Xue Xiaozhou.

449
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,720
Am I that kind of person

450
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,270
to you?

451
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,510
Stooping low for money?

452
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,070
You used your dad as a bait.

453
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,240
I think you're capable of anything.

454
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,790
Stop.

455
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,000
You have to

456
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,640
sell to him.

457
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,270
Or...

458
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,550
What?

459
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,240
I tell Li Qingqing

460
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,350
Xue Xiaozhou is a loser.

461
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,720
He got his only one client

462
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,750
from me.

463
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,590
You know how

464
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,750
ruthless she is.

465
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,000
What will become of you at TSI?

466
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,110
You know better than I do.

467
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,270
Think about your mom.

468
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,550
She's lying on sickbed.

469
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,550
She needs money.

470
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,270
Young men like you, think twice.

471
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,830
You threaten me.

472
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,200
I'm helping you see the big picture.

473
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,720
OK.

474
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,440
Mr. Ai.

475
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,350
Here's the general proposal.

476
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,110
You have any questions?

477
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,030
The annuity...

478
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,310
Do I get the money regularly?

479
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,960
Yes.

480
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,720
OK.

481
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,270
Got it.

482
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,270
See you.

483
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,750
The client approves your plan.

484
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,720
Let Ma Xiaowei sign tomorrow.

485
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,480
Baodan.

486
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,960
Careful

487
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,480
not to touch your dad's computer.

488
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,680
He just wrote that.

489
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,550
You know that?

490
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,960
What's daddy doing?

491
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,240
Let's go check on him.

492
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,030
Xiaozhou.

493
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,550
The order sum is 4 times the last one.

494
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,720
You'll have 4 times the commission?

495
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,070
Don't get your hopes high.

496
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,270
What?

497
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,030
Client's difficult?

498
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,400
It's...

499
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,680
Will you blame me if I blow it?

500
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,680
You want me to be honest or not?

501
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,110
Not.

502
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,400
I will

503
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,400
I will be very very angry.

504
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,440
That's a lot of money.

505
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,920
If you blow it,

506
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,070
I'll abandon you.

507
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,750
Thanks.

508
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,680
Mr. Ma.

509
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,510
I'm Zhonghua's insurance broker.

510
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,240
This annuity

511
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,160
plan policy.

512
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,550
The total sum is 3 million.

513
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,510
Why not transfer directly to me?

514
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,310
With three million

515
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,830
on your personal card,

516
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,830
you think the authorities will ignore?

517
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,880
Why?

518
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,550
What's wrong with him giving me money?

519
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,480
He's my dad.

520
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,920
That's not how it works.

521
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,750
If this blows up,

522
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,400
Linjiang will know.

523
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,440
If he does,

524
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,830
you'll

525
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,270
still get the money?

526
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,030
OK. Linjiang's the crown prince.

527
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,790
Zhonghua still

528
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,590
cares about him.

529
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,270
OK.

530
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,720
I'll sign.

531
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,830
I have a hold over Zhonghua.

532
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
You guys can't take me down.

533
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,550
One, two, three,

534
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,590
four, five, six.

535
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,160
Three million.

536
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,070
Sign where?

537
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,440
Here.

538
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,510
This.

539
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,830
The one that says "the insured."

540
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,550
OK.

541
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,000
Hold on.

542
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,400
Mr. Ma, why don't you

543
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,510
take a good look at contract?

544
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,110
What do you mean?

545
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,720
It's all written here.

546
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,790
Can I be mistaken?

547
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,030
No, you can't.

548
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,790
Here, take a look.

549
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,030
The holder, Ai Zhonghua.

550
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,070
The insured, Ma Xiaowei, you.

551
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,350
The personal info matches.

552
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:52,830
Look.

553
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,310
Your ID number.

554
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,400
Correct.

555
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,880
OK?

556
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:56,790
Here.

557
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,960
Indeed they're correct.

558
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,350
But you need pay attention to...

559
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,240
Monthly.

560
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,480
Regularly.

561
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,880
What does it mean?

562
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,880
It means

563
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,640
you can't take this money out

564
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,880
in one go.

565
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,160
Instead,

566
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,160
you receive money every month.

567
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,160
Every month?

568
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,680
Like a salary?

569
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,400
That's nice.

570
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,790
Mr. Ma.

571
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,270
You can't spend all that money

572
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,550
one time, right?

573
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,590
A street-wise guy like you

574
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,030
must deposit money to have interests.

575
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,720
This money is just like your interests.

576
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,030
And, our interests

577
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,720
are higher than those of banks.

578
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,830
Yes, but you have to live long enough.

579
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,440
That's how you

580
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,400
get all the money back.

581
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,880
I'll put it this way.

582
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,070
We're human beings.

583
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,590
Tomorrow is a mystery for us.

584
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,590
After a few months,

585
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,440
if anything happens,

586
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,750
the rest money will...

587
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,110
What are you talking about?

588
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,440
He's so young.

589
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,480
Mr. Ma.

590
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,270
Monthly payment means

591
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,640
you can't utilize a large sum of money.

592
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,830
Well, I guess you'll

593
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,790
get married, have kids, and have

594
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,640
other events that require big money.

595
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,440
So I think

596
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,640
monthly payment isn't perfect for you.

597
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,310
Moreover,

598
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,070
Zhonghua is the beneficiary,

599
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,310
so if anything happens to you,

600
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,590
the money goes back to him.

601
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,240
Mr. Ma.

602
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,720
That's because

603
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,240
your mother passed away

604
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,590
and you don't have children or partner.

605
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,310
Don't misunderstand.

606
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,550
This is perfectly normal.

607
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,110
I see.

608
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,440
No wonder he's being generous,

609
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,070
giving me such a big sum.

610
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,960
So it's all part of his plan.

611
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,790
He's actually giving me so little.

612
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,160
Right?

613
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,000
You misunderstood.

614
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Let me explain.

615
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,720
I don't buy it.

616
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,240
Go tell Zhonghua.

617
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,960
I'm no beggar.

618
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,400
Don't play tricks with me.

619
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,510
I want three million in three days.

620
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,640
Or...

621
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,640
I have no attachment.

622
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,510
You know I can do anything.

623
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,350
Mr. Ma, calm down.

624
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,590
Shall I read you the articles?

625
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,880
Mr. Ma.

626
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,310
Mr...

627
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,510
You did this on purpose.

628
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,640
Don't think I didn't know.

629
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,240
I didn't.

630
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,680
I was just informing him

631
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,200
as a broker should.

632
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,480
Why did you do this to me?

633
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,350
I help you grow.

634
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,030
Yet you're so ungrateful.

635
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,160
Well, thank you for that.

636
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,270
Leave us alone.

637
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,110
I'll find a way.

638
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,550
I won't see you again.

639
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,510
What?

640
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,310
You want to part ways?

641
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
OK, I take back what I said.

642
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,880
OK?

643
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,240
Yes.

644
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,240
I was in

645
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,310
a rush.

646
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,550
Right?

647
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,830
And I threatened you with Li Qingqing.

648
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,400
I was wrong.

649
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,030
I apologize.

650
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:34,790
OK?

651
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,640
But don't decide

652
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,720
rashly on our future.

653
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,480
We came all the way here.

654
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,680
I think we make good partners.

655
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,270
Actually, I didn't like

656
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,550
this idea.

657
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,070
You're vain and ignorant.

658
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,310
I thought you were changing

659
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,880
when we dealt with Ms. Zhou.

660
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,160
And I respected you for

661
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,640
making that happen, really.

662
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,750
But I was naive.

663
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,790
People won't change their nature.

664
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,350
You throw away principles for money.

665
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,310
I can't work with you.

666
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,830
Is it for money?

667
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,790
You think it's money?

668
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,640
I told you.

669
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,830
Don't make things up again.

670
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,750
I value

671
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,960
integrity.

672
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,240
I won't go back on principles

673
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,350
even if I starve on the street.

674
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,830
You...

675
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,240
Hello, Ms. Li.

676
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,110
I'm available, go on.

677
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,920
What happened?

678
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,550
Really?

679
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,680
Oh my.

680
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,440
Sorry.

681
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,750
OK, I see.

682
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,030
Thank you so much. Bye.

683
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,880
Take it out.

684
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,680
Looking up words.

685
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,720
I wasn't gaming.

686
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,200
You're something.

687
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,200
So that's why the class I signed you up for

688
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
didn't work.

689
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,440
Your teacher told me

690
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,720
out of eight kids,

691
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,310
only you failed the exams.

692
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,510
What to do?

693
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,880
Answer me.

694
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,550
Don't act like your dad,

695
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,640
keeping

696
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,550
your mouth up after making a mistake.

697
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,310
20,000 for 20 sessions.

698
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,960
I can at least see a splash

699
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,400
if I throw into water.

700
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,640
Answer me.

701
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,680
What to do?

702
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,240
I don't know.

703
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,240
You don't know?

704
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,350
OK.

705
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,480
Drop out.

706
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,270
Idle your days away.

707
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,510
You're saying yes?

708
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,510
I spent so much for your private school.

709
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,160
If you lag behind,

710
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,110
they can drive you out.

711
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,960
Why look at me?

712
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,480
Something on my face?

713
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,000
Do your homework.

714
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,590
I'm waiting for you to stop.

715
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,830
I'll stop.

716
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:09,920
I'll stop

717
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,720

Thanks.

750
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,280
Duck intestines.

751
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,480
Their signature dish.

752
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,550
I'll server you.

753
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,630
Eight, seven, six...

754
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,320
I have news for you.

755
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,190
Good news or bad news?

756
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,800
I suppose...

757
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,710
bad news.

758
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,590
But I think you'll support me.

759
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,920
Bad news is okay

760
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,440
because I have good news.

761
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,070
Cheer you up.

762
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
I lost the deal.

763
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,840
It's fine.

764
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,000
Find another client.

765
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,630
Doesn't that lady know a lot of people?

766
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,590
And I fell out with her too.

767
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,320
Um.

768
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,760
I think they're ready.

769
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,710
Have some.

770
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,030
Why?

771
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,190
Hello, besties.

772
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,880
I haven't updated for days.

773
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,800
Today,

774
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,840
I want to share a real case.

775
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
I have this client over 60.

776
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,760
I recommended increasing death benefits.

777
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,000
Does that sound off?

778
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,190
Hear me out.

779
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,630
So I declined.

780
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,070
Can you feel me?

781
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,670
You can decline

782
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,510
but you can still work with her.

783
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,360
She serves a cheater today,

784
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,190
tomorrow?

785
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,070
Is it going to be a mistress?

786
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,480
I can't even imagine.

787
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,670
A murderer?

788
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,880
Possible.

789
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,880
Right?

790
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,440
Xiaozhou.

791
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,630
She said the client

792
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,110
has some sorts of difficulties.

793
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,230
It's not what you think.

794
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,230
That lady is willing to

795
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,550
lie through her teeth for money.

796
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,000
It's worth three million.

797
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,030
Consider your mom's conditions.

798
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,590
I know...

799
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,510
What about your good news?

800
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,880
Tell me.

801
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,800
It's...

802
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,440
Ms. Duan

803
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,190
invited you for tennis with Kang again.

804
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,440
I'm not going.

805
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,400
I'll lose my temper.

806
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,030
No.

807
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,800
I'm no good actor.

808
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,920
OK, leave me alone.

809
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,840
Eat up.

810
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,670
You eat so little.

811
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,710
You want something else?

812
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,550
Sir.

813
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,110
No.

814
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,070
We ordered so many.

815
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,360
OK. We'll have

816
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,510
bubble tea later.

817
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,000
Have this.

818
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,510
OK.

819
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,800
What's wrong?

820
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,760
You're so quiet.

821
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:17,960
Xiaozhou.

822
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,920
Remember what date it is?

823
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,550
We've been together for five years,

824
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,590
four months, and eight days.

825
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,400
Should I tell the exact hours too?

826
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,800
Three years ago,

827
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,030
you gave up a master's degree

828
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,400
that you could get in half of a year.

829
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,670
No other choices.

830
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,030
Xiaozhou.

831
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,000
You ever think

832
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,070
if you got that diploma,

833
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,030
what would you be now?

834
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,590
You were top one in your department.

835
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,800
Every teacher liked you.

836
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,960
If you continued,

837
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,710
perhaps

838
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,440
you could've worked for a fancy law firm

839
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,510
for the court,

840
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,840
or be a consultant at a big company.

841
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,360
Maybe...

842
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,800
There's no if.

843
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,510
Xiaozhou.

844
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,840
You ever feel regrets?

845
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,000
I don't.

846
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,070
That's my mom.

847
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,000
Doc advised you to give up.

848
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,400
Why am I mentioning this?

849
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,920
I was blabbering.

850
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,440
Sorry.

851
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,840
I know.

852
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,670
Let's go home.

853
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,360
So my client and the family

854
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,550
all feel happy.

855
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,670
Instead of caring others' evilness,

856
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,280
we should focus on our kindness.

857
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,230
That's what I want to share with you.

858
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,510
Love you.

859
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,510
I finished my homework.

860
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:36,800
Mom.

861
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,280
Need me to help editing?

862
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,000
Inserting music and caption.

863
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,440
For free.

864
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,550
Ding Dare.

865
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,630
I don't get it.

866
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,840
It's not on books? Where did you learn?

867
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,230
It's because I'm like you.

868
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,760
Like me?

869
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,630
Then why aren't you smart like me?

870
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,110
From today on,

871
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,110
I'll teach you English.

872
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,960
First, the words.

873
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,320
You don't even know them.

874
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,110
I know the alphabet.

875
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,110
I'm learning with you.

876
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,150
You're worse in English

877
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,550
than me.

878
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,400
No, I can do

879
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,000
better than you.

880
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,110
Baodan.

881
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,760
Smells like hotpot.

882
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,400
I'll go shower.

883
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,400
OK.

884
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,030
Mom.

885
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,510
Ya.

886
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,800
Have you eaten?

887
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,670
Yes.

888
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,800
The 20,000 I borrowed from you,

889
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,320
I...

890
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,960
I'll transfer to you.

891
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,030
Never mind.

892
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,000
Keep it.

893
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,110
Not easy living in big cities.

894
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,480
Mom.

895
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,920
Sorry.

896
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,070
I'm a grown-up now

897
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,760
and still ask for money from you.

898
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,280
I know

899
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,960
it's for Xiaozhou.

900
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,670
No, Mom.

901
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,320
I know it's been hard for him.

902
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,480
We can help him out

903
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,190
a bit.

904
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,190
But he lacks ambition.

905
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,320
We can't help him forever.

906
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,030
Mom.

907
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,630
Ya.

908
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,280
You guys don't fit together.

909
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,670
Your life has been easy.

910
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,630
Dating is not a problem,

911
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,960
but life isn't.

912
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,030
We can give you 20,000

913
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,840
to help a little now,

914
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,880
but when you get married and have kids,

915
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,710
you might need 200,000

916
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,280
or millions.

917
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,230
You'll know by then

918
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,400
love isn't your priority.

919
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,030
But it'll be too late.

920
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,190
Mom, I

921
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,190
gotta go.

922
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,070
