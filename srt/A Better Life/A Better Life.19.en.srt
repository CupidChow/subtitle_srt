00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,480
It makes the driver

198
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,120
feel in control

199
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,870
of speed and driving.

200
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,510
Come over.

201
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
You should come back later.

202
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:38,950
Get me anytime.

203
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,160
Why are we here?

204
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,040
Take a look.

205
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,390
This is

206
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,870
the bonus car for your best broker.

207
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,390
You couldn't buy a good model like this

208
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,160
with such a low price before.

209
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,750
Will you look after your mental state?

210
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,560
You think those accident and medical plans

211
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,720
from that market vendor

212
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,270
can make us the first?

213
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,830
Buckle up.

214
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,630
Listen.

215
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,600
Ai Zhonghua will separate,

216
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,920
through insurance,

217
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,870
his family assets from the firm's.

218
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,920
His price is 10 million.

219
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
A call for bids soon.

220
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,430
If we make this happen,

221
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,430
we'll be top one.

222
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,950
This car will be mine.

223
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,600
Do you trust us?

224
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,870
Don't touch me.

225
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,800
So,

226
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,310
who else will bid?

227
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,150
Brokers, lawyers,

228
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,910
and private bankers.

229
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,030
Why do you think

230
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,270
we'll win?

231
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,790
Intuition.

232
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,870
Really?

233
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm lucky lately.

234
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,200
And we make a good team now.

235
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,550
Our career is taking off.

236
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,630
You can't

237
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,870
shake off your good luck.

238
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,840
This time,

239
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,600
we'll strive forward.

240
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
[Ding]

241
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,120
You won't take it?

242
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,200
Bad luck.

243
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
I don't want that.

244
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,240
I must

245
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,870
have this cutie.

246
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,270
Whoever stops me

247
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,510
dies.

248
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,320
Ruthless women

249
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,390
are horrible.

250
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,600
So what to do next?

251
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,150
Next,

252
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,030
take a picture of me.

253
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,080
Come on.

254
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,840
Hand forward.

255
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,670
Yes.

256
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,030
Your chin...

257
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,270
Smile.

258
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,080
Nice.

259
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,670
OK?

260
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,510
Zhiyuan.

261
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,480
What did you do exactly?

262
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,080
You.

263
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,630
When they come back,

264
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,550
tell them to remove

265
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,750
that stuff from online.

266
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,440
Give our 200,000 back.

267
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,670
Fugui.

268
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,030
Zhiyuan.

269
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,750
You can't be fooled.

270
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,600
He's seeking justice for you.

271
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,320
You're too generous

272
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,120
to leave this house

273
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,120
empty-handed.

274
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,120
She's here.

275
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,120
Why are you here?

276
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,600
See?

277
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,720
The young guy I told you about.

278
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,720
They're always together.

279
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,080
Can't bear to watch.

280
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,080
Let me introduce.

281
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,630
Xue Xiaozhou, my colleague.

282
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,440
You'll regret if you keep

283
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,790
spouting nonsense.

284
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,200
Prof. Ding.

285
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,030
Please ask them to leave with

286
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,550
their belonging.

287
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,840
Remove that thing from online.

288
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,790
OK.

289
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,270
It'll be depended on what you do.

290
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,550
Uncle...

291
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,720
Let's go.

292
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,000
We can't.

293
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,440
No.

294
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,030
You mom said

295
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,390
she has to give us the money.

296
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,480
Would you stop

297
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,720
messing around now?

298
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,360
What about the money?

299
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,510
Let's go now.

300
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,000
I won't.

301
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,550
I don't leave.

302
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,630
Fugui.

303
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,480
I beg you.

304
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
Let's leave.

305
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,750
You're useless.

306
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,390
A woman bullies you like this.

307
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,270
You're making our entire family ashamed.

308
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,000
You won't go?

309
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:45,960
Fine.

310
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,550
I'll make you.

311
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
We can't go.

312
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,030
Leave.

313
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,670
Zhiyuan.

314
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,510
We should stay.

315
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,150
For money.

316
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,120
If you don't go,

317
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,910
forget 200,000,

318
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,870
I won't take even 20,000.

319
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,510
You.

320
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,240
Will

321
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,320
you leave?

322
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,870
Go.

323
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,440
Hurry.

324
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:01,960
Let's go.

325
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,630
Go.

326
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,440
Go...

327
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,960
Are we leaving?

328
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:06,960
Really?

329
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,840
Let's go.

330
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,840
Shameless.

331
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,480
Hold up.

332
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,240
Who did you call shameless?

333
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,750
Not you.

334
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,870
Apologize.

335
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,390
Don't push it.

336
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,390
I should say that to you.

337
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,910
This young man requested

338
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,360
the fund-raising online.

339
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,630
If you upset him,

340
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,390
he won't take it down.

341
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,790
Apologize.

342
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,390
Sorry.

343
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,320
I can't

344
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,270
hear you.

345
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,150
Sorry, young man.

346
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,030
I was wrong.

347
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,870
Who do they think they are?

348
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,390
Calm down.

349
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,630
Don't take it to heart.

350
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,000
Calm down.

351
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't get

352
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,720
mad

353
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,840
at them.

354
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,910
What a scene.

355
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,660
[Cash Advance]

356
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,580

357
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,270
I want to share with you today

358
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,870
The Turbulent Career.

359
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,270
Between 19th and 20th centuries,

360
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,910
many Western explorers

361
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,790
like missionaries and travelers,

362
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,960
visited Southwestern China,

363
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,320
bearing various purposes.

364
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,960
The sought and found.

365
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,270
In the perspective of human science,

366
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,870
they observed and recorded

367
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,790
local customs and people.

368
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,480
I hope you

369
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,870
make time to read this.

370
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,150

371
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,840
Put the sea cucumber box.

372
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,550
Mr. Ding.

373
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,870
We have a teleprompter.

374
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,790
Just read along.

375
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,510
Put that box

376
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,750
nearer Mr. Ding.

377
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,390
Closer.

378
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:49,720
OK.

379
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,750
All departments.

380
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,510
Three, two, one,

381
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,440
action.

382
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,510
Mr. Ding.

383
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,550
Tiger sea cucumber,

384
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,390

Women thrive,

387
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,240
men...

388
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,670
rise.

389
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,870
Cut.

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,270
Mr. Ding.

391
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,440
One more time.

392
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,320
Emotions.

393
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,670
More emotions.

394
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,030
Stand by.

395
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,200
Three, two, one,

396
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:34,960
action.

397
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,270
Tiger sea cucumber,

398
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,600
for the worn-out

399
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,320
middle-aged.

400
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,390
Women thrive,

401
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,150
men rise.

402
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,360
Bravo.

403
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,480
Where are we headed?

404
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,150
Restaurant.

405
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,240
Fugui.

406
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,480
I've transferred the money to you.

407
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,150
Did you receive?

408
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,880
Yes.

409
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,830
I called

410
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,200
my in-laws to tell them the good news.

411
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,400
Look at Zhiyuan.

412
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,350
He gets money with a few calls.

413
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,880
They want to cancel the wedding?

414
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,070
They'll regret.

415
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,000
That's right.

416
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,720
By the way.

417
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,830
I see your job is easy.

418
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,880
Any vacancy there?

419
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,920
I think

420
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,960
our son can talk too.

421
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,350
Why won't you help him?

422
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,000
Get him a job like yours.

423
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,960
Yes.

424
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,680
Look after him.

425
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,160
Remember.

426
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,000
We're family.

427
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,830
So fancy.

428
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,510
The lights.

429
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,160
Colorful.

430
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,350
Like we were in a movie.

431
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,790
Zhiyuan.

432
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,590
The painting

433
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,640
looks real.

434
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,240
The furnishings

435
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,480
are

436
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,480
fancy.

437
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,510
This

438
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,030
private room is nice.

439
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,400
Fugui.

440
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,720
Sit here.

441
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,240
No, I can't.

442
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,720
Seniors should

443
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,790
sit in the middle.

444
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,590
Listen to him.

445
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,110
Sit.

446
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,400
You sit there.

447
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,880
OK.

448
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,400
I'll take my seat here.

449
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,750
Come on.

450
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,350
Uncle Fugui.

451
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
Let's drink this.

452
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,830
This is good liquor.

453
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,240
Don't...

454
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,680
Just had a surgery.

455
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,480
No.

456
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,440
Right.

457
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,030
Then we'll have juice.

458
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,640
Juice is fine.

459
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,000
Uncle and Aunt.

460
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,270
I've always wanted to meet you.

461
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,640
I just couldn't make it.

462
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,640
I'm here to apologize.

463
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,240
Zhiyuan.

464
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,510
She's...

465
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,350
Introduce her.

466
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,750
Qiu Lisu.

467
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,750
My uncle and aunt.

468
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,960
Finally meet you.

469
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,880
Uncle and Aunt.

470
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,440
Just call me Lisu.

471
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,680
Sorry I've been on

472
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,480
business trips.

473
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,400
Couldn't see you in time.

474
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,480
It's OK.

475
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,790
Work is more important.

476
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,480
Finally meet you.

477
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,240
Come over.

478
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,920
Nice to meet you.

479
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,880
Mr. Ding.

480
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:09,960
I was wrong.

481
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,640
What?

482
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,110
She's...

483
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,880
His family needed money.

484
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,960
Were the procedures necessary?

485
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,440
You were away.

486
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,960
I couldn't use your account.

487
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,240
I used the firm's account,

488
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,350
they were necessary.

489
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,790
The firm would be under investigation.

490
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,790
Enough.

491
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
You failed.

492
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,200
No excuse.

493
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,750
Get your compensation

494
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,030
and leave tomorrow.

495
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,000
Please give me another chance.

496
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
- Please…
- Stop!

497
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,590
Uncle and Aunt.

498
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,550
I was wrong.

499
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,270
It was all my fault.

500
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,510
Help me.

501
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,200
Mr. Ding, please.

502
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,830
Uncle, I...

503
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,790
Lisu.

504
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,240
She's young

505
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,680
and makes a mistake for once.

506
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,110
Why won't you forgive her?

507
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,750
She'll learn a lesson

508
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,350
after this.

509
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,590
Listen to Fugui.

510
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,110
Did you hear?

511
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,830
Thank them now.

512
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,960
And Mr. Ding.

513
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,550
Thank you.

514
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,920
Thank you, Mr. Ding.

515
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I'll leave you alone.

516
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,310
You go on.

517
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,960
I'll check up on the kitchen.

518
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,270
Serve our dishes.

519
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:34,880
OK.

520
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,480
Come on.

521
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,790
Dig in.

522
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,550
You're busy.

523
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,070
What would you like to drink?

524
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,830
Juice, OK?

525
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,350
OK...

526
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:44,920
I'll help you.

527
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,920
Can I drink wine?

528
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,750
Lisu, it's so kind of you.

529
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,200
I got so many.

530
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,310
How sweet of you.

531
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,720
You're welcome.

532
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,310
Come to me when you visit Shanghai.

533
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,720
OK?

534
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,160
OK.

535
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,400
Let me.

536
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,830
You're so nice.

537
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,270
What's the date?

538
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,920
Take it.

539
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,640
For what?

540
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,070
Wedding.

541
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,240
It's your second marriage.

542
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,720
We still have to

543
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,790
meet each other's family.

544
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,200
Let me know.

545
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,030
Take care.

546
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,480
Careful.

547
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,830
Bye...

548
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,270
Bye.

549
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,750
Take care.

550
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,590
Call me.

551
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:32,880
Zhiyuan.

552
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,960
You've been

553
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,830
living at school?

554
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,440
Yes.

555
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,350
Can I see?

556
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,270
This is

557
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,400
where I sleep.

558
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,440
It's not fancy.

559
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,510
But,

560
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,030
I have my books,

561
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,640
food, and clothes.

562
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,590
Enough.

563
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,590
You should

564
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,480
go.

565
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,030
I'll do some reading.

566
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,030
Zhiyuan.

567
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,110
About Uncle and Aunt.

568
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,400
It's really a misunderstanding.

569
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,030
I'll go read.

570
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,400
Tell me if you're still

571
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,480
upset.

572
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,440
I'm afraid you can't take it.

573
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,000
Tell me.

574
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,270
I'm here.

575
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,750
You set me up to write the preface

576
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,510
for Fendou.

577
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,680
You get close to me

578
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,400
just to use me.

579
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,110
Right?

580
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,830
People told me

581
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,720
what you were.

582
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,400
I didn't believe.

583
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,480
Now...

584
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,720
I don't know what I should do.

585
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,590
Never mind.

586
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,590
Enough talking.

587
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,000
Go.

588
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,920
What did they call me?

589
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,070
A vain

590
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,030
gold digger

591
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,640
who sells herself?

592
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,310
None of my business.

593
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,270
Don't worry.

594
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,070
I won't smear your name.

595
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,590
If I had cared

596
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,000
about my name,

597
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,160
I should've

598
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,400
married my first love from school

599
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,160
and got children.

600
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,480
I'd been devoured by life.

601
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,960
You wouldn't spare a glance when I

602
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,350
walked past you.

603
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,110
But no.

604
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,640
I wasn't willing.

605
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,920
I had this possibility

606
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,110
in my life.

607
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,240
I was not content.

608
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,000
When I met a successful man

609
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,880
who'd

610
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,000
help me grow immensely,

611
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,920
why couldn't I fight for him?

612
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,350
Sorry.

613
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,070
I'm not that man.

614
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,720
You're wrong.

615
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,550
Yes.

616
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,270
I realized in the beginning.

617
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,350
But I

618
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,070
still chose to stay,

619
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,720
because

620
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,110
I love you.

621
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,830
You see everything

622
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,590
crystal clear.

623
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,720
You know how

624
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,720
the world

625
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,440
goes in a deep way.

626
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,960
Being with you,

627
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,480
talking to you,

628
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,960
it always makes me

629
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,790
feel enlightened.

630
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,750
Runnian left three years ago.

631
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,880
I had admirers

632
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,030
better than you.

633
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,350
But in the end,

634
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,440
we got together,

635
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,680
because

636
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,160
I really like you.

637
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,480
You don't have to.

638
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,480
I'm merely a teacher.

639
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,070
I'm mean and arrogant.

640
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
I'm not that good.

641
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,750
Zhiyuan.

642
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,070
I know I failed

643
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
you.

644
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,750
But I really hope

645
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,720
you can understand.

646
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,440
Zhig is in big trouble.

647
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,750
I can shut down and leave.

648
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,880
But once I do,

649
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,720
the rumors will be true.

650
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,440
I'll show them

651
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,790
I, Qiu Lisu,

652
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,310
on a higher

653
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,030
better platform,

654
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,400
can still achieve something.

655
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,440
I want them all to know

656
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,240
I have talent.

657
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,960
I don't solely rely on men.

658
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,440
You feel me?

659
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,400
I know

660
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,480
your firm's in trouble.

661
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,160
I didn't say I wouldn't help.

662
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,200
But I have principles.

663
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,880
I know.

664
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,160
That's one of the reasons I love you so.

665
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,480
I'm also glad

666
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,310
our child

667
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,640
has a father like you.

668
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,680
Our child?

669
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,310
Zhiyuan.

670
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,160
I'm pregnant.

671
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,510
You're going to be a dad.

672
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,110
Let's go home.

673
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,030
OK?

674
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,720
Tiger sea cucumber.

675
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,790
Women thrive.

676
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,070
Men...

677
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,550
rise.

678
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,270
Look at his face.

679
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,510
As if he had a gun against his head.

680
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,640
Look at you.

681
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,030
Making fun of him.

682
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,750
You're totally over him.

683
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,400
Well.

684
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,590
When we first broke up,

685
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,510
I hated the couple.

686
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
Then, I realized,

687
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,070
without that woman,

688
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,240
for some other reason,

689
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,160
we might've ended up in this state too.

690
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,440
What do you mean?

691
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,880
We'd been married for a decade.

692
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,240
You have to respect me for that.

693
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,590
But I haven't gained any good out of it.

694
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,110
Zhiyuan is a fool.

695
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,240
You're right.

696
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,200
But maybe I was wrong too.

697
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,510
Self-reflecting now?

698
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,350
This is not you.

699
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,400
Really.

700
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,640
You know.

701
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,030
I speak harshly

702
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,200
but act mildly.

703
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,400
I'll suffer losses

704
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,960
for sure.

705
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,270
So you want be

706
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,750
a lady from now on?

707
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,200
I won't.

708
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,510
I can't change.

709
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,590
I just decide I'll be nice

710
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,960
only to those who appreciate me.

711
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,750
It's not that I'm not enough.

712
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,590
Zhiyuan doesn't deserve me.

713
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:20,880
It's getting late.

714
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,030
I'll see a client.

715
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,160
Manli.

716
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,200
Wait.

717
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,240
It's about my family.

718
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,200
I want an education annuity

719
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,920
plan for Jun.

720
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,590
Education annuity for Jun?

721
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,270
Didn't you buy one two years ago?

722
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,310
I want more.

723
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,110
Ning.

724
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,070
Would you listen to yourself?

725
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,030
What do you mean?

726
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,880
I know you want to help,

727
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,550
I appreciate it.

728
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,640
But you know me.

729
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,480
I don't like pity.

730
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,790
No, don't take it the wrong way.

731
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,270
This is for myself.

732
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,640
You buy the same thing twice?

733
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,400
You think you're too rich?

734
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,920
What?

735
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,030
Something's up?

736
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,030
I have my medical reports.

737
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,590
How are they?

738
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,240
They don't

739
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,880
look good.

740
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,590
How so?

741
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,000
I can't tell you shortly.

742
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,200
Don't make a big deal out of it.

743
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,960
Get treated then.

744
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,440
You can even do that abroad.

745
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,270
Didn't you buy that high-end package?

746
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,400
Including that

747
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,240
some center's service.

748
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,240
One of my clients was in late stage

749
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,880
of lung cancer,

750
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,310
and he went to that center.

751
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,160
They used a drug in clinical trial.

752
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,680
His cancer cells decreased in months.

753
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,640
It worked.

754
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,440
2 million's medical fees.

755
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,310
All covered by his insurance plan.

756
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,590
Will yours be worse than lung cancer?

757
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,830
I don't buy it.

758
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,590
My disease

759
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,550
is incurable.

760
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,270
You haven't even get treated.

761
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:22,960
You...

762
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,310
I won't let you die.

763
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,680
What is it?

764
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,920
You're scaring me.

765
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,030
ALS.

766
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,510
How's my mom?

767
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,830
Somehow,

768
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,920
she had a lung infection,

769
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,110
causing multi-organ failure.

770
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,590
What's happening?

771
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,750
It hasn't been a day since

772
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,640
her infection, I'm afraid...

773
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,070
No, do something.

774
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,110
Calm down.

775
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,590
She's out.

776
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:14,680
Ms. Duan.

777
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,110
Ms. Duan.

778
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,000
How's my mom?

779
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,720
How's she?

780
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,070
Xiaozhou.

781
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,590
My condolences.

782
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,220
[Wu Ya]

783
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,320
Don't worry.

784
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,190
I have clients in pharmacy.

785
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,280
I'll ask around.

786
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,230
Manli.

787
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,960
Stop wasting your time.

788
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,510
You can't cure me.

789
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,150
Don't give up.

790
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,110
Technology is developing.

791
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,280
Everything is possible.

792
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,230
Think positive.

793
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,550
I do.

794
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,960
I want to arrange

795
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,000
everything

796
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,670
while I can still talk and walk.

797
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,920
No regrets then.

798
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,480
Manli.

799
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,590
You'll help me, right?

800
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,030
Can't believe you said that.

801
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,630
Anytime you need me,

802
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,190
just call.

803
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,400
I'll show up.

804
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,630
My parents died early,

805
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,960
I don't have close relatives.

806
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,280
I just miss Jun.

807
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,150
Though

808
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,360
he forgets about me.

809
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,030
No.

810
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,070
Teenage boys are all rebellious.

811
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Don't take it to heart.

812
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,630
He'll grow up.

813
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,070
About insurance...

814
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,710
What's your plan?

815
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,840
Doc said I have two years.

816
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,360
Jun won't be an adult even then.

817
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,920
No matter it's money or house,

818
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,110
they'll go to my ex.

819
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,030
So

820
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,670
I want to sell my house.

821
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,800
Apart from my loan,

822
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
there's about 1.5 million left.

823
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,400
I'll be honest with you.

824
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,920
I didn't want you to know

825
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,550
so I

826
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,360
went to other brokers.

827
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,230
They said they couldn't

828
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,760
make it happen.

829
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,440
No.

830
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,510
You're the policy holder.

831
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,590
If you die before Jun turns 18,

832
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,230
the policy holder will be changed

833
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,630
to Jun's guardian,

834
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,150
that is, your ex.

835
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,510
If he becomes the policy holder,

836
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,480
he'll decide what to

837
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,070
do with the plan.

838
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,000
Exactly.

839
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,880
That's what they all told me.

840
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,320
Manli.

841
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,920
Is there another way?

842
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,440
Don't worry.

843
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,070
Give me some time.

844
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,040
[Wu Ya]

845
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,190
Hello?

846
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,230
Ya.

847
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,510
Manli.

848
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,670
I've got all the paperwork.

849
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,710
I'll go back to work.

850
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,550
I'll leave him to you.

851
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,590
OK, I got this.

852
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,550
Talk to him.

853
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:19,960
OK.

854
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,320
Let's go home.

855
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,320
Xiaozhou.

856
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:24,960
My condolences.

857
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,480
It's hard for your mom

858
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,760
to hold on till this day.

859
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,280
Talk to me if you feel bad.

860
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,030
You'll feel better.

861
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,000
Cry if you want.

862
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,400
You can't keep your emotions within.

863
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,440
I'm useless.

864
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,920
How can you say that?

865
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,150
It was not your fault she was in a coma.

866
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,400
You're a good boy.

867
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,510
You gave up studies for her,

868
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,110
supported her.

869
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,960
You've done very well.

870
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,920
Don't blame yourself.

871
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,480
She could recover

872
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,840
if I had made money.

873
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,070
She could've had a surgery sooner

874
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,550
so she wouldn't die.

875
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,000
You're not thinking clearly.

876
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,000
Go to sleep.

877
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,550
Lucky that Ya left me.

878
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,550
Or

879
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,760
I'd drag her down like I did

880
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,960
to my mom.

881
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,320
I'm useless.

882
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,800
Don't say that.

883
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,880
I asked you to save my career.

884
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,320
You pitied me.

885
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,480
Without me,

886
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,000
you could do better.

887
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,630
Yes I said I pitied on you.

888
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,400
But that was to gain more commission.

889
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,670
I thought carefully

890
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,960
before coming to you.

891
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,880
I'm experienced

892
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,320
but lacking in knowledge.

893
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,710
You're a law graduate

894
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,960
and worked in a claim department.

895
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,800
You can do what I can't.

896
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,590
Don't try to comfort me.

897
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,840
I'm not that nice, OK?

898
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,590
I just have this order I can't secure.

899
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,710
I need your help.

900
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,110
I didn't want to

901
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,110
bring it up now.

902
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,760
You made me.

903
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,960
Even you can't?

904
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,510
How am I supposed to?

905
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,480
Manli.

906
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,760
Any progress on my plan?

907
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,030
And I remember.

908
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,320
You've got me a critical illness plan.

909
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,480
If I die,

910
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,230
there'll be a large compensation.

911
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,710
Thought it's for Jun,

912
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,800
he's still a minor.

913
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,480
Will

914
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,590
the money fall into the hands of my ex?

915
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,480
Ning.

916
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,710
You're being pessimistic, talking about

917
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,230
death all the time.

918
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,590
Two years is what the doc estimated.

919
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,030
About my insurance plan,

920
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,030
you have to help.

921
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,510
Rest assured.

922
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,000
I've figured it out, you know?

923
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,190
Really?

924
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,320
Yeah.

925
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,070
I'll have Xiaozhou talk to you.

926
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,030
OK.
