1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Wei.

2
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,280
This place is so beautiful.

3
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,760
Suli.

4
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,400
Yezi.

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,660
This will be your home from now on.

6
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,320
No matter how hard life gets, things will eventually get better.

7
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,000
But if you sisters are separated,

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,130
it will be difficult to reunite again.

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,680
Since you're staying here with me,

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,340
I can also treat your illness.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,480
Dr. Yu.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,120
Your great kindness.

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,240
Yezi and I could never repay you in our lifetime.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,170
Come here, Yezi.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,360
I've already told you.

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,820
We don't kneel in my house.

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,320
Come.

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,960
Sister said

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,760
if you don't let us kneel, we should give you a kiss.

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,460
Go play now.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
Don't touch this.

22
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:38,640
Come here.

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,120
If Officer Li sees this,

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,450
he'll scold us for sure.

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,600
Dr. Yu.

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,900
Su Li is straightforward.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,860
It's hard to keep certain things bottled up inside.

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,800
That Officer Li

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,680
and the master of Chen household

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,039
are not good people.

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,440
The more compassionate you are,

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,300
the more likely they'll harm you.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,010
I know my limits.

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,010
You're from out of town, so you don't know.

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,479
Chang'an City was

36
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
sold to the An family by them.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,480
When my father was alive, he served as Deputy Commissioner of Jingzhao Prefecture.

38
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,740
Out of anger, he cursed them for treason,

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,120
and Prefect Wei Cheng

40
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,450
had him beaten to death.

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,760
That Master Chen

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,840
and Prefect Wei are cut from the same cloth.

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,370
Not a decent one among them.

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,640
Take my advice.

45
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,480
Don't go to the Chen household anymore.

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,079
One small mistake and you could lose your life.

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,490
Don't worry.

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,240
I've already died once.

49
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,620
I'm not afraid.

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,760
Ling.

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,720
I failed.

52
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Take good care of your wounds.

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,920
Leave the rest to me.

54
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,480
No.

55
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,380
You can't go to Zhaixing Hall.

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,240
Officer Li.

57
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,160
Miss Pang isn't feeling well?

58
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,220
In response to Officer Li,

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,800
The weather suddenly turned cold.

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,320
Sister Pang caught a chill last night.

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,520
She's suffering from a cold now.

62
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,560
She says she has a headache.

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,820
And chest discomfort.

64
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,440
What should we do?

65
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,060
It's just a minor cold.

66
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,600
Thank you for your concern, Officer Li.

67
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,360
Miss Pang.

68
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,720
Miss Pang.

69
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,079
Miss Pang.

70
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,320
Have you seen the doctor?

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,440
Do you know where Doctor Nongyu is now?

72
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,800
She went to the mountains to collect herbs. She's not at home.

73
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,720
Please trouble yourself to visit another clinic, Miss Pang.

74
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,450
Officer Li will accompany her.

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,000
Qi has successfully left the city.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,640
I must thank you for your help with this.

77
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
Qi is a good person.

78
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,280
I can help you leave the city too.

79
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,800
What?

80
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,840
Without having any leverage over me,

81
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,120
you're already making threats?

82
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,800
It's not a threat, but advice.

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,640
The Chen household is a den of wolves.

84
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,440
It's more dangerous than you imagine.

85
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,520
While there's still time,

86
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,850
leave the city quickly.

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,680
Thank you for your kindness, Officer Li,

88
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,540
but I made myself clear last time.

89
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,720
You're just a frail woman,

90
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,480
all alone.

91
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,080
Even with all your wits and skills,

92
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,200
how can you match those

93
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,560
powerful people who abuse their authority?

94
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,080
You're just a drifting weed.

95
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,740
Why dream of reaching the sky?

96
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Then what are you?

97
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,840
A drifting weed?

98
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,320
Or one of those powerful abusers of authority?

99
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,450
Or perhaps their underling or lapdog?

100
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,200
The herb shop owner is your handler.

101
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,640
Please come in, honored guests.

102
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,040
With so many herb shops in Chang'an,

103
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,800
you specifically brought me to

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,660
Jimin Herb Shop in Anye District.

105
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,320
Just outside is Zhuque Gate Street.

106
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,480
West connects to Yanping Gate,

107
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,680
south to Mingde Gate.

108
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,760
Easy access to both east and west markets,

109
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,680
convenient for coming and going,

110
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,940
easy to enter and exit -

111
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,640
a perfect location for covert operations.

112
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,720
Business is slow,

113
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,840
yet prices are higher than competitors.

114
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,300
Clearly the owner isn't eager for business.

115
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,880
Yet strangely,

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
they can afford this expensive rent.

117
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,080
They can afford this expensive rent.

118
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,740
The night we helped Qi escape,

119
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,180
I recognized someone.

120
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,720
Despite the black cloth covering their face,

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,920
I still recognized the unique herbal scent on one of them.

122
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:58,840
You!

123
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,560
I was right.

124
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,920
Unlike Officer Li, I won't be so polite.

125
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,560
If you persist in bothering me,

126
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,220
I'll expose your activities.

127
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,760
You!

128
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,720
What? Officer Li,

129
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,320
have I discovered your secret?

130
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,050
Are you planning to silence me?

131
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,880
This remote area

132
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,570
is indeed a good place to kill and hide bodies.

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,980
Let me tell you,

134
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,480
don't push me too far.

135
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,840
Officer Li seems to have forgotten

136
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,440
what happened last time

137
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,920
when you got this close to me.

138
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,380
The poisonous parts of my body aren't limited to just one area.

139
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,780
Lord Wei invites you to tea at his residence.

140
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,280
To hell with your tea!

141
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,160
Don't run!

142
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,410
Hurry up back there!

143
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,370
Chase him! Quickly!

144
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,640
Stop right there!

145
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,280
Don't run!

146
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,320
Stop!

147
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,040
After them!

148
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,680
Don't run!

149
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,280
Chase!

150
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,080
Stop!

151
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,040
Hurry!

152
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,760
Li Ling,

153
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,130
come with me.

154
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,160
Hurry after them!

155
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,520
Yes.

156
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
Don't let her escape!

157
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Stop right there!

158
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,560
Don't run!

159
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,250
Let's go.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,200
Why are you all standing there? Search!

161
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,080
Nothing here.

162
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,159
Where did they go?

163
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,690
What are you all good for? Search everywhere!

164
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,920
How was it?

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Was rolling down the hill exciting?

166
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,040
How can you even ask that?

167
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,940
It hurts like hell.

168
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,880
I thought I was going to die here.

169
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,130
Well, that's still a possibility.

170
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
How about I push you out there?

171
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,520
No, no, no, no!

172
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,970
Mr. Li, a gentleman doesn't take advantage of others' misfortune.

173
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,520
If I were a gentleman...

174
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Then what are you?

175
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,010
I'm a scoundrel.

176
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,700
Speak up. I can't hear you.

177
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
I said I'm a scoundrel! Happy now?

178
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,850
That's more like it.

179
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,760
What about here?

180
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,880
Did you find anything?

181
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,280
Nothing here.

182
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,160
What about your side?

183
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,690
Nothing.

184
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,940
Nothing at all.

185
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,960
Mr. Wang,

186
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,120
we should retreat.

187
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,040
The Chen family's guards will be here soon.

188
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,840
Yes, what should we do?

189
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,320
Bunch of useless fools.

190
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,850
Mr. Wang,

191
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,650
let's go!

192
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,400
Master,

193
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,180
she's here.

194
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,160
Come.

195
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,440
Come.

196
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Let me see.

197
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Are you hurt?

198
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,760
Thanks to your protection,

199
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm fine.

200
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,890
Thanks to Officer Li for arriving in time.

201
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,120
Otherwise,

202
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,040
my beauty would have suffered.

203
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,000
Right?

204
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
In response, sir,

205
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,960
this is merely my duty.

206
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,120
Nongyu,

207
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Wei's people

208
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,360
came for you today.

209
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,720
What did Wang Cong say to you?

210
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,840
And what did you tell him?

211
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,640
What did we say?

212
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,000
Well...

213
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,280
Speak.

214
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,120
I told Wang Cong

215
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,400
though I'm just a humble medical woman,

216
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,700
I've entered the Chen household.

217
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,380
That makes me your person.

218
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,280
Let alone going to Wei's mansion for tea,

219
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,680
even my everyday words and actions

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,760
must prioritize your interests.

221
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,600
Only then can I repay your great kindness.

222
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,720
Pleasant to hear, but not the truth.

223
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,920
What exactly did he say to you?

224
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,280
I want you to tell me everything.

225
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Word for word.

226
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,520
Everything...

227
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,120
Actually...

228
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,090
Lord Wei invites you to tea at his mansion.

229
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,890
To hell with his tea!

230
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,360
Well said! Excellent!

231
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,560
Yuyaonu.

232
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:14,920
Yes?

233
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,650
Seize that wretched woman.

234
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,160
This

235
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,480
Mr. Chen.

236
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,640
Nongyu, you're very clever.

237
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
But you shouldn't take me for a fool.

238
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,560
Wei.

239
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,160

256
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,880
Assistant.
