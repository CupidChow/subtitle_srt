1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Threat.

2
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,050
Investigation.

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,360
Three days.

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Three days?

5
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,880
I'm afraid that's not possible.

6
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,320
That's your problem.

7
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,239
If you can't do it,

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,400
you know what the consequences will be.

9
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,520
In these noble houses,

10
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,280
people's intentions are unpredictable.

11
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,560
Everyone here is shrewd,

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,820
not a single person you'd want to offend.

13
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,960
But now I've

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,410
already offended them.

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,170
I advise you to know your place.

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,860
You don't want to make enemies as soon as you arrive, do you?

17
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,560
If you try to be meek and humble,

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,759
you'll still make just as many enemies.

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,039
No matter how large their army is,

20
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,479
I have my own way to defeat them.

21
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,340
Then do you know

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,240
within these towering walls

23
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,410
you'll eventually become a ghost?

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,479
Then so be it.

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,120
I've noticed that you

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,759
really love to meddle in others' business.

27
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,440
I'll enter my mansion, you do your job.

28
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,840
Let's keep to ourselves

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,220
and not interfere with each other, okay?

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,840
Get out!

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,720
Nongyu.

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't understand.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,320
You've gone to such lengths to trap yourself here.

34
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,560
Surrounded by enemies.

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,720
Every step is a struggle.

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,450
Is this really what you wanted?

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,120
Child, your life has finally been saved.

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,780
You've been through death once already.

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,680
Who are you?

40
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
You can call me Yanbo.

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
What's your name?

42
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,760
If you don't want to answer, I won't ask.

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,640
Born in chaotic times.

44
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,400
Perhaps it's better to be nameless.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,280
Come, child.

46
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,250
Drink this medicine first.

47
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,720
At least she understands the rules.

48
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,720
She listens when I speak.

49
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,440
But who can't act submissive?

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,680
She said herself

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
that she'll stay in that courtyard.

52
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,760
For all matters,

53
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,090
she needs my approval as her elder sister.

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,530
She's obedient for now.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,360
But as time goes by,

56
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,720
who knows what might happen?

57
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,360
You've done well.

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,200
Father.

59
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,760
Shiyuan is completely devoted to you.

60
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,920
Thank you for your generosity, Father.

61
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,040
Come.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Father,

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,400
what will you paint after finishing this one?

64
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,880
Look at you, Father, so forgetful.

65
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't you always paint

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,400
the new girls when they arrive?

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I really did forget about that.

68
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,740
We can't break tradition.

69
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,730
Let's do it tonight.

70
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,020
Go make the arrangements.

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,680
Yes.

72
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,240
Please get changed quickly, beautiful lady,

73
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,040
don't keep Master Chen waiting.

74
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,610
What does this mean?

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,320
According to the mansion's rules,

76
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,840
Master Chen must paint

77
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,900
a bathing portrait of every new girl.

78
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,210
A bathing portrait?

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,480
Would you both please leave first?

80
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,740
I can manage by myself.

81
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,600
I'll be quick.

82
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,560
That old eunuch.

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,960
Loose lips sink ships.

84
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,560
Officer Li, your habit of showing up uninvited

85
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,490
needs to change.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,720
I was just patrolling nearby.

87
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,440
This courtyard is under my supervision.

88
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,940
Let me tell you,

89
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,720
though Chen Jingbian is a eunuch,

90
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,980
he still abuses women.

91
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,200
Even if I'm a lamb in the tiger's mouth,

92
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,930
what can Officer Li do about it?

93
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,659
If you promise to leave this place

94
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
and never return,

95
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,800
I promise to help you escape.

96
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,640
Then I'd rather not have your help.

97
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,520
You've already saved me anyway,

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,620
more than once.

99
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,320
You don't understand Chen Jingbian.

100
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,520
You won't be able to endure it.

101
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
It's you who doesn't understand me.

102
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,800
What I've been through,

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,130
you know nothing about.

104
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,850
Please leave now, I need to change.

105
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,000
Please, Master Chen, avenge my family.

106
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,200
Let me ask you,

107
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,370
if I hadn't knocked that knife out of your hand back then,

108
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,580
would you have?

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,560
I would.

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,360
My legs!

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,159
My legs!

112
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,840
Child.

113
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,640
Child.

114
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,040
Yanbo.

115
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,700
Don't move.

116
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,320
Yanbo, this isn't me.

117
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,640
This isn't me.

118
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,720
I'm not like this.

119
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,010
I don't want to be like this, Yanbo.

120
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,640
Child.

121
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,840
Your injuries are too severe.

122
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,880
It's already fortunate that you survived.

123
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,140
Yanbo, please save me.

124
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,600
I don't want to be like this.

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
I must stand up again.

126
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,920
Yanbo, I can't stay like this.

127
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,080
I must recover.

128
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,360
I must stand up again.

129
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,160
Child.

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,720
Do you know that to stand again,

131
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,680
your legs must be broken once more?

132
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
To reshape your tendons and bones.

133
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,160
Your face will need countless cuts,

134
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,090
only then can you be reborn.

135
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,520
Child.

136
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,520
The pain will be excruciating.

137
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,360
What about the Tianshan

138
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,960
Fire Poison Ghost?

139
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,000
If I take that,

140
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,920
I won't feel pain anymore.

141
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,640
This medicine does relieve pain.

142
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,720
But you can't take too much.

143
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,120
Once addicted,

144
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,320
it can cause injury or madness,

145
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,720
or even cost your life.

146
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,500
In all my years as a doctor,

147
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,960
I've never seen anyone endure it.

148
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,880
Don't overthink.

149
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,240
Just rest and heal.

150
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,280
Child.

151
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,400
What are you doing?

152
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,960
Yanbo.

153
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,120
I've made a good start.

154
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,800
Now,

155
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,120
it's up to you.

156
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,640
Why torture yourself?

157
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,320
I can't be a cripple.

158
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,720
I must walk again.

159
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,680
For my family,

160
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,600
for my brothers,

161
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,290
I must have revenge.

162
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,360
Master Chen.

163
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
What a beauty.

164
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,480
Such a beauty in a painting,

165
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,680
how wonderful.

166
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,920
Please, beauty, take a bath.

167
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,560
What?

168
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,520
Didn't you hear Master Chen?

169
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,800
Take it off!

170
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,220
You all,

171
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,440
get to it!

172
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,040
Yes.

173
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,640
No rush.

174
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,200
We must take it slow,

175
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
very slow.

176
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,360
Bathing in orchid water, washing with fragrance,

177
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,680
dressed in splendid clothes like flowers.

178
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,120
Wei.

179
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,880
Xie Zheng.

180
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,000
Kang Rui.

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,440
Kang Sunrui.

182
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,100
Yan Zhirui.

183
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,160
Ying.

184
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,480
Ying Bei Tu.

185
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Wang Lin.

186
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,960
Ying Lu.

187
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Tong Liu.

188
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,240
Hao Xiao.

189
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:18,720
Li.

190
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,680
Zhang.

191
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,880
Liu Wang.

192
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,640
