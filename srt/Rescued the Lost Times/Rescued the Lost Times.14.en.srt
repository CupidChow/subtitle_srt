1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Wei.

2
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,680
Sir.

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
This Wei Cheng is really shameless.

4
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,960
It's been almost four hours.

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,040
Powdering your calves.

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,000
Poor but still pretentious.

7
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,840
Tong Luan.

8
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,800
I haven't wasted my affection on you.

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,240
Now it's time for you to repay me.

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,600
I wondered who it was.

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,080
So it's Chang'an's finest musician.

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,720
Why aren't you serving Master Chen properly?

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,039
Why come to my place?

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,890
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,840
Master Chen.

16
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,800
Master Wei.

17
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,520
The melody is high but few appreciate it.

18
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,440
Fortunate to find a true listener.

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,880
That piece I just played, 'The General's Order,'

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,000
was dedicated to you, Magistrate Wei.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,400
The meaning matches your noble character,

22
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,740
and your grand vision.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,680
I trust that despite any recent offenses,

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,720
you surely won't hold a grudge, will you?

25
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,200
Get out!

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,000
You filthy performer,

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,259
trying to fool me here!

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,260
I'm telling you, this matter isn't over between us.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,680
I, Tong Luan, am willing to serve Lord Wei

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,080
for my entire life

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,560
until death.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,560
Master Chen, you're offering him completely.

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,690
You're really going all in.

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,320
But I, Wei Cheng, have always

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,560
been a gentleman who doesn't take what others cherish.

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,290
Master Chen,

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,079
what am I supposed to do?

38
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,840
Easy.

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,680
Since the magistrate doesn't appreciate these skilled hands,

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,240
there's no use keeping them.

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Just cut them off.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,200
Guards!

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,880
Chop off his hands.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,730
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,740
You!

46
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,100
What are you doing?

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,520
Wait!

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,480
What's the meaning of this?

49
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,140
Are you trying to use violence

50
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,680
in my residence?

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,890
This wretched weather!

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,360
My hands and feet are completely numb from the cold.

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,290
Magistrate Wei,

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,800
might I trouble you for a cup of hot tea?

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,360
Get up.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,120
Lord Wei still values you.

57
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,960
Just serve him well from now on.

58
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,840
Yes.

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,120
Take everything inside.

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,020
It doesn't look good leaving it all out here.

61
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,850
Magistrate Wei,

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,440
I hope I'm not imposing.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,240
Master Chen, please don't say that.

64
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,040
The wine has been warmed for you.

65
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:24,980
Please,

66
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,730
this way.

67
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,400
Sir,

68
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,440
I beg you,

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,079
please save Tong Luan.

70
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,320
Please, I'm begging you.

71
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,720
Sir.

72
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,660
Please save Tong Luan.

73
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,920
You really think I can't see what's going on?

74
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,320
You and Tong Luan are always together,

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,200
exchanging glances.

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,320
I fear you've already been having an affair.

77
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,240
No,

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:55,960
no.

79
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,520
There's absolutely nothing like that, sir.

80
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,650
It's not true at all.

81
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,440
Shiyuan.

82
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,010
I'm making you my goddaughter.

83
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,000
That's a favor to you.

84
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
You should know what's good for you.

85
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,760
After all,

86
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,690
you and Tong Luan

87
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,120
are just toys for my amusement.

88
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,839
If I want you to crawl,

89
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,959
you cannot kneel.

90
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,240
If I want you dead,

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,560
you won't see tomorrow's sun.

92
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
In my household,

93
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,480
never mind who pairs up with whom,

94
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,400
even if it's matching a dog,

95
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,920
I have the final say.

96
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,440
You'd better

97
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,840
think carefully about this.

98
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,120
Sir,

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,660
I pay my respects to Lord Chen.

100
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,040
No need for formalities.

101
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,440
Li Ling,

102
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,760
this time you've thoroughly

103
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,560
crushed Wei Cheng's arrogance.

104
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,159
You've brought honor to our Chen household.

105
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,280
I must reward you generously,

106
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,210
but what would be appropriate?

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,730
Family, country, world order.

108
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,480
Li Ling,

109
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,159
I see you're not getting any younger

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,840
and still unmarried.

111
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,200
Today I'll take charge

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,200
and arrange a marriage for you. What do you say?

113
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
What do you think of Lady Nongyu?

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,720
Lord Chen...

115
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,980
For Nongyu, you fought

116
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,940
your way in and out of Wei's mansion seven times.

117
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,740
Heaven and earth bear witness to such devotion.

118
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,520
I can see you two have feelings for each other.

119
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,560
Why not go with the flow

120
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,660
and bring this happy union about?

121
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,640
I will not marry.

122
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,480
In life I am yours, in death my ghost is yours.

123
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,409
I will not marry.

124
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,440
Nongyu...

125
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,120
This shows how naive you are.

126
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:42,900
Master,

127
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,890
this is absolutely unacceptable.

128
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Nongyu is your favored servant.

129
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,480
How dare I covet her?

130
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,740
If I were to act on personal feelings,

131
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,000
putting the Chen household at risk,

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,400
how would that be different from betrayal?

133
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,980
I know my place.

134
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,500
I understand clearly.

135
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,440
Officer Li is young and talented,

136
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,770
and has your patronage.

137
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm merely a rural female healer,

138
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,340
far too lowly to aspire to such connections.

139
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,000
If you truly care about your servant,

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,840
then please withdraw your order.

141
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,200
Or

142
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,240
find another match for Secretary Li.

143
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,360
Sir,

144
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,640
please don't.

145
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,760
I beg you

146
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,770
to withdraw your order.

147
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,960
Fine.

148
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,000
Fine.

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,200
You two.

150
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,360
One understands reason.

151
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,120
One shows loyalty.

152
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,920
It seems that

153
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,360
I haven't cared for you in vain.

154
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,540
Get up, both of you.

155
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:02,760
Sir.

156
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,680
Good news.

157
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,760
The spy who stole maps from Zhaixing Hall

158
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,690
has been caught.

159
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,080
I don't know the exact details.

160
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
After seeing Qi's distress signal,

161
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,000
our men rushed there,

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,960
but the spy had already been captured by the Chen household.

163
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,160
But with Qi's skills,

164
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,700
he shouldn't have been caught so easily.

165
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,610
For an ordinary person,

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,039
it would be impossible to capture Qi.

167
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,440
But...

168
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,320
this wasn't an ordinary person.

169
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,919
Who was it?

170
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,640
The Chen household steward,

171
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,200
Jie Niu.

172
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,840
Jieniu

173
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,640
Go.

174
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,840
Get up.

175
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,640
What are you doing? Hurry up.

176
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,280
Get up.

177
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:51,960
Get up.

178
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,040
Give me the rope.

179
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,640
All right.

180
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,160
Hiya!

181
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,450
Demon methods, demon face.

182
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,560
King of Hell before Hell's gate.

183
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,680
The title 'Jieniu'

184
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,080
is well-deserved.

185
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,210
He came from humble origins

186
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,840
and was hardened in the military,

187
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,000
battle-tested and capable of any evil,

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,800
highly valued by Chen Jingbian.

189
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,610
In terms of ability,

190
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,120
he's no less than you.

191
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,940
A-Qi falling into Jieniu's hands

192
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,860
is truly troublesome.

193
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,580
As far as I know,

194
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,140
no one has withstood his methods.

195
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,360
Moreover.

196
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,760
A-Qi has just recovered from serious injuries,

197
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,220
how can his body endure it?

198
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,740
During the escort,

199
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,160
we sent people to rescue him.

200
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,120
But they were no match for Jieniu,

201
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,250
we lost several brothers for nothing.

202
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,170
Once he enters Chen's mansion.

203
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,210
Trying to get out

204
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
won't be so easy.

205
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,480
Carry him

206
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,130
quickly.

207
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,690
I'll figure something out.

208
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,320
No.

209
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,530
What I'm most worried about now

210
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,530
is actually you.

211
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Chen Jingbian will try everything

212
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,320
to make A-Qi talk.

213
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,210
I'm afraid he might not hold out

214
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,600
and give you up.

215
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,410
Impossible.

216
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,970
You don't know A-Qi,

217
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,640
he would never betray me.

218
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,640
We.

219
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,360
No matter what it costs,

220
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,640
I will rescue him.

221
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,520
Speak.

222
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,400
How did you know

223
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,060
that Chen family ordered a coffin in Liangzhou?

224
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,600
Who told you?

225
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,680
Who else is your accomplice?

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
I don't know what a coffin is.

227
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,880
That coffin was a trap set by Master Chen.

228
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,520
And you fell right into it.

229
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,980
You don't even realize it.

230
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,720
Let me tell you the truth.

231
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,440
You've fallen into my hands.

232
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,060
I have all the methods of the King of Hell.

233
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,970
And even those he doesn't have,

234
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,400
I have them too.

235
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,560
Enough.

236
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,060
What can we get out of him if he's beaten to death?

237
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,880
You can deny the matter of the box.

238
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,880
But there's one thing

239
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
you cannot deny.

240
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,920
How did you disguise yourself as a servant

241
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,680
to sneak into my residence and steal the map?

242
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,940
You can at least explain that, can't you?

243
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,800
And about Zhaixing Hall,

244
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,960
who told you about it?

245
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
In my residence,

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,260
do you have an informant working for you?

247
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,200
Speak.

248
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,120
He really passed out.

249
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,280
Go

250
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,460
and bring Nongyu to me.

251
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,240
Yes.

252
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,600
Useless thing.

253
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,720
Sir.

254
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,760
Go save his life for me.

255
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,480
Yi Yu.

256
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,480
Xie Zheng.

257
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,800
Xiao Ke.

258
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,600
Xie Zheng.

259
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,850
Kang Sunrui.

260
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,480
Kang Sunwang.

261
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,210
Kang Sunrui.

262
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,080
Ying Lu.

263
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Wang Linwang.

264
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,400
Ying.

265
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,860
Ying Lu.

266
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Wang Linwang.

267
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,440
Hao Xiao.

268
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,240
Tong Liu.

269
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,640
Li Zhang.

270
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,960
Liu Wang.

271
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,520
Jia Jianing Tao Jiaying.

272
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,250
Jia Ningtao.

273
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,890
Jia Jianing Tao Jiaying Xi Dou Rong Jingshou.

274
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,880
Li.

275
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,720
Assistant.

276
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,160
Li.

277
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,360
