1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Wei.

2
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,440
Stop pricking yourself.

3
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,560
It's painful to watch.

4
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,610
Besides,

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,240
are those few drops of your blood really effective?

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,840
Master.

7
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,840
Back when I was in the palace,

8
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,010
I frequently visited the Imperial Hospital.

9
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,720
Looking for medicinal catalysts for His Majesty.

10
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,850
I've seen all sorts of strange things.

11
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,920
Like

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,760
sugarcane that survived three years of frost,

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,020
crickets raised by legitimate couples,

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,800
soil from the center of a decade-old stove.

15
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,340
It drove me crazy trying to find them.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,440
Later I realized

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,280
they were all just excuses.

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,000
All pretexts in case the medicine didn't work.

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
I understand what you're thinking.

20
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:44,240
You just want me to see your dedication.

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,520
So I'll sympathize with you more.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,160
Master,

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,039
I...

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,800
Alright.

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,570
You're just showing your loyalty.

26
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,160
I don't blame you.

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,800
To receive Master's affection

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,060
is Nongyu's blessing.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,460
You're speaking too soon.

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,040
We've barely begun.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,199
Don't forget,

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,290
I haven't fulfilled my promise to you yet.

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,000
I haven't granted your wish.

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,840
Since you know how to make medicine,

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,579
you must also know how to poison someone.

36
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,290
What did you say?

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,450
Chen Jingbian is hosting a dinner.

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,079
That's a miracle.

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,210
It's not even a holiday.

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,880
What is he up to?

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,040
I think something's fishy.

42
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,700
Maybe we should just decline.

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,340
Why should we be afraid of him?

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,360
I want to see what this old eunuch

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,040
is really planning.

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,490
Tomorrow I'll host a banquet at my residence.

47
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,400
Wei Cheng will be invited.

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,240
Didn't you want revenge against him?

49
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,340
I'm giving you this opportunity.

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,780
Master.

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,160
I've never poisoned anyone before.

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,620
This...

53
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,200
I don't know how to do it.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,860
This wine pot has a mechanism.

55
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,480
Just turn the lid to release the poison.

56
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,200
It seems this vendetta

57
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,880
was just empty talk.

58
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,920
Where is your determination now?

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,280
Or perhaps from the beginning,

60
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,340
you've been playing me for a fool.

61
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,640
I...

62
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,320
Thank you, Lord Chen,

63
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,720
for your great kindness.

64
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,680
You're thanking me too soon.

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,160
Jing Ke's assassination of the King of Qin,

66
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,420
Zhuan Zhu's assassination of King Liao,

67
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,780
have you heard of them?

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,640
Yes, I have.

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,120
If tomorrow's plan succeeds,

70
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,440
you'll be like Zhuan Zhu.

71
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,000
If it fails,

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,360
you'll be like Jing Ke.

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,720
Whether you succeed or fail,

74
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,480
at least you will have tried your best.

75
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,360
Then you can peacefully go to the underworld

76
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,160
and reunite with your family.

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,720
I won't be a burden to you, Master.

78
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,490
When the time comes, you won't need to act.

79
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,320
I will end my own life.

80
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,800
It seems I haven't wasted my affection on you.

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,280
What?

82
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,640
Poisoning Wei Cheng?

83
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,360
Keep your voice down.

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,760
Don't let others hear us.

85
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,930
Did you hear it clearly?

86
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,570
I heard Lord Chen instructing Nongyu myself.

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,250
This Nongyu, just to please Lord Chen,

88
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,000
would go this far.

89
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,600
It's not just to please him.

90
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,160
I heard Lord Chen say Wei Cheng killed Nongyu's entire family.

91
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,600
Killed her entire family?

92
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,780
That old eunuch is probably ready to bring everyone down with him.

93
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,680
If I go inform Wei Cheng now,

94
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,659
wouldn't that be a great achievement for me?

95
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,450
Sister Pang,

96
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,200
haven't you had enough of living like this?

97
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,880
I hate Chen Jingbian.

98
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,330
He's made my life worse than death.

99
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,980
But I hate Wei Cheng even more.

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,280
What he did to you

101
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,920
was worse than an animal.

102
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,720
Sister Pang, promise me.

103
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,540
Don't go to Wei Cheng, please.

104
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,900
I can't bear to see you degrading yourself anymore.

105
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
Then what should I do?

106
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,000
Resist?

107
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,160
I come from Pingkang District.

108
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,690
What do I have to fight with?

109
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,960
Besides,

110
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,920
my son Rui is still in his hands.

111
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,240
Have you thought about

112
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,820
what happens if Nongyu succeeds?

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,520
Master.

114
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,360
This Wei Cheng is getting too bold.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,920
Wait.

116
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,240
Prefect Wei has arrived.

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,400
Lord Chen,

118
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,520
I'm late.

119
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,820
Please forgive me.

120
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,960
Play the music.

121
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,330
I thought you looked familiar.

122
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,960
Now I remember.

123
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,840
I've seen you before.

124
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,400
I heard that Lord Chen

125
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,480
has a new female physician in his household.

126
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,410
That must be you.

127
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,000
In response to Lord Wei,

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
yes, it is me.

129
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,080
I had no idea before

130
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,800
that such a beauty could be a skilled doctor.

131
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,720
When you help Lord Chen solve his problems,

132
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,960
you're also helping me, Wei Cheng.

133
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:06,920
Come,

134
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,440
drink this cup.

135
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,120
Consider it my token of gratitude.

136
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,460
You insolent servant!

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,460
You don't know your place.

138
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,780
How dare a concubine pour wine for an honored guest?

139
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,120
Yuyao.

140
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,800
Mr. Chen,

141
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,560
what does this mean?

142
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,240
Don't you like it anymore?

143
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,560
If you don't, you can give it to me.

144
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,240
I know my mistake.

145
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Let me try again.

146
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,760
You must be tired.

147
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,560
Let me do it.

148
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,720
Pouring wine is something I should do.

149
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,480
Report!

150
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,320
Sir Chen,

151
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,120
an urgent confidential report.

152
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Everyone leave.

153
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,480
Speak.

154
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,080
Prince Jin An Qingxu has plotted to kill An Lushan.

155
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,520
He's claiming that An died of sudden illness.

156
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,250
And forged a decree to make himself crown prince.

157
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,290
What did you say?

158
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,760
An Qingxu killed An Lushan.

159
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,280
Mr. Chen,

160
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,600
is this information reliable?

161
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,000
Since I have the Night Firefly Map here,

162
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,730
do you think the information is reliable?

163
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,020
Urgent report!

164
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,640
If it's urgent, report it now.

165
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes.

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,600
Emperor An Lushan of Great Yan has passed away.

167
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,200
Continue.

168
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,760
That's all.

169
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,280
What?

170
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,120
That's it?

171
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,600
Sir.

172
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,680
That's it. Really nothing more.

173
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
What's the point of keeping useless people like you?

174
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,080
You call this intelligence?

175
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,720
Get out!

176
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,960
Yes, yes, yes.

177
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,240
General Wei.

178
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,240
I offer you my congratulations.

179
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,120
Now that An Lushan is dead.

180
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,360
My patron has fallen.

181
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,040
But you, General Wei, grew up with An Qingxu.

182
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,560
Like brothers.

183
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,120
If Lord An ascends to the throne one day,

184
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,000
wouldn't you become his most trusted minister?

185
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,160
I will need to rely on your support in the future.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Trying to fool me.

187
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,960
That old fox is using Wei Cheng's humiliation to test me.

188
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,290
I've already tested it.

189
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,380
There's no poison in that wine at all.

190
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,800
I'll need to be more careful from now on.

191
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,960
After Sister Yu,

192
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,600
I've met another miracle doctor.

193
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,530
Miracle doctor?

194
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,770
How miraculous?

195
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,600
Well, he's quite amazing.

196
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,800
But he's just an old man,

197
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,130
invited by the Tang camp in our Liangzhou.

198
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,520
Qi,

199
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,400
is this longgu from that miracle doctor?

200
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,600
So this is called longgu?

201
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,120
Sister Yu's medicine seems to have this smell too.

202
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,800
Where is this miracle doctor now?

203
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,640
The Yellow River rises to the white clouds.

204
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,520
Here he comes.

205
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,080
A lonely city amid towering mountains.

206
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,440
