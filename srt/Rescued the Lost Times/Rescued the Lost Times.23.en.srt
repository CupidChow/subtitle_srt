1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
OK. OK.

2
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,280
You can chop off my head now.

3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,730
The mountain is flying.

4
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,520
The spirit of Shuo passes on the golden horizon.

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,120
The general died in battles.

6
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,360
The warrior has returned for ten years.

7
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,360
This is the origin of your name.

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,050
It's also something

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,000
you've been proud of.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,330
I believe

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,200
in your hearts,

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,520
in your hearts.

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,080
a man of Tang.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,039
choose to be a bandit for life.

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,210
and do evil deeds for the tiger.

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,050
It's a shame to be a hero.

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,600
or choose to be a hero

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
a righteous man.

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,720
to revive Su Tianfei.

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,200
of the past

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,890
The choice is yours.

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,130
It's your turn. It's your turn.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,640
[You're not a good person, are you?] I'm a good person.

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,759
Think carefully.

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,080
what you want.

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,920
A man.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,729
Just admit it. Okay?

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,650
Don't you

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,240
you don't want to leave you

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,840
your name

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,960
and Guan Tian Society?

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,160
Shut up!

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,880
Cut off my head.

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,290
and bring your brothers

35
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,120
to restore Chang'an,

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,400
to restore Chang'an.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,280
This is my last request.

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
If I die,

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,240
would you be with him?

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,160
What if he dies?

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,680
I won't live alone.

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,640
Why can't it be me?

43
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,120
What's so good about him?

44
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,760
Just because I'm from the Guan Tian Society,

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,820
Is he the Tang army?

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,960
I've met many people

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,680
in my life.

48
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
except me, Aye.

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,130
He's the only one

50
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,400
who sacrificed his life

51
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
sacrifice his life

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,360
or even dignity.

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,320
Your life is mine now.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,360
Your head

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,840
in your place.

56
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,720
I'm going to Chen Residence tomorrow.

57
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,480
If you die,

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,260
There's something that's hard to do.

59
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,050
What's this?

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,079
Drink this.

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,760
The poison will take effect in 12 hours.

62
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,160
When I get the map,

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,200
you can die.

64
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,800
Go.

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,920
Go. Go.

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,800
A woman who has no experience

67
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,500
can't see my good side.

68
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,560
I don't care about

69
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,420
I don't care about an ignorant woman.

70
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,210
Chen Jing's border is over.

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
I won't

72
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
I don't want to get on the boat. I don't want to.

73
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,600
Then...

74
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,690
Fluffy Picture?

75
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,400
I'm shameless.

76
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,620
You and Li Lingcai are shameless.

77
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,480
Enough.

78
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,680
I'll find a way

79
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,480
to get the map.

80
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,890
But first of all,

81
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,820
I'll reward you in the future.

82
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,280
I want to be promoted.

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,730
Are you serious?

84
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,760
Before I change my mind,

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,530
Get lost!

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,130
Miss Nongyu.

87
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,560
You're finally back.

88
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
I was so worried.

89
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,440
I've been waiting for you in Zhai Xing Hall.

90
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,570
Please come with me.

91
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,700
Zhai Xing Hall.

92
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,680
So this is Zhai Xing Hall.

93
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,640
Su Changming is an outsider.

94
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,600
I specially told you

95
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
when you enter the hall,

96
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,620
Keep an eye on them.

97
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,960
Sir, they're here.

98
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,240
Mr. Chen.

99
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,170
I brought him to you.

100
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,530
Where is the map?

101
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,330
Jade waist slave

102
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,120
Go get it.

103
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,280
Yes.

104
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,000
Nongyu, the medicine.

105
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,820
Sir, the medicine is here.

106
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,720
I've been waiting for this.

107
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,040
Thank you for saving me, Young Master Su.

108
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,200
You...

109
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,560
It's... It's...

110
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
This medicine...

111
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,680
This medicine...

112
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,520
It's...

113
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,600
It's...

114
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,880
This...

115
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,000
Medicine.

116
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,320
It's you.

117
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,000
It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's your turn.

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,730
It's the poison I made earlier.

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,560
I should thank you for the medicine.

120
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,600
Without your medicine,

121
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,400
without your medicine?

122
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,840
How could he tell me

123
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,480
tell me?

124
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,240
Think about it.

125
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,840
How could the old eunuch really have a picture?

126
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,520
Everything is in his mind.

127
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,640
Chen Jing

128
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,650
The dark night glowing map.

129
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,840
Now,

130
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,120
It's here.

131
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,409
You are a man and a woman.

132
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,650
When I get out...

133
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,919
Get out.

134
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,039
Dream on.

135
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,820
Be careful.

136
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,450
It's darksteel.

137
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,490
The smoke is poisonous.

138
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,220
I always have antidotes on me.

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,040
is not fully effective,

140
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,370
but I can barely hold on.

141
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,720
I want one too.

142
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,800
I can't die.

143
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,740
Come and help if you don't want to die.

144
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,960
Push harder!

145
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,160
I'll kill you when I get out.

146
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,480
Shut up!

147
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,160
Yin Niang.

148
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,640
She left us the antidote.

149
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,280
The real knife

150
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
is not in my hand.

151
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,600
It's here.

152
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,440
and here.

153
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,640
As long as you

154
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,320
on Blade Point,

155
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,520
and get rid of distractions.

156
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,480
and combine human and sword.

157
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,760
Any knife in the world

158
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,680
can be called Yuzhen.

159
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,080
Yin Niang.

160
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,740
Be there! Be there!

161
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,480
Yin Niang.

162
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,560
Yin Niang.

163
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,200
Wake up.

164
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,360
Yin Niang.

165
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,320
Wake up.

166
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,960
It's fake.

167
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,000
She's here. She's here. She's here.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,200
It’s fake. It’s fake.

169
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,800
Fake?

170
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,480
Think about it.

171
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,480
How could the old eunuch really have a picture?

172
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,280
Everything is in his mind.

173
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,920
Chen Jing's side is fake.

174
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,720
The one who died

175
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,210
The dead Chen Jingbian is fake.

176
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,880
I'll help you up when you wake up.

177
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,700
Come on.

178
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,250
Come on. Come on.

179
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,280
Come here! Come here!

180
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,000
Who are you?

181
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,620
Why did you leave the city?

182
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,850
The seal of the Tang army of Dongdu.

183
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,880
So you are one of us.

184
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,800
Yes sir

185
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
We have important news

186
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,250
to the Tang army camp outside the city.

187
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,820
Let them go.

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,680
Sit tight.

189
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,240
Medicine.

190
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Medicine.

191
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:40,720
Sir.

192
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,520
Medicine.

193
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,400
Here. Here.

194
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,200
