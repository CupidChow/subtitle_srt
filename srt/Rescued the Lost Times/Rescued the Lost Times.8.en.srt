1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Hey.

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,160
Bathing in orchid water

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,960
Wearing colorful clothes like flowers.

4
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,560
This...

5
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,100
This...

6
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,020
How could this happen?

7
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,280
What a pity.

8
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,080
I've sinned. Please forgive me, sir.

9
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,680
What sin have you committed?

10
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,440
I know my body is hideous.

11
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,740
Yet I dared to be in your painting.

12
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,979
I've truly offended your eyes

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,600
and insulted your intentions.

14
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,660
This is a great sin.

15
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,290
I, Nongyu, willingly accept punishment.

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,700
You've been through a lot.

17
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,320
But your body

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,840
truly isn't worthy of my paintings.

19
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,480
However...

20
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,920
It's a pity about your pretty face.

21
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,540
Just focus on brewing your medicine from now on.

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,480
Shiyuan.

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,640
Let's go for a walk.

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,960
Li Ling.

26
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,740
Since we've known each other,

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,050
this is the first time I've seen you like this.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,760
I truly miss

29
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,620
the days when we fought together,

30
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,800
wielding guns and riding horses,

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,329
living life to the fullest.

32
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,000
Not like now,

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
stuck in this den of snakes and rats,

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,760
living like insects,

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,400
existing like walking corpses.

36
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Who cares about these evil spirits?

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,000
Better to cut them down with one stroke.

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,100
It's because of Nongyu, isn't it?

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,440
The Night Firefly Painting isn't in our hands yet.

40
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,040
We can't afford any complications now.

41
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,560
I'm sure I don't need to tell you

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,440
that you understand what's at stake.

43
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,480
As for that woman,

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,329
her mind is extraordinary.

45
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,800
Not just Chen Jingbian,

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,760
but you and I

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
are already under her control.

48
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,360
She said

49
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,650
she only wants revenge.

50
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,620
If she truly only wanted revenge,

51
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,440
do you think Wei Cheng would still be alive?

52
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,260
Whether Wei Cheng is her enemy

53
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,440
is uncertain now.

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,840
A woman who's willing

55
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,160
to risk her own life

56
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,440
If there comes a day,

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,860
she will show you no mercy either.

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,120
When she tried to kill herself,

59
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,920
you shouldn't have stopped her.

60
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,340
But no matter what,

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,930
I couldn't just stand by and watch.

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,770
After all...

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,880
After all, she saved A'qi's life.

64
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,780
Li Ling, oh Li Ling.

65
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,530
You're good in every way

66
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,580
except your heart is too soft,

67
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,500
especially toward women.

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,700
Is this flower pretty?

69
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,079
Yes, it is.

70
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,420
Is this one pretty too?

71
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,089
They're all pretty.

72
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,720
In the whole world, except for my sister Yu,

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,920
my sister is the most beautiful.

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,860
Whose little darling is this?

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,520
Sweeter than honey.

76
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,600
Sister Yu is back!

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,880
Slow down, don't knock Sister Yu over.

78
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,820
Sister Yu bought you new clothes.

79
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,440
Let me see.

80
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,720
Do you like them?

81
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
Yes, I do.

82
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,320
Come on.

83
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,050
Let's go inside and try them on.

84
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:49,850
Here.

85
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,120
Come here, Xiaoye.

86
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,680
Kowtow.

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,440
I don't know who you are,

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,720
but I know

89
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
you must be Dr. Yu's beloved family.

90
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,240
Please, from heaven,

91
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,040
bless Dr. Yu

92
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
to live without misfortune

93
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,740
and in happiness forever.

94
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,880
Su Li.

95
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,370
Yezi,

96
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,240
get up.

97
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,940
I haven't even thanked you

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,480
for watching over the memorial hall.

99
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,120
Sister.

100
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,700
If you have no family left,

101
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,120
Yezi and I

102
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,610
will be your family.

103
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,400
Slow down. Take it easy.

104
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,640
Your leg just healed. Don't hurt it again.

105
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,640
Yanbo,

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,460
I want to climb over that higher slope ahead.

107
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,280
This is astragalus.

108
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,810
This is cogon grass.

109
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,530
What about that one?

110
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,040
This is Jiuconggen.

111
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,520
That won't do.

112
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,800
Don't damage the roots.

113
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,460
We need to take the whole root.

114
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,160
It's fine.

115
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,640
There's more over there.

116
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
This child.

117
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,240
What is this?

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,240
Yanbo.

119
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,240
Yanbo.

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
Yanbo.

121
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,520
This is my daughter

122
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,040
Nongyu.

123
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,800
She was also a gifted child.

124
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,800
I haven't

125
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,240
visited her for a long time.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,360
I thought this would ease my longing

127
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,840
and make life more bearable.

128
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,080
Until I met you.

129
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,040
Every time I see you,

130
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
I keep thinking over and over again.

131
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,520
If

132
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,880
my daughter were still alive,

133
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,840
her smile

134
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,159
would be just as beautiful as yours.

135
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,760
Yanbo.

136
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,840
What are you doing?

137
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,840
You saved my life,

138
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,940
which means everything to me.

139
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,850
From now on, if you're willing,

140
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,520
I

141
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,690
will be your daughter, Nongyu.

142
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,920
I've brought you the things.

143
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,730
How is it?

144
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,770
Is it useful?

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,120
By analyzing the combination of ingredients,

146
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,880
I can reverse engineer her medicinal formula.

147
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,760
Combination?

148
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,440
Nongyu's treatment for Chen Jingbian and Aqi

149
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,400
seems simple,

150
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
but there's something more to this medicine.

151
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,280
Different regions, different schools,

152
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,680
even different mentors,

153
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,280
all have their unique ways of using medicines.

154
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,040
If I can find just a small clue,

155
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,280
I can trace it back to its origin.

156
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,500
Once you understand someone's past,

157
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,460
you can see who they truly are.

158
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,760
Good.

159
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,440
I was wondering why the forest smells so fragrant today.

160
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,500
So there's a little wildflower here.

161
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,640
Young lady,

162
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,200
why are you all alone?

163
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,720
Indeed.

164
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Where's your man?

165
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,920
Don't go!

166
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,600
How about a drink of water?

167
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,800
Yes, have some water.

168
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,480
No water.

169
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,700
Something else would be fine too.

170
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,520
That's right.

171
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,690
Zheshan!

172
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,160
What are you doing?

173
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,720
Yanbo!

174
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,240
Yanbo!

175
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,480
How long has it been since we last met?

176
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,680
Seeing you so healthy puts my mind at ease.

177
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,410
Yes, indeed.

178
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,800
Our young master has been talking about you all the way here.

179
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
He said if this old man passed away,

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,260
even if we wanted to be filial,

181
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,060
we'd only be left with burning paper offerings.

182
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,130
They haven't given you a hard time, have they?

183
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,080
Have you forgotten the rules of Guantian Society?

184
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,800
I'll tell Young Master Su about this,

185
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
and you'll be in big trouble.

186
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,160
No, no, no!

187
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,840
Sir, please come back with us.

188
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,300
Our young master is already waiting for you.

189
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:27,920
Go.

190
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,840
Yanbo.

191
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,240
Those people are from the Guantian Society.

192
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,570
They're those bandits.

193
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,090
Don't be afraid.

194
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,050
I'm here.

195
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,640
Turn.

196
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,770
Turn it over.

197
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,400
This roast chicken is just like a woman.

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,160
When the time is right,

199
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,320
you need to flip it.

200
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
How should we turn it, Young Master?

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,640
Young Master, Yanbo is here.

202
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,840
Yanbo, please.

203
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,920
Yanbo.

204
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,090
I've missed you so much.

205
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,050
Young Master, are you alright?

206
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,840
Young Master.

207
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,640
Young Master.

208
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,600
Young Master must have a reason for this visit.

209
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,640
Young Master.

210
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,970
If we had come any later,

211
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
this arm would have been lost.

212
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,800
Not too early, not too late.

213
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,400
Just perfect timing, Yanbo.

214
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,160
Yanbo, who is she?

215
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,410
I've taken on a female apprentice.

216
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,920
Not bad, Yanbo.

217
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,690
Still vigorous in your old age.

218
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,880
Wait a moment.

219
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,860
This liquor has made my mouth dry.

220
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,400
Would you pour me some tea, miss?

221
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,850
What are you looking at?

222
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,040
You.

223
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,360
Come here.

224
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,500
Go polish my knife.

225
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,780
Polish it well.

226
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,900
Yes, Young Master.

227
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,640

242
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,250
Li Zhang.

243
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,120
Jia Ning Tao Jia.

244
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:47,560
