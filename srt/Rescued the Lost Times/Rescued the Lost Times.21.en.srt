1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Wei.

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,760
This is a military order!

3
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,680
Do it now!

4
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,160
General.

5
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,600
General, if your spirit is watching from heaven,

6
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,200
please lend me your strength

7
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,380
to eliminate the traitors

8
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,740
and restore the Tang Dynasty.

9
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,479
I need to go to Jimin Pharmacy

10
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,450
to let Zhuang Yao know I'm safe.

11
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,840
Wait for me to return.

12
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,300
Master.

13
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,200
The Tang army has already captured

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,520
many strategic locations outside Chang'an.

15
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,800
They're about to break through.

16
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,960
Jieniu and the other two

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,000
haven't returned yet.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,199
Could something have happened to them?

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,120
Why panic?

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,640
We've weathered all kinds of storms.

21
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:22,200
Everything is under my control.

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,130
What did you say?

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,610
Nongyu is Feng Jianye's daughter.

24
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,579
I must tell her.

25
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,690
I must tell her everything.

26
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,520
Tell her what?

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,400
Tell her

28
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,160
that you personally delivered her father's head

29
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,720
to Chen Jingbian?

30
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,140
Let me tell you.

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
If she learns the truth,

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,360
no matter how you explain it,

33
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,240
it will sound like mere excuses.

34
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,930
All those passionate vows between you two

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
will instantly crumble.

36
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,290
She'll only see you as enemies.

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,130
She'll hate you to the bone.

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,300
This is a critical moment.

39
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,690
We must remain loyal to our duties.

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,840
If at this moment,

41
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,380
because of Nongyu,

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,680
complications arise

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
and cause trouble,

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,210
everything we've done before will be wasted.

45
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,400
When that happens,

46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
how will you explain to His Majesty?

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,210
How will you face our fallen brothers?

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,079
Can you face

49
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,940
General Feng who entrusted you with his dying wish?

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,340
I'll find a suitable time to tell her.

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,610
I'm telling you,

52
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,620
these words...

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,240
You...

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,460
You must keep them buried in your gut.

55
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,579
The most crucial thing now

56
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,560
is to prevent Nongyu from returning to Chen's mansion.

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,840
She'll definitely ask Chen Jingbian about that sword.

58
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,079
Don't worry about that.

59
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,560
I've already thought it through.

60
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,200
Otherwise I wouldn't have used you as an excuse

61
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,880
to leave.

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,370
I can't let her be in danger.

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,970
What are you going to do?

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,180
I'll go back alone.

65
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,320
First, I'll finish the butchering task

66
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,780
and pacify Chen Jingbian.

67
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,060
As for the rest,

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,420
I'll have to play it by ear.

69
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,600
Good.

70
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,170
Now the main Tang forces

71
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,090
have already assembled outside the city.

72
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
The Night Firefly Map

73
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,100
must be obtained as soon as possible.

74
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,290
Alright.

75
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,399
Li Congshi, you're finally back.

76
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,329
Are you alright?

77
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,220
Li Congshi.

78
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,240
Where is Master Chen?

79
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,170
I need to see him.

80
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,960
Why did you come back alone?

81
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,890
Where's Nongyu?

82
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,480
Don't ask.

83
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,800
Where is Master Chen?

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,080
The master is meeting with guests.

85
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,880
Let me ask you.

86
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,100
What about Jieniu?

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,680
Jieniu?

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,780
Master sent Jieniu to follow you.

89
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,020
Didn't you see him?

90
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,000
Master sent Jieniu to follow us?

91
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,440
I was following Nongyu and the undercover agent.

92
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,840
Jieniu was following me.

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,220
This shows distrust in me.

94
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,610
Master Chen!

95
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,970
I need to see you!

96
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,560
I told you the master is with guests.

97
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:53,960
Master Chen!

98
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,480
Did you hear me?

99
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,210
Master Chen!

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,930
Who's making all that noise out there?

101
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,970
Master Chen.

102
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,440
I heard that

103
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,640
you sent Jieniu to follow me.

104
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,920
You're doubting my loyalty, aren't you?

105
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,040
How could that be?

106
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,560
Back then,

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,130
when you brought me Feng Jianye's head

108
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,640
along with his precious sword,

109
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,400
I knew you would always be loyal to me.

110
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
Young Master Su,

111
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,320
did you hear that?

112
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,920
That's the origin of the precious sword Yulinxun.

113
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,920
Just now,

114
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,980
you were questioning its authenticity.

115
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,159
Now you should believe it, right?

116
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,880
I see now.

117
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,920
Li Ling.

118
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,250
Yes, sir.

119
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,500
Pay your respects to Young Master Su,

120
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,690
the leader of the Eighteen Bandits of Guantian Society.

121
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,040
Greetings, Master Su.

122
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,970
No need for that.

123
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,600
Actually, we just met outside the city.

124
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,240
We almost came to blows.

125
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,480
He mistook me for Tang soldiers.

126
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,340
Fortunately, I reacted quickly.

127
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,020
Otherwise,

128
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,600
I wouldn't be meeting Master Chen today.

129
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,860
Who would have thought

130
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,680
we're actually on the same side.

131
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,740
Indeed.

132
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,530
I was pursuing Nongyu and that undercover agent.

133
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,040
But unexpectedly encountered Tang soldiers on the way.

134
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,770
They were about to be captured.

135
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,880
I fought desperately to save them.

136
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,140
But I was outnumbered.

137
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,440
I barely managed to fight my way out.

138
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,290
Then I ran into Young Master Su.

139
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,880
At that time, I thought

140
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,940
they were Tang soldiers in disguise.

141
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,600
So I made a move against them.

142
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,570
How dare you!

143
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,940
Do you know who Young Master Su is?

144
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,460
How dare you be so bold!

145
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,000
Apologize now!

146
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,440
Enough, enough.

147
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,080
What can I say? I, Su Changming, am magnanimous as the sea

148
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,210
and tolerant of all.

149
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,720
I'll let it go.

150
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,290
Thank you, Young Master Su.

151
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:02,980
Li Ling,

152
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,530
where is Nongyu?

153
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,120
The situation was critical.

154
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,480
I couldn't save her in time.

155
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,010
She might have been captured by the Tang army.

156
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,880
Captured by the Tang army?

157
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,940
Alright, alright.

158
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,640
They're all useless.

159
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,860
I'll find another way to deal with Nongyu's situation.

160
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,440
Li Ling,

161
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
you may leave now.

162
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Yes, Master Chen.

163
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,490
Young Master Su,

164
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,250
please come with me.

165
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,360
You want me to rescue that woman from the Tang army.

166
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,400
This woman is highly skilled in medicine.

167
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,960
If I lose her,

168
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,960
when my migraines strike,

169
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,720
it could be fatal.

170
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,940
I can only blame

171
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,000
that my men are all useless.

172
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,600
Unlike your Guantian Society,

173
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,850
which is brave and invincible.

174
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,000
Sir Chen,

175
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,540
you're trying to test me, aren't you?

176
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,120
Not at all.

177
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,400
I'm simply asking for your help.

178
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,460
You're asking for quite a lot.

179
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,120
You want me to fight the Tang army and defend Chang'an,

180
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,919
and now you want me to rescue a woman too.

181
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,320
No matter how I look at it, it's not worth it.

182
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,160
Since we're working together,

183
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,000
how could I let you do all the work alone?

184
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,450
You have the men,

185
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,240
I have the map.

186
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,320
If I bring her back,

187
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,720
you can take the Night Firefly Map

188
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,540
and enjoy it as you please.

189
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,640
Good,

190
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,680
it's a deal.

191
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,200
Li Ling.

192
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,360
I just saved your life.

193
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,840
How are you going to thank me?

194
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,840
That old bastard approached you

195
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,930
because he wants to use you as a pawn

196
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,560
to defend Chang'an, right?

197
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,080
Smart.

198
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
That old eunuch's infighting killed Wei Cheng.

199
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,720
Now that disaster is coming,

200
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,520
he wants my men as cannon fodder.

201
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,600
He's treating

202
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,780
the eighteen bandit groups of Guantian Society

203
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
like beggars.

204
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,890
Did you say that to his face?

205
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,480
No.

206
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,480
I agreed to his terms.

207
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,480
The exchange is for the Night Firefly Map.

208
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,480
Thanks to you,

209
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,340
we can't count on Nongyu anymore.

210
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,520
According to her,

211
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,360
I need to rely on my own abilities.

212
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,320
But guess what?

213
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,020
To test my abilities, that old eunuch

214
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,330
actually made another demand:

215
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,720
to bring Nongyu back.

216
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,480
Isn't that ridiculous?

217
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,200
So what do you plan to do?

218
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
I've said before,

219
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,330
both the woman and the sword

220
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,520
will be mine.

221
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,170
But you wouldn't believe me

222
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,360
and bet your life against me.

223
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,080
Now I want to see

224
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,010
how you're going to win.

225
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,240
You never exposed me.

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,720
Actually,

227
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,080
you were just waiting

228
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,400
to see what terms I might offer, right?

229
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,530
Whatever the terms,

230
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,560
both the woman and the sword will be mine.

231
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,490
I could reveal your true identity to that old eunuch.

232
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,600
Just imagine,

233
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,210
would he flay you alive?

234
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,800
I could also tell Nongyu

235
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,650
about how you betrayed your master for glory.

236
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,200
Guess how she would react?

237
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,700
No matter the outcome of this bet,

238
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,600
you're bound to lose.

239
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,040
If I were you,

240
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,140
I would return both Nongyu

241
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,360
and the sword.

242
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,330
Perhaps if I'm pleased,

243
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,660
I'll let you take a look at the map,

244
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,040
fulfilling your final wish before you die.

245
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,970
If you've made up your mind,

246
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,600
come to Zuixiang Tower where there are flowers and wine

247
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,320
and find me.

248
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,840
Yiyu.

249
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,120
Xie Zheng.

250
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:18,640
Xiaoke.

251
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,920
Xie Zheng.

252
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,000
Kang Sunrui.

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,720
Yan Zhirui.

254
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,160
Ying.

255
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,720
Yinglu.

256
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,000
Wang Linwang.

257
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,800
Yinglu.

258
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Wang Linwang.

259
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,160
Tong Liu.

260
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Hao Xiao.

261
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,880
Li Zhang.

262
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,440
Jia Ningao Jia.

263
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,160
Jia Ningtao Jia Yingxi.

264
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:48,520

265
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,400

267
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,520

268
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,160
Assistant Li.

269
00:12:59,560 --> 00:12:59,560
Li.

270
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,840
Li.

271
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,680
Sheng Lanfeng Tao.

272

273
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,720
Public Limited.
