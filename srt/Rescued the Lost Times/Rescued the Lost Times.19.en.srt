1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
[Danger]

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,560
How could the Tang army react so quickly?

3
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,290
Where is my headache medicine?

4
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,080
Nongyu.

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,700
Master.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,930
You sent Nongyu to catch the spies.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
Jieniu.

8
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,160
Li Ling.

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,220
Master.

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,640
None of them have returned yet.

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:05,960
Go

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,400
and bring them back to me.

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,410
The situation in Chang'an is about to change.

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,960
What's the use of catching a few spies?

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,920
Hurry up!

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,360
Yes.

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,759
Nongyu

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,360
You're awake.

19
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,570
It's still snowing.

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,650
Here.

21
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:45,440
Put this on quickly so you don't catch cold.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,640
Li Ling

23
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,170
I've made up my mind.

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,440
From today on,

25
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,940
there will be no more secrets between us.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,980
Listen carefully.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,760
My real name is Feng Yinniang.

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,600
My father was General Feng Jianye of the Great Tang.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,320
Li Ling.

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,440
Li Ling.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,640
Go ahead, do it.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,280
General Feng.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
You're Feng Jianye's daughter.

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,120
You know him?

35
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,040
I don't know him personally.

36
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:34,880
I...

37
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,579
I've only heard of him.

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,560
General Feng's entire life,

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,440
he was skilled in both civil and military affairs,

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,300
utterly loyal,

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,320
defeated the Jieshi,

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,579
conquered the Dabolü,

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,360
achieved glorious military victories throughout his life,

44
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,960
and rarely suffered defeat.

45
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
He's someone I admire most.

46
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,290
Rarely suffered defeat...

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,480
Yes.

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,200
My father's greatest defeat

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
was being betrayed by that traitor.

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,380
The rebel An took advantage and captured Tongguan.

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,640
The court didn't investigate thoroughly,

52
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,240
but falsely accused my father of treason,

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
ordered his execution,

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,900
and condemned our entire family.

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,720
My father served Tang loyally his whole life,

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,120
with absolute devotion,

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,280
yet this was his fate.

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,840
How could his spirit ever rest in peace?

59
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
My poor mother

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,329
and my fourteen-year-old brother

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:34,960
were hacked to death

62
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,160
by countless blades.

63
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,640
Perhaps heaven took pity on me,

64
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
I escaped death

65
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,240
and survived.

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,010
Loneliness,

67
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,240
despair,

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,480
fear,

69
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,560
the darkest nights,

70
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,320
the bitterest medicine,

71
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,920
the most unbearable nights,

72
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,170
I survived them all.

73
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,690
The Feng Yinniang standing before you now

74
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,200
may be covered in wounds,

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,640
but is also unbreakable.

76
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
I will definitely find

77
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,520
my father's true murderer.

78
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,400
I will have him sliced into pieces

79
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,460
and torn to shreds.

80
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,290
To avenge my mother,

81
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,960
my father,

82
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,120
and Xiaochuan.

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
I already have a lead.

84
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,200
I found my father's precious sword,

85
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,880
Yu Linxun.

86
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,840
Yu Linxun is known as the world's most extraordinary blade.

87
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,600
My father loved it dearly and never parted with it.

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,240
This time,

89
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,900
it somehow ended up in Su Changming's hands.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,080
There must be something suspicious about this.

91
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,120
I joined the Guantian Society

92
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,240
and entered the Chen household

93
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,360
because I had an agreement with Su Changming.

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
Once I obtain the Night Firefly Painting,

95
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,159
he will tell me

96
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,440
who really killed my father.

97
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,520
I understand.

98
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,280
This is undoubtedly like asking a tiger for its skin.

99
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,010
I know you're worried about me.

100
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,450
I've made up my mind now.

101
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,080
I'm with you.

102
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,840
From now on, your path is my path.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,930
Just as you said,

104
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,040
it's not just for the people,

105
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,960
but also for us.

106
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,650
I will do everything in my power

107
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,640
to help you reclaim the Tang Dynasty

108
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,900
and restore Chang'an.

109
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,040
Yu Linxun.

110
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Stop right there.

111
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,800
You touched my sword.

112
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,360
Forgive me, General.

113
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
I don't know what came over me.

114
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,680
I was momentarily possessed

115
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,540
and defiled your precious sword.

116
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,360
Boy,

117
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,640
I've been watching you for a long time.

118
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,320
You've had your eye on my sword

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,200
for quite some time now.

120
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,360
Do you know how to use a sword?

121
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,290
I wouldn't dare.

122
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,700
Show me a few moves.

123
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,080
Do you know why it's called Yu Linxun?

124
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,520
Those who master blades prevail

125
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,620
because of their unyielding spirit.

126
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,360
Since you admire it,

127
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,020
you should at least

128
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,159
have the courage worthy of such admiration.

129
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,120
Take it.

130
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,720
Stand up.

131
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,520
Having no will to win

132
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,280
is no different from surrender.

133
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,160
Your strikes are hesitant and indecisive.

134
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,600
Again.

135
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,160
I'm standing before you now.

136
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,640
I am your enemy.

137
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,960
Boy,

138
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,200
use whatever skills you have.

139
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,080
How is this possible?

140
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,800
You must be wondering,

141
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,320
even though you used all your strength,

142
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,520
how Yu Linxun

143
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,460
could be knocked away with just one move.

144
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,659
Remember this:

145
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,720
A true sword

146
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,740
is not in your hand,

147
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,360
but here

148
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,880
and here.

149
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,600
As long as you put your whole heart

150
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,200
into the blade,

151
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,160
truly clear your mind of distractions

152
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,180
and become one with the sword,

153
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
any sword in this world

154
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,080
can be called Yu Linxun.

155
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,560
Boy,

156
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
what's your name?

157
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,640
What's your position in the army?

158
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,880
In response to the General,

159
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,810
my elder brother

160
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,580
was a deserter.

161
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,080
I was demoted to become a Buliangren,

162
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,480
unworthy of a name in the army.

163
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,320
I am...

164
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,570
a stable boy.

165
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,520
Then you've been taking care

166
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,420
of my Zhaoyebai very well.

167
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,410
Let me tell you a secret.

168
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,480
When I was serving

169
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,600
the General of the Imperial Guards,

170
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,760
I not only fixed horseshoes

171
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,200
but also picked up horse dung.

172
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
It stank terribly!

173
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,000
Boy, remember this:

174
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,360
In life,

175
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,160
what you become

176
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,440
is not determined by your birth.

177
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,360
It's not for others to decide.

178
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,480
It's always in your own hands.

179
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,640
Good kid.

180
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,320
Now,

181
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,640
you should tell me your name.

182
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
My name is Li Ling.

183
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,090
You're from Guantian Society.

184
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,320
This area outside the city is so desolate.

185
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm afraid food will be hard to find.

186
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,450
What a gentle voice.

187
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,040
Could she be waiting for a lover?

188
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,570
Why is it you?

189
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,420
What's with that expression?

190
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,040
The lover you're waiting for,

191
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,880
isn't it me?

192
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,000
Nongyu, oh Nongyu.

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,960
Until today,

194
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,720
we haven't seen each other for three whole months.

195
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,890
I thought you would miss me.

196
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,090
But instead, you've come up with something quite original.

197
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Giving me such a grand welcome gift.

198
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Give it back to me.

199
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,240
Why don't you tell me,

200
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,960
how it feels to use the sky as your blanket

201
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,680
and the ground as your bed?

202
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,810
I don't recall giving you such an assignment.

203
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,880
My affairs are none of your business.

204
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Don't forget you belong to Guantian Society,

205
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,540
you are mine, Su Changming's.

206
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,560
I've been going crazy with restraint,

207
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,360
haven't even dared to touch you.

208
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,810
Yet you're out here looking for other men.

209
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,680
So the great young master of Guantian Society

210
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,210
only knows how to use force.

211
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,560
And you kept saying

212
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,580
you would win my heart and make me willingly submit.

213
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,120
Is this your method?

214
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,140
Who is that man anyway?

215
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,480
Who is it?

216
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Stop right there!

217
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,050
What's going on?

218
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,700
Nongyu.

219
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,720
Li Ling.

220
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,880
Yin Niang.

221
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,370
Are you alright?

222
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,000
I was wondering who it might be.

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
So it's an old acquaintance.

224
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,120
Meeting an old friend in a foreign land.

225
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,720
What a wonderful coincidence!

226
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,050
Come,

227
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,050
give me a hug.

228
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,770
Li Ling, you'll never catch me!

229
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm a soldier, you're a bandit.

230
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,260
We have no friendship between us.

231
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,120
See that?

232
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,680
So heartless.

233
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,720
Your taste in men is terrible.

234
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,760
You!

235
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,120
Years ago, I spared your life by luck,

236
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,440
which was already a great mercy.

237
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,080
I never expected that not only would you not repent,

238
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,210
but you'd become even more shameless.

239
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,020
My level of shamelessness

240
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,010
certainly can't compare to yours.

241
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,040
I've heard that

242
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,060
one moment you were a Tang army foot soldier,

243
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,960
and the next you became Chen Jingbian's watchdog.

244
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,240
Nongyu,

245
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,280
this man changes sides faster than turning pages.

246
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,800
He's clearly a heartless man.

247
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,930
It's not too late for you to regret now.

248
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,360
Xie Zheng

249
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:20,920
Kang Rui

250
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,200
Zhi Rui

251
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,930
Kang Sun Wang

252
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,240

253
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:24,880
Wang Lin Wang

254
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,200
Wang Lin

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,960
Wang Lin Wang

256
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Ying Lu

257
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,080
Tong Liu

258
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,040
Hao Xiao

259
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,360
Li Li Zhang

260
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,360
Jia Jianing Tao Jiaying Xi Dourong

261
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:46,960

262
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,080
Jia Jianing Tao Jiaying

263
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,540
Jia Jianing Tao Jiaying Xi Dourong Jingshou

264
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,920
Assistant.

265
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,800
Assistant.

266
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,960
Li Sheng Lanfeng Tao.

267
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,520
Sheng Lanfeng Tao.
