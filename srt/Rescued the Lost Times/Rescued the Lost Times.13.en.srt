1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Wei.

2
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,480
Li Ling.

3
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,880
Stop fighting.

4
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,680
Stop fighting. Let's go!

5
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,280
Let's go!

6
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,240
Sir, you go first.

7
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,640
Li Ling.

8
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,320
We need to settle our score.

9
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,850
We need to settle our score.

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,360
You're taking advantage of my situation.

11
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Do you even choose your time to kill?

12
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,600
Li Ling.

13
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,840
Go.

14
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,140
Back to the courtyard.

15
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,840
What's going on here?

16
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,660
Isn't this Officer Li?

17
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,920
Li Ling.

18
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,800
Li Ling.

19
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,160
Li Ling.

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,820
Li Ling.

21
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,240
You're awake.

22
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,740
Li Ling.

23
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,220
Li Ling.

24
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,300
Li Ling.

25
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,360
Li Ling.

26
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,320
So much blood.

27
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,040
I'm afraid he won't make it.

28
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,720
Indeed.

29
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,160
It's terrifying.

30
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,440
Such severe injuries.

31
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,160
Everyone get out of the way!

32
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,600
These wounds are serious.

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,530
Don't you have eyes? Stop gawking!

34
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:48,980
Li Ling.

35
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,079
Greetings, Master Chen.

36
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,000
How did this happen?

37
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,850
Are you alright?

38
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,280
I'm fine.

39
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,920
Thank you for your concern.

40
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,780
What about him?

41
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,560
Is he alright?

42
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,040
Master, you pray to Buddha with sincerity.

43
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,160
Surely the Bodhisattva will protect us.

44
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,320
As your servants,

45
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
we too shall overcome difficulties

46
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
and turn misfortune into blessing.

47
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,180
Use the best medicine available.

48
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,760
Spare no expense.

49
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,400
You must save Clerk Li's life.

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,100
Nongyu will do everything possible.

51
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,020
Li Ling.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,520
Li Ling.

53
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,890
Sister Shiyuan.

54
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,560
Do you know what's going on

55
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,690
between Nongyu and Officer Li?

56
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
How would I know?

57
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360
Speaking of our boss.

58
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,440
He really is something.

59
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,280
Just him alone

60
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,840
taking on the entire guard station.

61
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Isn't that right?

62
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,280
If it weren't for Officer Li

63
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,080
and that Nongyu,

64
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,940
he'd probably be in grave danger.

65
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,320
But for a woman,

66
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,800
do you think it's worth it?

67
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,320
Exactly.

68
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,840
You just don't understand.

69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,800
This is called following each other in life and death when love runs deep.

70
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
Nongyu is so lucky.

71
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,400
Yes, indeed.

72
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,300
I don't understand these things either.

73
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,920
Sir.

74
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,260
How's it going?

75
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,480
The Wei family's gates are tightly closed.

76
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,740
We're still investigating the details.

77
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,760
They must be seriously injured.

78
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Someone might even die.

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,200
If Wei hadn't suffered a major defeat,

80
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,400
with his temper,

81
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,520
he would be yelling

82
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,720
and coming here to settle scores by now.

83
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,000
Go now.

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes.

85
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,620
I never thought Li Ling

86
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
would be so ruthless.

87
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,340
He's certainly given me quite a problem.

88
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,920
Let's pin everything we've done

89
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,280
on Li Ling alone.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,860
Once he's dead,

91
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,560
everything will be over.

92
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,770
I'll tell them right now

93
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,320
to stop treating him.

94
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,680
Come back.

95
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,600
After all, he's brought prestige to our Chen family.

96
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,280
This dog who's earned respect,

97
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,480
if you don't save him,

98
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,320
who else will be your dog in the future?

99
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,200
Save him however you can.

100
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,060
We'll figure something out with the Wei family.

101
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,680
Yes.

102
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720
You're awake.

103
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,410
How are you feeling?

104
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,320
Yan Bo.

105
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,520
What?

106
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,000
Yan Bo.

107
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,640
I saw Yan Bo.

108
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,280
I know who you are now.

109
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,400
Yan Bo told me earlier

110
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,409
to protect you at all costs.

111
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,970
Why are you here?

112
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,440
After what happened today,

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,260
I'm worried about you.

114
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
It's all my fault.

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,440
Yes,

116
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,330
I'm the one who harmed them.

117
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,900
How can this be your fault?

118
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
You had no choice.

119
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,050
Did you see how Li looked today?

120
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,100
If I hadn't told Wei Cheng,

121
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,540
they wouldn't have arrested Nongyu.

122
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,280
Li Ling

123
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,530
wouldn't have gone to save her.

124
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,570
If it's not my fault,

125
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,780
then whose fault is it?

126
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,490
But if you hadn't done this,

127
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,760
Wei Cheng would have killed you anyway.

128
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,040
Even if not for yourself,

129
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,290
you need to think about Rui'er.

130
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,520
Rui'er...

131
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,260
My dear Rui'er.

132
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,320
My son and I

133
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,240
will eventually be killed by Wei Cheng.

134
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,820
But when that happens,

135
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
who will save me?

136
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,679
I will.

137
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,330
I will save you both.

138
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,840
I wish I could be like Li,

139
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,620
storm into Wei's mansion,

140
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,600
rescue Rui'er,

141
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,960
and set you free.

142
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,800
Yan Bei told me

143
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,780
that you joined the Guantian Society

144
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
to seek revenge.

145
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,640
No.

146
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,530
There are things

147
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,320
I must say now.

148
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
I've had dealings

149
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,210
with the Guantian Society before.

150
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,680
I know better than anyone

151
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,780
what they're really like.

152
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,780
Nongyu.

153
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,650
Yan Bei has been worried about you.

154
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,320
No matter how the Guantian Society threatens you,

155
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,520
I want you to know that

156
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,920
whatever you seek,

157
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,240
I can help you achieve it.

158
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,820
But you can barely protect yourself now.

159
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:47,920
No,

160
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,560
I'm not alone.

161
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,960
Behind me

162
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,170
is the entire Tang Dynasty.

163
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,460
I am a Tang soldier.

164
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,000
I've been undercover in the Chen household for years,

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,880
all for the day

166
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,080
when Tang forces reclaim Chang'an.

167
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,020
I didn't know about your background before,

168
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,880
so I was cautious around you.

169
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,360
But things are different now.

170
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,840
Nongyu.

171
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,480
From now on,

172
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,290
will you let me help you?

173
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,620
You say you're with the Tang army.

174
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,400
Not just me.

175
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,540
Zhuang Yao,

176
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,120
A'qi,

177
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,090
they're all Tang soldiers.

178
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,320
I'm grateful for your rescue.

179
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,560
But I won't join your restoration army.

180
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,640
I would rather join the Guantian Society

181
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,480
than join you.

182
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,000
Why?

183
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,820
We've been through so much together.

184
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,240
I thought you would understand my feelings, Nongyu.

185
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,700
My name isn't even Nongyu.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,960
You don't need to know my real name.

187
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,080
There are many things I didn't tell Yanbo.

188
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,740
I was afraid of burdening him.

189
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
But I can tell you this.

190
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,890
My entire family

191
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,400
was killed by your Tang army.

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,320
Suppressing rebellion.

193
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,120
Restoration.

194
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,020
None of that means anything to me.

195
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,330
Because my family is already dead.

196
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,780
My only purpose for living

197
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,400
is revenge.

198
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,000
And your beloved Great Tang

199
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,160
is the culprit.

200
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,600
From today on,

201
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,120
you go your way,

202
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,640
I'll go mine.

203
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,880
We're destined to walk different paths.

204
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,360
I only hope that in the future,

205
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,320
we won't become enemies.

206
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,840
Nongyu!

210
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,160
colluded with enemies and betrayed the country,

211
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,640
intended to obstruct imperial civilization,

212
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,800
intended to obstruct the great imperial mission,

213
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,680
attempted to create chaos in the peaceful state,

214
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,880
must be eliminated,

215
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,240
with no pardon.

216
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,840
No pardon.
