1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Sir

2
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,680
Sir.

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,519
This man's pulse is weak,

4
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,560
he's lost too much blood,

5
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,960
and his internal organs are damaged.

6
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,080
If this continues,

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,860
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

8
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,520
He cannot die.

9
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,760
I'm missing some medicines from my kit.

10
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,690
I'll go get them.

11
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Hurry back.

12
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,560
Isn't this Clerk Li?

13
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,650
Why come here in such an injured state?

14
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,240
You want to interrogate prisoners too?

15
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,500
Are you trying to compete with me for credit?

16
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,280
It's a critical time with undercover agents being caught.

17
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,040
I fear someone might take advantage of the situation.

18
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,240
Just came to inspect.

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,480
Inspect, you say.

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,490
No wonder the master likes you.

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,580
I've only been gone for a few days.

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,280
I heard you went alone

23
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,210
to the Wei mansion to kill someone.

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,970
Speaking of who's most prominent in the mansion now,

25
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,920
it would be you, Clerk Li.

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,320
That's only because the master has my back.

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,620
Whoever slaps the Chen family's face

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,200
is asking for death.

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,500
Bold words.

30
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,200
Not only does the master like you,

31
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,000
I like you too.

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,280
I also heard

33
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,480
the master offered you beauties but you declined.

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
I serve the master

35
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,290
and dare not be distracted.

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,040
So you're focused on climbing the ladder.

37
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,420
How about this,

38
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,460
why don't you try sitting in my position?

39
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,250
I wouldn't dare.

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,840
Manager Xie has worked hard with great talent and strategy.

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,370
I can only admire from afar.

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,080
Moreover, in the future,

43
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
I'll need your guidance and support.

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,200
Of course.

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,320
Hurry up.

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,250
Move faster.

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,640
Hurry.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,079
Manager! Manager! Manager!

49
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,560
Don't hit me!

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,800
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,920
It's just a child.

52
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,680
I'll wash the dirty clothes.

53
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,290
I'll treat you to tea later.

54
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,079
Tea! Tea!

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,920
No food for you today.

56
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
You'll go hungry.

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,400
Thank you.

58
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,040
You look just like your mother.

59
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,680
Do you know my mother?

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,520
Then where is my mother?

61
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,880
The eighth day, 1-3 a.m.

62
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,720
Back door of Wei Mansion.

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,200
The eighth day.

64
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,720
Rui.

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,920
Mother.

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,600
Mother, come.

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,200
Rui.

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,860
We can't stay here.

69
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,320
You need to leave now.

70
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,280
Where should we go?

71
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Anywhere is fine.

72
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,650
As long as the three of us are together.

73
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,210
Let's go.

74
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Stop right there!

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,440
I wondered who it was.

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,040
Sneaking around in the middle of the night.

77
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,400
So it's you plotting from within.

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Trying to escape?

79
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,320
Pang Shiyuan.

80
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,040
Come with me to see Lord Wei.

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,760
Let's see how he'll take your life.

82
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,400
Seize them!

83
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,800
Yes!

84
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,960
What are you doing?

85
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,560
Let him go!

86
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,220
Don't move!

87
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,600
Let me go!

88
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,280
What are you doing?

89
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,000
Let me go!

90
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,460
Mother! Manager Wang!

91
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,570
I'm begging you.

92
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,610
Please spare us.

93
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,920
Spare you?

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,930
On what grounds?

95
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
Manager Wang.

96
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,400
If you're willing to let me go.

97
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,720
I...

98
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
I'll do anything.

99
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,170
Wang Cong, if you have the guts, come after me.

100
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,440
Fine!

101
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,440
2 taels.

102
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,520
Three.

103
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,280
Four.

104
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Doctor Yu is here.

105
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,720
The medicine you requested last time

106
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,650
has been prepared for you already.

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,530
These medicines

108
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,659
are all of the strongest potency.

109
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,650
This one is especially potent.

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,130
A-Qi won't be able to hold out much longer.

111
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,450
Then I must ask for your guidance, Mr. Zhuang.

112
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,240
No need for formalities.

113
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,520
If Doctor Yu

114
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
doesn't want the patient to suffer,

115
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
just prescribe the right medicine.

116
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,440
Don't forget,

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,720
A-Qi

118
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,560
also knows your secrets.

119
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,730
Miss Nongyu, are you ready?

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,860
The master is waiting and we can't afford any delay.

121
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,610
Yes, yes.

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
Treating the illness is urgent.

123
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,440
Doctor Yu,

124
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,120
the cost of these medicines

125
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,650
I've added to your account.

126
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,920
Take care on your way.

127
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,200
Li Congshi.

128
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,680
Li Congshi.

129
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,760
This poison is colorless and odorless.

130
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,480
In less than half an hour,

131
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,800
it will cause bleeding from all orifices and death.

132
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,200
I don't care how you do it,

133
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,800
or where you put it.

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,530
The point is,

135
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,480
I want Li Ling dead.

136
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,360
After it's done,

137
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,690
I'll release your pretty boy and your son.

138
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
But if you fail,

139
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,720
I'll hand all of you over to Lord Wei.

140
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,040
You!

141
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,040
Let go of me!

142
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,730
Why are you grabbing me?

143
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,960
Let me go!

144
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Are you crazy?

145
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,840
There are so many eyes watching in this mansion.

146
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,970
Don't you know that?

147
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,800
Since the day of our arranged marriage,

148
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,280
there have been so many people gossiping.

149
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,200
Let them talk.

150
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,340
Nongyu.

151
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,160
No.

152
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,420
Although I don't know your real name.

154
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,920
I don't know

155
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,920
what happened to your family

156
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,559
or why they died at the hands of the Tang army.

157
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,559
But I promise you.

158
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,370
I will report to the imperial court

159
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,450
to clear your family's name

160
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,210
and bring justice for them.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,930
If this is all you wanted to tell me,

162
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,040
then I have nothing to say to you.

163
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,410
But A-Qi is still...

164
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
A-Qi is still in their hands.

165
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,820
We need to figure out a way.

166
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,980
Your solution?

167
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,320
Calling me here is your brilliant plan?

168
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,120
Look.

169
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,020
When you made me drug A-Qi,

170
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,170
that was Zhuang Yao's idea.

171
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,480
You're just the same.

172
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,810
You're all the same.

173
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,680
All you Tang soldiers are alike.

174
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,610
You make me sick.

175
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,650
He may be a Tang soldier,

176
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,170
but he's still A-Qi!

177
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,040
The year I met Qi,

178
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,130
he was only 13 years old.

179
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,250
All these years,

180
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,780
we've entrusted our lives to each other.

181
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,880
We're brothers who fought together

182
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,320
through fire and blood.

183
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,930
But now he's in trouble,

184
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,840
suffering endless torture,

185
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,040
yet he never revealed

186
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
a single word about us.

187
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,660
No matter who it is,

188
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,360
I absolutely won't allow

189
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,760
anyone to hurt him again.

190
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,720
Even if I have to kill everyone in the Chen household,

191
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,320
I'll fight a bloody path to rescue him.

192
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,180
Nongyu.

193
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,280
Qi and I need you.

194
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,920
If

195
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,360
you were a selfish person,

196
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,530
you would never help others again.

197
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,650
In these chaotic times,

198
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,290
with so much hatred and suffering,

199
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,400
Yan chose to save you.

200
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,120
And you

201
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,680
chose to save others.

202
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,500
For no other reason

203
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,600
than one:

204
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,770
your true heart.

205
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,160
I believe in your memory,

206
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,820
there must still be the original glory of the Tang Dynasty.

207
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,120
The world today

208
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,720
is not what it once was.

209
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,420
People like Chen Jingbian

210
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,280
and Wei Cheng

211
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,640
corrupt officials in power,

212
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,900
disrupting the court,

213
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,600
bringing disaster to the country,

214
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,440
causing suffering to the people.

215
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,970
They are the real culprits.

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,400
They are the ones most deserving of hatred.

217
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,490
But people like you,

218
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,160
me,

219
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,480
and Qi,

220
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,160
though we have little power,

221
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,400
we can gather sand to build a tower.

222
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,860
Together we stand strong.

223
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,880
As long as we have the will

224
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,290
and take action,

225
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,480
I believe

226
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,600
we can restore

227
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,490
the glorious Tang Dynasty.

228
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,720
Don't drink it.

229
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,280
Who

230
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,520
is it?

231
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:37,960
Wait.

232
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,560
I mean

233
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,850
there's poison in that tea.

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,560
Don't kill me. Please don't.

235
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,320
Spare me.

236
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,690
Be quiet.

237
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,680
Just answer what I ask you.

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Did you hear that?

239
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,180
Who told you to poison?

240
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Who sent you here?

241
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,600
It was

242
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,160
someone from the Wei Mansion.

243
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,090
It was Wang Cong.

244
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,120
I never intended to kill anyone.

245
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,980
Officer Li.

246
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,250
I truly never meant to kill you.

247
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,680
Nongyu.

248
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,640
It was all my fault before.

249
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,770
I failed to recognize your true value.

250
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,250
Please be magnanimous.

251
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,280
Please forgive me, will you?

252
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,210
So everything we just said,

253
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,810
you heard it all.

254
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,360
Then you can't stay here.

255
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Don't kill me, please don't kill me.

256
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,080
What I mean is,

257
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
you can't stay in Chang'an anymore.

258
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,640
Okay.

259
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,650
Alright.

260
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,040
No,

261
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,320
I can't leave.

262
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,240
I have nowhere else to go.

263
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,640
Still trying to bargain?

264
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,720
I really can't leave.

265
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,000
My son and Tong Luan

266
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,400
are still in their hands.

267
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,240
If

268
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,010
if I don't do as they say,

269
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,920
all three of us will die.

270
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
I can't leave.

271
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,760
Xie Zheng.

272
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,680
Kang Sun Wang.

273
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:34,840
Kang Zhirui.

274
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,570
Kang Sunrui.

275
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,840
Wang Linwang.

276
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,160
Ying Lu.

277
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Lin Wang.

278
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,820
Ying Beitu.

279
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Wang Linwang.

280
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:41,880
Tong Liu.

281
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,440
Hao Xiao.

282
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,010
Hao Xiao.

283
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Tong Liu.

284
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,200
Li Zhang.

285
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,520
Li.

286
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,640
Li Zhang.

287
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,680
Liu Wang.

288
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,240
Liu Wangliu

289
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,840
Jia Jianing Tao.

290
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,400
Jia Jianing Tao, Jia Yingxi, Dou Rongjingshou.

291
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:01,840

292
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,330
Jia Jianing Tao, Jia Yingxi, Dou Rongjingshou Peng.

293

294
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,000
Assistant Li.

295
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,480
Li Shenglan Fengtao

296
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,540
Shenglan Fengtao.

297
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,560
Gong Xian.

298
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,240
Gong Xian.

299
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,520
Xian.
