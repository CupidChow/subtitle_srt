1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Wei.

2
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,200
What should we do now?

3
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,400
Now Su Changming has also gotten involved.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,200
Things are getting more and more complicated.

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,160
I told you long ago

6
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,760
that woman can't be trusted.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,920
However,

8
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,040
he didn't tell Chen Jingbian

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,480
about your deception.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,880
That means there's still room to maneuver.

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,810
I'll figure something out.

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,610
What are you going to do?

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,050
Don't do anything rash.

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,820
The simplest solution now

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,880
is to hand over both the person and the sword to Su Changming.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,520
We might even be able to use him

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,120
to get the Night Firefly Map.

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,620
Li Ling.

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,200
Hey.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,160
Are you even listening to me?

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,240
The Tang army is about to enter Chang'an City!

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,600
The Tang army is entering Chang'an City!

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,620
The Tang army is entering Chang'an City!

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,140
The Tang army is entering Chang'an City!

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Don't run so fast!

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,280
Sister! Yu!

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,680
Sister, someone's coming!

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,320
Yezi, come here.

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,280
Don't be afraid.

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,080
He's my friend

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,770
and he's with the Tang army.

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,880
Why are you standing there?

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,759
Come in quickly. We're having saozi noodles today.

34
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,160
No help, no food for you.

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,200
All right.

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,640
Come on, try my cooking.

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,920
How is it? Tasty?

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,480
Delicious!

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,920
Eat slowly.

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,890
It's so good!

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,880
I love

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,540
these saozi noodles you make.

43
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,970
If you like them,

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,880
I'll make them for you every day.

45
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,720
Nonsense!

46
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,079
You're my deputy commander now,

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,280
not some cook.

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,900
Use that time to train soldiers instead.

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,130
Yes, sir.

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,250
You haven't taken a wife yet, have you?

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,280
Not yet.

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,040
I've thought of a perfect solution.

53
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,840
I have a daughter named Yinniang.

54
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,240
Though she has a bit of a temper,

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,080
she's quite beautiful,

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,450
and very clever too.

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,680
Whoever marries her will be a lucky man.

58
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,360
If you have what it takes to win her over,

59
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,000
then I could enjoy these noodles every day.

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,180
Think about it.

61
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,079
All right.

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,770
I suddenly feel these noodles smell even better now.

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,360
This time when you went back,

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
it's fortunate that Chen Jingbian didn't suspect you.

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,880
By the way, what about me?

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,500
What does he plan to do?

67
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,700
Has he sent anyone to find you?

68
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Even if he doesn't look for me,

69
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll find a way to go back.

70
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,370
After all, he can't stop taking his medicine.

71
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,760
By the way,

72
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,970
did you notice the color at the bottom of his eyes?

73
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,120
The color of his eyes?

74
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,240
I didn't notice that.

75
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,760
Why?

76
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,400
It seems it's not time yet,

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,220
otherwise the whites of his eyes should be noticeably yellow.

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,320
I didn't tell you before,

79
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,420
I tampered with his medicine.

80
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,840
I've been controlling the dosage to avoid detection.

81
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,140
You mean...

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,520
I was worried that even if we got the Firefly Map,

83
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,000
it would be hard to tell if it's real.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,529
So you're controlling him with the medicine.

85
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,440
According to my calculations,

86
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,040
it should be almost time now.

87
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:21,920
I see.

88
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,320
You've planned everything.

89
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,800
Thank you.

90
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,880
Yin Niang.

91
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,040
Young Master.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,040
That Li Ling,

93
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,120
he won't be causing trouble behind our backs, will he?

94
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,320
It's too late for him to do anything now.

95
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,360
They're already like meat

96
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,560
on a chopping board, ready to be sliced.

97
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
Young Master, a letter has arrived.

98
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,020
You see?

99
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,220
They still have to come begging to me.

100
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,640
Miss Yu.

101
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,450
Here's the medicine prepared for you.

102
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,490
Please wait.

103
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,920
When we rescued Qi the other day,

104
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,260
I spoke inappropriately.

105
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,520
Please don't take it to heart, Miss Yu.

106
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,480
You're too kind, Mr. Zhuang.

107
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,360
Wait.

108
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,920
Is there something else?

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,360
Li Ling.

110
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,640
Has he told you anything?

111
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,240
Told me what?

112
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,880
I knew it.

113
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,920
It would be like this.

114
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,100
Mr. Zhuang,

115
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,760
has something happened?

116
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,720
Li Ling is just like that.

117
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,890
No matter what happens,

118
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,640
he always bears it alone.

119
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,320
Chen Jingbian was the one who summoned Su Changming.

120
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,080
Su Changming

121
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,960
is just a profit-seeking opportunist.

122
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
To obtain the Night Firefly Scroll,

123
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,240
he has agreed to help Chen Jingbian hold Chang'an.

124
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,340
When that happens,

125
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,860
there will surely be another bloodbath.

126
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,120
The Tang soldiers

127
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,650
and countless civilians in the city will suffer and die.

128
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,340
Miss Nongyu

129
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,820
what are

130
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,040
you doing?

131
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,640
As a secret agent of the imperial court,

132
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
I've spent half my life undercover.

133
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,680
Now when our nation is in peril,

134
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,880
I've been given this critical mission.

135
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,440
I've weathered many storms before

136
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,520
and survived them all on my own.

137
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
But this time,

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,520
this crucial mission to recapture Chang'an...

139
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:04,800
I...

140
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,480
I...

141
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,780
I truly don't know what to do anymore.

142
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Master Zhuang, please get up first.

143
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,200
Since Chang'an fell,

144
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,180
our fellow undercover agents...

145
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,320
Some died,

146
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,460
some were injured.

147
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,080
Now only Li Ling and I remain,

148
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,680
still struggling to hold on.

149
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,220
Whether we can successfully retake the city

150
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,640
depends entirely on intelligence transmission.

151
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,370
Miss Nongyu.

152
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,560
We cannot allow Chen Jingbian

153
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,960
to cause more trouble with the Firefly Map.

154
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,620
Master Zhuang,

155
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,090
please stand up when you speak.

156
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,120
Miss Yu.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,460
About your background...

158
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,130
Li Ling has already told me.

159
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,040
I know you're General Feng's daughter.

160
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,320
General Feng spent his entire life in military service,

161
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,960
all so that the people of the Tang Dynasty

162
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,240
could live in peace.

163
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,640
As his daughter,

164
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,640
you must

165
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,560
also understand what's right and just.

166
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,400
I know I shouldn't say these things,

167
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
but for the sake of our Tang Dynasty,

168
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
for all its people,

169
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,120
for Li Ling...

170
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,200
I beg you, Miss Feng,

171
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,320
to distract Su Changming

172
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
and retrieve the Night Firefly Map.

173
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,240
Li Ling.

174
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,400
Where are my sword and the woman?

175
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,330
After all this talk,

176
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,120
this is your real purpose.

177
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,640
You want me to distract Su Changming

178
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,120
in exchange for the Firefly Map.

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,250
You just want me to throw myself at him.

180
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,290
Miss Nongyu,

181
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,240
you're the only one who can do it now.

182
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,820
Young Master, you're back. Someone is waiting for you.

183
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,720
I heard that only if both I and the sword belong to you,

184
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,840
will you be willing to help the Tang Dynasty.

185
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,100
Can you keep your word?

186
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,840
I'm just a bandit.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,200
I do terrible things

188
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,460
and break my promises.

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,520
Do you think I keep my word?

190
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,580
Since you're here,

191
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,490
you might as well sleep with me.

192
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,320
Show me all those skills

193
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,020
you used to please Li Ling.

194
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,240
Hit me.

195
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,000
Go ahead, hit me.

196
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,520
Last time I treated you this way,

197
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,720
you were completely unwilling.

198
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,700
Why is it that this time

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,530
you're playing hard to get?

200
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,240
Because you've already applied

201
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,720
poison to your lips.

202
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,680
Try again.

203
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
I won't fight anymore. I surrender.

204
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
No more fighting?

205
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,060
Then accept your loss.

206
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,780
Since you've lost,

207
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,420
you should act like it.

208
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,760
Where are my sword and woman?

209
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,840
You will never get the person or the sword.

210
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,240
You...

211
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
If I can't even protect

212
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,300
the person I love and my benefactor's relic,

213
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,400
then I'm worse than a scoundrel.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,800
Su Changming,

215
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,890
don't you understand even now?

216
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,520
Even if you get the person and the sword,

217
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,240
you still won't be the winner.

218
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,970
Ridiculous.

219
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,440
I, Su Changming, have never lost.

220
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,720
Deep down, you know very well

221
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,820
that even if you keep Nongyu by your side,

222
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,620
you will never truly have her.

223
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,700
Because...

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,660
She doesn't belong to anyone.

225
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,520
She only belongs to herself.

226
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,000
Actually,

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,130
what you really want

228
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,200
is my life, isn't it?

229
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,160
Fine then.

230
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,940
I'll give it to you.

231
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,890
What do you mean?

232
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,680
I'll give you my life,

233
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,320
but I have one condition.

234
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,640
You and the Guantian Society

235
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,130
must join the Tang army.

236
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,480
Li Ling,

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,060
have you gone mad out of desperation?

238
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,440
I lead my brothers to enjoy the good life

239
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,530
and live freely.

240
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,280
Why would I be foolish enough

241
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,480
to join the Tang army?

242
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,080
For honor.

243
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,240
Honor?

244
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,640
You killed your commander and betrayed your master for glory.

245
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,840
What right do you have to talk about honor?

246
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
What I'm doing now

247
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,840
is the same as what Feng Jianye did

248
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,360
when he willingly offered his own head

249
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,080
years ago.

250
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,250
Stop glorifying yourself.

251
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,960
After Tongguan fell,

252
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,940
the Emperor fled west,

253
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,290
Chang'an was captured,

254
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,090
and the Great Tang was in peril.

255
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,160
General Feng

256
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,240
wanted me to go undercover beside Chen Jingbian

257
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,880
to obtain the Night Firefly Map.

258
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,340
That's why he chose to die,

259
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,260
sacrificing himself willingly.

260
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,180
All these lies you're telling

261
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,280
are just to absolve yourself of guilt.

262
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,010
You can cut off my head, Li Ling's head, right now.

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
What are you waiting for?

264
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,680
Yiyu

265
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,520
Xie Zheng

266
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,120
Yan Zhirui

267
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,880
