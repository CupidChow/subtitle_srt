(Pee:)

7

(I don't understand you at all.)

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,280
(I just want the best for you.)

00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,920

(to get along with their friends?)

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,960
Hey, Pee.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,440
You're being crazy,
running around the mall.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,440
So what's the emo turtle
angry about this time?

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,040
Suddenly, he just walked out.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,320
I don't know what to do anymore.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,360
Hey Pee, are you going to be
dramatic about this too?

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,520
Or is Pee actually obsessed
with the little turtle?

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,720
Don't you guys know?

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,160
Pee likes weird things.

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,440
Yeah, I admit
that I like weird things,

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,320
but he's just too much for me.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,160
I just want to know

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,680
if people can really change
for someone they love.

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,120
You're so deep.

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,120
He was saying that

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,320
He wants to change him
to be a normal person for once.

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,320
It's like you're
doing him a favor out of pity,

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,720
but he won’t accept it, right?

30
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,920
You guys are really awful.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,320
How did his family raise him?

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,040
I think his family must have been

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,480
the type to forbid this and that,

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,320
which is why he turned out
to be so sissy.

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you.

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,560
Wait, Diew!

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,000
That doctor... Do you know him?

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,640
When you went into the restroom,

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,080
I talked to him a little.

61
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,640
He said that he knows you.

62
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,840
Who is he?

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Can I ask?

64
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,840
He is a senior.

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,360
A senior that I used to know.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,960
I happened to find this bracelet
in the sink in the bathroom.

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,840
I think someone
might have forgotten it.

68
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,160
Really?

69
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,720
I don't recognize it at all.

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,240
Oh, doctor.

71
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,000
Sorry,

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,000
it actually belongs
to someone I know.

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,800
He must have forgotten it.

74
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,880
I'll return it myself.

75
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,200
Okay, doc.

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,680
Every time I hear
the sound of wind chimes,

77
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,680
it reminds me of the early days of us talking.

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,160
Diew.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Diew.

80
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,800
What did you say just now?

81
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,920
You seem bothered.

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,240
Is something wrong?

83
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,200
No, it's nothing.

84
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,840
You've probably been
exposed to the wind too much.

85
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
Should we go inside?

86
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,240
It's okay,

87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm just a little tired.

88
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
I’ll be fine.

89
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,880
Diew.

90
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,040
Is Dr. Pee

91
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,840
really just your senior?

92
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,400
Uh,

93
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,560
why are you suddenly asking that?

94
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,280
I'm just...

95
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
Never mind, it's nothing.

96
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,000
God.

97
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
There's really nothing, right?

98
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,680
What are you looking for?

99
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm looking for a bracelet.
My bracelet is missing.

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,640
Is it the one that's
shaped like a square?

101
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,040
Yes,

102
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,360
have you seen it?

103
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,760
Should we go back
to the vet and check,

104
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,160
in case you dropped it there?

105
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,160
It's okay.

106
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,880
Okay, then.

107
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,520
Hello, friends.

108
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,480
Hey, guys.

109
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,240
How about going
to try the new steak place

110
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,600
in front of the mall today?

111
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,440
They say it looks
really delicious and that

112
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
it's so good it's worth bragging about.

113
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,760
Just go, guys.

114
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,400
I'd rather eat
quickly at the cafeteria

115
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
and then find a place to read.

116
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,760
What's wrong with you?

117
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,880
Why are you so eager today?

118
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,680
Just go, it's only for a moment.

119
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,960
I don't want to eat steak.

120
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,280
Just go, guys.

121
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,920
Hey God, are you going or not?

122
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,600
No, I'm lazy.

123
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,240
I was actually planning
to take Diew out to eat anyway.

124
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,800
Oh, what's going on?

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,880
This guy is so boyfriend-clingy,

126
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,640
and the other is so indie.

127
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
If they don't eat,

128
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,480
you don't have
to keep pestering them.

129
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,960
Alright,

130
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,160
then I'll just go with Wan,
just the two of us.

131
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,400
Let's go.

132
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm going to eat until I'm stuffed.

133
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,440
I'm going to order a big meal.

134
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,240
How is it?

135
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,520
Is it not okay after you said it?

136
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,280
Hmm, I think it might be
even worse than before.

137
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,720
But I don’t regret it.

138
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,560
At least,

139
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
I got to speak up.

140
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,080
Hey, come on.

141
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,400
After the competition,

142
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,480
I'll take you out
for drinks to cheer you up.

143
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,560
Hey.

144
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,040
What did Beer do to you?

145
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
It's nothing.

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,720
Don't think I'm being nosy,

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,440
but since we came back from Phrae,

148
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,440
you guys have been acting strange.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,040
Normally, you're inseparable,

150
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
and now

151
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,840
you're even arriving
at class separately.

152
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,120
What's going on?

153
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,920
It's nothing, just forget about it.

154
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,320
How do you feel about him now?

155
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,080
I...

156
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,360
Right now, I want
to collect my thoughts.

157
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,120
My head is filled
with who knows what,

158
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,400
and I can't explain it.

159
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,200
I just want everything
to be the way it was.

160
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,960
Yeah, I understand.

161
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,880
Then take plenty of time for yourself,

162
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,240
think things through slowly.
There's no need to rush.

163
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Even so,

164
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,520
I still want you guys to clear things up.

165
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,400
Look at what happened with Tan.

166
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,400
Hey,

167
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,560
I'm really uncomfortable

168
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,480
seeing the two of you change like this.

169
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,480
Eat, eat up.

170
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,960
Eat up!

171
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,280
(Diew:)

172
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,680
(I'm coming to practice.)

173
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,400
(Okay.)

174
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,840
(I miss you, Diew.)

175
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,960
(Are you sure that you don't need
my help to find the bracelet?)

176
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,040
(It's fine, God.)

177
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,280
(I'm okay.)

178
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,960
(Good luck!)

179
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,560
Come on.

180
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,240
Hello. How was Phrae?
Did you have fun?

181
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
It was quite fun.

182
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,400
I got to try a lot of new things
that I hadn't tried before.

183
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,320
You all seem to
be having a great time.

184
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,280
And how are you?

185
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
I'm still the same,

186
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,600
not off having

187
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,080
youthful romance like you.

188
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,840
What are you talking about?
I don't know anything about it.

189
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
I think it's good.

190
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,560
At your age,

191
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,960
it's normal to have romance.

192
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,000
It's the flavor of life.

193
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,280
Sometimes sour, sometimes sweet,
and sometimes spicy and exciting.

194
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,760
If you don't stop teasing,
I'm going to hang up.

195
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,240
Okay, I won't tease you anymore.

196
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,760
And,

197
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,760
how is Mom doing?

198
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,720
If you want to know,

199
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,840
then you should answer her calls.

200
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
I understand you.

201
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,360
You're at an age where you're
starting to grow into adulthood,

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,240
and it's natural

203
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,080
to want your own space

204
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,920
and to fully be yourself.

205
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,840
But if there are days
when you feel too lonely

206
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,040
in those new spaces,

207
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,720
I think

208
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,440
you can take a break from there.

209
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,720
Your mom and I are
still here waiting for you,

210
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,360
at our home.

211
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,480
Yes.

212
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,360
Thank you.

213
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,000
Dad!

214
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
Are you talking with Diew?

215
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,600
Well then, I'll hang up first.

216
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,440
Okay.

217
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,200
Are you secretly talking with Diew?

218
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,880
It's normal for me
to talk with my grandson.

219
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,600
You both are so close.

220
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,840
Grandpa and grandchild.

221
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,920
Why haven't you
told me anything at all?

222
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,280
Why are you still feeling hurt?

223
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
It's because of

224
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,800
what you said to him that day,

225
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
which made him upset
with you until now.

226
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,200
I just said that...

227
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
That...

228
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,680
It's just...

229
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,760
Just...

230
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,840
Oh, I won't tell. If I do,
you'll just scold me again.

231
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
If you were still here,

232
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,280
would you scold me too?

233
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,320
Ahh!

234
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,000
Dad!

235
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,960
Oh! Dad!

236
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,120
Hey!

237
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,560
Are you okay, Dad?

238
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,560
It's nothing.

239
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,960
I just felt a bit lightheaded.

240
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,800
It's my blood pressure.

241
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,520
But why did it suddenly happen?

242
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,680
You've never been like this before.

243
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,600
It's probably just
normal blood pressure.

244
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,480
After all, I'm getting older.

245
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,600
Are you sure

246
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,400
it's like that?

247
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,600
I'm as strong as I can be.

248
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,160
Just get a good night's sleep,

249
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,880
and I'll be fine by tomorrow.

250
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, there are so many mosquitoes here.

251
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,280
- Let's get inside.
- Be careful.

252
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,960
Don't touch me.

253
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,240
Please let me help.

254
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,240
I'm still strong!

255
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,160
If you don't know how to do it,
just let me know

256
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,120
and I'll teach you.

257
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,920
You should do it slowly.

258
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,200
Watch and remember this.

259
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,800
I won't do it for you
anymore from now on.

260
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,320
I already know, okay?

261
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,240
This is the laundry detergent.

262
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,320
Put it in this compartment.

263
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,000
And this is

264
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,520
the fabric softener,
put it in this compartment.

265
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,800
They must not be swapped.

266
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,920
That's all.

267
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,080
I forgot my phone in the room.

268
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,360
I saw that you forgot.

269
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,960
Beer, my dear frie...

270
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,080
Wan.

271
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,280
I think

272
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,440
I can't do this anymore.

273
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,520
Do...

274
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,880
Do what?
What are you talking about?

275
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,080
Beer!

276
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:23,720
(God:)

277
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,960
Hello, God.

278
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,560
The picture you sent is so beautiful.

279
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,320
The lines look sharper.

280
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,480
I think you should let others
see this picture too.

281
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,720
I'm not yet confident enough
to show it to others.

282
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,240
I just started learning to draw.

283
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,520
Well, I'll wait
until you're more confident.

284
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,240
But anyway, I really
like the pictures you drew.

285
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,920
Okay.

286
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,360
I will try my best.

287
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,520
Today, practice might end late,

288
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,920
so I might come back late.

289
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,000
You don't have to wait for me.
You can go to bed first.

290
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,680
Okay. Good luck, God.

291
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,920
Well, good night in advance,

292
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,960
and I miss you.

293
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,560
I miss you too.

294
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,160
Bye-bye.

295
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,760
(Diew: Are you interested in
working on this project together?)

296
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,840
Creative Print Media
Competition Project.

297
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,440
But there are outsiders
joining in to listen too.

298
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,360
(Creative Print Media Competition Project)
But it also has to do presentation.

299
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,600
I'm not very confident.

300
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,760
But if we apply as a team,

301
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,720
we can help each other
with the pitching.

302
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,720
Practicing a lot should
make us more confident.

303
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,520
But right now,
the important thing is

304
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,960
what we should submit.

305
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,280
Shall we work on something
related to children's stories?

306
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,480
♪From that day
when there was no one♪

307
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,280
♪You came with freshness♪

308
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,360

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,280
♪You've changed my world♪

310
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,800
♪Into ours♪

311
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,160
I need another round.

312
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
The timing isn't sharp yet.

313
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,680
Umm, okay.

314
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,040
After finishing the riff from Phil,

315
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,400
I'll drum and
then send it to Kan.

316
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,880
Alright, then let's
start with the hook.

317
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay.

318
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,000
(Diew:)

319
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,560
(Don't forget to eat.)

320
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
(Make sure you find
something to eat too.)

321
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,680
Are you ready?

322
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,080
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

323
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,840
(Diew:)

324
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,880
(Are you tired?)

325
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,920
(Yes, I am.)

326
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,880
(But talking to you
made me feel better.)

327
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,200
(Diew:)

328
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,000
(Whose boyfriend is so cute like this?)

329
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,320
Oh, Dr. Pee,

330
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,280
what a coincidence!

331
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,840
I've been meaning to swing by
the vet several times already.

332
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,680
Diew might have
left his bracelet there.

333
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,840
Have you seen it?

334
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,240
A bracelet?

335
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,800
I haven't seen it.

336
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,240
Normally, if someone
forgets something,

337
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
they would notify me.

338
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,240
It seems like it's really lost.

339
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,480
It's okay, I'll just
buy a new one for him.

340
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,040
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God!

341
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,560
Where have you been?

342
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,360
Since you have boyfriend,

343
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,320
you've forgotten about us.

344
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,280
I didn't forget.

345
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,320
When I'm free, I'll invite Diew
to play basketball with us.

346
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,920
Alright, see you.

347
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
You have a lot of friends.

348
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,200
It seems like they're close
with Diew too, right?

349
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,520
Yes,

350
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,280
he gets along well with my friends.

351
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,120
It seems like you
want to say something.

352
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,520
Oh,

353
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,880
it's nothing.

354
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,440
Are you sure?

355
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,400
How can I say?

356
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,960
I'm just thinking to myself

357
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,760
that he's still the same.

358
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,960
In what way is

359
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,400
he still the same?

360
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,760
To be honest,

361
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
I don't want to overstep
in your relationship.

362
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,600
Just spit it out, Doc.

363
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,040
I’m the one who decide
wheater it’s overstepping or not.

364
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,320
He's still the same

365
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
in that he doesn't dare to
express his feelings directly,

366
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,200
or say what he doesn't like.

367
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,680
What do you know
about me and my boyfriend?

368
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,840
Dr. Pee,

369
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,160
the coffee is ready.

370
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,400
Okay.

371
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Isn't that right?

372
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,960
What would I know about

373
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,000
you and...

374
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,960
Well, excuse me.

375
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,120
Wait a sec, doc.

376
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,480
What exactly is
your relationship with my boyfriend?

377
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,360
Didn't he tell you?

378
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,320
I think you

379
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,960
should clear things up
with your boyfriend first

380
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,720
and then come talk to me.

381
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,880
I hope you find the bracelet.

382
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,080
Good luck.

383
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,880
