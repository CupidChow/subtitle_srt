31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,840
My name is Diew.

32
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,920
I like listening to music,
as you can see.

33
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,080
I feel like I am in my own world.

34
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,560
Oh, a student!

35
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,280
Um, right.

36
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,440
The Midnight Solitary that
you requested has arrived.

37
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,880
If you want to borrow it,
it's on the shelf.

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
Really?

39
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,520
Then I'll go and borrow it.

40
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,000
Sure.

41
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,120
(I come to the library
almost every day.)

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,440
(It is a second home
for a reader like me.)

43
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,240
(DS 568 O808 - DS 576 P)

44
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,720
(Someone once told me that)

45
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,160
(books are like a gateway to new worlds)

46
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,280
(that make our ordinary days)

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,760
(THE MIDNIGHT SOLITARY)
(come alive.)

48
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,000
(I believe that too.)

49
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,720
Diew!

50
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,360
Hello, Game.

51
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Who drew this?

52
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,920
Hmm, that's right.

53
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,600
I didn't see any yesterday.

54
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,600
I don't know why anyone drew these.

55
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,840
(This is Game.)

56
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,960
(My only friend in college.)

57
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,560
It's good that it can be removed.

58
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,680
This is the Midnight Solitary.

59
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,200
I just saw a podcast review channel.

60
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,640
It's about Emma

61
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,160
who goes back
to different times in her life.

62
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,200
It's about love and dreams, right?

63
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,520
Um, right. I followed this author.

64
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,160
Have you read his previous books?

65
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,440
I have.

66
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,920
I am also interested in this book.

67
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,640
If I had the chance to live a life

68
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,720
that I did not choose in the past,
what would it be like?

69
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,320
(I think that me and
Game are similar in that)

70
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,320
(we are both very private people)

71
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,760
(and we're introverts.)

72
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,240
(For an introvert like me,)

73
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,480
(solidtary is extra happiness.)

74
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,880
Mr. Charcoal.

75
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,680
Mr. Charcoal.

76
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,520
Oh, oh!

77
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,440
Thank you.

78
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,840
Be careful.

79
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,960
(Department, Document Type, No. of Box)

80
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,280
I just moved here today.

81
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,080
At first, I thought
I could carry it all by myself.

82
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,320
If I had known, I would have
asked my friends to help me.

83
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,000
This room.

84
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,200
I didn't lock the door.
Could you please open it for me?

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,440
Thank you so much.

86
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,920
If it weren't for you,
I would have been in trouble.

87
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,600
Oh, where did he go?

88
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,960
Is he a human?

89
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,240
Khun Shy.

90
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,000
Are you hungry, Khun Shy?

91
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,600
Eat a lot, so you'll be strong, okay?

92
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
There will be someone
living next door to us.

93
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,360
Oh, you live in the room next to mine?

94
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,760
I just moved here.

95
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,120
If there's anything you're not
happy about, just tell me.

96
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,120
Where are you going?
Do you want to go with me?

97
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,400
You don't talk at all.
It makes me feel embarrassed

98
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,360
to let me do all the talking.

99
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Anyway, I'm glad to see you.

100
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
My name is...

101
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,920
Hello!

102
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,960
Hello, God.

103
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,360
You're still as handsome as ever.

104
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,840
Hello! Let me help you with these.

105
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,560
- It's okay, thank you.
- Okay. Bye.

106
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,640
Hell, Aunty Jai.

107
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,840
- The new hair clips are very cute.
- Well.

108
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,520
You're so sweet.

109
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,040
You came here very early today.

110
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,280
I woke up early today,

111
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,200
and the new dorm is closer,
so I arrived early.

112
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,240
Then you won't be late anymore, right?

113
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,520
Oh, Aunty Jai, at my level,

114
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,480
I will be late as usual.

115
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,080
I gonna go. Bye, Aunty Jai.

116
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,680
Hey, God!

117
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Hey, what's up!

118
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,240
Are you going tonight?

119
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,280
We'll watch football at the same place.

120
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,760
How could I miss it?

121
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,640
It has to be like this.

122
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,640
- See you.
- See you tonight.

123
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,960
- Oh, God. How are you?
- Hello.

124
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Say hi to everyone.

125
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,760
Hello, Jane's followers.

126
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,480
My name is God. I'm in my third year.

127
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,080
Try selling yourself a little bit.

128
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,520
When you're free,
what do you like to do?

129
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,440
I like watching movies
and listening to music,

130
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,720
but what I like the most is...

131
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,200
You rock!

132
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,840
Oh! God, you're so handsome.

133
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Shoot!

134
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
I forgot my phone.

135
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
Will I make it back to the dorm in time?

136
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,520
I knew you would forget.

137
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,680
Here, I brought it to you.

138
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
My dear friend Beer,

139
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,720
you really are my roommate.

140
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
You really are my roommate.

141
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,280
What do you care about these days?

142
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,200
Stop complaining.

143
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,080
It's me, Wan, your best friend.

144
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,200
Hey.

145
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,040
Today, after finishing
playing basketball,

146
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,520
we're going to a party at
God's new dorm, right?

147
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,800
Yes. Why?

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,600
I heard Bew say that there is a theme.

149
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
Why does eating hotpot need a theme?

150
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,560
Are you guys talking about
the hotpot party at my place?

151
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,880
Well,

152
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,880
you guys are excited about
my themed hotpot party, aren't you?

153
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,880
Of course,

154
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,480
I brought you guys the best outfits.

155
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,240
- But I don't want to...
- You don't want to, but I don't care.

156
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
Whoever enters my room last

157
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,280
has to pay.

158
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,680
I won't pay for it all by myself!

159
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,760
Me either.

160
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,800
If you don't wear it,

161
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,200
then you have to pay.

162
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,400
- Right?
- I'm not paying!

163
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,800
You pay.

164
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,600
I don't know who will pay or not,

165
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
but I have prepared
the outfit, so I won't pay.

166
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
Really? Your outfit is black, right?

167
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,120
Blackish black.

168
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,160
There are so many people.

169
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,840
I don't think there are any seats left.

170
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,440
Then, shall we go eat outside?

171
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,040
Um, good idea.

172
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,760
Let's go.

173
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,080
Huh.

174
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
What do they have today?

175
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,000
Aah...

176
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,800
I'm hungry. What should we eat?

177
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,120
Noodles?

178
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,320
Count me in.
Buy some for me too. I'm lazy.

179
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,480
Deal! What do you want, Beer?

180
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,680
You talk like you can hold them.
I'll buy them for you.

181
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,560
Let's go, God.

182
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,680
Let's go find seats.

183
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,560
The sky is so beautiful today.

184
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,880
Do you think the same as me, Khun Shy?

185
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,880
("My favorite sweet egg roll place".)

186
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,160
Welcome to my new room.

187
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,400
Let's go! Go, Go.

188
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,720
Go, Go!

189
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,640
Today is my new dorm's celebration,

190
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,280
so as the owner,
I would like to say something.

191
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,360
This hotpot is a celebration

192
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,200
for my new apartment.

193
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,360
Even though I didn't really plan
not to have a roommate,

194
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,280
it's just the way things turned out.

195
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,440
So, from now on,

196
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,400
all of you have to come visit
and crash at my place,

197
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,480
- alright?
- Okay!

198
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,320
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

199
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,680
Wow!

200
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,720
Put some vegetables in there, Beer.

201
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,920
Vegetables are not
necessary for someone like us.

202
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,120
Bew, this is yours.

203
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,600
It's not cooked yet.

204
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

205
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,240
This is mine.

206
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,800
Hey! How should we do it then?

207
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,440
This is tough now.

208
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,480
Wan definitely has to wash the dishes.

209
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,720
- Wan definitely has to wash the dishes.
- Don't tease me, guys!

210
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,360
Wan has to wash the dishes.

211
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,040
Because of you.
Why are you tapping the table?

212
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,000
Just call them already,
call them for help.

213
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,680
No, I didn't throw it at you.
It slipped from my hand.

214
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,480
Did it slip from your hand?

215
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,480
I didn't mean to,
it slipped from my hand.

216
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,560
That's enough! That's enough!

217
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,240
You all stop now.

218
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,640
Come on!

219
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,720
- Hey!
- Hey!

220
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,320
Hurry up, help me.

221
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,000
Hurry up, hurry up!

222
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
Easy, easy.

223
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,120
The power's out, Khun Shy.

224
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,080
The power will come back on in a moment.

225
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,000
(Under Construction)

226
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,120
Hey! Fire! Fire!

227
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,480
Which way?

228
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,040
Wan, this way. Wan!

229
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,840
Is anyone there?

230
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,600
Please, slow down. I can't see anything.

231
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,400
Where are you? I can't see the way.

232
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,760
It's still good that

233
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,640
only the hotpot got burned.

234
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,000
If something happens,

235
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,840
will you take responsibility?

236
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,240
You guys play like crazy.

237
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
Now look, everyone in the dorm

238
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,240
has to run for their lives
because the hotpot is on fire.

239
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,920
It's not funny at all.

240
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,880
I know.

241
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,720
- I'm really so sorry.
- Sorry.

242
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,480
Bye, Khun Shy.

243
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,040
(I'm sorry for causing
the fire last night.)

244
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,320
(From Room 514.)

245
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,760
Bew.

246
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,440
Shoot! Go.

247
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,480
We're on the same team.

248
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,040
Bew, give me water.

249
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,560
Thank you.

250
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,160
Aah...

251
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,400
Is it fun?

252
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,840
Hey, why did you stop playing so soon?

253
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,480
Come on. Let's go. Another round.

254
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,640
Soon?

255
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,040
How come it's soon?

256
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,760
You've been playing for three hours now.

257
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,720
It's only been three hours. Come on.

258
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,360
Only?

259
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,480
I tell you what,

260
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,280
you go play by yourself.

261
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,800
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

262
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,200
Because of you, Beer.

263
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,920
What are you complaining about?

264
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,880
You know I'm afraid of ghosts,

265
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,040
but I still listen.

266
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,680
Am I the only one listening?

267
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,760
After burning down my dorm,

268
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,840
do you still have the energy
to go back and fight with each other?

269
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,920
You're overreacting, man.

270
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,440
Nothing's burnt.

271
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,200
But I got condemned looks
from the dorm tenants.

272
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,600
I wonder if the person
next room hate me yet.

273
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,640
Wait a sec.

274
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,960
You just said the person next door.

275
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
Is there someone living
in the room next to you?

276
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,920
Yeah, there is.
There is one, but never mind.

277
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,760
Let's go, Beer.

278
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,400
You go. It's you.

279
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,640
- You guys too. Let's go.
- No.

280
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,920
- You guys too. Come on.
- No!

281
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,400
- Get up.
- No!

282
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,080
Come, Beer.

283
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,960
They're so strong, right?

284
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,360
Nice shot!

285
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,600
Three thousand!

286
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,520
The electricity bill is
very expensive this month.

287
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,520
Hello, Mom.

288
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,560
Mom, please transfer the electricity
bill to me. It's THB 4,500.

289
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,200
Where is it?

290
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,520
When the fire alarm went off,

291
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
I was shocked

292
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,720
and knocked on every door.

293
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,800
That's when I found out that
someone was in the next room.

294
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,640
Are you sure that's a human?

295
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,760
He's a real person.

296
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,360
I ran, grabbed his hand, and ran away.

297
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,240
But some ghosts can physically grab you.

298
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,640
Hey, Beer, I was so shocked.
I thought you were going to do a sit-up.

299
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,720
Wan!

300
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,880
You need to put a cap on your imagination.

301
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,080
Hey.

302
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,440
But I think it's a bit strange.

303
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,280
You live next door to him.

304
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't you ever hear
any noise from his room?

305
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,240
No,

306
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,040
he's usually quiet all the time,

307
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,040
so I thought there was no one there.

308
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,320
Maybe he only comes once in a while.

309
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,040
Is it really that quiet?

310
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,200
Come on, Beer.

311
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,560
Weren't you going to
do a sit-up a moment ago?

312
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,280
Let's do it. Bew, you count it.

313
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,920
- Start.
- One.

314
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,720
Two.

315
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,320
Slowly.

316
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,720
Three.

317
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,800
- Go deeper.
- Four.

318
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,920
Faster.

319
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,960
Hello, how can I help you?

320
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,080
Um.

321
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,520
Room 516
does not have the electricity bill.

322
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,920
Really?

323
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,960
I've sent it to every room already.

324
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,280
No, there aren't any in the mailbox.

325
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,760
Oh.

326
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,520
How could it not be there?

327
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,960
There has to be.

328
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,760
I personally issued the bills,

329
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,240
and my daughter helped put them
in everyone’s mailbox.

330
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,640
Okay.

331
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,280
Check again, okay?

332
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,720
- I will.
- Just in case you find it.

333
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,080
514.

334
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,800
516.

335
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,160
(This month, the electricity
bill is strangely expensive, isn't it?)

336
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,040
(I was away for a week, but
the electricity bill cost THB 3,000.)

337
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,560
(Is the bill from Room 514
also included?)

338
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,240
(My electricity bill...)

339
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,960
(Room 514...)

340
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,440
(Why is it so hard to
pay the electricity bill?)

341
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,200
(Whoever took the bill,
that person should pay it.)

342
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,920
(Did you take the electricity bill
from Room 516?)

343
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,400
(From Room 516.)

344
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,640
I'm from Room 514.

345
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,800
Sorry for taking

346
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,200
your electricity bill.

347
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,480
I just noticed that
there are two bills in the room.

348
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,320
