Are you okay? Does it hurt?

8

Take it slowly.

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,040
Diew.

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,040
My Diew is so cute.

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,200
Where did you go?

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,280
Diew.

13
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,080
(Diew)

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,880
Game. Have you gone to bed yet?
Can I call you now?

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,840
(02:00 a.m.)

16
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,440
Diew.

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
What should I do now?

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,160
Diew.

19
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,800
Yes?

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,320
Toilet.

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,800
Yes?

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,520
No, wait! Stop!

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,240
Slowly.

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,360
God, wait a sec.

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,640
Diew, it hurts!

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,720
Come on, God. Wait, wait.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
Are you okay, God?

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,200
Take it easy.

29
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,920
I can't open it.

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,240
You go take a shower, okay?

31
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,200
God!

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,720
Are you okay, God?

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,440
Feeling refreshed!

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,400
Wait a sec.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,480
Come take a shower with me.

36
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,600
Thank you.

37
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,560
You're all messy.

38
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
God!

39
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,960
Take a good shower.

40
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,080
Thank you.

Shoot!

63
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,720
Diew.

64
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,960
Um...

65
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,280
You couldn't wear my clothes,

66
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,920
so I wrapped a cloth
around your chest

67
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
to keep you warm.

68
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,880
Thank you.

69
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,720
Do you have a headache?

70
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Just a little.

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,480
Did you bring me
back here last night?

72
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
Yes, I did.

73
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,640
I was really drunk, Diew.

74
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,240
- God!
- Shoot!

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,200
What did I do?

76
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,440
You were very drunk last night.

77
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,400
I couldn't find
the keys to your room,

78
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,720
so I brought you
to sleep in my room.

79
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,960
Diew.

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,800
My Diew is so cute.

81
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,800
What I said last night,

82
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,320
I was drunk and
just talking randomly,

83
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,120
but I wasn't lying.

84
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,960
I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble.

85
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,640
It's okay.
Consider it an experience.

86
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,200
You should go put on a shirt.

87
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,080
Okay.

88
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,000
I have a list of five rock songs.

89
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,160
You all decide which one to play.

90
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,120
Pass it to Kan.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,880
I like this song.

92
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,600
I think it should be good.
The song is pretty popular.

93
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,440
You're so late like this.
Aren't you coming tomorrow?

94
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,520
Sorry about that.
Last night was a bit too much.

95
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,200
If you don't want to compete,
then just quit the band.

96
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm sorry, guys.

97
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,720
Let's continue talking, guys.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,640
Let's quickly decide
which song to play.

99
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,200
Go ahead, say it.

100
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,760
Hey, I saw a celebrity
dancing to this song on TikTok.

101
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,040
- It was really cute.
- Really?

102
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,280
- Then, how about we dance to it?
- Okay.

103
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Okay.

104
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,880
Smile.

105
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,200
Very good!

106
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,240
Oh, it's here!

107
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,160
It's my bag. New collection.

108
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,680
Here,

109
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,760
is it pretty?

110
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,960
Is this

111
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,720
what you were saying
you stayed up sleepless to design?

112
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,040
Yeah, it took several months to finalize it.

113
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,800
It's designed for both men
and women to use. Isn't it stylish?

114
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Is that Diew?

115
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,680
He is so cute.

116
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,080
I'm close to him.

117
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Really?

118
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,880
He will also be doing
a photoshoot for my bag.

119
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,720
Really?

120
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,800
You're amazing!

121
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,040
How about I
introduce him to you all?

122
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,920
Sure, let's do it!

123
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,640
Diew!

124
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,400
Diew! Diew, wait a sec.

125
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,520
Hello.

126
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,160
Is there something up?

127
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,760
I'd like to introduce you to my friends.

128
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,840
This is Yoyo,
and the other one is Cake.

129
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,080
- Hello.
- Hello. I'm Yoyo.

130
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm Cake.

131
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,880
I noticed you
don't have many friends,

132
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,400
so I wanted to
introduce you to my friends.

133
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,640
If you need any help,
you can always reach out to them.

134
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,560
Can I have your Instagram account?

135
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Me too.

136
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,200
Actually, I don't use social media.

137
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,360
It's okay, then.

138
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,240
Oh, Diew!

139
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,120
About the thing that I ask you,

140
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,400
have you decided yet?

141
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
What decision are you referring to?

142
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,480
Look at him, he's so funny!
Acting like he doesn't know.

143
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,520
It's about you
coming to model for me.

144
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,560
I've even booked
the studio for you already.

145
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,040
I don't think
I'd be suitable for it.

146
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,000
Why wouldn't you be suitable?

147
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,240
Diew.

148
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,720
This angle is cute,

149
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,200
and this angle is cute too.

150
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,160
But if you don't believe me...

151
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,880
Try putting on my bag and see.

152
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,840
This will show you
that it really is cute.

153
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,840
- Let me take a photo with him too.
- Me too.

154
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,400
Okay, come on.

155
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,440
See? It's super cute!

156
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,640
I'm sorry, Jane.

157
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,080
Diew. Please help me out.

158
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,120
Once the photos are done,

159
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,600
it'll be a part of your portfolio.

160
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,920
You can use it
for so many opportunities.

161
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,400
I've never begged anyone like this before.

162
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,640
Please, pretty please, Diew!

163
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,920
Diew, Diew!

164
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
Diew! My bag is all dirty now.

165
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,880
Sorry, Jane.

166
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,200
I'm not comfortable with it.

167
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,880
It's a pity despite you look so cute,

168
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,920
you are so boring.

169
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,240
Excuse me.

170
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,760
Does she really know him?

171
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,600
I think Jane just
wants to be famous

172
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,800
and is trying to
ride on his coattails.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
She doesn't even know that
he doesn't use social media.

174
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,960
Hey, girls!

175
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,120
Since the competitors
are playing rock,

176
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,320
we'll stick to rock too.

177
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,840
Let's compete based on skills.

178
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
Also,

179
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,720
they don't judge
based on the fame of the band.

180
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
If we're really good,

181
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,440
we should make it
to the finals, right?

182
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,800
I agreed with him on this.

183
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,920
Then let's play a rock song.

184
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,880
But I think if we play an alternative style,

185
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,280
which is trending right now,

186
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,160
people might like it more.

187
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,520
So far, everyone has
been playing rock songs.

188
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,440
Here, take a look.

189
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,360
Is it the band Golden Spell

190
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,200
that you want to cover?

191
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,920
Yeah, it's my favorite band.

192
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,760
I know this band.

193
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,800
See?

194
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,360
They're really famous.

195
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,760
Not every band is

196
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,680
suited to play songs
from your favorite band.

197
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,680
Our band specializes
in a different style.

198
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,240
But if we don't
do something different,

199
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,080
how will we stand out?

200
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,000
That's true.

201
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,440
Didn't you see? Last time, when he
put on a mask and went up on stage,

202
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,520
there were so many people
interested in our band!

203
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,520
They were just
interested in the mask,

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,520
not in the music you were playing.

205
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Are you proud of that?

206
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,320
Alright, let's vote.

207
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,760
Who wants to stick with
the same style, raise your hand.

208
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,800
Personally, I'd prefer to play
in a style I'm comfortable with.

209
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,320
It feels more confident
when we're on stage.

210
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
So, it's settled.
We'll continue playing rock,

211
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
since we all agree.

212
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,800
Okay.

213
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,160
Okay.

214
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
(Thai Language for Communication)

215
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,840
I will conclude
the presentation here.

216
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,240
Thank you.

217
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,760
Very good.

218
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,080
You can go back to your seat.

219
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,360
Who's next?

220
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,960
Come on, hurry up!

221
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,880
Are you ready?

222
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,880
Yes, I'm ready.

223
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,360
Hello.

224
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,600
Today, I... I am here
to present a report...

225
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,840
on Thai language

226
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,640
for communication.

227
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,960
Teacher,

228
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,760
what did he say?
I couldn't hear anything in the back.

229
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,320
It's not just you.

230
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,000
I also can't hear anything.

231
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,880
Who are you presenting to?

232
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,880
Speak louder, please.

233
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,200
If you're using
a microphone, the sound

234
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,800
should be loud enough
for everyone to hear.

235
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,560
Also, raise your head and face your friends.

236
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,040
Again.

237
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,680
Put that hand down as well.

238
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,560
I am here to present
on the topic of...

239
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,000
uh, obstacles in communication.

240
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,080
"Communication without Connection

241
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,920
Never Gets Collaboration".

242
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,200
Communication without

243
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,880
a good relationship

244
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,040
will not receive
cooperation and willingness.

245
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,000
Thank you.

246
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,000
All students, pay attention.

247
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,160
A obstacle in communication arises
from the sender of the message.

248
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,920
Take this as an example
of what not to do.

249
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,320
Excuse me.

250
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,320
Okay. Who's next?

251
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,280
Miss.

252
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,320
I'd like to request permission
to go check on my friend first.

253
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,160
Diew. Are you alright?

254
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,360
I can't even manage
to present the work well.

255
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,080
I'm really bad, aren't I?

256
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,880
Why do you think that way?

257
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,720
Well.

258
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,960
Every time I have to speak or

259
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,280
do something in front of a lot of people,

260
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,600
I feel really unsure of myself.

261
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
Nobody is good at everything.

262
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,400
I also have

263
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,920
things I'm not good at.

264
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,560
It's okay.

265
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,280
Next time, if we
have another presentation,

266
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,800
how about we practice together?

267
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,240
Don't think too much about it.

268
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,800
Thank you.

269
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Sorry, I still can't
get the timing right.

270
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,240
It's okay.

271
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,120
It's your first time playing.
Just adjust and improve gradually.

272
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,840
Come on.

273
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,880
God!

274
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,720
Focus a bit more, will you?

275
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,360
Sorry. Again.

276
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,480
(Diew:
Do you want to eat anything?)

277
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,120
Diew.

278
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,880
Have you just got back?

279
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,880
I've been back for a while.

280
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,960
How about you? How long
have you been back?

281
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,920
I messaged you in the evening,
but you didn't respond.

282
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,000
Is everything okay?

283
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,040
Well, just a little bit.

284
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,520
Hello, Diew.

285
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,880
I'm Smile.

286
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,040
I'm here to support you.

287
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,720
If you're going
through something sad,

288
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,360
feel free to share it with me.

289
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,160
Thank you.

290
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,520
Smile.

291
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,680
Here.

292
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,960
For you.

293
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,120
What?

294
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,200
I saw this and thought of you,

295
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,040
so I bought it for you.

296
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,320
Thank you, God.

297
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
When you're stressed
or upset about something,

298
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
let Smile be another friend
who's there for you.

299
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,120
Diew.

300
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,440
I have a place
I'd like to take you to.

301
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,560
Where is it?
