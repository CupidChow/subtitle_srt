Hello. Who are you looking for?

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Who is it, God?

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,720
Mom?

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,360
Diew.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,560
I need to talk to you.

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,080
Who is that guy?

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,720
His name is God

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,920
He lives next door.

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,080
Are you two dating?

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,400
Yes, he is my boyfriend.

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,800
I'm not old-fashioned or anything,

17
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,200
but why didn't you tell me

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,920
you have a boyfriend?

19
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
What year is he in?

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,240
Older than you?

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,600
Junior year?

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,480
Senior year?

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,600
Junior year.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,080
If your grandpa and I

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,800
hadn't come to surprise you,

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,440
would I even known
that you have a boyfriend?

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,360
Grandpa came too?

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,800
Yes, he came with me.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,480
But suddenly

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,880
he had a chest pain on the way,

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,480
so I had to take him
to the hospital first.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,200
I tried calling you,
but you didn't answer.

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,400
If Grandpa is in
such a serious condition,

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,480
why didn't anyone tell me?

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,600
You didn’t even mentioned

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,360
having a boyfriend to me too.

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,960
Over the past few weeks,

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,400
you must’ve felt nothing, right?

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,720
Not answering my calls

40
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,680
and leaving me worried like this.

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,240
Uh, it's not like that at all.

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,800
Diew feels bad

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,040
about not answering your calls.

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,320
I'm telling the truth.

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm with Diew.

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,960
I know how he’s been

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,640
especially since the time we went to Phrae

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,320
- He is...
- Oh, I see now.

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,320
The reason that you were
so eager to go to Phrae

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,840
It was because you wanted
to be alone with him?

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,480
Going off together like that,

52
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,760
if something happened,

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
who would take responsibility?

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
It's not like that.

55
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,280
I wasn't just going with him.

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,400
We went with God’s friend too.

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,080
I already asked Grandpa’s permission.

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,120
Well, you told Grandpa but not me.

59
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,720
We haven't talked

60
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,760
for several weeks.

61
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,040
What does that mean?

62
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,560
You probably think
that you've grown up now,

63
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,240
that you have your own life,

64
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,160
and that I'm no longer
important to you, right?

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,000
Can't you stop putting
pressure on me like this?

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,720
Pressuring you?

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,080
Is it really so wrong for me to care about you?

68
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,800
I raised you on my own,

69
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,440
without your father’s help.

70
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,240
Any other mother

71
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,840
would do the same.

72
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,040
Why do you make me
feel so disappointed?

73
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,400
What if I am like this
for the rest of my life?

74
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,760
If I don't talk,

75
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,400
don't listen,
and don't have friends.

76
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,120
Are you going to be disappointed in me
for the rest of your life?

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,840
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,600
I should have let you and your mother
talk it out on your own.

79
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,920
It's okay.

80
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,320
Even if you hadn't said anything,

81
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,360
it would have
ended up like this anyway.

82
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,640
Alright, I'll go see Grandpa first.
I'm worried about him.

83
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Alright, then I'll give you a ride.

84
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,440
Hello, Grandpa.
Which hospital are you in?

85
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,800
Okay. I'll come see you soon.

86
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,360
Um, hello.

87
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
I miss you so much.

88
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,640
Who did you come with?

89
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,760
Uh, this is God.

90
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,280
He's my boyfriend.

91
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,920
Hello, Grandpa.

92
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,960
This one is quite a catch.

93
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,640
Diew, you've got good taste.

94
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Are you okay, Grandpa?

95
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,040
Hey.

96
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm fine. This is normal for old people,

97
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,480
and it's natural
to have health issues.

98
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,760
So, God, you're Diew's senior, right?

99
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,720
Yes, I am.

100
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,320
How did you end up dating him?

101
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,960
I like Diew, so I pursued him.

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,640
This guy speaks very directly.

103
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,200
I like it this way—it's good.

104
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,680
Hey.

105
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,800
I heard the nurses say that

106
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,240
the coconut pancakes
here are delicious.

107
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,000
Could you fetch some for me, God?

108
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
They're at the cafeteria floor.

109
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,440
I’ll get that for you.

110
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,400
It’s okay. I can go.

111
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,280
So, I can stretch my legs and relax.

112
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,280
With that face, it looks like

113
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,720
you had a fight
with your mother, didn't you?

114
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,320
Diew,

115
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,520
are you going to tell me

116
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,440
what's going on? Why haven't you
been answering your mother's calls?

117
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,240
You're still unwell,
I don't want to bother you.

118
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
Diew.

119
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,160
Are you treating me
like some frail old man?

120
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,880
Next time I get sick,

121
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,240
I won't see a doctor

122
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,040
or take any medicine.
Do you hear me?

123
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,320
Okay,

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
I'll tell you.

125
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,120
When Mom found out from you
that I might go to Phrae,

126
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,200
she didn't want me to go.

127
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
She said that

128
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
if Dad were still here,
I would probably listen to him.

129
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,520
Your mother probably thinks
that things would be easier

130
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,760
if your father were still around.

131
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,560
Are you saying that

132
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,520
I'm being too difficult
for her to handle?

133
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,360
Okay, okay.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,920
Let me rephrase.

135
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,200
You were very close to your father.

136
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,720
After he passed away,
your mother probably felt

137
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,440
she needed to step in
and take his place.

138
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,040
How can they replace each other?

139
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,600
A father is a father,

140
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,000
and a mother is a mother.

141
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,320
This is something I know,

142
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,800
your mom knows,

143
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,360
and even you understand.

144
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,400
Your dad, in your memories,

145
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,720
was close to you,

146
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,600
but your mom,
who is still with you now,

147
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,040
just can't seem to be as close.

148
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,840
She has always been
someone who overthinks things.

149
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,040
She must’ve felt bad

150
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
given that she's
the one who raised you.

151
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,760
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,160
You don't have to apologize.

153
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,000
I've always thought that

154
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,720
she has an image in her mind,

155
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,880
an image of a perfect child.

156
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,040
And I haven't been able
to be that for her.

157
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,040
I'm just tired of trying.

158
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,320

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,640
Hello,

181
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,320
I’m speaking.

182
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,880

Answer the call, my love.

184
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,520
A car accident happened

185
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,800
while traveling between provinces,
veering off at a curve.

186
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,120
(Tragic! A bus veered off course
and crashed into the roadside.)

187
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,280
This morning at 5:06 AM,

188
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,440
there were 14 survivors

189
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,520
and 7 fatalities.

190
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,080
(Mr. Kornkan Cholsirivanich)

191
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,200
(Present)

192
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,720
What happened to you? Kid.

193
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,000
Does it hurt?

194
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,720
It hurts a lot,

195
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,360
but I don't want my mom
to know that I'm in pain.

196
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,760
Where is your mom?

197
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,480
You have to promise first

198
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,840
that you won't tell my mom

199
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,000
that I'm in pain.

200
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,000
Please.

201
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,160
I don't want my mom to know.

202
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,040
Okay.

203
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,400
How are you, dear?

204
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,800
Let's go get your wound treated.

205
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
I'll have the nurse
take care of it. Come on, let's go.

206
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,480
Let's go.

207
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,800
Aren’t you worried about your kid?

208
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,920
I'm not worried.

209
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,480
This kid

210
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,760
always cares
about others' feelings.

211
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,920
Even when she’s been bullied,

212
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,040
the first thing she think of is

213
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,200
don’t tell mom,
otherwise mom would be upset.

214
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,640
But we should do something about it.

215
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,880
But it seems like

216
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,440
she doesn't want that.

217
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,000
And what they want,
is it really good for them?

218
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,040
You just missed Diew a moment ago.

219
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,200
Dad.

220
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,560
Am I a terrible mother?

221
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,040
Kade.

222
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,760
I just want my child to be happy.

223
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,320
I want him to be safe.

224
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,240
I only want to protect him
from things that will make him cry.

225
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,080
(Mr. Kornkan Cholsirivanich)

226
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,360
I promise that

227
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,480
I will do my best to raise our kid.

228
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,000
Diew.

229
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,160
May I come in?

230
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,280
Diew.

231
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,040
Let's go have a meal. Shall we?

232
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,400
Please have something to eat.

233
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,920
Have a little bit, please.

234
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,600
It's a pity that
school has started.

235
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,360
Otherwise, I would have had the kids
come over to play with Diew.

236
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,480
It's alright.

237
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,080
I asked Grandpa
to take him to the library,

238
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,640
which is his and
his Dad's favorite place.

239
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,440
Don’t call me nosy but,

240
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,560
but wouldn't it be better for him

241
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,640
if you take him to new places?

242
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,360
That way, he wouldn’t be so
caught up in missing his father.

243
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,880
That's true.

244
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,400
The turtle said that,

245
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,200
in the end, his life is like...

246
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,160
Oh.

247
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,000
Diew.

248
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,000
Did I read that wrong?

249
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,800
I don't want to
read this book anymore.

250
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,520
I miss my dad.

251
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,360
I don't want to
see him cry anymore.

252
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,520
I love and care about him so much, Dad.

253
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,560
Listen to me.

254
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,360
Your love

255
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,480
needs to have a space for him to grow.

256
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,760
I'm getting old,

257
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
how much longer can I teach you?

258
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,320
Dad,

259
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,560
why are you saying this?

260
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,000
We need to let him experience

261
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,680
sadness

262
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,120
and disappointment sometimes.

263
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,600
So we can be there to embrace him

264
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,520
on the day that he cries.

265
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,120
That's all.

266
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,120
You're a great mother.

267
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,440
You have done well, my girl.

268
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,800
God seems like a good kid.

269
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,280
Should we talk outside?

270
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,560
God is a senior at college.

271
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,400
I know him because he moved
into the room next door.

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,680
We talked for a while
before we started dating.

273
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,600
You really like him, don't you?

274
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,640
Mom,

275
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,280
I'm sorry.

276
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,600
I didn't answer

277
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,080
your calls these past few weeks.

278
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
I just didn't know

279
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,600
what do I have to do to be a good child,

280
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,480
to make you happy.

281
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,600
About this morning…

282
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,160
Actually, I'm not
disappointed in you, dear.

283
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,040
I'm disappointed in myself.

284
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,560
I'm sorry

285
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,640
for making you feel
uncomfortable talking to me

286
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,720
I've tried everything
to get closer to you,

287
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,640
but the more I tried,

288
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,280
the further you seemed
to be far away from me.

289
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,280
How about we start by talking?

290
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,160
Talking?

291
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,440
What would you like to talk about?

292
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,800
About many things.

293
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,720
I just want us to
really listen to each other.

294
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,080
I might not be
very good at speaking,

295
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,680
but I will try.

296
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,960
I'll be a better son from now on.

297
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm sorry for everything.

298
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,760
Let's start over.

299
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,360
You don't have to apologize.

300
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,160
I'm also at fault for
not understanding you.

301
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,080
From now on,
I'll talk to you more, Mom.

302
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,920
I love you, Mom.

303
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,280
I love you too, baby.

304
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,480
Grandpa, it's just that...

305
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,240
I love Diew!

306
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,400
Why are you shouting?

307
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,760
I know now.

308
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,800
It's good that you love each other,

309
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
but next time,

310
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,920
before you open the door,

311
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,040
please make sure to
put on a shirt first.

312
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,760
It wouldn't look good
if others see it.

313
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,080
Can I trust you?

314
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,080
Trust me on what?

315
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,560
Please take care of Diew.

316
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,840
With pleasure.

317
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,480
Would you like some snacks?

318
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,680
I brought some for you.

319
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,480
Okay, thank you.

320
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
I'll go get a plate for you.

321
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,920
(God: The food has
been served to Mr. Shy.)

322
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
(Let me know how
Grandpa's test results are.)

323
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,320
(Thank you, God.)

324
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,520
Diew. How's it?

325
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,240
Do I look like I can
keep up with guys in their 20s?

326
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,680
For me, you are my number one.

327
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,640
Oh, isn't that your God?

328
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,400
Oh, you shouldn't have
sent him away so soon.

329
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,960
You should have
invited him to stay here.

330
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,560
Now it's no fun.

331
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,040
You're only looking to tease me.

332
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,680
Hey, hey.

333
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,840
If he does anything to you...

334
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,280
Look at my strength first.

335
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,840
That's enough, Dad.

336
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,160
The doctor said that

337
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,480
even though the test results
came back normal,

338
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,440
we still need to
keep a close watch.

339
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,040
That's right, Grandpa.

340
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,920
You should avoid overexerting
yourself during this time.

341
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,040
Have a taste and see if it's sweet.

342
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,280
Hmm, it's really sweet and juicy,
just to my liking.

343
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,920
Do you know, back in the old days,

344
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
dogs used to chase me

345
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,680
so much that I had to climb up
a coconut tree to escape.

346
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,920
Climbing up with just
my hands—imagine that!

347
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,760
If I say this, you might
think I'm bragging.

348
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,080
When I was young,

349
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,640
I was as strong as I am now.

350
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,600
You're really strong.

351
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,840
If you played basketball with me,

352
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,480
I think I'd definitely lose to you.

353
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
God is quite sweet-talking.

354
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,640
He knows how
to flatter the elderly.

355
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,120
He must have taken good care

356
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,560
of Diew in the past.

357
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,680
Actually, I don't know
who is taking care of whom.

358
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,920
What's the term in young people's slang

359
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,960
for being...

360
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,800
Infatuated.

361
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,360
Yes, infatuated.

362
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,840
Oh, Diew,

363
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,840
your face and ears
are all red now, dear.

364
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,760
Are you getting too embarrassed, or what?

365
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,600
Hmm, Mom! Grandpa!

366
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,040
The more embarrassed you are,

367
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
the cuter you get.
Whose boyfriend are you?

368
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,000
So, what do you

369
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,440
and God normally
like to do together?

370
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,640
Tell me about it.

371
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,240
Normally, we don't go out much.

372
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,840
He only visits
art galleries or cafés.

373
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,280
And most of the time, we go out
to find delicious food to eat.

374
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,320
I'm a bit of a foodie.

375
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,080
Mom, Grandpa,

376
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,080
tomorrow I have a presentation

377
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,240
for a project I
worked on with Game.

378
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,280
Would you like to come?

379
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,720
The slides are finished,

380
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,400
the story is complete
with all the chapters,

381
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,320
and the script is ready.

382
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,800
Okay.

383
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,680
There he is.

384
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,560
Shall we go inside now?

385
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,440
Okay.

386
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,400
Diew.

387
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,680
Hello, Mom and Grandpa.

388
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

389
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,080
This is Game.

390
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,920
Oh, Game.

391
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,040
I've heard your name for a long time.

392
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,520
Thank you for always
taking care of Diew.

393
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,480
It's no problem at all.

394
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,240
I'm happy to do it.

395
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,840
We're about to go inside.

396
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,120
Would you like to come in with us?

397
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,360
Let's go.

398
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,320
Are you all set and ready, dear?

399
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,120
- Yes.
- You can do it, my dear.

400
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,240
Just give it your all, sweetheart.

401
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,960
Thank you.

402
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,080
I believe that what you've
been working on is really great.

403
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,040
So, just focus and
give it your all.

404
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,200
Please help me put away the things.

405
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,800
Okay.

406
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,880
Yes, God?

407
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,560
Is it almost time
for the presentation?

408
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,480
Yes, I'm about to go inside.

409
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,680
Do your best today.

410
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,720
If you get brain freeze,
just think of my face.

411
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,200
Will that make it more difficult?

412
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm sorry that

413
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,400
I can't be there to
watch your presentation.

414
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,360
I got caught up in a big rehearsal.

415
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,600
I already said it's okay.

416
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,480
Don't you have a rehearsal?

417
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,400
Just focus on your rehearsal.

418
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,920
Alright.
I hope the project goes well.

419
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
Then I'll head out first.

420
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,800
Let's go.

421
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,680
Are you ready?

422
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,560
Diew.

423
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,680
Don't worry.

424
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,240
Believe me, we got this.

425
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,320
Let's go.

426
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,640
(Creative Print Media Contest
Project: Theme - Travel)

427
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,160
Hello, everyone.

428
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,320
Today we have a great turnout.

429
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,560
Welcome everyone to

430
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,040
the pitch event for

431
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,560
the "Creative Print Media Contest"

432
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,920
in today's special topic,

433
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,840
with the theme "Journey".

434
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,560
Our first team today is

435
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,440
Team Let's Go Jane
with their project,

436
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,560
My Journey as Jane.

437
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,840
Hello, everyone.

438
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,480
Journeys happen to many people

439
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,280
and evoke a wide range of emotions.

440
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,040
Each person's
destination often leads

441
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,040
to different goals and outcomes.

442
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,600
Hey.

443
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,240
Just five more minutes, please.

444
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,520
Please stand by.

445
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,880
Okay.

446
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,920
Game, I can't
find the adapter cable.

447
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,920
Try checking in the bag again.

448
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,360
I've already looked thoroughly.

449
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Then try looking in my bag.

450
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,720
It's not in my bag either.

451
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,000
What should we do?
