(Even though
we have different opinions,)

33

(we can still talk things through, right?)

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,560
Diew!

35
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,560
Could you please give
the electricity bill to God for me?

36
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,440
Okay, sure.

37
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,480
God!

38
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,520
I left your electricity bill with him.

39
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,640
Next time, it's better to leave it
in the mailbox as usual.

40
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,640
Okay, I'll do that.

41
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,880
(God, can we talk for a moment?)

42
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,280
Hello, my friend!

43
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,920
I had a fight with Diew.

44
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,280
Really?

45
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,680
Yeah, I saw him
getting back with his ex.

46
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,080
So, he went back
to reconcile with his ex

47
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,640
and then came to break up with you?

48
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,360
We haven't broken up yet.

49
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,840
I just saw him with his ex.

50
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,400
They might have just
run into each other by chance.

51
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,560
Have you asked Diew about it yet?

52
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,960
I just don't understand

53
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,200
why he would do this to me.

54
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
God!

55
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,520
I ask if you’ve asked him yet.

56
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
Not yet.

57
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,360
Then why don't you ask him?

58
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,560
Um...

59
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,360
I don't even know how to explain it.

60
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,800
I know that

61
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,800
the thing with Pee
might just be a coincidence,

62
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,640
but I don't understand

63
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,720
why he chose not to tell me anything

64
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,720
I'm his boyfriend,

65
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,720
but sometimes it feels like

66
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,800
he treats me like
I'm an outsider on certain things.

67
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,040
Sometimes, even Pee
knows more than I do.

68
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,840
It feels like I'm a bad boyfriend.

69
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,600
If I ask him

70
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,440
and he says
I'm overstepping into his life,

71
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,480
well I...

72
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,000
still want to be with him,

73
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,360
I don't know what to do then.

74
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,320
God.

75
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,080
You really do love him.

76
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,560
That's why

77
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,760
you need to talk to him

78
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,840
and sort things out with understanding.

79
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,240
Are you just going
to let it end like this?

80
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,400
Yeah, yeah, I understand.

81
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,040
Yeah, that's all.

82
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,280
(Diew)

83
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,120
(Diew)

84
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,400
God, how have you been?

85
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,000
I've been feeling lonely,

86
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,840
especially because
we haven't talked much lately.

87
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,840
I miss you.

88
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,640
Why did it end up
like this, Mr. Shy?

89
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,680
Once it's done,
slowly place the seeds.

90
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,640
Too many. Remove some.

91
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,800
Oh, is it too much?

92
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,640
Yes.

93
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Sorry, sorry.

94
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Don't worry, he'll eat it.
He eats a lot.

95
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,200
Here it is.

96
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,520
I get it now.

97
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,760
Read quickly. Read it.

98
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,520
Why have I started to dislike
the silence so much?

99
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,160
(How to reconcile
with your partner?)

100
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,640
Game.

101
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,160
What's up, Diew?

102
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,520
Have you ever disappointed someone
who is very important to you?

103
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,840
Have I ever disappointed someone
who is very important to me?

104
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,760
Hmm, I'm not sure.

105
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,560
Diew.

106
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,680
You know, right?

107
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,280
That if you have
something bothering you,

108
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,240
you can talk to me about it.

109
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,680
Well... I haven't talked to God
for several days now.

110
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,800
I didn't tell him about Pee,

111
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,600
my ex.

112
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,480
So, he and I ended up
having an argument, and it escalated.

113
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,280
If you chose not to
tell him from the start,

114
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,400
you must have
had your reasons, right?

115
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm not sure if
my reasons are good enough.

116
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,840
I don't want him
to think I'm bad or weak.

117
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,280
I don't know the whole story,

118
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,280
but from what I know,

119
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,560
God seems to be someone
who understands others.

120
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,760
Regardless of your reasons,

121
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,880
he probably
wouldn't see you as weak.

122
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,600
I still haven't found
the right moment to talk to him.

123
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,280
Will I have a chance
to explain myself to him?

124
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,040
Take it easy.
Think this through.

125
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,760
If the old method isn't working,

126
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,080
why not try using
a different approach?

127
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
I think it should be okay.

128
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,080
Here's your chance, Diew.
Come on.

129
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
You can do it. Trust me.

130
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,320
He's over there
playing basketball. Just a moment.

131
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,680
Diew! It looks like
he has seen us already.

132
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,680
Hey, Diew!

133
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,760
I think this card is okay too.

134
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,640
What should I write?

135
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,240
Just write
according to your feelings.

136
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,240
How do you feel?
How do you want to tell him?

137
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,920
Trust me.

138
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Diew! Here he is,
practicing music right now.

139
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,880
Once he's done practicing,

140
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,360
just give him the card right away.

141
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,440
Here he is.
He's finished practicing.

142
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Go give it to him now.

143
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,480
Um, hello.

144
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,200
I don't think I'll have time.

145
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,520
This week I have to practice,

146
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,120
and there's also a band
competition coming up.

147
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,520
I think we should
come another time.

148
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,600
Hey, wait. Diew!

149
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,680
Yeah, I got to hang up now.

150
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,920
I'll call you back later.

151
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,640
Just go in now.

152
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,600
Game, I think we should go now.

153
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Diew! Let's get in...

154
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,120
Diew!

155
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
(Boy)
(I’ve arrived.)

156
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
(Where are you?)

157
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,600
There is no response
from the number you are calling.

158
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,080
(I haven't been able to reach you.)

159
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,280
(I've arrived
at the meeting point.)

160
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,400
Hello.

161
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,960
Sorry, my battery died.

162
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,600
I just found a place to charge it.

163
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,120
Yes. Where are you?

164
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,040
I'm at the café across the street.

165
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,360
It's raining heavily.

166
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,640
What should we do?

167
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,280
Okay, you can wait there.
I’ll cross the street.

168
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,920
Yeah, you really do love this band.

169
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,520
The Golden Spell ticket
is so hard to get.

170
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,640
You’re a lucky fan.

171
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,960
Yes, okay.

172
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,720
Diew.

173
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,800
God.

174
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,760
Can we please talk?

175
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,400
What do you want to talk?

176
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,720
I want to talk about us.

177
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,440
Okay.

178
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm listening.

179
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,080
We're still

180
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,680
together, right?

181
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,640
Could you please listen to
what I'm going to explain?

182
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,480
I don't know

183
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,720
how you found out about me
stuck in the elevator with Pee,

184
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,040
but it was all an accident.

185
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,760
I didn't intend to skip
your concert to be with him.

186
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,760
By the time people managed to help us

187
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,200
it was already too late.
You’ve already done.

188
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,040
Pee and I ended a long time ago.

189
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,760
There's nothing between us anymore.

190
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,880
You know,

191
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,160
I don't really dwell
on your ex that much.

192
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,760
That Pee guy isn't a big deal.

193
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,360
But, Diew.

194
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,360
as your boyfriend,

195
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,080
I should know things
about you too.

196
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
Right now,
I feel like a stupid dog,

197
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,600
who doesn't know anything about you.

198
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,400
Your happiness,

199
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,400
your troubled past,

200
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,760
I just want to share
those feelings with you.

201
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,880
I just want to be a good boyfriend.

202
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,880
No matter what you've been through,

203
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,360
I told you from the beginning

204
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,240
that if there's anything,
you should let me know.

205
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,760
I think maybe sometimes

206
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,360
you just don't love me at all.

207
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,680
Can I ask,

208
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,600
am I important to you?

209
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,120
You are very important to me.

210
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,200
Then why don't you tell me?

211
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,640
Why don't you talk to me about it?

212
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,640
If I really am important to you.

213
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,480
Tell me!

214
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,080
The issue with Pee is
a deep wound for me.

215
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,480
He used to hurt my feelings.

216
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,120
I just thought that

217
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,520
if I don’t tell you about Pee,

218
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,240
or the pain in my life,

219
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,920
Then you wouldn’t look at me like
I’m someone to be pitied.

220
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
or a weird one
who needs to be fixed.

221
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,080
I don't want you to pity me.

222
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,320
Do you understand me?

223
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,360
Diew.

224
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,120
You're not a person to be pitied.

225
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,520
I've never seen you that way.

226
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,920
You're talented.

227
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,480
You're my lovely boyfriend

228
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
and most importantly,

229
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,200
you're a very strong person.

230
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
But you know,

231
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,240
as your boyfriend,

232
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,240
I am hurt.

233
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,760
that I don't know
anything about you.

234
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,440
Especially important
things in your life.

235
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
I found out from that Doc...

236
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,760
from others.

237
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Do you understand me?

238
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,000
(Golden Spell)

239
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,400
Golden Spell concert tickets

240
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,640
I want to make it up to you.

241
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,040
Can we be good again?

242
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,280
Thank you.

243
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,560
(Golden Spell)

244
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,800
Give it to me. I'll blow it for you.

245
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,920
Can I blow on it to dry it first?

246
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,720
For me, you are more important.

247
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,840
If you're unwell,

248
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,720
these two tickets

249
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,320
wouldn't mean anything.

250
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,960
Thank you.

251
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,760
Book is like
a door to new worlds,

252
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,960
making our ordinary days

253
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,040
come to life.

254
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,600
My dad told me that.

255
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,720
Actually, the reason I love
reading books is because

256
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,040
my dad instilled that
in me when I was young.

257
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,720
My dad gave this bracelet
to me before he passed away.

258
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,720
At first, I thought
it was shaped like a book.

259
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,680
It's a door, actually.

260
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,320
My dad said that

261
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,600
it's up to interpretation.

262
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,560
It's a coincidence that
this bracelet led me to meet Pee again.

263
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,280
Ah, it's more because
of Khun Shy actually.

264
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,880
Dr. Pee...

265
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,680
We didn't end things well.

266
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,280
He made me feel bad about myself.

267
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
Do you remember
the promises I asked?

268
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,680
Don't meet up, don't lie,

269
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,360
and don't share our
personal matters with others.

270
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,600
I set those rules because

271
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,200
I didn't want to experience
things like Pee again.

272
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,920
There was a time I confided in him

273
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
about my family,

274
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,840
about my dad,

275
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,120
and how I felt

276
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,960
after he was gone.

277
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,840
But all I got in return were

278
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,560
his eyes full of pity

279
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,760
Diew.

280
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,960
Losing someone is
always a heavy burden.

281
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,440
It feels like something is constantly
weighing you down to drown.

282
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,000
I don't know what
that Pee guy is like,

283
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,480
but one thing's
for sure—he's awful.

284
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,880
God.

285
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,760
Well, it's true.

286
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,840
If I were your boyfriend at that time,

287
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,920
I would be by your side,

288
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,400
listening to you
talk about your family,

289
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,840
and holding your hand

290
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,960
whenever you were in pain.

291
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,320
Even if I can't comfort you,

292
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,760
I will make sure you know

293
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,760
that I will be
a safe space for you.

294
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,160
God.

295
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,920
I really love you.

296
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,040
I love you too.

297
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,680
I'm sorry

298
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,200
for not telling you earlier.

299
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,600
You have nothing to apologize for.
