(not related to real person, place or event.)

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,240
This one.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,360
Is it there?

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,400
- Is it on this side?
- Are the tales on this side?

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,840
- Oh, it's right here.
- Here it is!

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,600
Found it!

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,040
Let's take a look.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,320
Here. Should we take this one?

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,560
Or should we choose another one?

(The Turtle and His Friends)

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,600
The Turtle and His Friends.

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,640
That's good.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,720
Once upon a time,

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,120
all the animals on Earth

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,560
decided to have a race.

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,320
On the day of the competition,

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,960
the tiger, the rabbit,

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,720
the deer, and rest of the animals,

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,040
all started running quickly,

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
leaving only the turtle behind,

25
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,640
who was still walking slowly.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,720
All the animals had
already passed the turtle.

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,120
They laughed a lot at the turtle.

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you still reading a children's tale?

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,480
That's funny.

30
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,960
Dad,

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,360
I don't like playing
with Joe and Ken at all.

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,440
It's okay.

33
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,280
I understand.

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,080
Is it really okay?

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,280
When you’re free,
you should take him outside

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,920
and take him to socialize,

37
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,840
rather than keeping him
cooped up in a room.

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,560
instead of making friends in his age.

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
You have to stop putting pressure on him.

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,680
Pressuring him?

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,600
It’s everyone that’s pressuring me,

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,440
constantly questioning
how I raise him,

43
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,600
as if he is not-

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,440
Not what?

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,320
Our kid is not what?

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Not like other children.

47
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,600
Kate!

48
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,560
Dad, what is it suppose to be?

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,720
It can be anything

50
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,840
you want it to be.

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,400
But if you ask me,

52
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,280
it’s a door.

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Can it be a book?

54
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Yes, definitely.

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,760
A book is

56
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,760
like a door,

57
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,760
which opens to new worlds

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,240
that make our ordinary days

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
come alive.

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,680
Happy birthday, kiddo.

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,520

We've arrived.

83
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,840
Open the door for me.

84
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,280
Come on, Wan.

85
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,080
Get down here quickly!

86
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,800
The weather is really nice.

87
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,200
Guys,

88
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,600
I want to walk up there.

89
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,280
Oh!

90
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,360
Do you see the stairs?

91
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,640
I'm so tired and it's super hot.

92
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Since you're here,

93
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,080
you might as well
take the stairs for a good fortune.

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,960
Look!

95
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,080
I'm a mess now,

96
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,960
and if I trip while walking up the stairs,

97
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,120
fall, and break my neck,
what would you do?

98
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,240
You're being dramatic.

99
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,120
I saw in the reviews that
there's an elevator over there.

100
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
Elevator?

101
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,320
Let’s take elevator.

102
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,640
Why taking the elevator?

103
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,040
God is walking up with us.

104
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,440
I'm taking elevator with Diew.

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
Oh!

106
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, it's hot.

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,080
Diew might get tired.

108
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,800
Okay?

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
Come on, let's take the elevator.

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,840
Come on.

111
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,920
If I take the elevator,

112
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,760
I'll just be a third wheel.

113
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,600
- Correct.
- Correct.

114
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,280
Then, can you buy me an ice cream?

115
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,520
Sure, I'll buy it for you.

116
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,880
Whoever reaches the top last,

117
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,200
may the ghost haunt you tonight.

118
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,120
Bew!

119
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,600
It's beautiful.
Could you take a photo for me?

120
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,920
I’ll take it for you.

121
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,120
I’ll definitely win the lotto.

122
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
Are you feeling warm, Diew?

123
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,160
That's okay.

124
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,600
It’s not that warm for me.

125
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,520
It’s really not that hot.

126
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,920
I'm fine.

127
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,640
Hey Beer,

128
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,120
the next place is air conditioned, right?

129
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,320
Well, we are going to a waterfall after this.

130
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,520
But I think we
can find a café to rest first.

131
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,400
We can go to the waterfall later.
What do you think?

132
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
Oh, why?

133
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,200
I can’t wait
to push you into the water.

134
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,320
Why?

135
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,360
It's okay.

136
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,240
Then we can go later.

137
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,680
You don't have to change the plan.

138
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,480
I’m alright.
Just follow the plan as it is.

139
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
It's okay, Diew.

140
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,120
The plan can be adjusted,
right, guys?

141
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,160
- Right.
- Right.

142
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,920
Don’t worry.

143
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,000
The van has arrived.

144
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,440
Let's get going.

145
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,560
Let's go.

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,760
Come on.

147
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,080
Cool air and comfy place.
Let’s go sit and relax.

148
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,280
Okay?

149
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,600
Come on.

150
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,920
It's alright.

151
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,960
They want to rest too.
You don't need to worry about it.

152
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,400
Come on, guys.

153
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,480
Oh, it's super hot.

154
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,400
Beer, wait for me.

155
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,680
It's insanely hot.

156
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,800
It’s like I've just escaped death.

157
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
True.

158
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,600
Oh.

159
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,680
There are books in this café too.

160
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,160
Looks like a library.

161
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,880
I saw that this place is nearby.

162
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,520
I thought Diew might like it.

163
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,000
Well then, I'll go
check out the books.

164
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,280
Okay.

165
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,760
Take a picture for me.

166
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,600
Okay.

167
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,600
- He's coming!
- One, two...

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,280
Don't make a funny face. No.

169
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,240
Put on a good face.

170
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,280
(It's a bad day, not a bad life.)

171
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,640
Hey, guys, I took a lot of photos.
Do you want to see?

172
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Let's see them.

173
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
You can look at them first.

174
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,840
Hey Beer,

175
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,120
did you check my face at all?

176
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,040
Why does only Wan
look good in all the photos?

177
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,920
Oh, well,

178
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,600
nothing I can do.
Some people are just good-looking.

179
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,040
You're handsome
in a weird way, aren't you?

180
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,080
You want to pick a fight, don't you?

181
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,800
You're showing favoritism.

182
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
- What favoritism?
- Check out my face.

183
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,600
Is it your own face that's the problem?

184
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,240
Guys,

185
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,960
Turn it down.
You're disturbing other people.

186
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,840
He's biased.

187
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,800
Oh,

188
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,920
it was only slightly noisy.
Why make it a big deal?

189
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Let's go somewhere else.

190
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm strarted to get bored.

191
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,520
True.

192
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
Honestly, there's nothing much here.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,440
True.

194
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,880
I want to go take photos somewhere else.

195
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
- Hey, wait...
- God.

196
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,680
You go find Diew.

197
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,320
Wait a moment.
Why do you have to be in a rush?

198
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,280
Otherwise, the light will go away.

199
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,960
Who's blocking the camera?

200
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,360
Give it back to me
and take new photos for me.

201
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,760
Make sure they look good.

202
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,920
See, Diew's coming.

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,080
I've finished looking.
Let's move on to somewhere else.

204
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,760
Are you feeling rested?

205
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,920
You don't need to rush.

206
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,800
God, stop.

207
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,160
I’m feeling rested.

208
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
So, what do we do?

209
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,480
Shall we go now?

210
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,640
Yes, let's go.

211
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,960
Let's go.

212
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,120
Take it and eat it in the car.

213
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,280
Okay.

214
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,400
I'll hold it for you.

215
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,680
Give it to me.

216
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,400
- Watch your step.
- Beer!

217
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,320
Where's the "Mek"
you were talking about?

218
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,520
This is the "Mek"
we're standing by.

219
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,200
It's an ancient city wall that's been
around for a thousand years.

220
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,600
The wall is so high because

221
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,080
it was built to protect
against invasions

222
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,560
and flooding.

223
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,680
Wow,

224
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,920
it's been around for so long.

225
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,760
People back then were
really skilled, weren't they?

226
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,600
Yes.

227
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,880
Hey guys,

228
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,880
let's take some photos.

229
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,120
The lighting is perfect right now.

230
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,480
Hey, let's go. Come on.

231
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,160
The lighting is perfect.

232
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,480
Over there, let's take photos over there.

233
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,520
Come on. Let's take a photo.

234
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,920
God.

235
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,720
Let me share the bill

236
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,000
of the drinks from the café.

237
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
No,

238
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,360
let me pay for it. Please.

239
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,600
Oh, Diew.

240
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,760
Don’t you want
God paying for you?

241
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,360
Then how about
he pays for me instead?

242
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,320
True.

243
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,920
God, you can cover it for me instead.
I'm happy to let you.

244
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,040
Let's go.

245
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,360
Diew.

246
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,800
About the café earlier, I really
don't mind paying for you.

247
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,120
Then, let me pay next time.

248
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,040
Okay, next time.

249
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,040
God, hurry!

250
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,080
Come on. Let's take a photo.

251
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,560
Yeah, I know.

252
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,240
Always rushing.

253
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,360
Come on.

254
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,520
Hurry.

255
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,360
- Hey, Bew.
- What?

256
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,760
What do you want to eat today?
Let me know.

257
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm going to eat
everything that's on the menu.

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,480
I'll tell you that
this place is really delicious.

259
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,480
Lead the way.

260
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,640
Diew, eat up.

261
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,840
This is really delicious.

262
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,880
You’re torturing a single like me.

263
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Give it a taste.

264
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,000
How is it?

265
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,240
Is it delicious?

266
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,240
It's... okay.

267
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,000
Have your meal, little Lin.

268
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
The steamed tilapia is here.

269
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,880
Would you like anything else?

270
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,040
No, that's all.

271
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,720
Thank you.

272
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,040
- I want the eyes.
- Steamed fish.

273
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,240
Wow.

274
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,600
Here it is.

275
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,120
I've removed all the bones
for you, and be careful, it's hot.

276
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,200
Here, eat this with it.

277
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,160
Aren't you going to eat?

278
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,120
I can eat later.
Don't worry about it.

279
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,240
You go ahead and eat first.

280
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,960
I want to eat the fish too.

281
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,120
Can you do it for me too?

282
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,760
Sorry,

283
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,920
but a single like you
have to do it on your own.

284
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,480
Oh!

285
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,800
Clean up the pieces
of your broken face too.

286
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,920
Diew, look at what he is doing to me.

287
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,920
This dish is a signature one.

288
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,280
Give it a try.

289
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,200
Yum, yum.

290
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,440
Eat the soup, okay? Little Lin.

291
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,840
I'm sorry.

292
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,240
I'll wipe it for you, Little Lin.

293
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,800
I’m sick of these lovey dovey.

294
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,080
I'd rather bother Wan instead.

295
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,920
Wan.

296
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,520
Will I ever be able to eat in peace?

297
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,720
Give me the fish, please.

298
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,840
You scoop it yourself.

299
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,120
Can you debone the fish for me?

300
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,040
Diew, are you okay?

301
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
I’ll be better if you eat with me.

302
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,720
The extra grass jelly
you ordered has arrived.

303
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,840
Here, this is great!

304
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,400
Come here, I'll help you.

305
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,680
Thank you.

306
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,040
Please help pass it.

307
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,480
Thank you.

308
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,520
Give me.

309
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,800
Let's eat.

310
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,480
Jern, what do you need to say to them?

311
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,080
Enjoy your meal.

312
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,840
She's so cute.

313
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,040
I want to carry her home.

314
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,480
Diew.

315
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,080
God, I don't
really feel like eating yet.

316
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,760
Please don’t be too stubborn, handsome brother.

317
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,560
or you'll end up like Little Lin.

318
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,200
Okay, Jern,

319
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,960
let them eat.

320
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,640
Enjoy your meal, okay?

321
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,720
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your meal.

322
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Hey, guys,

323
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,400
it's already getting late.

324
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,920
I think we should hurry up
and go to the waterfall.

325
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,480
Okay, then I'll go pay first.

326
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,560
Alright, got it.

327
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,160
How much is it, Miss?

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,800
That’s just how kids talk.

329
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,920
Don't take it seriously, okay?

330
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,320
Okay, come on.

331
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,880
- Let's eat the grass jelly.
- God.

332
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,080
I have something
I want to talk.

333
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,360
Sure, what is it?

334
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,840
But this probably
isn't the right place.

335
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Sure,

336
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,360
whatever you want.

337
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,800
Guys.

338
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,040
I've just paid the bill.

339
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,200
Beer, you calculate
how much for each of us.

340
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,280
Combine my share with Diew's, okay?

341
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,400
I'll wire you later.

342
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,920
Okay, details in the group chat.

343
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,600
Didn’t we say I’ll pay for this one?

344
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,280
It's okay.
Let's do it next time.

345
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,680
Thank you so much for saving my life.

346
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,840
This waterfall
is really huge

347
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,200
Wow, it's so cold!

348
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,440
Oh my god!

349
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
- No!
- You asked for it.

350
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,160
You're going to fight, right?

351
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,800
God, come down quickly.

352
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,120
- Okay.
- Hurry.

353
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,800
Come on, Diew.

354
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,240
- Diew, hurry.
- Okay.

355
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,080
You go first.

356
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,120
Why?

357
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,520
I will

358
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,120
take the picture for you

359
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
so I won't get wet.

360
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,440
No need to take a picture.
Just come down together

361
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,320
and hold my hand.

362
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,200
Hurry, God!

363
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,400
Okay.

364
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,600
(Veterinary Hospital)

365
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,040
You go ahead and
play in the water first.

366
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,360
Wait...

367
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,320
Hurry.

368
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,360
Where are you going, Diew?

369
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,080
Yes, okay.

370
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,760
Sure.

371
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,400
Okay, thank you.

372
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Have you finished your phone call?

373
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,440
Is someone in trouble?

374
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,720
No one is in trouble.

375
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,560
The vet nurse just called to update

376
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,800
on Khun Shy's wealth.

377
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,360
And is he okay?

378
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,680
Okay.

379
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,240
She said that he ate a lot.

380
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,920
And you?
Are you okay?

381
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,720
If I say I'm not okay,

382
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,240
what will you do?

383
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,840
I will try to do everything

384
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,400
to make you feel better.

385
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,560
The way that you
taking such good care of me,

386
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,200
I really appreciate it.

387
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,320
But...

388
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,800
Since you're here for a vacation,

389
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,480
you can have
some fun with your friends too.

390
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,360
You don't need to worry
about me all the time.

391
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,800
But I'm happy to do it for you.

392
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,880
I want you to enjoy
your vacation time with me.

393
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,400
But I feel like a kid,

394
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,680
a kid who

395
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,280
always needs help from others.

396
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,560
I...

397
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,320
I really don't like it.

398
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,920
I think I want to be a good boyfriend.

399
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,800
I want to treat you

400
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,440
and make sure you enjoy

401
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,360
a relaxing vacation.

402
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,200
But if that’s what
makes you unhappy,

403
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,560
then I'm sorry.

404
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,240
God.

405
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,720
You're a really great boyfriend.

406
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,720
but you know what they say

407
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,120
Too much of anything can be a bad thing.

408
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,160
I want to share my life with you.

409
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,840
I didn’t see things
from your perspective.

410
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,960
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,600
You don't need to apologize at all.

412
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,640
You have done nothing wrong.

413
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,440
It just

414
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,120
felt like I was
with a service dog.

415
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,600
You said I’m a dog again.

416
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,880
What?

417
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,240
I didn’t

418
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,560
Not at all.

419
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,960
I heard you loud and clear—"service dog".

420
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,040
Well, it's true.

421
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,080
I've seen it on TV before,

422
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,640
they help guide people around

423
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,840
and take care of everything.

424
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,120
Okay,

425
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,720
then I’ll give you a bathing service.

426
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,160
- No!
- Come here.

427
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,160
Like this.

428
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,200
God!

429
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,360
I'll give you a bath then.

430
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,360
Let me give you a bath.

431
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,920
Stop it.

432
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,160
No paparazzi shot please.

433
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,000
Why not?

434
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Since we're here together

435
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
and haven't taken
a couple's photo yet,

436
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,680
let's do a selfie together!

437
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,320
Shall we go now?

438
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,240
Sure, before it gets dark.

439
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,880
Come here!

440
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,080
I’m jealous of that couple.

441
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,280
Why? Do you want to have a partner too?

442
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,320
I don't know.

443
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
I'm just ranting.

444
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,720
Do you want me
to find a partner for you?

445
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
You? Find a partner for me?

446
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,800
Hey, I really can find
someone for you, you know.

447
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,520
This guy.

448
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,600
He's single.

449
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,800
You're single,

450
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,480
so why not just get together
and be done with it?

451
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,320
Are you crazy?

452
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,160
We’ll get a heaven strike.

453
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,720
What a smart mouth.

454
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,600
Don't let me see you
get pushed by a ghost!

455
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,440
What ghost?

456
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,920
It's me. I'm the ghost.

457
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,720
Darn it, Bew!
What the heck are you doing?

458
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,960
What?

459
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,760
It's done.

460
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,880
What's wrong with you?

461
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,160
Oh, nothing. I'm just sore.

462
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,280
Hey, Bew!

463
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,640
Hey,

464
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
the van is here!

465
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,720
Bew is already sleepy.

466
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,720
Diew.

467
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,160
Come sit with me.

468
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,320
Let's go.

469
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,280
What's going on with you?

470
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,960
You won't die if you stay
away from him for a bit, God.

471
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,400
Let's go, Diew.

472
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,040
- No!
- I agree.

473
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,440
Hurry, hurry.

474
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,480
I actually think
what Bew said is true.

475
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,720
Yeah, I was going to ask you before
but kept forgetting.

476
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,560
About what?

477
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,960
Did you choose to come to Phrae

478
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,280
because you-

479
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,160
Are you coming or not?

480
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,320
I'm feeling sleepy already.

481
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,080
Otherwise, I'll drive off first.

482
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,600
Do you know the hotel's address?

483
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,960
Come here quickly, right now!

484
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,360
I'm sleepy. Hurry up!

485
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,120
Come on, God.

486
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,200
Bew, go sit somewhere else.

487
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,320
You should separate and
be on your own for a bit.

488
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,720
(Homely Nest @ Phrae)

489
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,200
You picked a good place to stay, Beer.

490
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,800
Beer.

491
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,520
Could you pay a bit
of attention to me, please?

492
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,280
What's up with you?

493
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,160
I was just going
to say that I like...

494
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,800
You like...

495
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,920
I like it when I get to
visit new places like this.

496
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,680
Of course you'd like it.

497
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,920
Everything has been taken care of for you.

498
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,600
You just

499
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,800
eat, sleep, and enjoy yourself.

500
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,680
Well,

501
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,640
with a good friend like this, of course.

502
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,960
When we get back, I'll make sure
to give you a tip, okay?

503
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,280
Give it to me.

504
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,480
What are you doing, Wan?

505
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
Why are you so
obsessed with the camera?

506
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm right in front of you.

507
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,560
You can look at the pictures
when we get home, can't you?

508
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,840
Let me see.

509
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,880
Wan.

510
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,160
I...

511
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,000
Why my picture that you took,
doesn’t look like me at all?

512
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,200
Yeah,

513
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,720
I'm sorry then,

514
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,480
for taking bad photos of you.

515
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,000
Oh, not like that.

516
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,920
I mean,

517
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,960
it's like you know all my angles.

518
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,160
I never knew I looked this good!

519
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,480
What are you doing?

520
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,520
There aren't any pictures
of you on the camera.

521
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,680
All day, you've been taking
photos of  the gang.

522
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,200
I'm just not used to having
someone take my picture.

523
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,560
No,

524
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,960
I don't know

525
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,800
what face should I make.

526
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,520
But I want to be the first person
to take a picture of you, Beer.

527
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,160
No, I'm embarrassed.

528
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,080
I

529
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,360
just want to
see your face up close.

530
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,480
That's Bew's voice.

531
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,840
Bew! What's wrong?

532
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,120
Bew! What is it?

533
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,760
Guys,

534
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,000
I saw...

535
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,880
What did you see?

536
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,080
I saw...

537
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,720
Hey, it's me.

538
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,920
