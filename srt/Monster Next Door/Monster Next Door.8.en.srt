Come on, come on.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,600
I'm so excited.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,960
I'm excited too.
My hands are freezing.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,520
Hey... we...!

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,680
We made it to the next round!

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,240
We made it to the next round!

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,920
Let’s practice even harder.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,920
Yeah, also get
ready for the next round.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,000
But can we celebrate today?

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,600
Practice comes first.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,760
Yes, yes.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,800
- Fine, then.
- Come on, everyone,

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,400
Let’s go.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,240
Okay.

00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,840

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,200
(felt so good and excited.)

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,240
Well, well,

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,040
what are you thinking about?

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
No!

53
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,320
I wasn’t thinking about anything!

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,800
There’s no need to be shy at all.

55
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,800
As a couple,

56
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,520
it’s something you’ll have to do anyway.

57
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,520
Just take things slowly
with something like this.

58
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,680
God hasn't said anything yet,

59
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,800
right, Diew?

60
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,120
There’s a first time for everything.

61
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,000
It’s better to be prepared.

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,880
Whatever happens

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,320
will happen.

64
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,880
Prepare myself?

65
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,560
Hello, Grandpa.

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,480
Hello, Diew.

67
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,880
Have you finished the exam?

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,720
I’ve finished the exam.

69
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,200
How have you been lately, Grandpa?

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,200
I'm fine, don't worry.
Check out my guns.

71
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,400
So firm, see?

72
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Hey, Diew,

73
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
your mom wanted to know

74
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,600
if you’re coming home
for the school break.

75
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,920
Um,

76
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,320
do you remember the friend
next door that I told you about?

77
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,920
Yes, I do.

78
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,880
His name is God.

79
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,720
Well, during this school break,

80
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,480
he invited me to go on a trip
out of Bangkok with him.

81
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,360
So, do you want to go?

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,040
I do want to go.

83
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,320
I’d like to try
doing something new.

84
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,480
That sounds good,

85
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,680
but don’t forget to
share your trip photos for me.

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,440
I don’t know if I will go yet, Grandpa.

87
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,480
Why not?

88
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,720
Well, the others going on the trip
are God’s friends,

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,400
but I’m only close to God...

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,120
You’re coughing?
Are you alright?

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,720
I'm fine.

92
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,400
I’m as strong as ever, kid.

93
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,040
Look.

94
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,800
Can you see?

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,200
Okay,

96
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,640
but, anyway

97
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,760
So I'm hesitating
whether to go or not.

98
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,880
Grandpa, are you
sure you’re feeling okay?

99
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,080
I’m sure. I’m absolutely fine.

100
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,440
I just choked on the rambutan
that your mom gave me.

101
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,080
The rambutan this season
are great. Look.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,880
See?

103
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,800
But you haven’t eaten any of it yet.

104
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,080
Oh my, it’s time,

105
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,880
my TV show is waiting for me

106
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Got to go.

107
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
Okay, but you need
to take care of yourself too.

108
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,320
I'm worried.

109
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,440
Don’t worry. I’m perfectly healthy.

110
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,400
And don’t forget to let me know

111
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,480
whether you’re going
on the trip with them or not.

112
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,600
I’m hanging up now

113
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,120
Grandpa!

114
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,120
(God:)

115
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,520
(Are you almost here?)

116
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
(I’ve already
ordered our food.)

117
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,320
Oh, God.

118
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,520
Come inside first.

119
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,520
How was the audition result?

120
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,720
It’s just as I thought.

121
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
It's okay. Next time...

122
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,080
We’ve passed the audition.

123
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh,

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
You startled me!

125
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,080
Congratulations.

126
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,040
Can you also reward me with...

127
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,480
a kiss on the cheek?

128
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,400
Come closer, then.

129
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,720
Wait here for a bit.

130
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,240
Okay?

131
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,560
- Okay.
- Close your eyes too.

132
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,960
Do I have to close my eyes too?

133
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,280
No peeking.

134
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,320
Hurry up.

135
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,120
Someone really wants
his cheek to be kissed.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,840
Keep your eyes closed.

137
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
What is this?

138
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,240
Can’t he also be happy for you?

139
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,880
God!

140
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,360
Someone’s boyfriend smells really good.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
Stop it.

142
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,920
Did you just kiss me?

143
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,280
Thank you.

144
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,480
Hello?

145
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,040
Oh, you’ve arrived?

146
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,280
Just leave it there,
I’ll go get it.

147
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,640
Okay, thank you.

148
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,520
Food is here.

149
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,440
I’ll go get it now.

150
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,720
Okay.

151
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,000
Be quick.

152
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,760
Someone already misses you.

153
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay.

154
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,880
(I think Pee is my first love.)

155
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,720
(I wonder if
he feels the same way.)

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,280
God, I'm back.

157
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,000
Did you wait long?
The deliver guy got lost.

158
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,800
Not at all.

159
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,680
What were you doing?

160
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,840
I was just looking around.

161
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,800
Let’s eat now.
Shall we?

162
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,880
Wow, that’s a big bite.

163
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,720
Yummy.

164
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,440
That photo from his diary

165
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,880
is definitely his ex.

166
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,640
Calm down.

167
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,200
Maybe it’s not what you think.

168
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,840
If you don’t believe me,
just ask him.

169
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,440
Everyone has a past,

170
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,520
but right now, Diew’s boyfriend

171
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
is you.

172
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,960
True!

173
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,080
What do you mean by 'true'?

174
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,560
This sushi is truly delicious.

175
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,480
It’s my favorite.

176
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,320
- Right?
- Right.

177
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,160
It's really delicious.

178
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,680
So much laundry to do.

179
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,360
Seems like no one comes here.

180
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,280
It's good that there
aren't many people today.

181
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,320
This one.

182
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,400
Give me.

183
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,880
Aah!

184
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,960
Why do we have to do the laundry?

185
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,960
Why don't clothes wash themselves?

186
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,040
It would be great if
that happened.

187
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,720
Right?

188
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,840
Our job is just to
put the clothes in the machine.

189
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,760
You’re such a dummy.

190
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,240
And I’ve told you so many times

191
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,880
that colored clothes need to
be washed separately from the whites.

192
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,240
We’ve put the clothes
in the machine already.

193
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,640
Why doesn’t it separate
the colors by itself?

194
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,440
You’re talking as if
you are the one doing it.

195
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,720
That’s true,

196
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,560
but thinking about it,

197
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,720
it would be nice
if it were possible.

198
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,000
That way, you wouldn’t get tired.

199
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,680
If you don’t want me to get tired,

200
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,200
then you should do
it yourself sometimes.

201
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,880
What will you do if I'm not around?

202
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,680
Hey!

203
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,720
you’re going
to stay with me anyway.

204
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,560
You’re not going
to leave me, right?

205
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,560
Sure,

206
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,840
I’m not going anywhere.

207
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,760
Whoever gets to be
your boyfriend is super lucky.

208
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,160
I don’t want you to ever have a boyfriend.

209
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,840
I’m jealous.

210
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,040
Well, well,
I can’t ever touch you anymore, now?

211
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,360
Fine. Won’t touch you, then.

212
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,520
- Wan.
- What?

213
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,600
Here comes

214
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,720
Wan.

215
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,200
Wan, I'm ticklish.

216
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,160
Exactly, you’re ticklish.

217
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,040
You want to go?

218
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,680
If I really get a boyfriend,

219
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,600
what are you going to do?

220
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Oh, Beer!

221
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,760
I didn’t expect to see you.

222
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,760
And are you...

223
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Yeah, I’m just sleepy.

224
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,920
and this floor looks kinda comfy...

225
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
Come on, get up.

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,400
This is Ton, my friend
from the photography club.

227
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,680
Uh, Ton, this is Wan.

228
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,400
Hey, Beer,

229
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,480
About the thing
you asked for my help,

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,840
any updates?

231
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,400
Aren't you going to introduce him?

232
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,560
This is my boyfriend.

233
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,960
Hello.

234
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
Ton has told me a lot about you.

235
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,960
Ton!

236
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Did you badmouth me to your boyfriend?

237
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,520
Hey, easy now.

238
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,920
Badmouth?

239
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,800
You’re just like a saint.

240
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,640
What saint?

241
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,080
Just tell me what he said.

242
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,920
I just told you.
Nothing to badmouth about.

243
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,080
Are you sure?

244
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,200
Don't tell him.

245
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,640
- Ton!
- What?

246
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,040
Tell me, tell me now.

247
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,880

I going to stay and practice a bit more.

Don’t overdo it.
Save your strength for tomorrow.

261
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,840
Yeah, I know.

262
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,160
Save your energy
for tomorrow too, man.

263
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,480
Okay, okay.

264
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,000
See you, guys.

Well, we're going then.

Why are you pacing around?

I’m getting cross-eyed.

301
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,040

to ask you.

Even though they're a bit old,

310
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,200
they should be usable.

311
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,800
This is the best I could find.

312
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,640

than enough. Thanks.
