Mr. Shy.

6
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,360
Are you hungry?

7
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Not used to the new room, are you?

8
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,960
You'll be back in our room soon.
Just wait abit.

9
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,840
(Thai Pun) A hammer is for hitting,
but my love and kisses are only for you.

10
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,680
(Thai Pun) Good people like to correct things,

11
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,800
but someone like me just likes you.

12
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,920
Are you sneaking around?

13
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not sneaking.

14
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm just reading it.

15
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,720
Would you like me
to read it out loud?

16
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,280
(Thai Pun) Street-side noodle soup is fine,

17
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,000
but if you're free, I'd like to
have a meal on your side.

18
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,520
You must have a certain level
of courage to do this.

19
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,320
Why?

20
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,000
Are you not going to let me
score any points at all?

21
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Your score is now negative.

22
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,920
But if you want to earn more points,

23
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,480

It's there, God!

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,440
You might want to put that away first?

Okay, okay.

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,040
You wait here, okay?

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,000
God, be careful.

God!

52
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes?

53
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,320
Just be chill.

54
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,400
Let me go first.

55
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,960
I did it!

56
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,640
Then what's next?

57
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,520
What should we do?

58
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,520
Aunty.

59
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,560
Yes, dear?

60
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,040
Well, there's a spider...

61
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,400
Oh, so the little rascal is here!

62
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,040
Yes, someone
mentioned the other day

63
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,360
that a spider got lost.

64
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,720
Okay.

65
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,440
- Thanks for bringing it back.
- Okay.

66
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,120
I'll return it to them now.

67
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Hey, I've got goosebumps all over.

68
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,280
Thank you.

69
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,280
God! Diew!

70
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
Yes?

71
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,680
What's up?

72
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,600
Did you and Diew sleep together?

73
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,760
Yes, that's right.

74
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,840
Yes, that's right.

75
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,960
But, because, the spider. That spider.

76
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,200
A spider got into his room,

77
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,240
so I suggested that
he sleep in my room.

78
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,960
for the spider's safety.

79
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,280
But we didn't do anything.

80
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,880
We just slept.

81
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,480
Well, we did hug a little,

82
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,360
But there was nothing else.
I didn't do anything to him.

83
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,880
But I did smooch his forehead a bit.

84
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,760
God!

85
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,000
Stop talking.

86
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,800
Why make it more ambiguous than it already is?

87
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,760
Right.

88
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,280
Un, then me excus-

89
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,320
Excuse us.

90
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Okay.

91
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,960
That one is fully booked,
so we didn't get any.

92
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,240
How about we go cook
and eat in the room instead?

93
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,360
Well,

94
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,560
are you interested
in the matching items?

95
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,000
That's nice.

96
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,960
God has been doing us many favors.

97
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,960
Have you bought him something cute?

98
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,480
Matching shirts are too common.

99
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,200
Let's go for something else.
There are so many options,

100
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,240
like matching phone cases
or something like that.

101
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
A gift...

102
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,520
Have you been waiting long?

103
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,800
Not at all.

104
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
Let's go! This handsome rider
is ready to take you.

105
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
Let's go.

106
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,160
Come on, I'll take it for you.

107
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,520
Take it easy.

108
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,520
Very good.

109
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,440
Good job.

110
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120

115
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,200
He's just here to drop me off.

Anyway, have fun drawing today.

119
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,640
Sure.

120
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,920

123
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,920
Are you taking drawing class too?

124
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,840
Yes.

125
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,680
Well, I'll get going.

126
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,080
Anyway, just call me.

127
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,840
- Bye-bye, God.
- Bye-bye.

128
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,680
Bye-bye.

129
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,120
Shall we go to class?

130
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,000
As I mentioned before,
there are various ways

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
to pair colors,

132
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,840
whether it's monochrome,

133
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,120
analogous colors,
or complementary colors.

134
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,320
For example,

135
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,040
when we think of Van Gogh,

136
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
we immediately
think of the color yellow.

137
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,520
In the Starry Night,

138
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,160
he used blue and yellow, which are

139
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,920
complementary colors,
paired together.

140
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,720
I recommend that

141
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,120
if you can't think of anything,

142
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
you can start by
using colors you like first.

143
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you.

144
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,320
Colors I like?

145
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,160
Diew.

146
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,440
How about trying mixing
this color with this color?

147
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,520
Draw often and you'll get better.

148
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,360
I practice drawing frequently

149
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,000
because I want to see

150
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,760
how my skills improve.

151
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,480
Wow.

152
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,920
Game.

153
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,760
Yes? Wait a sec, Diew.

154
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,440
What's up, Win?

155
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,480
Do you think it's good to pair
this color with this color?

156
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,320
Why don't you try mixing
this color with that color?

157
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,720
It will give you another shade.

158
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,760
Okay, I'll try to organize
the color tones.

159
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,200
I think you should try mixing
this color tone with this color tone.

160
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,600
This is for you.

161
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,960
Why am I so nervous?

162
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,400
I'm giving this to you because...

163
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,640
Because...

164
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,440
God!

165
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
This is for you.

166
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,520
This is for you.

167
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,680

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,720
Diew.

169
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,120
This evening, I have practice,

170
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,520
so I might not be able to pick you up.

171
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,160
Sure, okay.

172
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,480
You have an audition
this week, right?

173
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,240
I have something
to give you as well.

174
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,960
On what occasion?

175
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,200
I’m not telling.

176
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,240
See you this evening.
Hurry up and go now!

177
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,080
Hey!

178
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,040
Bye-bye.

179
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,720
"The treasure quest started!"

180
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,720
"Can you find a wind chime?"

181
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,760
Diew.

182
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,480
Diew, are you there?

183
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,800
"The first place we ate together."

184
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,480
"The place where there the letter is"

185
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,120
"The first place
where we almost met."

186
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,400
- Take it to that table.
- Okay.

187
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,640
Kid!

188
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,880
Yes?

189
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,480
You're looking for this, right?

190
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,920
Hey, right! Thank you.

191
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,320
Okay.

192
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,920
"The place where you told me
about the drums."

193
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,480
God!

194
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,360
Diew!

195
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,280
Why are you giving this to me?

196
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,880
I want to thank you

197
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,240
for doing so much for me.

198
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,200
For being a rider

199
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,680
also helping with the spider thing.

200
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,480
Thank you.

201
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,800
Can I open it now?

202
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,320
I want to know what's inside.

203
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,680
Is this for

204
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,160
keeping my drumsticks?

205
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,880
And this one is mine.

206
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,680
Thank you.

207
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,600
Open it and see what's inside.

208
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,800
I really like it.

209
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,320
How can you be so cute?

210
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,400
I want to send you my support through

211
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,680
these drumsticks when you compete.

212
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,240
I initially want to buy it just for you.

213
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,720
But then I thought

214
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
it would be cute to keep my brushes too

215
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,360
so it could be a matching item.

216
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,840
That way, we can be matched
when we go out.

217
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,440
Here, it's for the brushes.

218
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,720
Thank you.

219
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,160
Okay, God.

Is it already 10 PM again?

227
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,400
Alright, let's pack up.

228
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,920
Come on.

229
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,840
Huh?

230
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,600
What?

231
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,120
Did I do wrong?

232
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,160
No.

233
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,040
I don't think I played it wrong.

234
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,680
I put my effort to practice all night.

235
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,640
I get it now. I want

236
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,560
our band to play
together like this tomorrow.

237
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,440
Finally, the day
I've been waiting for

238
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,480
has arrived.

239
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,600
Tomorrow, we just make it

240
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,200
the same as it was during practice.

241
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,680
Seriously, if we perform
like we did today tomorrow,

242
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,160
we'll definitely make it through.

243
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,320
Thank you

244
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
for your dedication.

245
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,000
Hey, why took so long

246
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,760
for you two to talk nicely?

247
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,600
Yeah, it's good that
they are on good term.

248
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,600
Hey, God.

249
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,480
Are those new drumsticks?

250
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Who gave it to you?

251
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,680
With cute cartoons, too!

252
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,320
Yeah, someone important gave it to me.

253
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,720
Someone important!

254
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,800
Hey, you got it!

255
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,200
With such great support,

256
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,600
don't mess it up tomorrow.

257
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,600
Come on. Let's go home!

258
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,960
Let's go home now.
We have a competition tomorrow.

259
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,920
Let's go home!

260
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,440
God, let's go.

261
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,760
Come on.

262
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,880
- See you.
- See you tomorrow.

263
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,200
Hello,

264
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
we are the band

265
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Friends from the Moon.

266
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,840
Hello.

267
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,880
You can introduce your band to us
when you’re ready.

268
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,720
Okay, we are Friends from the Moon.

269
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,360
The five of us came together
to form this band

270
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,960
because of a shared dream.

271
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,480
Currently,

272
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,160
we are the band of
the Faculty of Engineering.

273
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,520
You're already
well-known in the university.

274
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,960
Why are you auditioning?

275
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,920
Your drum line is amazing!

276
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,640
Let me show you, too.

277
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,040
I've practiced a lot.

278
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,800
This time, I think you'll easily pass

279
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,160
the audition and secure a place in the band.

280
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,520
Isn't it already a given?

281
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,400
How about a toast, my friend?

282
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,280
Let's wait and see
the results first.

283
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,440
The drummer who will be joining
the band Friends from the Moon

284
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,040
is… Congratulations to God!

285
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,600
The reason we came to audition

286
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,280
is that we want the band
to be more widely recognized.

287
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,000
We want everyone

288
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,480
to see our skills.

289
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,160
As the frontman,

290
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,000
I want to say that
we have practiced very hard.

291
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,240
Although there have been obstacles,

292
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
I believe that
they will help us grow.

293
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,600
Thank you all for
giving us this opportunity.

294
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,480
You can start when you’re ready.

295
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,200

will be announced on the website.

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,520
Thank you for coming
to audition today.

310
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,960
Thank you.

311
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,000
I think I gave it my all.

312
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,840
I really have put everything
into this opportunity.

313
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,880
Yeah, I know.

314
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,640
(He looks so cute
when he's sleeping.)

315
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,640
(Like a baby.)

316
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,360
Or is he bored?

317
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,000
There's nothing to do,

318
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,000
just sit around watching you read.

319
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,800
No, it's not that.

320
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,040
He's just tired, so he's sleepy.

321
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,840
Why don't you ask him to go outside?

322
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,280
Will it be good?

323
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,800
Right?

324
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,320
He might want to rest.

325
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,520
Why wouldn't it be good?

326
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,200
For an extrovert like him,

327
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,480
he would probably
be happy to go outside.

328
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,400
Diew.

329
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,920
Diew.

330
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,920
Diew.

331
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,520
Yes?

332
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,000
Are you okay?

333
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,400
No, I was just zoned out.

334
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,720
Have you woken up, God?

335
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,760
I wanted to come here and read books with you,

336
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,640
but I ended up falling asleep.

337
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,480
I've done reading for today.

338
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Do you want to go anywhere?
I will go with you.

339
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,560
Yes, I do!

340
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,240
I have a lot of places I want to go
and things I want to do.

341
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,160
I'm sorry.

342
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,520
I thought you were free.

343
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,000
Should you go running your errands?

344
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,800
Hmm… No, not really.

345
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,160
The place I want to go
and the things I want to do

346
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,200
need you to be there with me.

347
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,840
Let's start by
going to have a meal.

348
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,760
There's a new place that
just opened at the back of the campus.

349
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,720
It sounds like a nice place. Do you want to go?

350
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,240
But I think it's better to go
to your favorite regular spot.

351
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,600
You'd probably like it more.

352
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,560
I want to go to the restaurant
you want to go to.

353
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,760
Okay, then let's
go to this place.

354
