(ESC Pet Clinic)

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,360
Can you please hold this?

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,200
Just go.

38
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,120
Khun Shy's parent please come inside.

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,040
- Hello.
- Hello, doctor.

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,320
Hello.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,280
Well.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,440
From the initial
diagnosis, I found that

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,040
Khun Shy has a cold.

44
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,280
It seems he doesn't do well with
the rapid change of the weather,

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,800
which led to the cold.

46
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,000
Overall, his condition

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,920
isn't too worrisome,

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,880
but I'd like him to be admitted
here for an overnight observation.

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,920
Yes, that's fine.

50
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,920
Alright, I will examine his
condition more thoroughly.

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,320
If everything is fine, you can
come to pick him up tomorrow.

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,520
Thank you so much, doctor.

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,560
You're welcome.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,760
Khun Shy, I'm sorry.

55
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,160
I'll pick you up tomorrow, okay?

56
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,600
Thank you so much, doctor.

57
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,160
Please go to the counter next.

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,640
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

59
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,720
For Khun Shy, right?

60
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,560
Correct.

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,000
Please sign this documents.

62
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,360
It's raining soon.
Let's hurry and head back.

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,560
Okay.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,680
I don't think we can drive back.

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,480
Let's wait out
the rain here for now.

66
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay.

67
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,320
Just go inside.

68
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,680
Are you okay?

69
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,680
Could you hold this for a sec?

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,040
Sure.

71
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,320
Thank you very much, God.

72
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,400
Okay.

73
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,160
No problem at all.

74
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,160
I completely forgot that.

75
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,280
Tomorrow, I have quizs both
in the morning and afternoon.

76
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,160
What should I do?
I also need to pick up Khun Shy.

77
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,040
If you don't mind,
I can go pick him up for you.

78
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,680
I'm available all day since
I don't have any classes.

79
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,560
Are you sure it's convenient
for you? I don't want to impose.

80
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,080
Yes, I am. It's very convenient for me.

81
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,120
Are you still
waiting for my answer?

82
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,960
If possible,

83
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,480
let's get back to talking
like we used to.

84
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,040
Do you still want to talk with me?

85
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,880
Yes, I want to.

86
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,000
I really really want to.

87
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,680
But…

88
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,760
are you okay with it?

89
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,560
Yes,

90
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,880
and I would like to withdraw

91
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,520
my previous requests as well,

92
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,640
because I want to know you better.

93
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
So that means

94
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,280
we can get back to talking
like we used to, right?

95
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,720
No,

96
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,280
we won't be going back
to how we used to talk.

97
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,880
From now on, we will talk face-to-face,

98
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,520
not just through the balcony anymore.

99
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,160
Excuse me.

100
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,120
We've arrived home, Khun Shy.

101
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,240
So refreshing!

102
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Ah,

103
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,680
let's go home then, Khun Shy.

104
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,560
You're home now. Here it is.

105
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,320
May I have
your permission, Khun Shy?

106
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Wow!

107
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,520
Hello.

108
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,680
Hello, God.

109
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,440
I was about to call you.

110
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,920
Khun Shy has safely arrived back
in his place. Don't worry.

111
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,280
Focus on your exams, okay?

112
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,120
Fighting!

113
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,480
Thank you so much, God.

114
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,920
With all my pleasure.

115
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,000
Then I won't
bother you any further.

116
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,600
Okay, bye.

117
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,920
Is there something wrong, Diew?

118
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
Khun Shy was sick and admitted
to the clinic yesterday, Game.

119
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,120
Oh, is it something serious?

120
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
He's not in serious condition now.

121
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,680
The doctor has given
the okay to take him home.

122
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,920
And what about the afternoon quiz?

123
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,800
I had friend next door go pick him
up and bring him back to my room.

124
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,160
To the room... does that mean

125
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,400
you let someone else
into your room?

126
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,920
So, this friend next door

127
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,640
must be quite close to you then.

128
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,120
Actually,
it's because Khun Shy was sick.

129
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,120
I wanted him to return
to the room he's familiar with it.

130
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,520
Oh, I see.

131
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,080
You really trust
this friend a lot, don't you?

132
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,400
Mission completed!
You now entered Diew's room.

133
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,840
The room is very clean

134
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,760
and smells so nice.

135
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,720
Don't do anything stupid.

136
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,840
I really want to just flop
down and lie on his bed.

137
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,600
His bed looks so fluffy, doesn't it?

138
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,920
How about we try lying down?

139
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,720
Stop being naughty!

140
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,960
Could I borrow a tissue, please?

141
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,920
Wow.

142
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,200
Oh.

143
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,560
Oh!

144
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Shoot!

145
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,640
Was that not all of it?

146
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,000
Can I take a break for a sec?

147
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,080
Why do I have such a headache?

148
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,080
Khun Shy! I'm back!

149
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,320
God.

150
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,640
God, God!

151
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,520
Diew.

152
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,960
Are you okay?

153
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm okay.

154
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,600
I felt a bit dizzy cleaning up the room.

155
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,400
I've cleaned up
all the trash for you,

156
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,240
I got rid of all the trash inside
and the bottles outsie.

157
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,760
I noticed that you might've been busy

158
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,080
so I wanted to do something for you.

159
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,320
The bottles outside on the balcony?

160
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,400
Why?

161
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,360
Well...

162
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,560
I've...

163
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
washed them

164
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,680
and planned to use it for my plants.

165
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,080
Oh... hey, I'm sorry.

166
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,600
It's okay, God.

167
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,080
I should go get
the bottles back for you.

168
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,640
The housekeeper probably
hasn't taken them yet.

169
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,800
It's really fine, God.

170
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,240
Are you sure?

171
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,080
No, it's better if I go get
them back for you.

172
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,080
It's okay, God.

173
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,040
You still have a fever.

174
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,120
It's better to rest for now. I'll
bring a cloth to wipe you down.

175
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,120
Um...

176
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,520
Can I wipe you down?

177
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,080
Thank you.

178
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,960
I'm not so cool after all.

179
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Then I'll go back to my room.

180
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,680
You can sleep here for now.

181
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,520
Consider it as

182
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,520
a way to repay you for
picking up Khun Shy for me.

183
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,200
Also, if your fever
worsens during the night,

184
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,640
your condition
might get more serious.

185
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,720
I'll go get a blanket for you.

186
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
Get well soon, Khun Shy.

187
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,080
Get well soon, God.

188
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,800
Good morning.

189
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,840
Are you awake already?

190
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,320
Yes, I am.

191
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,600
You had a high fever yesterday.

192
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,000
Do you want to go see a doctor?

193
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,120
I'm better now.

194
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,200
If you don't believe me,

195
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,400
try feeling my forehead.

196
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,440
What do you say?

197
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,760
I believe you now.

198
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,400
Okay.

199
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,960
These bottles…

200
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,680
Last night, I went to check
the trash disposal area

201
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,960
and saw that the housekeeper
hadn't collected them yet,

202
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,760
so I brought them back to use.

203
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,120
I'm sorry

204
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,400
that I caused you trouble.

205
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,080
How about this? Today,
I'll help you plant the trees

206
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,280
as a way to make up for it.

207
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,120
Is that okay?

208
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,240
So, what do I need to do?

209
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,680
Just...

210
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,040
plant them as usual.

211
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,160
Have you ever planted trees before?

212
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,880
I've been to a mangrove
planting camp before.

213
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,720
Just plant it in the soil and it's done.

214
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,520
I'm really good at planting.

215
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,200
Is this the same?

216
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,120
Just plant it in the ground,
add soil and water,

217
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,440
and it's done.

218
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,800
- Not like that.
- Really?

219
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,120
So, what should I do?

220
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,120
Add the soil.

221
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,800
Oh.

222
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,840
- That's enough.
- Continue, and then what?

223
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,240
Then gently place the seeds down.

224
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,200
There's too much.
Please take some out.

225
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,360
Oh, really? Is it too much?

226
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,840
Yes.

227
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,760
Sorry, sorry.

228
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,400
Okay.

229
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,200
Then cover it with soil.

230
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,160
After that,
make sure to water it every day.

231
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,160
That's it. You're done.

232
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,920
The watering can is so cute.

233
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,320
Um...

234
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,880
You've decorated
your room so nicely.

235
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,480
Everything I look at
is easy on the eyes.

236
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,120
I like the feeling

237
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,240
of being surrounded by nature.

238
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,840
It feels very peaceful.

239
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,120
So, what is your room like?

240
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,000
My room is...

241
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,400
It's just a normal room,

242
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
nothing special.

243
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,160
The only thing is that I have some

244
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,960
merchandize related to
the band Golden Spell

245
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,000
that I like, such as albums,
posters, and t-shirts.

246
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,200
That's really interesting.

247
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
I enjoy listening to music,

248
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,880
but I don't follow bands,

249
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,320
so I don't really
collect any goods.

250
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,920
Well, if you don't mind,

251
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,560
I can give you a tour of my room.

252
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,840
Well...

253
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,040
I need to get ready for class now.

254
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,560
Do you have any classes?

255
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,600
Oh, I have classes too.

256
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,840
How about we go together?
I can give you a ride.

257
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,760
Will you?

258
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,960
God...

259
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,560
You got some dirt here.

260
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,920
Thank you.

261
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,240
If it's not too much trouble,

262
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,680
may I ride with you?

263
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,920
Sure, you can.

264
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,640
I'll clean it up for you.

265
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,520
Okay,

266
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,800
thank you.

267
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,080
Here, it's a helmet.

268
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,640
Excuse me, Diew.

269
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,160
All good now.

270
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,920
Thank you.

271
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,120
