God?

God?

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,240
I like this one.

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,320
I like you, Diew.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,600
I like you so much.

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,400
I like you more than just a friend.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,320
You think the same, right?

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,520
Will you be my boyfriend?

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,360
God!

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,760
Did you come to this event too?

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,880
Lucky me, seeing you here today.

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,200
Who did you come with?

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm with the one that I'm currently seeing.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,760
Oh, Diew, the boring guy.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,680
How come you came together?

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,560
Jane!

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,160
That's not nice coming from you.

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,920
Well,

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,800
it's true.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,360
It's a shame.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,960
Despite his cute look,

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,400
he doesn't even help anything
when people ask for a hand.

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,360
And when people come to talk to him,

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,360
'I don't want to answer'
is written all over his face.

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,560
Jane!

31
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,800
God, over there,

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,360
they have a music show.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,520
It is more fun than here.

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,560
Come on, let's go!

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,080
Then, excuse me.

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,760
Wait, Diew!

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,720
Don't be like that, God.

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Come with me.

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Win and the others are over there too. How fun.

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,560
Let's go.

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,680
Jane.

42
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,160
Turn it off.

43
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,040
I told you to turn it off, Jane.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,760
Bye-bye.

45
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,600
I don't know what's your intention here

46
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,120
but you are invading my privacy,

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,880
which I don't like

48
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,480
and no one would like.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,360
If this were happening to you,
how would you have felt?

50
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,240

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,120
(Two years ago)

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,840
Here we are again, little turtle.

73
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,400
This isn't the same person
from yesterday, is it?

74
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,040
You're all being suck a jerk.

75
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,760
Little turtle, come sit down.

76
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,960
Little turtle,

77
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,240
come sit down.

78
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,320
Come sit down.

79
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,360
Please, excuse me.

80
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
Where is he going?

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,280
He's going to have a chat with turtle.

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,280
Damn it, guys.

83
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,680
Pee!

84
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,880
Diew!

85
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,240
Diew! Why such a hurry?

86
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,720
I want to leave now.

87
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,160
Why?

88
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,400
My friends were going to
ask you about the turtle.

89
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,800
They said they had fun talking to you.

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,160
But I don't.

91
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,440
Diew, what's wrong?

92
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,640
Why are you so tense?

93
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,880
Do you really not know how I feel?

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
You say it, then.

95
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,360
Storming out like this,

96
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,920
not a good look.

97
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,840
I made an effort
bonding you with my friends.

98
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,800
A new social group for you.

99
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,760
And change who you are a little.

100
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,480
Not just stay cooped in your room.

101
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,760
Do you want me to change?

102
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,080
Of course,

103
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,960
you need to socialize more.

104
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,600
Not just be by yourself,

105
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,800
and talk to the turtle every day.

106
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,520
That's not it.

107
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,600
Besides,

108
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,160
who wouldn't want their boyfriend
to get along with their friends.

109
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,960
Anyone in a relationship

110
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
should change themselves
to match with each other.

111
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,480
But it's not that easy for me.

112
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,160
Diew!

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,120
Please wait a moment.

114
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Are you okay, Diew?

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,320
I'm sorry,
but can you please leave me alone?

116
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,440
Diew!

117
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,080
Is he dead?

118
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,040
Can you check on him?

119
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
God!

120
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,560
What's wrong with you?

121
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:57,880
(Diew)

122
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,200
It's not like you lying here like this.

123
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,360
Who hurt you?

124
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,840
Look at him,

125
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,520
this is a dog who got dumped
by his owner.

126
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,360
Come on,

127
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,720
let him be.

128
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,360
Just drink.

129
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,160
Aren't you joining us?

130
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,760
Hello, Grandpa.

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,440
How are you, Diew?

132
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,640
I'm feeding Khun Shy.

133
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
And he's doing well, right?

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,840
Yes,

135
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,520
he's eating well again
and is as strong as ever.

136
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,120
That's good.

137
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,640
I heard from your mom that you went out.

138
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,600
How was it?

139
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,440
It was good.

140
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,200
You said it like that.
Is it actually good?

141
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,480
And who did you go with?

142
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,240
Was it the friend
you mentioned to me before?

143
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,720
No,

144
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,160
I went with the neighbor next door.

145
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,760
The neighbor next door?

146
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,920
That's good.

147
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,680
You have a friend nearby,
so I'll feel more at ease.

148
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,240
You can help each other
if anything happens.

149
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,040
Did you have fun going out?

150
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,480
Well...

151
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,320
Well... it was good.

152
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,160
Why are you making that face
if it was good?

153
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,400
Is it actually good?

154
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,600
Is something wrong?
Can I help?

155
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,240
Do you think
I should change who I am?

156
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,080
Why do you think
you need to change yourself, hmm?

157
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,200
Or did he tell you
to change who you are?

158
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,200
No, he didn't.

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,400
It was just we are so contrastive.

160
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,360
Diew,

161
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
this is between two people.

162
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,000
The reason he hasn't spoken up

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,520
is because he might
not want you to change.

164
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay, then. I have to go now.

165
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,920
Hey, God!

166
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,880
Hey!

167
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,480
God!

168
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,880
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

169
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,520
What's with the zoning out?

170
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,360
- God!
- Diew!

171
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,960
Hey, where are you going, God?

172
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,840
Where are you going?

173
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
God! I think you should rest.

174
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,360
You are wrecked.

175
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,080
Shoot, God, blood...

176
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,920
Wan, take him to sit down.

177
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,320
I'll go get some ice packs and a towel.

178
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,440
Let's go.

179
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,280
- Shoot!
- Be careful.

180
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,040
God, look at you.

181
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,080
Are you alright?

182
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,760
And isn't the fact that

183
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,960
he ran away already clear enough?

184
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,040
He got it all wrong.

185
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,760
Go tell him the truth now.

186
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,040
How about your face?

187
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,080
Are you getting bruise?
Should I go get any medicines?

188
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,640
Just wait a moment.

189
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,240
He's a good guy, isn't he?

190
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,760
Diew!

191
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,120
So many people.

192
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,040
It might not be a good idea going in now.

193
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,360
If you don't go in now,

194
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,640
he won't understand.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
Hey!

196
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,720
Yes?

197
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,000
Could you please
help give these to God?

198
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,600
Are you a fan of God?

199
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,720
It's not a perfect time for him.

200
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,800
These are some medicines,
in case it helps.

201
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,800
Thank you.

202
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,600
I've got the medicine now, guys.

203
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,040
Hey, where did you get it?
How is that so quick?

204
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,480
Someone gave it to me.

205
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,080
Probably a God's fan.

206
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,280
Let me see.

207
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,600
Oh!

208
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,480
It would've turned out fine
if you gave it to him.

209
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,440
It's okay.

210
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,760
You can just send him a message.

211
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,520
(God:)

212
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,480
God. I have something to talk to you...

213
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,160
I'm sorry.

214
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, you've been staring at it.
If I were the medicine bag, I'd be shy.

215
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Hey, are you guys
heading back already?

216
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,080
Hey, why have you just arrived?

217
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,160
I thought you called a rain check.

218
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,320
Yeah, traffic was stuck
because of an accident on campus.

219
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,400
Where?

220
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,480
In front of the library.

221
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,640
Was it a car accident?

222
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,480
- It was a car crashing a person.
- Darn.

223
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,760
I heard that the person
dropped their stuff,

224
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,840
and the car was going fast

225
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
so they crashed real hard.

226
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,480
Was it a woman or a man?

227
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,320
It was a man.

228
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,080
But I'm familiar with his face.

229
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,720
I've seen him often at the library.

230
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,440
Can you remember his face?

231
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,840
I only know that
he's a small, skinny guy.

232
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,200
I heard he's a chemistry student,

233
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,040
but I'm not sure if that's true.

234
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,520
There is no signal from
the number you have dialed.

235
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,000
Diew.

236
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,440
(Emergency)

237
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,040
Excuse me. Hello.

238
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Is there a university student
who was hit by a car?

239
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,480
What is the patient's name?

240
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,600
His name...

241
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,320
Does it hurt a lot, dear?

242
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,520
If it's a university student,

243
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,840
then this is the only person
with a car accident.

244
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,120
Is he your friend?

245
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,200
No, he isn't.

246
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
Thank you.

247
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,160
Okay.

248
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,040
There is no signal from
the number you are calling, please…

249
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,280
Diew!

250
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,480
Are you okay, Diew?

251
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
I couldn't reach you at all.

252
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,800
God, calm down.

253
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,440
You're hurting me.

254
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,400
I'm sorry. Is it hurt?

255
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,520
I'm fine.

256
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,080
It's good that you're fine.

257
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,520
Have you taken
the medicine already?

258
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,760
I knew it was you.

259
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,760
Um...

260
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
I...

261
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,640
Shall we

262
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,240
talk about this inside?

263
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,040
Okay.

264
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,600
Um...

265
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,280
What happened?
Why do you look so shocked?

266
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,760
So you don't know yet.

267
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,320
Someone got hit by a car
in front of the library.

268
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,600
Really?

269
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,680
When I found out,
I was very shocked.

270
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,200
I tried calling you
but couldn't get through.

271
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,200
I was afraid that the person
who got hit might be you,

272
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
because I thought I saw you
at the basketball court…

273
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,200
My battery died.

274
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,200
I'm sorry for making you worry.

275
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,760
Anyway,

276
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,120
you came to me at the campus,

277
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,840
what was that about?

278
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,880
Well, actually, it is...

279
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,440
Um...

280
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,480
I wanted to talk about
what you said that you like me.

281
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,680
And what do you think about it?

282
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,840
If I feel the same way as you,

283
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,920
will anything change?

284
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,920
It's not only just about our status,

285
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,400
but also about everything.

286
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,040
I will not make you uncomfortable.

287
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,640
If you want to change, then change.

288
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,040
But if you don't,

289
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,840
I'll respect your decision.

290
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,520
Is it just for now?

291
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,480
Just the beginning?

292
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,440
Not at all.

293
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,240
Forever.

294
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,520
I want to be your comfort.

295
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,600
But who I am is not...

296
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
You being you now, is the best.

297
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,120
I like that about you.

298
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,760
You are so adorable.

299
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,920
I'm glad that
you are being straightforward.

300
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,440
And I'm sorry for

301
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
making you worry earlier.

302
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
But can I ask you,

303
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,640
please don't walk away from me again?

304
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,320
I'm sorry for
walking away like that.

305
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,200
I was so worried
about you, you know?

306
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,840
Let's go check that out, Diew.

307
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,240
Okay.

308
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,560
Is this the same model as yours?

309
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,520
Yes, it is.

310
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,240
That's pretty cool.

311
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
It looks stylish.

312
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,000
It suits you perfectly.

313
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,840
Okay.

314
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,200
Other ones look interesting too.

315
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,840
Hello!

316
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,280
May I ask if you're
looking for a specific model?

317
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,240
Hello!

318
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm looking for a new phone.

319
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,720
Could you please recommend?

320
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,040
Then I'd recommend this one,

321
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,280
the Reno 12…

322
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,560
Are you ready? Ten seconds.

323
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,040
Let me see.

324
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,080
Hey. This is so cute.

325
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,040
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

326
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,200
After this, are you planning
to go anywhere else?

327
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,600
Probably heading back.

328
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,640
But thank you

329
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,440
for hanging out with me while buying a phone.

330
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,680
It's okay.

331
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,800
if I want to ask you to stroll along the mall

332
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,040
a bit more, would that be alright?

333
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,640
Alright then.

334
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,240
So, where would you like to go?

335
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,360
You always ask me where I'd want to go,

336
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,840
and what about where would you want to go?

337
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,280
I want...

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,600
