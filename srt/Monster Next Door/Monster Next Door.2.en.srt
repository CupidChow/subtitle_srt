00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,720
Diew.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,880
Can we start seeing each other?

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,680
Out of nowhere, I asked you
like this, you'd be surprised, right?

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,320
Can I think about this?

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,920
Sure.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,360
You can

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,360
take your time thinking about it
and then let me know.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,360
Hey, God!

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,960
Why do you want to this?

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,880
I want to know you more.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,520
This is Diew.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,440
Diew, they're my friends.

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
Is this the person you've been dating?

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,920
And is it true that
you like talking to turtles?

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,840
Pee told me that.

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,880
You're such a nerd.

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,840
And how do you talk to turtles?

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,360
Do you speak turtle language?

23
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,800
Next time, if you feel lonely,

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,040
come talk to me instead.

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,000
You don't have to talk to the turtle.

26
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,160
I feel sorry for you.

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,800
We're all friends, after all.

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,040
Don't tease him.

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,280
He just has a turtle friend, that's all.

30
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,320
It's late now.

31
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,600
You have to wake up
early tomorrow, right?

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,600
You go get some rest.

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,320
I'm going to leave now, then.

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,320
If I make you overthink about this.

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,320
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,640
Diew!

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Diew!

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,840
Diew!

60
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,760
What did you just say?

61
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,000
Today in art class, I made a new friend.

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,480
Oh, that's great.

63
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,400
How was he?

64
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
He was okay.

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,600
He was very good at drawing.

66
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,080
When we were studying,
he gave me very good advice.

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,320
It's nice to have someone who likes

68
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,360
or is interested in the same things.

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,840
We ended up

70
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,440
talking a lot about drawing.

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,960
Hmm, that's true.

72
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,960
What did you say?

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,880
Oh, nothing.

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's just keep reading.

75
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,800
Okay.

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,280
(How should I give God an answer?)

77
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,440
Just agree to it right away.

78
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,880
You can tell that he likes you.

79
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,320
He hasn't said anything yet.

80
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,040
We can't just assume

81
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,920
And when he asked to see me,

82
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,440
what does that mean for sure?

83
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,200
Well...

84
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,400
Why do you overthink about this stuff?

85
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,520
It's just someone you’re seeing.

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,560
You feel good about him.

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,160
If you like each other,
then why not be together?

88
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Why wasting time?

89
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,640
Dating?

90
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,480
That's fast. You should
think it through first.

91
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,880
Oh, what are you waiting for?

92
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,080
You only have one life,

93
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,120
so just go and find out.

94
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,280
But

95
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,360
if you regret it again,
what should you do?

96
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,960
Will you be able to take it?

97
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,600
I don't want to be sad again.

98
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,400
Are you a fortuneteller?

99
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,640
How do you know
that he will make you sad?

100
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,320
Does he seem like that kind of person?

101
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,080
He doesn't seem like
that kind of person.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
What should I do, Khun Shy?

103
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,720
Did you call me, Diew?

104
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,920
Yes, I did.

105
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,360
I want to talk about
what you said last night.

106
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,120
About you asking to start seeing each other.

107
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,360
Did I make you overthink?

108
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,240
I mean…

109
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,400
Well...

110
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Let’s start seeing each other.

111
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,800
But I have three things
I want to ask you, God.

112
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,040
What do you want to ask?

113
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,480
Can we not meet in person just yet?

114
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,320
and please don’t tell anyone

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
about my personal matters.

116
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,200
Ahh, okay.

117
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,440
And another one?

118
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,440
Please don't lie to me.

119
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,240
If you have anything to say,
just tell me directly.

120
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,600
That's all I ask.

121
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
Okay.

122
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,640
Thank you

123
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,240
for agreeing to it.

124
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,680
But haven't we met before?

125
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,760
I haven't seen your face.

126
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,040
It's okay.

127
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
So, can I ask

128
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,720
why you don't want us
to meet face-to-face?

129
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,960
Don’t you want to meet me in person?

130
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,560
It's not like that.

131
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,920
I feel at ease
when it’s not face-to-face.

132
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Reading chemistry is so much fun.

133
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,920
It makes you smile from ear to ear.

134
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,000
Look at the line at the smoothie shop.

135
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
What time will we get the drink?

136
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
You go find seats.
I'll go buy it for you.

137
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,640
Excuse me, my friend.

138
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,280
You usually

139
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,760
don't drink smoothies.

140
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,000
You said they have a lot of sugar.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,360
- What's going on?
- Well, today I want to.

142
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,520
I'll order mine with less sugar.

143
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,120
Don’t pick a fight with me.

144
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,640
I'm going now

145
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,680
before the line gets any longer.

146
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,840
Here you are.

147
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,280
Thank you.

148
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,800
Thank you, too.

149
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,120
I want it as usual.

150
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay.

151
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,960
Does Diew like this kind of thing?

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,640
(Personally, I feel that)

153
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,760
(when I see someone in person,
I feel pressured,)

154
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,040
(as if I am expected to say
or do what they think.)

155
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,960
(So from now on,
if you feel uncomfortable)

156
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,560
(or uneasy,)

157
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,840
(you have to tell me directly.)

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
Okay.

159
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,360
I can do that.

160
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,280
Hey guys, I'm leaving now.

161
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,200
Where are you rushing to?

162
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm sleepy. I'm going back to sleep.

163
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,280
Hey, wait,

164
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,960
you're acting weird.

165
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,240
What's wrong with you?

166
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,160
Do you really want to know?

167
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,520
Yes, I do. What's up?

168
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,480
You nosy ass!

169
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,680
- Oh!
- You!

170
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,200
Hey!

171
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,040
Beer!

172
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,960
Where are you going?

173
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,920
Help me!

174
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,280
Hey, Beer!

175
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,280
Back off!

176
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,560
If you help him, I'll be angry.

177
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,560
Stop looking at him, God.

178
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,160
Tell us what's going on right now!

179
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,440
Tell us!

180
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,560
Okay.

181
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,240
Tell me straight. If I let you go
and you run away again,

182
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
I'll definitely drag you into the water.

183
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,680
Well...

184
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,640
The story is...

185
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,800
I won't tell!

186
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,800
- Hey!
- God!

187
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,960
You, come back and tell me first!

188
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,840
God!

189
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,880
Com back!

190
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,720
God!

191
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,640
Wait for me, guys!

192
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,520
Aah!

193
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,280
Very good indeed.

194
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,840
Do you mean my voice or just the guitar?

195
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
The sound of the guitar.

196
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,080
I'm just kidding. It must be your voice.

197
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,960
Wow, I'm so hurt.

198
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
You're even make mean jokes now.

199
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,360
Oh, I might not be able
to talk to you much these days.

200
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,400
I have to go practice the drums.

201
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,000
Really?

202
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,280
Can I ask
why you chose to play the drums?

203
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,840
I was lost in life for a while,

204
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,480
and it was the drum

205
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,480
that helped me regain my senses.

206
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,920
Everything else I do
is just because it's cool.

207
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,200
But as for drums,

208
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,440
it's both my dream and

209
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,360
something I do that brings me happiness.

210
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,960
And how about you?

211
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,840
Do you have any dreams
you want to pursue?

212
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,360
Actually, I don’t
really think about my dreams.

213
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,240
I just want to live peacefully
day by day.

214
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,880
Can this be called a dream?

215
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,800
Sure.

216
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,040
I think our dreams can be anything,

217
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,720
as long as you are happy with them.

218
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,800
Wan!

219
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,200
I've told you many times

220
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,120
to take off your clothes

221
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,520
and put them in the basket.

222
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,800
Oh, I have you. It's okay.

223
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,120
You!

224
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,520
So do I have to pick it
all up every time?

225
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,240
Did you just find out?

226
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,080
I wish you see a ghost in there.

227
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,960
Hey, hey!

228
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,160
What are you saying?
Slap your own mouth right now.

229
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,880
Oh.

230
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,600
Do you shower without
using a towel?

231
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,880
You're right.

232
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,200
Why naked?
Any shame at all?

233
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, aren't you embarrassed by me?

234
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,400
- I'm so disappointed.
- Come here.

235
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,200
What?

236
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,600
Hurry up,

237
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,160
I'll go take a shower.

238
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,440
Thank you, Mr. Beer.

239
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,280
Without you, what would I do?

240
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
I'm going to take a shower first.

241
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,240
Wan!

242
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,240
I'm going to the laundry.

243
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,960
Don't forget to take my stuff with you.

244
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
Um, I know.

245
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,360
Hello. Um.

246
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,640
What's up?

247
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,880
Where are you?

248
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,400
You're getting close, aren't you?

249
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,160
Okay, okay.

250
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,800
That's all for now, man.

251
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,120
Or is he not here?

252
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,240
And why am I getting

253
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,800
getting goosebumps?

254
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,960
Is something wrong?

255
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,880
Oh, ghost!

256
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,960
God, open the door for me!

257
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,840
God!

258
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,480
You know what? Come here quickly.

259
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,680
What's wrong with you?

260
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Are you good?

261
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,680
There's a ghost next door.

262
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,680
Don't be loud,
you’re disturbing the neighbors.

263
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,440
Your next-door neighbor isn't a human.

264
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,640
I saw it with my own eyes.

265
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,920
He's clearly a ghost.

266
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,120
What the heck are you talking about?

267
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,080
Stop talking nonsense and shut up.

268
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,880
God! You have to move out!

269
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,560
What? I just moved in.

270
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,120
Aren't you afraid of ghosts?

271
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,160
Can you shut up?

272
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,440
You have to move out.
A ten-baht ghost, God!

273
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,960
A ten-baht ghost, God!

274
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,480
What is wrong with you?

275
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,440
Hey, wait.

276
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,360
Yes?

277
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,920
It should be your friend's.

278
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,040
Please return him.

279
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,640
Thank you.

280
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
Khun Shy...

281
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,720
You ate a lot today.

282
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,080
Let's take a picture for Grandpa to see.

283
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,880
(Khun Shy, he's grown so much already.)

284
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,520
What's wrong? You look worried.

285
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,040
I have no idea
what university life will be like.

286
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,960
Wait a minute,

287
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,560
I have a gift for you.

288
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,760
Ta-da!

289
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,720
Take this guy with you as a companion.

290
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,600
Turtle,

291
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,880
he's so cute.

292
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,320
Thank you.

293
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,240
You're definitely
not lonely this time, right?

294
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Khun Shy.

295
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,120
It's good to name you, Young Master.

296
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,480
Hello, Young Master,

297
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,520
please help take care of my grandson.

298
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,560
Khun Shy, shy "S-H-Y",

299
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,720
which means shy.

300
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,640
Oh, this name is good too.

301
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,760
When you say it,
you can think of two meanings.

302
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,000
Khun Shy,

303
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,480
please be with my grandson as long as you can.

304
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,560
What's up, son? Turn on the camera, son.

305
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,600
Hello, Mom.

306
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,120
I sent you messages,
but I didn't get a reply.

307
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,480
What are you doing?

308
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,520
I just fed Khun Shy

309
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,760
and about to go study.

310
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,880
Hey!

311
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,800
You disappeared just like that.

312
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,320
Do you know how worried I am?

313
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,840
Like this won't do.

314
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,840
You have to give me
your friend's number.

315
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,040
That way, when I can't reach you,

316
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,440
I won't have to worry.

317
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,160
Which medicine should I take?

318
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,400
Go fetch it for me, will you?

319
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll talk to him myself.

320
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
- Give me, give me.
- Okay, okay.

321
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,800
How are you, Diew?

322
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,080
What's wrong with you, Grandpa?

323
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,320
Why do you have to take medicine?

324
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,840
No, no!

325
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,640
I'm good.

326
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,640
I just want her to go
get some supplements for me.

327
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,720
Oh, I've seen Khun Shy.

328
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,320
He's grown up a lot.

329
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,240
Here you go, Grandpa.

330
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Khun Shy's so big now.

331
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,520
You're right.

332
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,360
Don't think too much
about what she said.

333
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,360
Your mom was just worried.

334
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,520
I know that you are a lovely person,

335
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,320
a lovely grandson.

336
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,800
I love you very much, Diew.

337
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,120
I love you too, Grandpa.

338
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,360
Mommy loves you too, Diew.

339
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,040
Hello.

340
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,640
- I'll take...
- Mixed noodle soup,

341
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,800
without sprouts, no fried garlic,

342
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,440
extra plain rice.

343
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,240
One set to go, right?

344
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,800
Okay. Wait a minute.
I will do it for you first.

345
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,600
Okay.

346
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,920
How did you get that?

347
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,640
You've been here three times

348
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,480
and ordered the same thing
three times.

349
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,240
Or do you want to change this time?

350
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,240
I'd like it to be the same as before.

351
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,120
Okay, then wait a sec.

352
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,200
- Oh, hello!
- Hello.

353
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,560
Special pork noodle soup

354
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,720
with three bowls of rice. Eat in.

355
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,560
Okay, please have a seat.

356
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Uncle, here it is.

357
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,280
Wait a sec.

358
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,560
That sounds familiar.

359
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,400
Have we met before?

360
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,880
Ah, yes.

361
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,400
Have we met before?

362
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,560
We met in front of my room.

363
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,120
Your room...

364
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,480
Your room...

365
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,600
Ten baht coin.

366
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,240
Ten Baht Ghost.

367
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,280
Wait a minute, aren't you a ghost?

368
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,840
Wan, did you order yet?

369
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,320
