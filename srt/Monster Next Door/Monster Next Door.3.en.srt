I'm...

12
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,800
I'm God.

13
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,240
I didn't mean to ambush you.

14
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,560
I bought you some snacks.

15
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,960

37
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,560
What should I do? We've met face-to-face.

38
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,840
It's good to see him in person.

39
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,720
He's so handsome.

40
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,360
But you haven't prepared your heart yet.

41
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
You must be shocked, right?

42
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,240
Yes, I am.

43
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,160
I can't think of anything.

44
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,840
Take your time,

45
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,120
and you'll figure out what to do.

46
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,920
But I'm not ready to face him yet.

47
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,160
Because you have been hurt before,

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,080
so it's not strange to have a high wall

49
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
to protect yourself.

50
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,280
Is it about Pee?

51
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
Hey, what do you want to order?

52
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,160
Diew!

53
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,400
Diew!

54
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,760
Diew!

55
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,200
It's your turn.

56
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
Do you want the usual?

57
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
Um... okay, okay.

58
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,280
I'll have one minced pork and basil

59
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,960
and another one of fried pork with garlic.

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,800
Okay.

61
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,240
Diew.

62
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,280
Diew!

63
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,200
Why did you take it?

64
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,480
Don't you usually not add seasonings?

65
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
What did you order?

66
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,080
Minced pork and basil

67
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
and another one of fried pork with garlic.

68
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,920
Why did you take it?

69
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,360
(Mom: What are you doing, Diew?)

70
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,960
(Have you finished school yet?)

71
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,520
(Have you eaten yet?)

72
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,880
Here you are. Hold it carefully. It's hot.

73
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Thank you.

74
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,200
Thank you.

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
Let's go.

76
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,840
I'm so hungry.

77
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,840
What should I do?

78
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,080
What should I do?

79
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,520
- Hey, God!
- Should I go apologize

80
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,680
- or should I talk to him?
- God!

81
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,320
Why are you walking around?

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm getting dizzy. Come sit down.

83
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,360
What the heck is wrong with you guys?

84
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,360
It's you!

85
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,760
Come sit down!

86
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,080
What is wrong with you?

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
No, I'm okay.

88
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,840
Not okay.

89
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,400
Stress is written all over your face,
and you're still lying.

90
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,320
Stress on my face?

91
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,240
Yes!

92
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,680
I'm not playing basketball today.

93
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,840
I'm going home.

94
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,840
Hey, didn't you say you were
going to eat at Jay Por's with us?

95
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,800
Then don't you have to practice music?

96
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,720
No.

97
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
God!

98
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,320
So weird.

99
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,680
So much mystery.

100
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,280
What do you think?

101
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,640
I think we should just let him go.

102
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,280
When he is ready, he will tell us himself.

103
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,240
But I want to be involved right now.

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,280
Right!

105
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,560
I do want to get involved too.

106
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,560
But I think that...

107
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,960
What do you think?

108
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,920
I shouldn't have
been friend with you guys.

109
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,480
Oh, oh, oh.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,960
Has he come back?

111
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,000
Just knock it, so you can clear the air between you two.

112
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,000
Calm down. Give him some space.

113
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,120
When he's ready, he'll tell you.

114
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,280
You two have already met face-to-face,

115
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,840
so there's no point in hiding, right?

116
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
Have you forgotten what he asked you for?

117
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,840
(Golden Spell)

118
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,880
(What is he doing now?)

119
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,960
(Has he come back yet?)

120
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
(No, I have to do something.)

121
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,240
(About today, I'm sorry.)

122
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,560
(Can I ask something of you?)

123
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,000
(God)

124
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,200
I've been waiting for you for so long.

125
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
Are you really not going to talk to me?

126
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,920
How is it? Am I handsome?

127
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,440
I'm really cool, you know.

128
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Um...

129
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,080
Are you thinking about me now?

130
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,520
Aah...

131
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,440
You are so cute.

132
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,200
Diew.

133
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,960
Yes?

134
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,520
You’re back right?

135
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,680
Yes, I am.

136
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,720
Have you seen the post-it note?

137
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,000
What do you think about it?

138
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,480
What do you want from me?

139
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
What did you say?

140
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,360
You wrote,

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,480
"Can I ask something of you?"

142
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,760
Shoot!

143
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,080
Wait,

144
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,960
that's not it.

145
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,240
I put the wrong note.

146
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,600
I made a mistake.

147
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,040
This is the correct one.

148
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,200
(About today, I'm sorry.)

149
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,320
(Can I talk to you? God)

150
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,080
You want to talk to me, right?

151
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,880
Right.

152
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,800
I have something I'd like to ask.

153
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,680
Um, say...

154
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,760
Um, actually I was going to ask,

155
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,440
but I had to say it first...

156
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,200
I don't know what to do.

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,440
Um...

158
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,040
You remember

159
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,960
how I told you that if you feel uncomfortable

160
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,440
or uneasy,

161
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,240
you can tell me directly?

162
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,840
Actually, I was

163
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,720
thinking that I also want to talk to you.

164
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,160
About this morning

165
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,000
when we met, right?

166
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,480
Right.

167
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,600
I didn't mean it.

168
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,880
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,520
I'm not angry with you.

170
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,520
But...

171
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,640
I'd like to ask for some time to think.

172
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,600
You mean...

173
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,240
I still don't know

174
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,120
how I feel after meeting you like this.

175
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,000
I used to...

176
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,000
And right now,

177
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,560
I'm feeling a bit confused.

178
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm still not very sure.

179
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,920
Sure,

180
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,280
take your time to think about it.

181
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,000
I understand.

182
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,360
Diew.

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,760
You don't feel bad about me, do you?

184
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,400
I don't feel that way, God.

185
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,520
I just want to ask for a little time.

186
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,480
It's okay.

187
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,200
I understand.

188
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,200
Take your time to think.

189
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,400
I'll wait.

190
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,520
Every decision has its pros and cons.

191
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,960
I know well that you
must have your own reasons.

192
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,040
Thank you, God.

193
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,640
(Seven Months Ago)

194
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,520
(Pee is like a completely different
person from what I thought.)

195
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,240
(I'm sad.)

196
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,840
(Six Months Ago)

197
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,080
(After quitting the game, there's
nothing to do.)

198
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,600
(Five Months Ago
Why is it so hard just to smile?)

199
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
- Come on, I'll take care of it myself.
- Right.

200
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,640
Here it is.

201
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,200
Hey, friends!

202
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,920
What are you guys doing?

203
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,480
You're here, huh, you troublemaker?

204
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,440
What the heck?

205
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,240
What are you guys doing?

206
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,040
We're just insulting
the person who came to insult you.

207
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,120
I've taken care of it, buddy.

208
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,920
The idea of you wearing a mask

209
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,320
on stage was really great.
How did you come up with that idea?

210
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,320
And those who come and leave nasty comments

211
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,200
are probably just jealous of you.
Do you believe me?

212
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,840
Yeah, you guys don't
need to pay attention to it.

213
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,080
No way.

214
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,640
If they insult you,
you've got to reciprocate.

215
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,480
- Correct!
- Correct!

216
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,320
Don't give in.

217
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,760
Yeah, you still haven't told me

218
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,920
how you came up

219
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,280
with the idea of wearing
a mask while playing the drums.

220
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,480
- Right.
- Right.

221
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,960
Because I...

222
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,200
You... what?

223
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,560
I

224
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,360
just wanted to.

225
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,480
- Oh.
- Oh!

226
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,040
Listen to my friend's answer.

227
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,600
What did you eat

228
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,800
to be so confident?

229
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,640
He has lost all his sanity.

230
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,920
Hey, stop it. Stop!

231
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,360
What the heck are you doing?

232
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,480
Hey, I'm sorry.

233
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,080
Let's do it again.

234
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
Let's do it again. Come on.

235
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,960
Sorry, sorry, guys. Let me try again.

236
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,280
If you're not going to take it seriously,

237
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,600
then just go back.

238
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,360
Come on, don't be like that.

239
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,840
I think we should take a break.

240
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,920
God, go wash your face and freshen up first.

241
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,760
I think the reason that God wore a mask

242
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,400
is because he wants to stand out.

243
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,960
He might just want content or something.

244
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,120
You're overthinking it.

245
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,640
That way, people will be
able to remember our band.

246
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,240
I saw in the university post that

247
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,400
people seem to like that
our band has a gimmick, don't they?

248
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,520
Yeah, the number of likes is even higher than

249
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,760
the band from
the Faculty of Communication Arts.

250
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,440
I think he wants to stand out.

251
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,600
Otherwise, why would he wear a mask?

252
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,080
Also,

253
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,720
he hardly ever comes to practice,

254
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,160
but then acts like he loves the drums.

255
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,480
If he played well,

256
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,800
I wouldn't criticize him at all.

257
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,200
Are you being biased?

258
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,120
But I think not coming
to practice is unacceptable, Kan.

259
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,680
It's important, you know.

260
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,600
And what about the mask?

261
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,120
At the very least,

262
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,600
he should have told us before
going on stage, don't you think?

263
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,400
