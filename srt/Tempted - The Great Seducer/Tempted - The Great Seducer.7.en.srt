1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,180
Don't you want to find out about me?

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,580
I do, but I'm a bit scared.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,870
I too, am scared.

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,760
Why?

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,980
Because I...

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,980
might hurt you.

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,730
What do you mean by "hurt you"?

8
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,520
Lying.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,000
Huh?

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,870
I'm talking about when you deceive people, pretending to like someone and pretending to be a good person.

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,640
There are a lot of people in the world like that. You should be careful.
[Episode 7]

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,700
But don't you think that deceiving yourself is worse?

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,560
Pretending like you're not hurt, not lonely, and that everything's alright.

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,240
Someone I know was like that.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,600
Her heart fell ill.

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,000
Then, tell me. Don't lie to your heart either.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,560
You still haven't given me an answer.

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,430
How you feel about me.

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,650
I'll wait for your answer.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,540
Wow! Is this really the one that I painted?

21
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,080
It looks completely different now that it's finished!

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,790
Oh, I glazed it before I baked it. Isn't it pretty?

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,000
Not as much as you.

24
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,290
But where did you learn pottery? It's amazing.

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,050
Well... I just picked up a few things here and there.

26
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,770
Ah, that's right! You should give this to Grandma. She'll like it.

27
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,490
I should wrap this up, make it look pretty like you.

28
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,830
Never mind! I'll just do it.

29
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,140
Why? I want to, though. I've always wanted to try this.

30
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,070
- No, no. I think it's better if I just do it.
- Why?

31
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,720
- I said I can do it.
- You told me to do it though!

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,390
- I said I can do it myself—!
- They're going to end up staying up all night like that.

33
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,530
You told me they had a fight, but it looks like they're about to get real cozy.

34
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,490
Don't you need to go home? All us old ladies need to get some sleep!

35
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,820
- Ah, we were about to leave.
- Just leave them alone.

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,450
Why do they have to go home?

37
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,850
We're leaving now!

38
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,220
- Okay!
- Good-bye!
- Go have fun somewhere and get home late!

39
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,510
- Hey!
- Huh?

40
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,950
Why are we running right now?

41
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,740
I need to go to my part time job. I'm late.

42
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,590
When is your shift over?

43
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,080
The grandmas told us to have fun somewhere and get home very, very late.

44
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,480
I get off... very late.

45
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,430
Then, I'll wait and take you home.

46
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,660
It's dangerous at night.

47
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,550
I think that you're more dangerous.

48
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,060
Why are your cheeks so red?

49
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,990
Did you catch a cold?

50
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,610
You're burning up. Your scarf got loose, too.

51
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,400
- Why are you standing still?
- Give me your boss' number.

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,060
- You should come back to your senses.
- You should cancel your shift tonight and go to the hospital with me.

53
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,620
- Should I carry you?
- Hey!

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,080
It's because I'm hot.

55
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,800
I get hot easily. I'm leaving.

56
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,590
Let's go together.

57
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,810
What's with him? Seriously.

58
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,860
We should at least eat together today!

59
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,650
How come my cheeks are so hot?

60
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,430
- Eun Tae Hee!
- I'm going insane.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,970
I'm a bit late, right? Go ahead, sit down.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,310
I like the team for Bio Medicine more than I was expecting.

63
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,940
I think it will be nice if we can reassign some people in the research and development department. I can do that, right?

64
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,340
Go ahead. If you need anything, just tell me.

65
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,820
You should look forward to it, because Bio Medicine will be JK Group's focus in 2020.

66
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,690
I'm thankful, then.

67
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,760
Ah, what about the new business proposal?

68
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,870
Why did you call me here?

69
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,220
I'm just confused as to whether this is a conference or a date.

70
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,200
You shouldn't butt in when adults are talking.

71
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,120
I'm sorry. This is a family gathering, but we're only talking about business.

72
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,060
Family gathering?

73
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,110
Then shall I say something befitting this "family gathering"?

74
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,570
Sure. What is it?

75
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,440
Even if you get married, don't move out of your current house.

76
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,460
It's not something for you to have a say in.

77
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,870
I know. It's not something you should have a say in either.

78
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,970
For Shi Hyun, that house is all he has left of his mother. He was always there with his sick mother

79
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,040
and made sure that the house stayed the way it was during her hospitalization for when she returned.

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,160
He's grown up now and I believe it's time for him to accept—

81
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520
- How can he just accept that? He never got to properly say goodbye—!
- Choi Soo Ji!

82
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,770
You didn't even let Shi Hyun attend his mother's funeral.

83
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,150
If he collapsed, they should've taken him to the hospital. They're seriously too much...

84
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,720
Shi Hyun.

85
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,440
Oh? You're here?

86
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,590
Mom! They're here!

87
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,590
Mom!

88
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,020
Why isn't she responding...?

89
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,600
Look at us.

90
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,360
Is she not here?

91
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,080
Is Mom... not here?

92
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,300
You can just cry. You have us.

93
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,090
I know how he feels.

94
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,660
If you want to take what he has left,

95
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,570
you should at least give him enough time to grieve over and remember his lost mother.

96
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,700
Okay. I will think about moving to a new house again.

97
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,290
You said this was a family gathering, but no one's asking where Shi Hyun is.

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,710
Please do me this favor.

99
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,790
Since I didn't ask why you arrived at the hotel on time but got here late.

100
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,120
Hey. How do I look?

101
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,740
You're pretty! You look pretty in anything.

102
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,010
Do people normally feel this happy when they're told that they're pretty?

103
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,960
What's with these shiny eyes?

104
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,230
What's with your dreamy voice? Who did this to you?

105
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,880
N-No. It's nothing.

106
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,760
It's Kwon Shi Hyun, right?

107
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,800
Do you think it was obvious that my heart was fluttering?

108
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,670
At moments like this, you need to get your head on straight.

109
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,160
If you fall for him too easily, you're going to lose when dating!

110
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,700
Hey! What do you mean by dating? I was just a bit confused.

111
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,330
This is big news! Eun Tae Hee finally likes a guy.

112
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,130
It's nothing like that!

113
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,550
This is what it means when you like someone! This! When you keep thinking about them!

114
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,210
Choi Soo Ji.

115
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,010
- Choi So—
- Stop it.
- Door opened.

116
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,700
Flowers.

117
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,590
What the heck?

118
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,120
Did you have fun?

119
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,660
Your father was late. Almost an hour.

120
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,550
He's normally like that.

121
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,330
He didn't look for you. I thought he would at least ask me about it.

122
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,640
Did you really get abandoned? Did he say he'll sell the house?

123
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,430
What's with you? I even made time for you on Friday night.

124
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,490
- Choi Soo Ji.
- Hey.

125
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,460
What are you doing?

126
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,660
Stay put. Your heart is fluttering, but what happens if he's just playing you?

127
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,200
Don't worry, I'll ask her without being suspicious.

128
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,830
Ah, stop it!

129
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,070
Aish...

130
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,250
Did you talk to Shi Hyun about Tae Hee?

131
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,690
I think those two met up already. What did he say?

132
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,900
I'm with him right now, so I'll ask.

133
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,580
She said she's with him right now.

134
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,530
Ah... really?

135
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,140
He said he met her when she went volunteering.

136
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,880
So did he say he likes her? Does he think she's pretty?

137
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,340
He says I'm prettier.

138
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,290
Hey... stop messing around.

139
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,950
I don't know. He's too busy playing around right now, so I'll ask him later.

140
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,400
He's with the others, I think they're hanging around.

141
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,870
Ah, I thought he went home.

142
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,930
What? What did she say?

143
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,760
However, he didn't seem particularly interested.

144
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,500
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,740
This is better.

146
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,490
The few moments where I thought about him were a waste of my time.

147
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,760
You're sad, right?

148
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,150
A bit.

149
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,000
I've always lived here since I moved to Seoul, so I'm a bit sad.

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,330
Stop changing the subject.

151
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,040
I don't even know anymore! Hurry up and sleep.

152
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,130
That's the end!

153
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,760
Hey, wow! Their acting is seriously...
[Director Myeong]

154
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,750
- Hey, you have a call.
- Don't answer it.
[Director Myeong]

155
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,840
So what happened after that?

156
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,910
Hello, Director. It's me, Shi Hyun.

157
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,100
Oh, it's you, Shi Hyun.

158
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,390
Are you two together?

159
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,430
Yes. Se Joo's here, too.

160
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,670
It's pretty late right now. Are you guys doing something important?

161
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,070
No, I'm sorry. I'll tell her to go home soon.

162
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,630
You don't have to be sorry. Hey, Shi Hyun.

163
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,880
You must've been very upset when you heard about the move, right?

164
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,010
No, this is a decision between you two anyway.

165
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,230
We realized we made a mistake after listening to how concerned Soo Ji was for you.

166
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,470
Nothing has been decided on right now, so don't worry. Okay?

167
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,510
Yes.

168
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,020
You should go home quickly, your father must be worried about you.

169
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,800
This club is popular around here.

170
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,100
You can't get this every time you come!

171
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,930
Hey, say that one more time!

172
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,000
- Okay.
- You should go home now.

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,290
- The Director says to come home.
- Why did you pick up?

174
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,310
Hurry up, show Shi Hyun, too!

175
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,650
- What is it?
- Hey.

176
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,730
You broke it!

177
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,400
- Sorry. I'll buy you another one. Where did you—?
- You should've looked where you were sitting!

178
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,470
Well... I mean it was an accident...

179
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,760
Are you mad at me right now because of a mere dish?

180
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,180
This was made, not bought.

181
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,490
Give it to me. Let me see if we can glue it together.

182
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,660
You made this? Did you paint this?

183
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,360
- No, just give it to me.
- What is it? Who did you make this for?

184
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,770
I said that's not it!

185
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:48,180
It wasn't like I did it on purpose. I came here after that dinner, where I felt like I wanted to die.

186
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,710
That's not what I meant. I was just too shocked—

187
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,060
You know this is the first time you've ever gotten mad at me, right?

188
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,030
I'm really sorry.

189
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,900
Door opened.

190
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,500
Hey. Why did you make such a fuss?

191
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,540
Hey, Choi Soo Ji! You shouldn't go by yourself!

192
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,080
Door opened.

193
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,730
First floor.

194
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,970
Choi Soo Ji!

195
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,670
[Personnel Form]

196
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,300
[Mother: Seol Young Won]

197
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,290
How did you first get into pottery?

198
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,050
I don't really remember.

199
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,700
You know, it's like how you can't remember why you started to like someone.

200
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,680
You just fall in love with it at one point.

201
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,620
It's similar to love.

202
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,050
- When you touch pottery, it feels cold, right?
- Yes.

203
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,420
Perhaps I should explain it as getting colder?

204
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,160
But in the beginning, it's very hot. And when you make it, you have to be careful.

205
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,390
It gets more firm throughout the process.

206
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,260
It can also last forever as long as it doesn't break.

207
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,990
I was nervous because I haven't held an exhibition for so long, so I was anxious as I worked.

208
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,110
But I was able to endure through it, with these kinds of thoughts.

209
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,560
- I'll be back in a moment.
- Sure.

210
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,720
Was it uncomfortable to enjoy the exhibition? We were a bit loud.

211
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,770
Please take your time to look around.

212
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,420
Why does she eat something every two hours like an infant?

213
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,230
Here.

214
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,520
Oh, thank you!

215
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,250
Yes, hello, ma'am!

216
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,650
Oh, Soo Ji. Where are you right now?

217
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,930
I thought you were going to an exhibition, but that neighborhood doesn't seem like it would have one.

218
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,710
We just stopped by really quick to get a bite to eat.

219
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,400
Oh, I see. I was worried because I thought you were in a weird area.

220
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,450
Hye Jung is very weak so she catches a cold easily.

221
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,290
She has lots to study so don't waste her time.

222
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,150
Of course, don't worry.

223
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,550
Sure, good-bye.

224
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,400
How does she know where we are?

225
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,720
Well... she downloaded this.

226
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,110
Hey, do you have security cameras in your room?

227
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,340
I used to have one but we got rid of it when I was fifteen because my brother kept on spying on me.

228
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,230
Hye Jung, don't worry. I'll hang out with you a lot.

229
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,860
Unni! Thank you so much!

230
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,530
Hey, if you want to be friends with me, then don't bow.

231
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,430
Where did you learn this stuff? You don't even go to school.

232
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,250
I learned it from teen dramas.

233
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,900
Don't do it! Don't! I'm not a bully or your senior.

234
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,090
Unni, I'll make sure from now on!

235
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,340
Oh, that was a mistake! A mistake, a mistake!

236
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,590
Gosh, you're all grown up but you act like a baby.

237
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,060
I can do this.

238
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,830
No, no. I give up.

239
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,500
Dang it!

240
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,010
They all look the same.

241
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,460
Darn it!

242
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,580
But he didn't seem particularly interested.

243
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,330
I'll do it. Give it to me.

244
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,690
I'm done.

245
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,970
Oh, really?

246
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,280
Next is Grandma Kim Hee Ja.

247
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,820
What's that?

248
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,970
- Wow!
- Thank you.

249
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,570
Next up is Grandma Heo Nam Suk.

250
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,030
You made it so well.

251
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,720
Gosh, this is good enough to be a plate for a newlywed couple!

252
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,610
Should I give it to you guys for your wedding present?

253
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,330
- Yeah, give it to them!
- Give it to them!

254
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,220
My goodness! Oh my, whose masterpiece is this?

255
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,310
Mine, that's mine!

256
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,930
Of course, Ms. Choi Young Soo.

257
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,320
This is a piece of cake.

258
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,950
You, too?

259
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,620
Me, too.

260
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,940
Next one is for our youngest grandma.

261
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,030
Forsythia.

262
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,460
Hey, what are you doing? Give it to her.

263
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,350
Oh... could I talk to you for a moment?

264
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,550
What happened?

265
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,190
What!?

266
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,140
Are they fighting?

267
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,590
Why are you telling me this now?

268
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,440
I was going to tell you earlier but you wouldn't even look at me.

269
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,300
How was I supposed to tell you?

270
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,210
Grandma, something went wrong while baking the plate.

271
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,770
I will make you another one.

272
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,010
Okay?

273
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,610
Forsythia ... is gone?

274
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,440
That's... Um...

275
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,260
Grandma, do you want a piggy back ride?

276
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,930
Get on my back.

277
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,160
Hold on tight.

278
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,650
Here we go.

279
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,010
- Me, too!
- Me, too!

280
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,980
- Me, too!
- Me, too!

281
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,140
- Me, too!
- Me, too!

282
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,840
Father, me too.

283
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,620
A piggy back ride?

284
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,010
I'm sorry, I dropped it by accident.

285
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,000
Forget it.

286
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,190
Are you going to make it again?

287
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,350
Great idea. You focus on that, and I'll clean everything up.

288
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,910
You should stop messing around now.

289
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,860
What?

290
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,000
If this place was important to you, would you have done this?

291
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,500
"I broke it by accident. What should I do?" You could've called me earlier, but you didn't.

292
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,870
If that's not messing around, then what is?

293
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,950
I'm sorry I couldn't call you earlier. But you could listen to what I have to say first.

294
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:13,760
Forget it. I was a fool to trust you with it.

295
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:21,020
The people here don't tell visitors things like "come again" or "see you next time."

296
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,500
Because they're worried they might pressure them, since the visitors can stop coming anytime.

297
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,960
But you have no idea how much they wait.

298
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,860
So end it here. I don't want people to get hurt by your games.

299
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:41,360
I get it, but is this about you or the grandmas?

300
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,130
I'm sorry I fooled around.

301
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,880
Oh, no!

302
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,500
I'm letting you know not to miss breakfast the day after tomorrow.

303
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,800
It's for the peace and harmony in this household.

304
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,750
What harmony? It's probably for Grandpa's death, no?

305
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,920
Careful where you step.

306
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:56,460
If you get hurt, your grandfather will be very heartbroken.

307
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,700
You worry too much. Because of certain someone,

308
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,300
I know I may be kicked out of the house without a penny.

309
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,940
So I plan on being careful.

310
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,360
Of course.

311
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,860
You need to walk out on your own legs.

312
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,320
Who knew I would learn what it's like to be a single father through Kwon Shi Hyun?

313
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,950
Is that breakfast?

314
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,490
Hey, I'm not telling you to move back home.

315
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,430
They deliver all kinds of foods these days.

316
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,340
You think you'll be fit forever?

317
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,400
Eating too much like this will hurt your genes.

318
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,990
Then your stamina will also fall.

319
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,740
Stop drinking too much. Why talk about stamina so early in the morning?

320
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,630
I like how you call this time "morning."

321
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,040
Grab your passport. Ramen is the best in Osaka.

322
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,600
Do you know what I found out?

323
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,750
Eun Tae Hee. The person who talked bad about you to her wasn't Go Kyung Joo.

324
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,300
Why should I help you? What do I get out of this?

325
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,740
Money? Or...

326
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,200
a better workplace for

327
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,760
someone as awesome as you?

328
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,620
Or...

329
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,650
Me?

330
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,060
You have no idea what a bad kid he is.

331
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,540
Seducing women is his hobby.

332
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,560
And recently, he even met up with his school friend's mom.

333
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,760
At a club.

334
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:46,640
That mom used to be a model, so she looks younger than she is.

335
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,130
He is making excuses saying that he didn't know she was a mom. The two of them—

336
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,390
I'm telling you this because I worry about you girls.

337
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,660
You have to be careful.

338
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,630
Make sure to tell this to Kyung Joo too, okay?

339
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,130
Okay.

340
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:19,260
So she ignored me because she heard things, not even from her best friend, but from some stranger?

341
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,610
Yeah, that's it.

342
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:24,230
So you should live a good life, you punk.

343
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,410
Are you sure it's Eun Tae Hee? What else did they talk about?

344
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,580
Something about a plate?

345
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,870
- That's her.
- Hey.

346
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,420
You know that Chinese lady? She's so cool.

347
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,020
Her charisma, her self-reliance, wow!

348
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,830
I wish she took care of my sixth brother. She'd turn him into a real human in a month.

349
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,540
I was a fool to trust you.

350
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,210
She probably had no choice but to believe what the lady said.

351
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,930
Normally in the beginning of a relationship, what other people say is scary.

352
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,990
Forget it and don't talk about her in front of me!

353
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,010
Why are you so grumpy? You were so close to the finish line,

354
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,980
but you tripped on your own two feet. Tsk, tsk!

355
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,480
Shut it.

356
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,340
You can't fool me when it comes to a relationship between a man and a woman.

357
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,250
You changed your home pass-code to her number, right?

358
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,580
What did she say? Was she touched?

359
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,520
Get lost!

360
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,190
Alright.

361
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,070
Taking it slow is fun, too.

362
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,600
I see that your face is better, so it must be fun meeting her?

363
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,570
We're not taking anything slow, you punk. And what do you mean by my face is better?

364
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,150
No, when you came to the hotel after getting kicked out by your dad, you looked like a zombie.

365
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:47,830
But nowadays, you've been dressing up and going out, like a real person.

366
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,220
Whatever, it's all a game anyway.

367
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,980
The kimchi is so good.

368
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,480
Don't eat the kimchi. Get out.

369
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,360
I'll leave when the sun's set.

370
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,810
Wait, so your car is Soo Ji's now?

371
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,680
I'll get going after staying for a while.

372
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,840
Aren't you visiting a little too often these days?

373
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,490
I have school soon, so I won't be able to come as often.

374
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,850
That's why you should go on dates and have fun now, when you have time.

375
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,380
Hey, hey, hey! isn't this your boyfriend?

376
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,950
I sent a picture to an old teacher and she remembered him.

377
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,100
He's Shi Hyun, right?

378
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,290
Yeah, that's right. Kwon Shi Hyun.

379
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,340
This lady is the wife of this foundation's CEO.

380
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,220
- She passed away two years ago.
- My goodness!

381
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,800
So you did recognize him!

382
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,900
Why did you come now?

383
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:53,000
What took you so long? I thought you died.

384
00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:00,060
Poor thing, he lost his mother. He must have been heartbroken.

385
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,070
Let's show it to him when he comes next time.

386
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,770
Will he remember though?

387
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,730
No, I don't think he'll be coming from now on.

388
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,370
That's not true. He came yesterday too, wearing a black coat.

389
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,010
What?

390
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Kwon Shi Hyun, what kind of a person are you?
