2
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,140
Did his father contact him again?

3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,530
His face looks gloomy.

4
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,190
Kwon Shi Hyun!

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,010
Stay where you are, I'll come.

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,400
What? Why are you running?

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,950
♫ When I saw you the first time, I didn't know it'd be like this ♫

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,950
You should've been careful.

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,300
I just wanted to take some pictures for memories.

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,160
Did it not work? You didn't hear it, right?

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,680
Come here.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,320
♫ I can't do anything about my heart going closer every day ♫

13

One, two, three!

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,270
One, two.

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,300
One, two.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,250
♫  Always that place ♫

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,020
Don't you think we're missing something?

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,160
What?

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,300
I learned it from Kyung Joo. It's called "cliché."

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,300
It's something that usually happens in a situation like this.

21
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,760
Like this? Right?

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,470
♫ Rather than love, pretending not to know would be better ♫

23
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,480
♫ I probably am a fool for being like this, but I don't think this is easy ♫

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,970
You'll fall.

25
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,770
What? You know how when a railroad appears in a movie, they all do this?

26
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,710
I wanted to try it.

27
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,590
- Why are you laughing?
- What?

28
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,660
Is it because I'm not as pretty as a female lead?

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,700
You're prettier.

30
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,570
What'd you do while I was doing homework?

31
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,530
I was looking at you.

32
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,100
Did you store that in your memory? You said you keep forgetting.

33
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,150
Yep, I did.

34
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,260
After storing it in your memory, a few months from now,

35
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,820
you could draw me.

36
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,880
Was your father the one who called you earlier?

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
Why do you ask?

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,130
Nothing, just that you looked gloomy.

39
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,680
No, it wasn't that.

40
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,520
- Shi Hyun.
- Yeah?

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,900
Do you have anything to tell me?

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,920
What do you mean?

43
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,130
Anything. I'll be your chest of secrets.

44
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't have anything.

45
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,270
Hey! What are you thinking about so hard on your own?

46
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,790
Whenever you have a gloomy expression, I worry like crazy, but

47
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,870
you don't even say anything.

48
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,810
You call me your girlfriend, but you don't tell me your concerns and worries.

49
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,480
I've already trusted you with it.

50
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,680
The paper airplane.

51
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,990
That...

52
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,530
About your airplane...

53
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,140
Instead of being someone who stores my secrets,

54
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,730
can you give me a forgiveness card?

55
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,780
In the future, no matter what mistake I make,

56
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,760
- you must forgive me once.
-  I, too,

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,840
am scared. I'm scared that

58
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,300
I'll do something wrong to you.

59
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,290
Alright. It's been issued to you.

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,610
In return, give me one forgiveness card, too.

61
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,290
Yeah, I will.

62
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,330
I'll give you ten.

63
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,290
No, it's unlimited.

64
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,500
It's infinite. Yes, infinite.

65
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,450
Oh, you! You're always acting cool by yourself.

66
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,860
- You set the mood all by yourself, too!
-It hurts!

67
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,140
- In return, I have a gift for you.
- What?

68
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,890
Follow me.

You're so busy, going to school to practice even on the weekends.

73
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,230
Of course. I'm going to practice until my fingerprints disappear.

74
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,770
Yes, yes. Eat up and do well, okay?

75
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,540
What's this? Why do keep wasting the meat?

76
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,780
I was going to stir fry it and eat it with rice later.

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,140
Alright, I have twenty people. Who else should I call?

81
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,620
Kyung Joo. Contact her right away.

82
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,750
You call her.

83
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,320
I'm telling Shi Hyun right now.

84
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,360
- Ah, this is great!
- This is why you didn't want to take my car.

85
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,290
Of course. I chose this province so I could drink this.

86
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,220
You said you chose it to show it to me.

87
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,280
But don't you think it's a bit much to be drinking in the middle of the day?

88
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,800
What about it? I'm twenty.

89

Here.

91
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,940
I don't want to. I've never had rice wine.

92
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,500
Hey. This is called the "sit-and-get-drunk" liquor.

93
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,120
Since the sweetness sticks to your mouth,

94
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,320
you can't help but want more. Then, before you know it, you are drunk.

95
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,760
It's super good.

96
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,820
How is it? It's good, right?

97
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:02,590
It's refreshing like a soda. It's sweet and sour.

98
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,760
Hey. If you don't want to, don't.

Let's have a last drink and go back to Seoul.

100

Sit-and-get-drunk liquor? Sit-and-get-drunk..

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,370
It's good, right?

102
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,010
It's so good! What is this?

103

- Hey, Kwon Shi Hyun, get up.
- Why?
- Get up!
- Why?

The trains are going to stop soon!

105
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,230
Why are you drunk from drinking this much?

106
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,150
I've never been on a subway train. I can't go on one.

107
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,280
I'm going crazy.

What do we do?

Let's call a taxi. Let's take a taxi!

110
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,110
Hey! It's expensive to go to Seoul.

111
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,380
Hey, this won't do.

112
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,860
We'll have to spend the night somewhere.

113

Animal.

114
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,220
Hey! We're going to get a splash of water.

115
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,340
No, I can't go to a public sauna.

116
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,210
I have a dragon tattoo on my body. A dragon tattoo.

117
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,440
A dragon?

118
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,560
I need to pee. I want to go to the bathroom.

119
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,510
Anyway, no public saunas.

120
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,050
I don't want to. Not a sauna.

121

- Hi, Kyung Joo.
- Hey, Kyung Joo.

Yeah, I'll be going. Make Kyung Joo good food.

126

Where are you going? You have to stay here.

Sit down.

00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,520
Oh, you're here! You're here! Oh, you're here.

131
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,610
Soo Ji, say hi. This Eui Jee Young, who's in charge of the cat café.

132
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,010
And this is Yoon Jae, who's in charge of a LP bar.

133
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,010
Hello.

134
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,390
Sit down here.

135
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,910
Hey, Lee Se Joo. Why are you introducing me to your acquaintances?

136
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,260
What?

137
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,780
That's true. Why did I do that?

138
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,120
- Why didn't Eun Tae Hee come with you?
- Huh?

139
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,500
You see—Well... she said she had a lot of homework.

140
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,330
Tell her to come quickly. It's free tonight.

141
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,480
She went out of the city because of her assignment.

142
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,620
Oh, really? Then, I'll pack the food. You know where she lives, right?

143
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,030
Let's go together​ to give it to her.

144
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,090
No, she went far away.

145
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,590
She might not even come home today.

146
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,410
As expected, two meals straight is too much. I'm leaving.

147
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,490
You're leaving already?

148
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,140
Good-bye.

149
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,260
Is anyone in there?

150
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,560
If there's no response, let's just go.

151
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,450
Yes?

152
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,110
Do you have a room, by any chance?

153
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,580
Since it's the weekend, we only have one room.

154
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,740
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

155
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,120
Hey, it's cold. Let's go in.

156
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,690
What do you want to do about it?

157
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,240
You said you don't want to go to a sauna because you have a tattoo.

158
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
No.

159
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,980
Is it because it's a house in the countryside, and it's uncomfortable? Because there's no bed?

160
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,830
You, do you not want to sleep with me?

161
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,130
Hey! I won't eat you alive. I won't even touch you.

162
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,790
I don't even snore or grind my teeth.

163
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,840
What's wrong with you?

164
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:44,330
I... really want to sleep with you.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,610
Me, too.

166
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,210
I hope I won't forget all the things we did today until the day I die.

167
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,230
Me, too.

168
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,600
Try and guess it.

169
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,680
I... I...

170
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,710
I should wash my face? All of a sudden?

171
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,730
That's not it.

172
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,670
Ah, you're feeling shy? Well, that's understandable.

173
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,940
That's not it!

174
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,790
I don't know.

175
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,880
Forget it.

176
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,620
I love you.

177
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,160
Your heart must be fluttering, right?

178
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,060
Your hand is sweating.

179
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,190
No!

180
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,740
But Tae Hee and Shi Hyun probably won't make it back to Seoul at this hour.

181
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,400
Did you know that those two are dating?

182
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,790
Of course.

183
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,800
I see. Soo Ji said that Shi Hyun was going to come here,

184
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,580
so I thought that you two believed they'd broke up.

185
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,640
Soo Ji still doesn't know about it.

186
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,680
But, so what? So what if they're dating again?

187
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,090
Well, that's true,

188
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,620
but Shi Hyun told me to keep it a secret.

189
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,380
If Soo Ji knows about it, will it be alright?

190
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,900
Hey. Either way, you can't hide that you're in love.

191
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,260
I'm sure that Soo Ji has probably figured out that those two are dating, too.

192
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,250
Right?

193
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,020
When did you stop by, Kwon Shi Hyun?

194
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,430
Shi Hyun is probably not alone right now, right?

195
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,900
Can you play a song for me on the cello?

196
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,670
Alright.

197
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:17,200
♫ I couldn't say ♫

198
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:24,460
♫ To pour out my heart ♫

199
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:31,520
♫ In case I got farther away from her ♫

200
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,820
♫ I must have been hesitating ♫

201
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:44,900
♫ I should've said I love you first ♫

202
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:52,170
♫ I should've said I was in love with you ♫

203
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,640
♫ Now and like this ♫

204
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,980
♫ I wouldn't have regretted it ♫

205
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:13,570
♫ I should've approach you first ♫

206
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:21,720
♫ I should've said you were another me ♫

207
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,800
♫ More than anyone, to you ♫

208
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,280
Did you sleep well?

209
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,730
Yeah. Sleep some more.

210
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,170
Where are you going?

211
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,950
I knew this was going to happen.

212
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,560
Here.

213
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,540
What's this? Did they give you this?

214
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,330
No. Ta-da.

215
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,620
You were prepared to stay for the night, huh?

216
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,350
You use the same kind of toothbrush as me. As expected, we were destined to stay the night here.

217
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,780
This is yours. I used it well.

218
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,070
It's mine?

219
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,670
Here, have some of this.

220
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,190
Thanks.

221
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,020
I was thinking about it, so how do you feel about us spending another day here?

222
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,000
I think it's totally great if we spend three days and two nights here. I also brought a lot of food.

223
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,550
Let's go.

224
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,400
♫ When I didn't know you I couldn't even imagine, ♫

225
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,120
- Hello!
- Can we have one regular and one special, please?
- Yes.
♫ Thump, thump, what do I do about my fluttering heart? ♫

226
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,040
♫ I can't say it,  ♫

227
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,400
Here it comes!
♫ But I just want to see you ♫

228
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,010
♫ Every day, I can't do anything about my heart getting closer to you ♫

229
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,990
- Ah, ah! Please put the special one here.
- Ah, yes.

230
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,430
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

231
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,200
It looks delicious, right?

232
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,230
Yeah. You eat a lot.

233
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:43,000
♫ Maybe it's his love that shakes me ♫

234
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,780
♫ No way, what do you mean love right now? ♫

235
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,650
♫ Rather than love, pretending not to know would be better ♫

236
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:58,550
♫ I probably am a fool for being like this ♫

237
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,500
Wait! What are you doing? You should hold it back like this and pour it.
♫ But I don't think this is easy, it's difficult to say ♫

238
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,340
Thanks.

239
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,180
♫ Rather than love, pretending not to know would be better ♫

240
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,120
♫ I probably am a fool for being like this ♫

241
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,090
♫ But I don't think this is easy, it's difficult to say ♫

242
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,260
Give me a bite. Just one.

243
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,240
♫ I don't think this is easy ♫

244
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,440
This crazy Se Joo, seriously!

245
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,070
How could he play a joke like that just because I did it once to him?!

246
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,940
Do I have to beat you up in order for you to come back to your senses?!

247
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,240
You punk!

248
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,320
What are you doing? Just hurry up and hit me.

249
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:15,320
Do it quickly, so I can go to sleep. Just hit me already!

250
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,360
You're more useless than a dog's poop.

251
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,120
If you run a restaurant, you should get up early and buy groceries.

252
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,400
If you can't make a profit within a month, shut it down!

253
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,600
It's been a while since I've been to the countryside, so it feels great.

254
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
It reminds me of the neighborhood I used to live in.

255
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Where did you live?

256
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,540
Jeongeup. Have you been there before?

257
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,230
No.

258
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,400
This is so nice and quiet.

259
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,580
Right?

260
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,120
It was also like that there. The air was also this nice. There were fields, too.

261
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,920
There was a school over there— Ah!

262
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,360
Are you alright?

263
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,490
Seriously...

264
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,550
I usually stay alert whenever I'm near roads, but I must've relaxed because you were here.

265
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,860
I'm an idiot. I was like this that one time, too.

266
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,560
"That one time"?

267
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,560
When I got into an accident. I was also walking down a countryside road like this

268
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,240
then, all of a sudden a car came right up and—!

269
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,580
You scared me, seriously!

270
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,220
You're making me crazy.

271
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,780
It was a hit-and-run.

272
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,970
Scary, right?

273
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,240
When was that?

274
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,270
It's been about two years now.

275
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,780
It was during winter break and because it was at night, I don't even remember what the car looked like.

276
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,530
There weren't any security cameras or witnesses.

277
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,600
I rolled into a ditch like that and almost froze to death.

278
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,310
I couldn't walk for a while.

279
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:20,970
Also, that night I left home after fighting with my mom, so we became pretty distant after that.

280
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,880
That's why I came up to Seoul by myself and took the GED.

281
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,590
What's wrong?

282
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,180
Huh?

283
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,600
If you were to find the culprit, what would you do?

284
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,390
What do you mean? I wouldn't let them go.

285
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,300
I still have nightmares about it from time to time.

286
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,830
I'm sure that person doesn't know that I was about to die and is living well, right?

287
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,060
Isn't that just despicable? How can someone be like that?

288
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:07,660
What's wrong? Did I make you think about your mom?

289
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,880
I'm sorry.

290
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,380
It's fine. I was thinking about something else.

291
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,040
Let's go.

292
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,660
But I hear that Soo Ji and Hye Jung meet up a lot nowadays?

293
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:28,440
She takes her to many concerts and Hye Jung listens to Soo Ji well.

294
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,960
But the Soo Ji I know is pretty daring.

295
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,940
I'm a bit worried that Soo Ji might be a bad influence for the innocent Hye Jung.

296
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,110
Is that so? She seems like she's daring, but

297
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,880
I have a favor to ask Director Myeong.

298
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,820
Favor? What favor? You should ask me instead.

299
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,830
What type of power does Director Myeong have?

300
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:56,100
Honestly, my Gyu Jung got another notification to have a check-up for the army.

301
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,380
I heard that Gyu Jung quit school because he was sick, right?

302
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,530
He needs to be exempted from the army.

303
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,540
- I'm asking you for this favor.
- I told you to not talk about it!

304
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,760
I told you to not let others know that I'm sick!

305
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,330
Okay. Okay.

306
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,120
That's why he been a bit sensitive lately.

307
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,390
I told you not to talk about it, Mom! I'm not a patient!

308
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,370
This is so annoying! I told you already, I'm not a patient!

309
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,870
Seriously! I'm not a patient!

310
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,190
Hye Jung! Hye Jung!

311
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,780
Oppa!

312
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,690
I'm sorry, Ki Young.

313
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,290
It's okay!

314
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,440
Let go of me! You'll get hit!

315
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,430
Just try and hit me! If you hit me, I won't play games with you anymore!

316
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,960
It was a hit-and-run.

317
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,680
When was that?

318
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,330
It's been about two years now.

319
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,340
We couldn't let your deceased mother remain guilty.

320
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,220
Let's eat ramen, Snake Lady.

321
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,000
Here.

322
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,010
Just stay still. I'll be the one that makes it today.

323
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,860
Alright.

324
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,290
Where's the assignment you were working on last time?

325
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:20,030
Assignment? The assignment is over there.

326
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,230
You really made this well.

327
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:38,690
I told you to clean up a bit or else I'll turn into the Snake Lady again.

328
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,530
[Party One's and Party Two's DNA results: 2% match]

329
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,210
The ramen is done, Shi Hyun!

330
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,960
What are you doing?

331
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,060
This.

332
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,520
Why... was that there?

333
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,720
I was keeping it in my album. Did it fall out?

334
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,130
I'll take this with me now.

335
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,170
What?

336
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:41,620
By any chance, did you take a look at this?

337
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,190
I'm sorry.

338
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,460
Are you mad at me?

339
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,790
I was the one that gave it to you.

340
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,750
- Shi Hyun, you see—
- I'm leaving.

341
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,720
Shi Hyun—

342
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,750
- Did you get hurt?
- Don't come here!

343
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,030
Stay a bit farther and don't come here.

344
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,540
That's why I left my house.

345
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,370
The first time we met each other at the bus stop was the day I found out.

346
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,090
That I wasn't my father's son.

347
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,650
I don't know who my real father is and I don't want to know, either.

348
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,980
Even Se Joo and Soo Ji don't know.

349
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,290
If it's possible, I didn't want anyone to find out.

350
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,190
When you told me I could tell you anything,

351
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:09,230
were you waiting for me to tell you something like this?

352
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,120
There might still be pieces that you can't see, so be careful.

353
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,600
Shi Hyun—

354
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,970
Shi Hyun... you're listening to me right now, right?

355
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,910
I'm sorry.

356
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:00,630
I should've told you first, but I didn't have the courage.

357
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:06,360
I know I was being greedy when I was waiting for you to tell me first,

358
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,680
but I didn't think that far.

359
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,750
Can't you listen to my side of the story a little bit more?

360
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,520
Please open the door for a moment.
