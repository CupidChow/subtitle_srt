00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,820
If you're wrong, then your motorcycle is mine.

164
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,490
Shall I show you a movie?

165
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,220
Don't you think it's wrong for a guy like that to be promoted?

166
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,120
So I snuck in a camera to catch his bad habit in action.

167
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,770
Is this whistle-blowing?

168
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,060
No. Revenge.

169
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,770
I prefer melodramas.

170
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,350
But...

171
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,330
Oh, wow!

172
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,240
I'm going to complete and release this.

173
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,910
- What's the title?
- "If you pretend to be decent,

174
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,620
I'll want to shoot you."

175
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,790
Oho.

176
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,580
One, two, three.

177
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,340
What are you doing? What if someone catches us?

178
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,520
You're naughty!

179
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,190
- What is this?
- My goodness!

180
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,250
Oh, this is nice.

181
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,710
I told you to keep him away even if you had to break his legs!

182
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,790
I'm sorry! I understand!

183
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,210
Make sure to leave every bit of evidence that shows him playing

184
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,250
and making the video. Don't leave a single thing out!

185
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,230
Hey, that's enough!

186
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,320
- It's alright.
- It's alright.

187
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,710
It's alright!

188
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,890
Wow, nice editing.

189
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,860
This is all yours.

190
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,990
Thank you.

191
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,480
When did you have time to edit it?

192
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,030
Choi Soo Ji! Choi Soo Ji!

193
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,630
Go Kyung Joo? Why?

194
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,630
I wanted to thank you for that video of the homeroom teacher.

195
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,360
Oh, don't worry about it.

196
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,190
You guys did it, right? It was so cool.

197
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,100
- What did we do?
- What? Which one?

198
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,870
Aren't you guys going to take pictures? Do you want to take one with me?

199
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,260
Yeah, sure, go stand. I'll take it for you.

200
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,770
No, you should be in the picture, too.

201
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,150
Alright then, let's take the photo.

202
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,230
Look here! One, two, three!

203
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,360
I took a lot! Let's get going now.

204
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,830
- Bye!
- Go, go.

205
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,770
Bye!

206
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,450
But why was the target the Korean teacher? Didn't you want revenge on the art teacher?

207
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,300
It was revenge on the art teacher.

208
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,150
Hey, everyone now knows that he's a eunuch. You can't get a worse revenge than that.

209
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,660
What do you mean?

210
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,120
It must have been pretty bad for the Korean language teacher,

211
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,910
to do it with our homeroom teacher.

212
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,830
Aiya, Lee Se Joo, that's all you think about, huh?

213
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,360
Why? It's true!

214
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,940
You're kind of a genius in that area.

215
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,590
Since you babies are adults now, I'll teach you something.

216
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,710
Do you know what the most powerful revenge is?

217
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,060
You take something precious away from that person.

218
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,130
When a person loses something precious,

219
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,010
they realize how to get revenge without even knowing.

220
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,590
Are you alright?

221
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,480
What now?

222
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,830
Never mind, then.

223
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:25,440
This atmosphere is suspicious. Guys, there can't be love between us.

224
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,170
- It can't happen.
- What are you saying?

225
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,200
Don't exaggerate.

226
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,630
You guys should just sleep together once.

227
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,450
I'll pretend not to know. Once is fine. It's nothing serious.

228
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,330
Are you crazy? Yah, I'll lock you up!

229
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,680
Instead of dating and crying and breaking up, just sleep together!

230
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,080
Come here. What did you just say?

231
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,740
It's not like this is his first day.

232
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,360
Ouch.

233
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,160
Choi Soo Ji, are you going to follow him?

234
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,120
What do you mean follow? He came, so I'm going.

235
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,690
A swan like you shouldn't go where the crows play.

236
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,170
It's not a swan. It's a white heron.

237
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,000
- Anyway.
- Be quiet.

238
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,470
You two, don't make trouble and play moderately.

239
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,840
You're one to talk.

240
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,220
He came all the way here to pick you up. He's so annoying.

241
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,470
You should learn to speak like an adult now. Don't call me.

242
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,530
- What's a white heron?
- I don't know.

243
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,960
You're coming later, right? If you're not coming then who's making the bomb shots?

244
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,490
Be careful.

245
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,410
I don't get why Soo Ji is meeting that bastard.

246
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,030
Leaver her alone. She'll end up dumping him first.

247
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,420
Se Joo, do you want to go work out?

248
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,400
Should we?

249
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,190
We graduated today. We're old enough to drink now.

250
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,020
A diligent Capricorn...

251
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,680
and a crazy Aquarius.

252
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,330
Cheers!

253
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,110
This is bland. Chinese food goes well with kaoliang liquor.

254
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,150
The dropout with a GED has a lot of swag.

255
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,000
So why did you call me? What about your parents?

256
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,750
- They think the graduation is next week.
- What?

257
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,680
You can't understand. Everyone judges my mom's looks

258
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,310
and asks if she's a stepmother or if I'm adopted.

259
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:47,240
- I also have to take pictures next to my mom.
- But you really had to lie about your graduation?

260
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,600
At my school, there are these crazy three troublemakers.

261
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,240
I mean, they're not crazy but kind of interesting.

262
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,840
They made a complete mess at the graduation!

263
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,100
Then, why are you laughing?

264
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,240
Oh, you must like one of them!

265
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,440
Is it that obvious?

266
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,680
What do you like about him? You said he was crazy.

267
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,310
He's cool because he's crazy.

268
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,930
Hey, ahjussi! Could we have a bottle of kaoliang liquor?

269
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,820
It's kaoliang liquor!

270
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,850
So anyway,

271
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,010
should I get just my eyes done?

272
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,860
Hey, I thought you said that your eyes were your only favorite feature.

273
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,630
He also has mono eyelids.

274
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,640
Even the textbook says that people are attracted to people with different genes.

275
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,840
Hold on. Does he not like you because you have mono eyelids?

276
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,980
Ah! Forget him! Tell him to get lost.

277
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,680
It's not like that.

278
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,550
Then, you still haven't talked to him yet?

279
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,100
It's embarrassing to get rejected.

280
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,440
I was going to tell him after we graduated.

281
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,900
What if he doesn't like you even if you get your eyes done? Are you going to get something else fixed?

282
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,810
How are you supposed to change yourself every time you meet a guy you like?

283
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,990
What's so great about men, huh? It's not like you die if you don't date.

284
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,400
But I feel so ugly every time I see him.

285
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,430
Hey, Go Kyung Joo! You're a great girl. What's wrong with you?

286
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,660
But he's too handsome!

287
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,540
Noble and Law.
 [Noble & Law: Private Party, February 7th, 2018 7 pm]

288
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,540
I still can't get used to that name.

289
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,360
Where are you? We have to celebrate our graduation!

290
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,550
You don't deserve to celebrate it.

291
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,100
I'm not going so just have fun by yourselves.

292
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,050
If you call again, then you're dead.

293
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,410
- What did she say?
- She's not coming! Let's get out of here!

294
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,150
- Hey!
- Wow!

295
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,540
This is perfect timing. Do you want to join us? Our sunbaes are paying for everything tonight.

296
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,760
If that's the case, I am extremely thankful!

297
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,460
Take it easy, okay, okay?

298
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,800
Hey, let's go. It's this way.

299
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,660
- Who's that?
- Someone.

300
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,230
He doesn't know about my family.

301
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,380
That's why I like him.

302
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:28,920
I'm doing my best, but I keep saying what's wrong with you, comparing her to others...

303
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:35,070
How would she feel, when she even lies about her own graduation?

304
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,300
Would it be okay to go to her college graduation?

305
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,960
I wouldn't be that pretty because I'd be older.

306
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,850
I wish my mom was this pretty.

307
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,370
Really?

308
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,170
Seriously.

309
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,910
Do you need anything else? You can order all of this.

310
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,070
Jung Na Yoon! Jung Na Yoon!

311
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,270
Fair Skinned Jung Na Yoon!

312
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,160
Cheers!

313
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,540
My daughter... she ignored my text again!

314
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,030
I'm sorry that I keep crying.

315
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,380
- Take care.
- Fighting!

316
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,650
Hey, everyone!

317
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,590
These are some people that I know, we can all hang out here together, right?

318
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,250
- Wow. He's so cool.
- He looks nice...

319
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,260
This is nice.

320
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,710
I'm taking that over there.

321
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,150
You have a tendency for weird things.

322
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,900
What's wrong? She's the prettiest.

323
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,270
Nice to meet you.

324
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,150
Hey. Have a drink.

325
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,480
- Is that so?
- Deal?

326
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,790
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

327
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,700
How about we do that later?

328
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,380
That would be nice.

329
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,810
Should we have all our drinks together, too?

330
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,750
How amazing.

331
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,590
Congratulations on graduating, Soo Ji.

332
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,390
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

333
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,860
- Ki Young must be your first love.
- What?

334
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,500
You're starting this again.

335
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,820
What about you? If it's only Soo Ji's first love, then it's unfair.

336
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,770
Why are you being so childish about all this "first love" type of talk?

337
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,960
I know who.

338
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,810
The daughter of the professor.

339
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,710
An undergraduate student made up an excuse to go visit the professor at his home.

340
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,310
Crazy guy.

341
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,330
So she's your future fiance but,

342
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,980
you're not even over your ex yet?

343
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,330
I'm a target today again.

344
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,650
You're doing this so I would answer more quickly, aren't you?

345
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,020
Ki Young and I are—

346
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,710
Soo Ji.

347
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,250
Wait a minute.

348
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,750
Please.

349
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:11,400
Since you are also an adult now, let's be clear about our relationship.

350
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,130
Alright.

351
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,190
I'm am just a person that you know.

352
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,420
What?

353
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:28,050
When you were preparing for the college exam, your mom wanted me to give you some advice, so that's how I got to know you.

354
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:31,930
Since then, we've been meeting up from time to time. It's been nice for me, too.

355
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:38,570
But high society networking, you see, it's smaller than you think.

356
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,360
Since you're still young, you might not be able to understand what I'm trying to say.

357
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,870
What are you trying to say?

358
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,340
If we're known to be in a relationship,

359
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,510
neither you nor I will gain anything from it.

360
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,080
Why did you tell me this today? And here, of all places...

361
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,460
I thought about it a lot because you are so pretty.

362
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:13,890
But honestly, Myeong Jeong is not that powerful and its reputation is a bit vague.

363
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,860
So what? Then why did you even meet up with me in the first place?

364
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,880
I wasn't planning on mentioning it to this extent,

365
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,560
but when your father was arrested, you were going to use my firm to defend him.

366
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,910
Our family insisted against it.

367
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:33,190
If we had taken his case, he probably wouldn't have had to serve time.

368
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:38,460
In any case, your mom is amazing, for her to pick me out as your boyfriend in that sort of situation.

369
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,210
You really didn't know anything, did you?

370
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:54,430
From now on, I'd advise you to choose a more realistic partner.

371
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:59,360
This is also the best for you. Is that alright?

372
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,560
Do you want to have another drink?

373
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,000
That was harsh.

374
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,170
You were so mean.

375
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,260
I feel sorry for her.

376
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,360
[Myeong Jeong Hospital]

377
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,520
I'm sorry I couldn't attend your graduation.

378
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,090
Did you meet up with someone?

379
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,880
Lee Ki Young.

380
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,460
Let's go home.

381
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,640
You can leave first.

382
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,960
It's all good. I didn't want you to keep seeing him.

383
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,150
What are you talking about?

384
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,090
No way, did you like Ki Young?

385
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,750
He said I should choose a more realistic partner next time.

386
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,430
He said he felt crowded because I was too transparent from the get-go.

387
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,430
I thought he was smart. Why would he say such a thing?

388
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,210
That was directed at you, Mom, not me.

389
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,430
Let me ask you one thing.

390
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:57,390
Did you personally make a request for Lee Ki Young's law firm to take Dad's case?

391
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:03,640
And if he had taken the case and Dad hadn't gone to jail, would you still have left him?

392
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,300
Soo Ji, I never left your dad.

393
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,860
I protected the hospital.

394
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,890
Drink some more.

395
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,690
Why isn't she going?

396
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,750
How annoying!

397
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,310
If she's the supplier, she should just leave after paying for everything.

398
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,660
No wonder she's ignored by her own daughter, since she's so dense.

399
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:43,320
Are you getting bored? Want to go somewhere?

400
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,230
There's no more space for me.

401
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:58,220
No, why are you sitting there? Your seat is right here.

402
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,610
Go.

403
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,810
So what if I sit wherever...

404
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,820
So what if I sit wherever...

405
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,920
You know how to behave in the world.

406
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,310
Taking care of her like a much older sunbae.

407
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:29,630
An older sunbae... Oh, my. I thought you were friends.

408
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,010
How old are you? You look pretty young.

409
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,790
Well, you know. I'm about old enough to be in a noona-dongseng relationship.

410
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,890
Since I lowered my speech, did it make you upset?

411
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,960
No, just be comfortable. Comfortable.

412
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,930
Pour me a drink.

413
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,200
♫  Come check the floor ♫

414
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,500
Excuse me!

415
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,490
Are you about to leave?

416
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,770
No, I just don't see my friend.

417
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,780
Can I... call you from time to time?

418
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,480
Of course.

419
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,660
Why do you go around crying? Makes me sad.

420
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,380
- You scared me!
- My love, Kwon Shi Hyun!

421
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,650
I'll see you later.

422
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,660
I'll see you later, Noona.

423
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,630
What is this?

424
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,030
- Hey, that's alcohol!
- Hey, that's alcohol!

425
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:16,130
But, in this case, he didn't degrade me, but my mom.

426
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,230
Why am I so pathetic?

427
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,330
Of course, it would be upsetting.

428
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,370
Just lean on me.

429
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:32,320
I really don't like my mom, either. But it's not like I can put down my own mom.

430
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,420
That Lee Ki Young, how should we get revenge?

431
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,450
What does he think he is to look down on someone else's mom like that?

432
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,120
Is my mom also that strange to you guys? Is she that much of a witch?

433
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,080
- No!
- No!

434
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,060
What are you talking about?

435
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,700
You are both on my side, right?

436
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,620
- Of course.
- Of course.

437
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,320
Thanks.

438
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,910
I was nervous from the moment you said you were going there.
