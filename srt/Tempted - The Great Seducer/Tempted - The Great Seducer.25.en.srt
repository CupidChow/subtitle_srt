Shi Hyun.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:12,020
I'm a person that only makes you sad.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,600
You found me

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,890
and brought me such great happiness like this,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,820
but in the end, I'm someone who made you cry.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,730
Thank you.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,210
In the end, I'm the person who made you cry the most.

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,660
That's why I couldn't hold you back.

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,700
I... am going to wait for you.

I can hear your voice.

37
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,000
I keep hearing it.

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,420
I miss you... Eun Tae Hee.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,560
Did you not sleep well again?

40
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,390
No.

41
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,220
Here. Our Eun Tae Hee...

42
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,560
Get up. Let's go to school.

43
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,120
It's pretty nice, going to school with you all the time.

44
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,770
You don't think that Kwon Shi Hyun is waiting for you again today, do you?

45
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,320
He came yesterday, too. It's already been a couple of days.

46
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,140
I know, right? I told you that I would just stay in the studio.

47
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,450
He must want to see you just once, even if it's like this.

48
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,260
It's his own feelings, so he should take care of it himself.

49
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,350
Aigoo. You want to see him, too.

50
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,430
Give me the car keys. Did I ever give you permission to drive it?

51
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,110
I should practice with a used car at least.

52
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,430
I know, but not that car.

53
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,290
Se Joo already got it checked out.

54
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,020
Are you nervous because the car got involved in an accident?

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,430
What?

56
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,080
They said the front of the car was changed or something. Did you get into a car accident?

57
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,740
Leave the key. I'm going to get rid of it.

58
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,360
Mom. By any chance, is Shi Hyun's grandmother bothering you?

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,550
What are you talking about?

60
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,320
Is your relationship with Ahjussi alright?

61
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,790
We're alright. Why are you asking?

62
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,870
Just because. I want you to marry each other without any problems.

63
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,460
If you need help, I'll help you.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,330
Why are you looking at me like that? Does it feels strange because I've changed sides?

65
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,900
Why do you keep acting like a bad person?

66
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,160
That's why you're the one who's getting hurt.

67
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,730
Why don't you grab onto my hands first?

68
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,230
Why do you make me question whether our first kiss was a dream or not?

69
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,190
Why are you making me ask all these questions?

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,860
Let's just stay like this for a little bit. Just a little bit...

71
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,290
Your face when you smile is so pretty.

72
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,520
But all I ever did was make you cry.

73
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,470
I'm sorry, Tae Hee.

74
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,210
She called me many times.

75
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,600
I'll call you later. Make sure to keep your phone on.

76
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,590
What happened to you? Why do you keep leaving your phone off?

77
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,240
I'm busy because of the contest. Why?

78
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,970
What do you mean, "why?" It's because you were doing alright, but then I suddenly couldn't get in touch with you.

79
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,920
It's not like we call each other often or anything.

80
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,310
Tae Hee. You seem so different from the last time we saw each other.

81
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,420
I'm really taken aback right now.

82
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,720
What happened? Are you upset with me?

83
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,700
Upset?

84
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,040
Why? Do you feel guilty because of me?

85
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,940
What?

86
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,580
Do you remember the last conversation we had?

87
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,580
You said you were going back down to your studio, and that you weren't dating anyone.

88
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,700
But, then what? Did you end up dating someone from then on?

89
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,040
You can tell me honestly. I'm not even surprised anymore.

90
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,680
- Tae Hee—
- I had my phone off on purpose.

91
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,890
Not because of anyone else, but because I didn't want to get your calls.

92
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:37,660
I blocked your number already, so don't contact Kyung Joo! Just why—

93
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,360
Why did you come and mess with someone who was fine?!

94
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,530
Wait, Tae Hee!

95
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,710
Fine. You can explode on me and get mad,

96
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,090
but you're being too weird right now. What happened?!

97
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,270
Who do you think is making me have a hard time? I've always had a hard time because of you.

98
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:04,260
If it wasn't for you, Dad and I wouldn't have had any problems!

99
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,840
That's right. This time is also your fault. Should I tell you?

100
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,110
The person who you couldn't ever forget, the one who made you make things hard for Dad and me,

101
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,350
is my boyfriend's father.

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,940
Do you know how sorry I felt towards Shi Hyun?

103
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,820
Since you couldn't get over your feelings, you made Dad and I have a hard time, but just how many more lives are you going to ruin?

104
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,370
Thanks to you, it's over.

105
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,340
Please get out of my life now.

106
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,960
I won't ever meet you again. I won't see you anymore.

107
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,880
[Hye Jung]

108
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,800
[Hye Jung]

109
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,180
Yeah, Hye Jung?

110
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,660
Are you on your way, Unni? I finished all the prep work for our lesson.

111
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,980
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

112
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,100
How did you hurt yourself, our future son-in-law? Oh, my goodness.

113
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,380
I just overworked myself while exercising.

114
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,040
Oh, my goodness. You should've been careful. What should we do?

115
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm alright.

116
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,410
My teacher's here.

117
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,010
- Hello.
- Welcome.

118
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,080
Ki Young Oppa...

119
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,570
Tae Hee.

120
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,140
Oh my. She is Hye Jung's tutor math tutor. Do you know each other?

121
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,660
Ah, yes—she's the daughter of a teacher whom I respect.

122
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,450
Right? As expected, you were from an elite family.

123
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,930
Then, I don't have to introduce you to my future son-in-law.

124
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,310
F-future son-in-law?

125
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,940
Oh? You look better than I thought.

126
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,550
In the video, you basically flew away.

127
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,660
Video?

128
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,390
Yeah. The guy who fainted in the bar in Cheongdam-dong.

129
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,480
That's you, right? Mr. L from a Seoul law firm. Should we watch it together?

130
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,370
Should I turn it on?! I'll do it.

131
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,900
- I got—
- Hey, stop it.

132
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,840
Hye Jung, what are you doing watching stuff like that? How low quality of you.

133
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,330
What do you mean "low quality"? You were the one that was complaining about being cheeky and then got beat up.

134
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,370
It's so satisfying to watch, Unni.

135
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,760
You kid, what do you mean "cheeky"? I'm someone who's going to be working in the law.

136
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,400
I'm pretty sure it's you. You complained first and then it turned to complete chaos.

137
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,550
I told you, right, Mother? After she started hanging out with Soo Ji, she got completely influenced by her.

138
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,250
Look at the way she speaks. Stop using your phone.

139
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,260
Ah, seriously—

140
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,230
Are you getting married, Hye Jung?

141
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:10,300
No. You know that I have a boyfriend. All the adults are just being foolish.

142
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,390
That's a relief. I don't recommend that guy as a boyfriend.

143
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:19,340
Do you know this phrase, Unni? "Only lovers survive."

144
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,560
I'm going to get into college and marry Joo Hwan.

145
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,930
Alright. You're so cool.

146
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,290
- Is everything going well with Shi Hyun and you?
- What?

147
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,690
Do you also know him?

148
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,560
I think that he really likes you. On opening day, he even brought you meat.

149
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,230
That's right. Let's hurry and get started.

150
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,570
What is it?

151
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,970
Just let me ask you one thing, Tae Hee. Is Shi Hyun still following you? Do you want me to take care of him for you?

152
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,190
Aren't you busy? What is there for you to take care of?

153
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,320
I'm being like this because I think about you. Those kiddos are really scary people.

154
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,740
Hye Jung used to be gentle, but after hanging out with Soo Ji a couple of times, she became weird.

155
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,470
This is also because of Kwon Shi Hyun.

156
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:26,200
Lee Se Joo and Kwon Shi Hyun were fighting like crazy over Soo Ji, so while I was trying to stop them, I turned out like this.

157
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,190
This situation doesn't involve me and I'm not even curious about it.

158
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,400
You need to cut them off immediately if you're still hanging out with them. Otherwise, you're going to end up hurt.

159
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,630
I'm going to sue Kwon Shi Hyun for this.

160
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:42,070
It's none of my business whether you sue him or not. It's up to you. Good-bye, then.

161
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,430
Tae Hee! Tae Hee?!

162
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,100
Just why is even Tae Hee acting like that to me?

163
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,650
Just go, you punk!

164
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,990
You, who say you don't use violence, and you, who only uses violence,

165
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,760
went in public, disgracing our family! How dare you get involved in a group fight!

166
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,810
Let's see the both of you fight here. Try fighting until one of you dies.

167
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,400
Try it.

168
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:22,290
Father—With whatever methods I can, I'll persuade Ki Young to drop the lawsuit.

169
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,070
You should know where you stand in order to not bring shame to our family!

170
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:30,740
How can brothers fight, and what is this nonsense with accusations and lawsuits?! You!

171
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,190
Young one.

172
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,500
Yes, Father.

173
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,240
Please ask a favor of your father.

174
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,320
Isn't his law firm more powerful than theirs?

175
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,390
Of course, Father. I'll take care of it.

176
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,810
While we're at it, close down your restaurant, too. If that's all you can do, just shut it down.

177
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,940
My restaurant is doing well now, so why?

178
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,210
You have to pay for the damages at least!

179
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,060
I can just work and pay it off.

180
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,810
Or you, give back the room where you guys roll around and play in.

181
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:10,330
My mom definitely gave that to me. No one can touch it.

182
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,440
Even if you don't get sued, you have to do at least that much for disgracing our family.

183
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,740
I understand. Then, I'll take care of that, Father.

184
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,210
No. I'll take care of whatever I have to.

185
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:27,180
If you ask me to leave this house, I gladly would do that instead,

186
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,870
but if you dare touch that place...

187
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,440
I'm not going to stay put.

188
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,320
Why do you look like you have a lot of concerns?

189
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:45,540
Seo Won was planning on suing you for the fight, so I took care of it already.

190
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,850
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,650
Why can't you hold yourself back?

192
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,850
I'm sorry that I keep disappointing you.

193
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:59,240
When your father comes back from his break, just leave and come with me.

194
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,790
You should go and get help from Yeo Min. You should start studying, too.

195
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:09,050
It's better to do this than getting scolded by your father all the time.

Yes?

You were always adoring me.

199
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,810
There's nothing that I'm good at, but you always believed in me.

200
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:25,640
I also know that you have high hopes for me. So I've always felt apologetic towards you.

201
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,260
There's something you need to know before it's too late.

am not my father's real son.

00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:50,200
I only found out when my father told me after graduation.

205
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,180
I'm sure Father couldn't tell you because he didn't know how to.

206
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,140
I'm sorry. It was too hard for me,

207
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,340
so I'm saying it in a way like this.

208
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,990
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

Shi Hyun. Before I tell you otherwise,

210
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:21,160
make sure not to tell anyone else. Do you understand?

211
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,580
Yes.

My dad got hospitalized because he's unwell, right? Is he staying at Myeong Jeong Hospital?

215
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,390
He's just going to get some tests. He'll be alright.

216
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,800
Yes, I understand.

Hello, Doctor Kim. I have a favor to ask of you, quietly.

218
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:11,920
I'm sure you know right away just by looking at the scans, but a surgery right away is the only option for a good prognosis.

219
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,780
I understand.

220
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,620
Are you alright, Director?

221
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,770
It's not going to be easy, but it's not an impossible treatment either.

222
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,830
If the surgery goes well, you will have a high chance of recovery.

223
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,310
Let's end the wedding first, it's not fair to you either.

224
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,110
We can discuss our work at another time.

225
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,320
Nothing will change. I'm going to keep working hard on my work from my position.

226
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,590
If you feel sorry towards me, even a little bit, then just focus on your treatment.

227
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:28,000
Change into the hospital clothes. Since you're going to get a lot of testing done later, you should rest well.

228
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,450
I should probably change it.

Ah, yes. I'm calling again.

Were there any people who left this month?

233
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,680
There was one student who left because of his mandatory military service.

234
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,640
Oh, there was also a female student.

You can move in next month, is that alright?

Of course. I need it.

so when would be a good time for you?

I'll decide the date in person, when I go to turn in the documents.

241
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,160
I think there was a problem when I set it up through the phone before.

Yes. I'll get there before you get off work.

Did you eat anything yet?

No, I didn't. I thought I was going to die from hunger.

00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,720
is doing well.

312
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,630
She can't look into a victim's personal information.

313
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,620
Then, does that mean she was at the scene of the accident?

314
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,420
Yes, Aunt. You see,

315
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,370
can I ask you something about the day I got into the accident?

316
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,900
All of a sudden?

317
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,330
What is it? Are you not feeling well lately?

318
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,300
Did you have a lot of nightmares about it?

319
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,660
It's nothing like that.

320
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,670
I'm just wondering if after I woke up,

321
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:41,020
did I say anything or did you find any evidence or something?

322
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,050
Oh... at that time,

323
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,020
when you woke up, you kept asking weird questions like

324
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,050
is "Ahjumma alright?" and "Did she go to the hospital?"

325
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,490
You also didn't recognize your mother,

326
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,300
and you kept hitting your chest and calling her Ahjumma.

327
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,570
That's right. I did that...

328
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,880
Tae Hee. You shouldn't think about whatever happened that day too much.

329
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,370
Even if it comes to your mind again, just push it away.

330
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,380
When people who are traumatized keep thinking about the accident,

331
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,330
they can still remember things like the color of the car even after a couple of years.

332
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,000
Although that's not the case for everyone,

333
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,580
just thinking about it will make you have a hard time. Just forget it.

334
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,760
Alright, Aunt.

335
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:30,250
It's fine. Just give her a little bit of time

336
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,970
and work it out with her again slowly.

337
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,420
If only I could.

338
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,830
I want to go back to twenty years ago.

339
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,090
Even if we can turn back time,

340
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,030
we can't change a person's heart.
