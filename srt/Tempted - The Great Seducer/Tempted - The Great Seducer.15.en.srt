Your father's seeing another woman!

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,870
They seem to have known each other for a long time.

7
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,530
They're similar in age, she's pleasant, and she seems like someone anyone would like...

But, how am I supposed to stop my mom?

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,610
Where? How did you see it?

10
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,150
- Listen to me. I'm talking about my mom!
- Who is it!?

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,670
Tell me.

12

16
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,400
I heard what happened. Are you okay?

17
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,030
Yes, I am.

18
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,460
There have to be events like this so that we can come out with great momentum.

19

There weren't any reporters there, right?

20
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,950
Just in case, I instructed the publicity team to prevent it from getting on social media.

21

Hey, I'll need to buy this, too.

35
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,340
It's what my mom taught me. I can't cook.

36
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,360
An egg with ramen is the best.

37
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,640
I love it when someone cooks ramen for me.

No, it's nothing.

Why are you bringing rice from the fridge?

43
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,910
Ramen should have cold rice.

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,020
Why?

45
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,200
Oh, you see, it's simple if you explain it in terms of osmotic pressure,

46
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,350
the amylose and amylopectin that makes up rice—

47
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,060
My head hurts.

48
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,990
Okay.

What are you even saying?

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,780
You know how they call the time for the light of a star to reach here a light year?

56
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,150
Isn't that a bit sad?

57
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,280
But, if we're being exact,

58
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,460
a light year is the amount of distance light travels through space in a year,

59
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,720
the astronomical lines and the aeon parsecs travel between the celestial bodies—

60

You know right? That I become a beast when my head hurts.

61
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,230
Okay, fine.

62
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,740
But, what are you sad about?

63
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,400
Just that... How I came to shine,

64
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,780
how I laughed, how I spoke,

65
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,780
someone will find out about all that a long time after it happened.

66
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,380
You should show me right away and tell me right away.

67
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,600
Since I'll be close by, I'll know soon.

68
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,290
Really? Shi Hyun really isn't his biological son?

69
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,530
The vice chairman doesn't know that I know.

70
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,420
Why did you tell me?

71
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,320
It's information that you need to know.

72
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,120
This is all I can do for you, too.

73
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,700
It would be interesting if the chairwoman knew.

74
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,080
I heard that the reason why the vice chairman seat was given to him so quickly was because of Shi Hyun.

75
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,050
No one else knows about it, right?

76
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,010
Tiuzen passing, the marriage, the name of the foundation, the Bio stocks...

77
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,160
This has to be kept a secret until my claim's been secured.

78
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,390
And, we need to check if that's really the case for Shi Hyun.

79
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,660
Mi Ri, do you really have to get married?

80
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,960
What kind of question is that?

81
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,260
I just want you to find an easier person to be around.

82
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,250
Senior, comfort and a comfortable relationship...

83
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,510
There's a relationship that offers more than that.

84
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,050
Am I easy to be around? Are you comfortable around me?

85
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,060
It's probably no for both.

86
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,360
To me, you're a comfortable person to be around. But you're not someone who can give me comfort.

87
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,430
So, if you're trying to stop me, don't tell me about these things.

88
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,460
What's with your expression?

89
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,610
- Everything changed.
- What?

90
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,030
It's not even the theater where we watched movies.

91
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,260
It's not where we used to eat, either.

92
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,820
That's true.

93
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,880
I was excited when I came, but now I'm sad.

94
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,970
Let's walk all night until we find somewhere that looks like how it did in the past.

95
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,990
There was a place like this in Seoul?

96
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,780
The people that my eldest sister-in-law send all drive around in cars.

97
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,990
So, I have to hide in places like this.

98
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,300
It's pretty.

99
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,050
Just follow me around. I'll show you a lot of fun places.

100
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,560
Hey.

101
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,290
I was almost tricked by you, where do you think you're selling medicine to?

102
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,080
What medicine did I sell?

103
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,580
You're different from Shi Hyun. Even your eyes can act when you're seducing women.

104
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,960
Is it hard to work at a restaurant?

105
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,400
You can't go playing around, so you have nowhere to flirt around, huh?

106
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,270
Okay, I got it, so just breathe when you talk.

107
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,250
With all that speculation, how is she going to become a famous cellist?

108

What is he mumbling on about?

109
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,330
So, Soo Ji is a Cancer sign.

110
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,180
And there's a Gemini constellation nearby.

111
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,780
So Se Joo's next to her, then.

112
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,240
They're both winter constellations.

113
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:25,060
They say Aries and Gemini also have similar lifestyle rhythms.

114
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,060
You and Se Joo are similar.

115
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,410
That's true. I wake up at noon, and Se Joo wakes up at one.

116
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,840
Then, you woke up early that time because of me?

117
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,570
Me? When?

118
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,860
In the beginning when you would wait for me at dawn in the library.

119
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,160
When you went to see the elders, you'd wake up early on the weekends, too.

120
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,760
That's true, I did.

121
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,070
Did you really want to appear that good in front of me?

122
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,040
Did you really want to seduce me that much?

123
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,260
When did you start liking me?

124
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,270
Hey, so what? Tell me!

125
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,370
I don't know. I really don't know when I started to like you.

126
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,370
You should just say that you liked me from the start, like it was fate. Why so shy?

127
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,790
Where's my constellation?

128
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,960
You can't see it right now.

129
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,250
Why?

130
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,420
Because yours is an autumn constellation!

131
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,640
It already lived its life? It's dead?

132
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,660
No, no, it's not that.

133
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,700
It's a constellation you can only see in autumn.

134
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,210
Yeah, but I was born in the spring. That's when my birthday is.

135
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,710
What are you saying?

136
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,290
Why?

137
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,140
No, it's not like that. You can just see the constellation in the autumn.

138
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,290
But, why?

139
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,070

Look over there without making it too obvious.

The woman in front of him isn't my mom, right?

I don't think so.

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,460
The thing that hasn't changed the most is my heart.

160
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,930
The future is what's important. You're not going to change?

161
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,580
No.

162
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,660
Let's not separate.

163
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:58,610
And don't ruin things. Got it, Seol Young Won?

164
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,980
Of course.

165
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,790
Soo Ji. Let's go home, you'll get a cold.

166
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,280
Let's go home! If I get a cold, I can't grill the meat.

[Mrs. Myeong]

168
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,520
Yeah?

169
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,560
Where are you, my daughter? Why aren't you coming home or picking up your phone?

170
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,770
I'm coming.

171
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,560
She's acting so happy. How annoying.

172
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,300
Let's go.

173
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,460
I saw a boy in his twenties who was painting.

174
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,470
I was really sad at the time.

175
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,180
But, after I saw him painting... How should I say this?

176
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,160
I felt like I was being comforted.

177
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,310
He looked like the happiest person in the world.

178
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,360
Really?

179
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,560
After being so in love with you and not fearing anything, when I was working hard and making pottery,

180
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,300
I probably looked like that, too.

181
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,300
Seol Young Won. Don't go home today.

182
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,610
What would we do?

183
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,710
Don't go.

184
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,120
Geum Shil would faint.

185
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,890
It's okay if she faints.

186
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,780
She needs to be shocked in some way to start meeting someone.

187
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,930
I'll just look. Like this.

188
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,010
I'm being serious.

189
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,910
Forget it.

190
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:05,080
Even now, if you told me to cover and hide you, I could do it.

191
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,970
I keep forgetting you. So I have to keep coming to see you.

192
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,840
The smell of your cologne.

193
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,730
For some time, on the second floor of the department store,

194
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,400
I'd walk around so much to try and find this cologne.

195
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,760
If I had this scent, I thought that maybe I'd be able to live.

196
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,890
That's what I did.

197
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,460
When I first met my husband, I talked to him first.

198
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,810
I asked, "What cologne do you use?"

199
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:53,410
After divorcing him, I felt sorry towards him.

200
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,350
I was late for my lecture, so I was running up the stairs. And your mother was coming down so we brushed by each other.

201
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:09,440
We just brushed by each other, but your mother came back, grabbed me, and asked,

202
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,780
"What cologne do you use?"

203
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,180
So, I told her,

204
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,150
"I'll tell you if you buy me a cup of tea."

205
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,640
I don't know where I got that courage from.

206
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,360
She was so pretty and asked me that question out of nowhere.

207
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,170
Later on, when I had gotten older,

208
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,620
I asked her what she liked so much about a person who wasn't even fun like me.

209
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,920
She said she wanted to keep meeting me because of the smell of my cologne.

210
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,290
Dad, even after telling me that hundreds of times, do you like thinking about that time?

211
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,310
Well, since you've listened to it hundreds of times, I'll let you in on a secret.

212
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,490
What is it?

213
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:02,120
That cologne that she liked so much was given to me by a graduate student who liked me.

214
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,890
No way.

215
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,520
But, I like the scent of coffee on you the best.

216
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,660
Me, too.

217
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:20,980
When I open that cologne bottle, I think of Seol Young Won, so it's still bitter.

218
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,060
I didn't know that you used cologne.

219
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,850
I didn't even know I had it.

220
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,240
- My mom bought me the same one that my dad uses.
- I see.

221
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,810
Do you want three marshmallows?

222
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,890
No, I don't really like marshmallows.

223
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,590
I don't know if I like this cologne.

224
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,730
I don't really like it, either, since it reminds me of my dad.

225
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,980
I just like what you usually smell like.

226
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,290
So cheesy!

227
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:17,590
If Kyung Joo knows I'm like this, she might want to end our friendship.

228
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,320
Take this first and go sleep. I'm sleepy, so I need to sleep.

229
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,950
Hey, I have to drink this first.

230
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,620
No, you can take that and drink it. Go on.

231
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,130
You're going to sleep until noon, anyway. I'll be going.

232

It looks like a girl I know.

Okay. I'll be leaving for work.

281

Did you sleep well? You should have breakfast.

No, she didn't. She hasn't been eating well lately.

Whether it's true or not, the fact that it was even created is the problem!

296
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,370
I wondered why you had called me. You just wanted others to see that I'm perfectly fine and walking about.

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,450
While Mom was living with you, that's probably how it was for her, too.

316
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:15,430
Director Myeong can't be like that, too. Since she even got egged in front of her daughter for JK.

317
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,620
So, I'm going to find out. No matter what.

318
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,480
Don't come up with useless actions.

319
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,430
You should see it, what I'll do.

320
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,520
The relationship between you and me could be revealed.

321
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,420
The one who would be injured is you.

322
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,270
Well, for me, I'm already a mistake.

323
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,520
Do you not have a child out of wedlock like me, between you and that other woman?

324
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,310
If there is, that's just another inferior life like mine that's being created.

325
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,890
Shi Hyun, I know it's unfair for you. I watched over you at the hospital, too.

326
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,690
Are you okay?

327
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:08,360
For the rumors about the drugs, it's fastest to get rid of them by re-testing him. How about opening it at our hospital and re-testing him?

328
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,760
You're saying we should do an open test?

329
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,220
There are politicians who do it for military enlistment issues.

330
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,860
It's not easy for the person being tested, but it's the easiest way.

331
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,250
No, we don't have to go that far.

332
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,600
But people will keep...

333
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,860
It doesn't matter to me.

334
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,540
You must be worried that you'll be caught for something.

335
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,860
Then, speak amongst yourselves.

336
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,770
Since it's drug rumors, the board members are worried that the Tiuzen deal won't go through.

337
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,590
They also believe that there will be political repercussions and additional rounds of investigations as well.

338
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,300
It's not like we took bribes.

339
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,890
How about we ask Congressman Kim to explain?

340
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:12,010
No, if Congressman Kim comes out, it'll look more like we're confirming their suspicions.

341
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,150
And there's no good in pressuring Congressman Kim as well.

342
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:20,590
But if we come out and share our side of the story, will the press settle down?

343
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,300
I'll make a statement at a press conference.

344
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,190
It's better if Myeong Jeong comes out, rather than JK.

345
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,210
Will you be okay?

346
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,700
It's better to get an explanation from a professional expert in order to stop the rumors.

347
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,720
For the location, we'll use the Myeong Jeong Bio Research Center.

348
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,970
Thank you.

349
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,320
This is the changed Bio business report.

350
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,430
I may be too forward with this, but it may not be a good idea for Director Myeong to make the statement.

351
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:06,640
It's not to the point of harsh criticism yet, so if Director Myeong interferes in a JK matter,

352
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,090
people won't look at your marriage as just marriage.

353
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,690
You could also lose Myeong Jeong's image as a societal hospital,

354
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,970
the research-oriented hospital businesses may also be at risk of elimination.

355
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,220
What's wrong? Are you very tired?

356
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:39,850
No it's nothing. I think, for the press conference, we'll have to think about it again.

357
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,360
You don't have to go too overboard.

358
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,350
Also, I'll look at this later.

359
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,300
Tae Hee, I came here to apologize. Please forgive me.

360
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,550
I was really, really, really overreacting that time.

361
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,560
Your drink has arrived, guest.

362
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,860
You're making me upset.

363
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,160
Wow, this is art. Since you made it, it's even more delicious.

364
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:25,330
Can you drink that in your seat? I'm working right now, and I'm an employee here.

365
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,830
If you need to talk, tell me when I'm done.

366
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,520
There are no customers right now. Okay, got it.

367
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:36,860
I was just worried about you. Kwon Shi Hyun has also been hanging around near you.

368
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,460
Why are you worrying about me? I'm living a good life on my own.

369
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,120
And, what do you know about Shi Hyun to be saying that?

370
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,030
Did you know that his admittance into the Myeong Jeong Hospital was because of drugs?

371
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,470
He's all over the news. Check the internet, even his initials are out.

372
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:03,520
That's not true. Did you see it yourself? It hasn't even been confirmed.

373
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,570
But, why are you taking Kwon Shi Hyun's side?

374
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,160
I'm not taking his side.

375
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,720
Oppa, I thought you'd be a good judge.

376
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:24,700
But now that I see you, you're not. People who report unfounded rumors like you have no right to be a judge.

377
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,000
[Did you eat lunch?]

378
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,220
Nothing happened to me.

379
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,560
It's just because I wanted to hug you.

380
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,400
I like it when you hug me.

381
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,280
You can tell me everything.

382
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,710
I'm okay, though.

383
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,970
Don't tell me that you're okay.

384
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,460
Thanks.
