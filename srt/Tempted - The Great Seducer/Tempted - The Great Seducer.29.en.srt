[Episode 29]

2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,770
We were playing with you.

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,730
Why... Why did you do this to me?

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:27,020
You're asking the wrong question. There's no particular reason when we pick out a toy to play with.

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,820
You should be asking, "Why am I a Myeong Jeong scholarship student?"

6
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,580
It's because you were Lee Ki Young's first love, coincidentally.

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,680
What?

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,580
At first, Shi Hyun made a bet with Soo Ji to ease her heart.

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,120
Who you are and what kind of person you are, that wasn't important.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:57,000
Shi Hyun... had trouble memorizing your name, too.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,820
What's her name again—?

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,780
Eun Tae Hee! It's written here. Don't forget it!

13
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,020
We found out about the places you frequently go to and even canceled your application to move into the dorm.

14
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,520
We thought about stopping around then.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,900
But Kwon Shi Hyun wouldn't stop.

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,850
He lied and even helped you move. He even made sure you moved in across from him.

17
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:26,520
He tried his best to make us not come on the trip you were going on. He even went after you, who had left early the next morning.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:34,640
I don't know what happened between the two of you, but at some point, without us knowing, he dated you,

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,580
liked you, missed you,

20
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,880
and protected you.

21
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,630
Are you also being like this because Shi Hyun likes me?

22
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,790
I don't care whether Shi Hyun sincerely likes you or not.

23
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,760
I don't mind it either.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,390
I don't have any reason to want to split you two up.

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,410
How about you ask this question now?

26
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,070
You shouldn't ask, "Why did Kwon Shi Hyun seduce Eun Tae Hee?",

27
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,630
but "Why is Lee Se Joo telling her all of this?"

28
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,070
You're curious about that now, right?

29
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,930
Stop it. I don't want to hear about you guys anymore.

30
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,710
Soo Ji. Shi Hyun. Me.

31
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,090
The three of us, who were always together, are over.

32
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,760
Shi Hyun left us because of you. It's a pity that you became our toy.

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,820
But what can I do, when you're the only way I can punish him? There's nothing else besides you.

34
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:49,450
All of you, every single one of you, is trash.

35
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:56,540
I know. We're trash that doesn't care if others cry tears of blood.

36
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,250
So what?

37
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,690
You have everything in the world, yet you say that you have the hardest lives in the world.

38
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,360
Even if they get hurt, no one lives like you guys.

39
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,750
Was it fun deceiving and ridiculing people, as if it was part of some big revenge?

40
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,240
Did you think that if you carried out revenge like this that you would stand above Lee Ki Young?

41
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,150
That's a shame. I thought that you would've been touched.

42
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,250
You said that Kwon Shi Hyun loves you and that you love him, too.

43
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,830
That's why our nest got broken up like this.

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,860
Aren't you the great Eun Tae Hee if you know everything and love him anyway?

45
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,590
Someone so great that we would mock you for it.

46
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,090
What are you going to do now?

47
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,310
Since you forgave him for other things, are you going to forgive him this time, too?

48
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,740
Can you still like him after knowing all of this?

49
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,690
Are you alright?

50
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,890
[Kwon Shi Hyun]

51
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,850
Can you stand up?

52
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,450
Hello?

53
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,940
Ah, I— Isn't this Eun Tae Hee's phone?

54
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,680
Well, her body doesn't seem well.

55
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,570
What? W-Where are you?

56
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,660
Tae Hee!

57
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,860
Are you alright?

58
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,990
Why are y-you here?

59
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,400
You know already why I'm here.

60
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,360
I saw it. Your hideout.

61
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,720
Also... I saw everything about how you played around with me in there.

62
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,470
Hey, Tae Hee...

63
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,290
You said that you had something to tell me.

64
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,160
Was this what you said you had to say no matter what?

65
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,940
I'll explain it to you again.

66
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,780
Explain? From where are you going to start?

67
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,520
How you found out things about me?

68
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,080
Or, the things you found out about me by asking Kyung Joo?

69
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,620
Or, the plan about pretending to help me

70
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,450
the day my dorm move-in got canceled?

71
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:28,310
Did you also come up with the plan to invite me on the trip and pick me up at the station?

72
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,730
How did you know who my mother was?

73
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:41,690
Since when and how much did you find out about me before you did this to me?

74
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:49,300
You three... you three really... must have fun.

75
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,350
Why aren't you saying anything?

76
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,600
Did you not come up with another plan for what to do if you were caught?

77
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,090
You asked me in the beginning if I was going to regret this, right?

78
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,400
You said that you were worried about hurting me.

79
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:14,550
You're pretty great. Since the very beginning, you were preparing to run away as far as possible.

80
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,810
No.

81
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,340
Just why did it have to be me? What did I do to you?

82
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:30,550
Even after I heard about how you and Soo Ji liked each other, I trusted the feelings that you were showing me.

83
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:37,030
In front of your friends, when you humiliated me because of your pride, I endured it like an idiot.

84
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,130
Because we both liked each other.

85
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,060
A misunderstanding? Because I thought we could resolve those misunderstandings together,

86
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,930
I endured it, I understood it, even when it was hard.

87
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,010
All because I love you.

88
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,150
It was obvious to me.

89
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:06,300
Did I have to receive this big of a punishment because I believed that one thing?

90
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,060
I know that whatever I say, you won't forgive me,

91
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,430
but I was sincere.

92
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,650
Sincere?

93
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:27,820
If you were even remotely sincere to me, you would've broken up with me when I said I wanted to stop.

94
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:36,190
No matter how much fun you had watching me accepting you like an idiot and no matter how laughable I looked embracing you,

95
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,000
you should've stopped there.

96
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,470
If it's you who did this to the person you love, if you're the Kwon Shi Hyun that I know,

97
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,330
then I've never loved you.

98
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:54,020
I've never called your name. I have also never known you.

99
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,100
Tae Hee...

100
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,580
It ended up like this because I liked you too much.

101
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,280
I knew I shouldn't have been like that,

102
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,590
but it ended up like this because I kept asking for one—j-just one more day.

103
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,190
At some point, I ended up liking you so much that I forgot about my guilt.

104
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,300
Even when I was scared as time went on...

105
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,050
Just one more day,

106
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,580
I wanted to like you for just one more day.

107
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,990
Fine.

108
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,680
You probably didn't imagine that you would end up liking me.

109
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:55,930
The only thing in your plan was for me to be abandoned and suffer.

110
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Tae Hee! Please!

111
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,310
What are you trying to get back by doing this? You're no longer someone I know.

112
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,490
No...

113
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,300
When I told you that I didn't know what type of person you were

114
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:12,610
and that I wanted to find out... this is the last time I'm going to regret saying that.

115
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,730
Don't you understand?

116
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,800
The idiot that you three wanted to humiliate will despise you for a long, long time.

117
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,400
I want you to hurt as much as I despise you.

118
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,060
I want you to have a hard time.

119
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:37,670
I hope that you have a bad life. If not, I will end up despising myself for having known you

120
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,710
and accepting you countless times.

121
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,580
Don't ever appear in front of me again.

122
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
[Hye Jung]

123
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,260
Did you have to do it like this?

124
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,740
I...

125
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,290
told you that I would reveal everything and beg for forgiveness even if she tells me to get lost.

126
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,390
Did you have to take away my last chance like that?

127
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,030
[Hye Jung]

128
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,280
Let's go home.

129
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,460
You're going to get in a lot of trouble with your mom.

130
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't want to. If I just go back like this, then it won't change anything in the future.

131
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,870
Let's get up. You'll catch a cold.

132
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,560
Tae Hee!

133
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,850
Tae Hee!

134
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,760
Oh my, are you alright?

135
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:51,080
Patient Kwon Seok Woo: forty-six years old, male. He came to our hospital for ambulatory care and has received a complete physical.

136
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,650
The tumor showed up in both the CT and MRI scans. We will cut it out with guided operations.

137
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:02,460
The tumor is putting pressure on the optic nerves, so we're going to keep observing.

138
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,860
The surgery will take almost a whole day.

139
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,320
Okay.

140
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:18,110
Don't worry too much about it. I gathered our greatest doctors at this hospital and—

141
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,460
My dad is a strong man. He'll be able to get through this.

142
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,250
Shi Hyun...

143
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,960
I know that I will have to keep repaying you for the things I did wrong for a long time.

144
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:39,210
Although it's probably hard, for now, can't you just think about your father?

145
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,710
I'm asking you for this favor.

146
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,200
Alright.

147
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,370
For now, please take care of my father well.

148
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,220
We're prepping for Kwon Seok Woo's surgery.

149
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,310
He must've listed you as his guardian.

Here, get up.

152
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,260
Are you okay?

153
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,700
Drink this and go back to sleep.

154
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,810
And take some medicine.

155

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,900
When Dad leaves, I'm going with him.

158
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,760
What about school?

159
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,160
It'll be hard for you if I tell you everything.

160
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,970
You still want me to tell you?

161
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,530
After I came back to Korea, only bad things happened to me.

162
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:39,970
I argued with you every day, got into an accident, got hurt, then got better.

163
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:45,350
And I thought only good things would happen after all that.

164
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:53,270
I thought everything would be fine if I was apart from you and came to live in Seoul by myself.

165
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:59,120
I got to go to the college I wanted to go to. I thought only good things would happen.

166
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,990
Now, I want to get away from everything.

167
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,790
You slept in? That's unlike you.

168
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,420
Did you eat breakfast?

169
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,360
You're even worried for me? Makes me feel good.

170
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,580
Are you taking that medicine again these days?

171
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,290
Just because... I've been having some trouble sleeping.

172
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,880
Where did you go so early in the morning?

173
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,480
Lee Se Joo, what is it?

174
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,980
Did you get hit?

175
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,600
I met with Shi Hyun.

176
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,260
I told Eun Tae Hee everything.

177
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,950
What?

178
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,750
All of it. I finished it.

179
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,420
Does Shi Hyun know?

180
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,860
Probably.

181
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,850
Se Joo, I'll tell Shi Hyun that I asked you to do that.

182
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,320
What do you mean? Why would you?

183
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,520
Listen.

184
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,350
Shi Hyun and I can never get back to the way we were.

185
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:35,690
If Ahjussi and Mom get married, we'll probably become family, even if we're enemies.

186
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:44,020
But if your friendship with him is ruined... how am I supposed to watch that?

187
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,160
Got it?

188
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,130
It's Hye Jung.

189
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,230
Oh, Hye Jung.

190
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,560
Wow!

191
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,190
There are even games.

192
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,090
- Seriously.
- Wow.

193
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,430
You can relax here, no one will come.

194
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:26,880
Go home as soon as possible. Don't you think your mom will find you somehow?

195
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,810
Thank you, Se Joo.

196
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:33,160
Thanks to you, I'm going to safely see Hye Jung every day.

197
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,300
Sorry, I worried you.

198
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,210
You didn't.

199
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,630
Say thanks to Soo Jung. I'm leaving.

200
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,160
Thank you, Se Joo. We'll be cleaning or something.

201
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,800
We will!

202
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,150
Door opened.

203
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,120
- Shall we clean up?
- Yes, let's.

204
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Where are you, Hye Jung...?

205
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,150
You have a guest.

206
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:06,460
Mother, you can't come to the family gathering today, right?

207
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,630
Because of Hye Jung.

208
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,100
What to do?

209
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,890
I'm in a tough spot, too.

210
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:23,850
What reason should I give? It's not like I can say Hye Jung ran away from home.

211
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:30,600
Even though you may fight, when you help each other out, that's family.

212
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,830
We'll become family in the future. How about it? Should I push for it?

213
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,090
Can you do that?

214
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,750
Yes, Secretary Kim.

215
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,020
We're going to cancel the family gathering today.

216
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:58,080
My future mother-in-law is very sick. Please put in a good word to my father.

217
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,470
Tell him that I'm taking her to the hospital myself. All right.

218
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,770
Is that good? You'll find Hye Jung very soon.

219
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,010
Korea is a small country.

220
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:23,220
[Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol]

221
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,740
Hello, Assemblyman.

222
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,710
They say they're evaluating the permit for the clinical trials.

223
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,240
Thank you.

224
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,880
How late is the VIP Center open until?

225
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,760
We're open until 7 p.m.

226
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,230
You close early. Well, you know what you promised me last time?

227
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:47,240
A few VIP guests will be arriving at 8 p.m. Please take good care of them.

228
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,620
Yes, I understand.

229
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:13,010
Ahjussi is in surgery. Things are going well.

230
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,860
Yeah.

231
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,660
Shi Hyun is probably in the hospital room.

232
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,100
I got it.

233
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,860
What's wrong with you?

234
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,300
Ahjussi is still in surgery.

235
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,940
Mom told me it's going to take all day.

236
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,040
Why are you doing that? Just stay still.

237
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,720
About the parking lot incident that day,

238
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,690
I'm sorry.

239
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:40,390
Why are you sorry about that? You have more than enough reason to do that to me.

240
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,420
You should've just hit me that day.

241
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,400
Then, I'd be more grateful not knowing anything.

242
00:28:51,400 --> 00:29:00,810
Shi Hyun, I asked Se Joo to tell Eun Tae Hee.

243
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,130
You know that Se Joo does everything I ask him to do.

244
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,650
I asked him to tell her that because I wanted to hurt her.

245
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,180
So, don't blame Se Joo.

246
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:21,520
Soo Ji, when I think about everything we did up until now...

247
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,390
We're truly monsters, don't you think so?

248
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:32,710
No. Who the heck am I to nag you guys about that?

249
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,460
What good did I do?

250
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,250
How did we come to this?

251
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,090
I'm sorry.

252
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:55,140
But... let's not ever see each other again.

253
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,420
Even if we happen to bump into each other, let's just walk on by.
