1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,970
What the heck?

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,930
Tae Hee's probably going to grumble about how loud it is when she needs to sleep.
[Episode 23]

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,700
Hello?

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,100
You must be scared of the thunder.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,250
No!

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,690
Was there ever anything that you wanted to do with me on a rainy day?

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,580
Well, things like having you come get me from school with an umbrella.

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,620
No, I'm talking about right now. I'll do that next time when I pick you up at school.

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,460
Right now?

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,990
Well, right now...

11
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,630
Since you can't think of anything, how about we meet up and talk about it?

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,330
What the heck is that?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,020
I don't know!

14
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,660
Should we bet on whose wish is going to come true first?

15
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,810
My wish is probably going to come true first since I wished it in secret.

16
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,250
No way. I have a great record of wishes coming true.

17
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,070
Please allow for my wish to come true.

18
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,150
I'm going to have a good dream tonight.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,590
- Why aren't you sleeping?
- I want to look at you more and then sleep.

20
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,030
Do you have something to say to me?

21
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,520
Yeah, a lot.

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,910
I think you have a lot of things that you're thinking about,

23
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,810
rather than things you have to tell me.

24
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,600
"Don't think about your future before it's time to think about it."

25
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,550
"You never know when you'll need a break,

26
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,560
so running in a rainstorm that you can't stop is

27
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,820
the same as getting hit by rain that is bound to happen in the future."

28
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,560
My dad used to tell me this from time to time

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,970
and lately, I've been thinking about it a lot whenever I see you.

30
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,680
You seem to be worrying about a lot of things, so I'm worried, too.

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,450
Eun Tae Hee.

32
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,120
You're really an adult.

33
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,260
- Didn't you know that I'm older than you?
- Hmm?

34
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,390
- By three months.
- Hey! Seriously...

35
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,720
You had a hard time today.

36
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,910
You went to meet that person and your dad.

37
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,070
There are a lot of things that I want to hear from you,

38
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,800
but I want to just sleep tonight.

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,040
You should, too. Hurry up and sleep.

40
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,260
Let's sleep.

41
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,310
♫ I couldn't say ♫

42
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:09,330
♫ To pour out my heart ♫

43
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:16,360

44
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,820

45

♫ I should've said I love you first ♫

46
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,220
I'm going to make a long and hard confession to you.

47
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,070
♫ Now and like this ♫

48
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,830
Did you also know that the two of them were living together?

49
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,400
No.

50
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,390
I came all the way here because I was worried about him, but there was no need to.

51
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,190
I'm here because I'm worried about you.

52
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,620
Did something happen to Shi Hyun?

53
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,510
No.

54
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,070
I'm not going to stop their wedding anymore.

55
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,900
I'm going to let my mom do whatever she wants.

56
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,620
Let's switch seats. I'll drive.

57
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,120
I'm fine. I'll do it.

58
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,870
Are you alright?

59
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,740
I must've stepped on the wrong thing.

60
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,590
This won't do. I'll do it.

61
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,030
Get up! Hey, get up. Let's go exercise.

62
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,340
Why?

63
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,100
Let's go exercise.

64
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,640
Get up. Get up. Let's go.

65
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,690
I can't do it anymore! I can't!

66
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,050
Hey, if you want to drink with me, you should be able to run at least this much.

67
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,350
I heard that, if you exercise, it increases your alcohol tolerance.

68
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,010
Hey, but you're riding a bicycle right now.

69
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,770
- I'm going.
- Huh?

70
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,950
It's pretty great to have someone drop you off at school.

71
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,330
As often as you like.

72
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,880
While you're dropping me off, you should at least take me to my lecture hall.

73
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,570
Of course. Let me take a look at the faces of the guys in your department.

74
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,700
Don't worry! I have high standards.

75
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,570
What do you take me for?

76
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,740
Wait a moment.

77
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,930
[2018 Applications for Exchange Student Program]

78
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,110
Exchange student? Don't you need to go abroad for this?
[2018 Applications for Exchange Student Program]

79
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,730
Yeah, that's right. I was just curious.

80
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,190
You can't leave me though. Should I enroll in college, too?

81
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,820
Eun Tae Hee! Are you looking for the poster for the contest?

82
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,760
- Yeah.
- That's the one I talk about all the time.

83
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,540
Let's do it together. Just tag along with me.

84
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,020
I already told you that I don't want to.

85
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,010
What do you mean by tag along? Who's tagging along with whom?

86
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,830
When you put your arm around me at dinner that time,

87
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,910
I remember I clearly rejected you. Do you not remember?

88
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,010
No, I thought that you didn't remember because you were drunk.

89
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,920
I thought you changed your mind when I saw you looking at the poster.

90
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,340
Either way, I don't plan on going with you.

91
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,700
So please don't bring it up anymore.

92
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,120
Alright. I'm sorry.

93
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,680
I'm going, Noona.

94
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,080
Wow, as expected, Eun Tae Hee is really cool.

95
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,480
From now on, you should keep turning down guys like that.

96
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,540
Hey! I was only nice to you.

97
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,300
That's right, I was insane at that time.

98
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,640
Let's go.

99
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,530
Why did you let go of my arm?

100
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,150
Why aren't you two greeting each other?

101
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,670
We're going to see each other later anyway.

102
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,250
My grandmother called us.

103
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,210
Let's go.

104
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,650
It's okay if it's for the last time, but please listen to what I have to say.

105
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,410
Alright. One last time.

106
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,740
I see that you two came together.

107
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,280
Don't worry. We came separately.

108
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,130
- Have a seat, Shi Hyun.
- How have you been?

109
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,400
- Grandma!
- Aigoo, my grandson!

110
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,650
- You've been healthy, right?
- Yeah.

111
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,340
Please have a seat.

112
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,270
You can sit.

113
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,190
Eat more.

114
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,530
I chose this place so that I could feed you abalone dishes like this.

115
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:31,840
Did you eat seaweed soup on your birthday? I told you to come over to my house.

116
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,940
I ate lots of seaweed soup.

117
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,920
Your face is so thin. Your father must be scolding you for every little thing, huh?

118
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,640
No. Eat a lot, Grandma. This tastes good. Try some.

119
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:54,200
No matter how important work may be... the vice chairman doesn't know how important sharing a meal with his family is.

120
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,340
After he came back from his last business trip, he made sure the four of us had dinners together

121
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,090
Seok Woo is trying to make more time.

122
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,070
Eat.

123
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,910
Okay.

124
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,650
So, I heard that you two are good friends.

125
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:15,500
They've been friends since junior high. They have another friend, and the three of them are quite close.

126
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,390
I didn't ask you, CEO Myeong.

127
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,200
Yes...

128
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,170
I heard that you play the cello? You attend a great school. I'm proud.

129
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,480
Thank you.

130
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,860
I guess you'll have to go study abroad right away, huh?

131
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,190
Pardon?

132
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:39,030
Are you not good enough to go study abroad? Is there something else you'd rather do in Korea?

133
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,610
That's not the case, but I'd have to think about my future...

134
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,530
I'm thinking of sending her.

135
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,950
Soo Ji doesn't have another career path that she's interested in besides music.

136
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,150
Should I ask them to bring out the tea if we're done?

137
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,380
You two, eat dessert comfortably without from us.

138
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,020
Okay.

139
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,980
I had no idea that a meal could be so heavy.

140
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,710
When the two of them get married, I guess we'll all live in the same house, feeling repressed.

141
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,120
I understand that my grandmother isn't so friendly with the director,

142
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,760
but we should still give Grandma some time to accept it. Try to understand.

143
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,610
You talk as if you didn't act the same way.

144
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:43,520
You were the same way towards my mom. Saying you don't want a car given to you by someone else. Always saying "someone else."

145
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,780
Even so, I always sided with you.

146
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,170
Let's not have a fight between us, Soo Ji.

147
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,410
I wanted to ask about the exchange student program. By chance, are freshmen eligible?

148
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,310
Your first semester grades, application, and your professor's recommendation letter.

149
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,630
- You can read it.
- Okay.

150
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,700
Why? Are you going to your dad?

151
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,050
No. I just want to look into it. Um...

152
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,300
How can I find out about our school's art school admissions?

153
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,180
You can check our website.

154
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,770
Just a moment. I'm sure I have a brochure.

155
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,480
Kwon Shi Hyun?

156
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,890
Just because.

157
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,300
He couldn't make it to our school.

158
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,090
I'll have to ask him.

159
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,100
Snakey Bride, tell me what your CSAT score and your GPA is.

160
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,390
I didn't take the CSAT last year.

161
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,950
You're going to lie to me?

162
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,880
Don't be shocked.

163
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,490
That's not going to work. I'll tutor you.

164
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,740
You said her name is Soo Ji, right?

165
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,290
You'll have to work on teaching her some manners.

166
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,330
I apologize.

167
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,170
I didn't tell them to leave to say that.

168
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,590
I'm going to give you a piece of advice and a warning.

169
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,940
In my household, people who talk too much...

170
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,160
I will never accept them.

171
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,000
What are you talking about?

172
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,310
The day Shi Hyun's mom passed away...

173
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,240
What you said to my daughter-in-law...

174
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,950
Other people may not know about it, but I do.

175
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:45,070
I'm sure you never knew that that would happen, but words that come out of greed

176
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,890
bring about misfortune.

177
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,430
Should we call the kids back in and wrap up? I'll get going first.

178
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,070
I'll leave first. Shi Hyun, bye.

179
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,020
Soo Ji, I'll see you at home.

180
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,970
Mom.

181
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,150
What could she have said to her?

182
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,400
Your dad is amazing.

183
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:35,700
He leaves it to my mom to take over having dinner with such a scary grandmother? That's right, he was late that time, too.

184
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,200
The family gathering without you.

185
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,750
I'm the one who wasn't there that time.

186
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,430
I saw it that day. Your father and that ceramist at the Joosung Hotel gallery.

187
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,510
There's no reason those two will see each other again. Don't worry.

188
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,580
You're seeing Eun Tae Hee. Would that work?

189
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,340
What are you saying?

190
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,940
How is it going with you begging Eun Tae Hee for her forgiveness?

191
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,410
Why are you asking me when you're not even curious about it?

192
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:06,740
Well, I was just wondering. Why bother asking for forgiveness and confessing and all that when you two are getting along so well?

193
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,270
It's not like you're going to be together the rest of your lives. You just have to not get caught until you break up. Isn't that right?

194
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,060
No one knows whether we'll be together the rest of our lives or not.

195
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,440
Shi Hyun.

196
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,890
Relationships like that always change.

197
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,080
Do you want to date?

198
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,760
No, I don't want to.

199
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,380
Why not?

200
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,080
Relationships like that always end.

201
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,430
Soo Ji.

202
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,450
All relationships change.

203
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,860
Whether it's between friends, lovers, or family.

204
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,730
If people aren't genuine, things change sooner.

205
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,990
Right.

206
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,550
They all change.

207
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,960
Who do you think between the two of us wasn't sincere?

208
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,470
Not another business trip,

209
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,420
but you heard that he's going to Jeongeup?

210
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,120
I graduated from the same university as the vice chairman.

211
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:32,480
Since he comes from such a distinguished background, everyone knew every move he made in school.

212
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,020
The two of them got engaged in front of their friends.

213
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,600
I'm aware that Chairwoman Hong annulled that.

214
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,140
The woman...

215
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,340
I've always known who she was.

216
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,380
I see.

217
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:54,320
One of my patients gave me a piece of pottery as a gift. And I was looking up the artist...

218
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,920
Her studio is currently located in Jeongeup.

219
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,010
I see.

220
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:06,480
But it looks like our chief secretary made a mistake.

221
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:12,610
He could've just said that he had other business, he didn't have to say things with such detail.

222
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,100
I guess I shouldn't have said anything.

223
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,780
No.

224
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,770
I know that you pay special attention to my family.

225
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,190
I'll go in and rest now.

226
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,340
Hi!

227
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,190
Oh. Long time no see, Lee Se Joo.

228
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,210
- Are you going to your class?
- Yeah.

229
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,790
Isn't that Soo Ji's car?

230
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:14,910
Ah, the director hasn't driven that car for a few years, so I took it for maintenance and just brought it back.

231
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,130
Ah, I saw Soo Ji arrive in a taxi this morning.

232
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,790
I see.

233
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,030
Did you have a good time celebrating Shi Hyun's birthday?

234
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,760
Huh?

235
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:35,050
You know, we always celebrated our birthdays together every year. We would even get out of school early.

236
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,990
Ah... Did you do that this year, too?

237
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,990
No, he has a girlfriend now, so we're not a priority.

238
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,320
Actually, not a priority, but we had an argument. A big one.

239
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,130
It's his birthday, why would you guys fight?

240
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:57,500
Shi Hyun said he doesn't need us anymore. I've never been so depressed on a birthday before.

241
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,840
Seeing that you kept looking for me, you must know.

242
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,810
Young Won.

243
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,520
That's right.

244
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,820
Your son came by. He didn't do anything wrong towards me.

245
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:52,150
I was just so embarrassed and regretted things so much.

246
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,530
Why did you buy my work?

247
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,100
Did you feel sorry for me?

248
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:06,210
You must've lifted your feelings of guilt by helping me out like that and feeling good about it.

249
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:13,680
You and I... we've hurt our children enough. And...

251

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,240
And how could you...?

253
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,500
What are you trying to do by seeing me again?

254
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,350
I just...

255
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,650
wanted to see you one last time. That's all.

256

It's all my fault.

257

258

I shouldn't be interfering, but I know that he has a habit of hiding it when he's hurting emotionally and physically.

316
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,280
You know a lot about my dad, as expected.

317
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,950
Where and how much does it hurt?

318
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,680
Does he say he hurts more than my mother, who was hurting for her whole life because of him?

319
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,260
Shi Hyun, I'm sorry.

320
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:11,800
This might just be my thinking, but I think that this might be why he came to find me after two years.

321
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,740
If that's right, then I think that he might be really hurt.

322
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,120
I don't know how much he's hurting,

323
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:29,350
but he and I both may be being punished.

324
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:36,060
My daughter got my punishment.

325
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:43,710
The day your mother went to look for me, my daughter got into a car accident.

326
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:50,470
It was a hit-and-run, so we couldn't find the driver. My daughter was the only one that went through a hard time.

327
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:58,910
I'll live with a guilty heart towards both my daughter and you.

328
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:03,620
I really am sorry.

329
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,630
Is that even possible since you're dating Tae Hee?

330
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,780
What are you saying?

331
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,360
Hello?

332
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,690
Tae Hee. Nothing's happened to you, right?

333
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,920
No, nothing's happened to me.

334
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,430
Is your father okay?

335
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:49,320
Yeah, he's okay. I'll call you again when I get up to Seoul. Yeah.

336
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,360
[Soo Ji]

337
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,990
[Shi Hyun]

338
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,730
You can go now.

339
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,810
Okay, thank you.

340
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:18,330
You're the one who started it. I'm going to be the one to end it.

341
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,750
She left.

342
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,640
She said to not contact her again, since there's no reason to.

343
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,520
Alright.

344
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,180
Take me back home.

345
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,840
What's the occasion for this?

346
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,660
Well, this place is right in front of our school.

347
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,370
After almost hitting you with my car, I never got to actually apologize.

348
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,030
I'm sorry about that.

349
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,330
No, it's fine.

350
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,090
You seem to have made up with Shi Hyun.

351
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,670
Yeah.

352
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,440
But, why do you ask?

353
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,560
How amazing of you.

354
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,290
If I were you, I wouldn't want to see him again after being rejected like that.

355
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,960
Well, it was a problem between the two of us. We realized it wasn't that big of a problem.

356
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,450
When you're dating someone, misunderstandings like that are settled quickly.

357
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,770
How much do you know about Shi Hyun's family relationships?

358
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,930
I don't really know what you're asking about, but...

359
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:35,540
I probably know less than what you and Se Joo know.

360
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,140
I like to think that I'll find out more in the future.

361
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,770
Whenever I see you, you seem very confident.

362
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,660
You think you'll be able to do that, huh?

363
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:54,280
Soo Ji. I know that you like Shi Hyun.

364
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:00,950
I think you're getting angry at me since you can't accept the fact that Shi Hyun likes me.

365
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,040
You look very sad to me,

366
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,020
since Shi Hyun doesn't love you.

367
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:17,010
Don't speak as if you know everything about me and him, about us.

368
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,460
Shi Hyun said this once.

369
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,330
He said that you and Se Joo

370
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:28,050
were equally precious to him, to the point where it was inexplicable.

371
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,870
That's why I was very envious of you guys.

372
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:35,020
I wanted to become someone precious to Shi Hyun, too.

373
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,730
After being with me, when he'd suddenly go to you guys,

374
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,990
there were times when I was hurt and resentful.

375
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:48,240
But, Shi Hyun told me that I was also precious to him in a different way.

376
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,430
And I believed his words just as they are.

377
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,690
So, afterward, I felt better.

378
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:02,090
I accepted Shi Hyun's love the way it was.

379
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,430
I also love him in the way I feel.

380
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:11,720
You must think that your feelings are so great.

381
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,400
You must think that in this world, your love for him is the greatest one.

382
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,870
No, it's just that you and I have very different ways of thinking.

383
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,490
We're different from other friends.

384
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:29,190
The secrets and pain that we share with each other are more than you think.

385
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,490
I think that, as well. I don't plan on interfering with the three of you,

386
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,590
since you two are precious to Shi Hyun.

387
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:45,310
I just want Shi Hyun and myself to get to know each other one step at a time like we are now.

388
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:50,680
Also, just because I'm dating Shi Hyun doesn't mean that

389
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,000
I need to accept all of your emotions and resentment. So, I'd like it if you didn't come find me like this.

390
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,650
Your emotions are your own.

391
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,310
Yes, I'm thankful that you won't try to butt into our friendship.

392
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:12,210
But, Shi Hyun and I are siblings. You're butting into that.

393
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,820
And you're doing it in a really difficult way.

394
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:21,630
Shi Hyun's father, who will be my stepfather, is seeing another woman.

395
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,370
Did Shi Hyun tell you that?

396
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,150
Yeah.

397
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:29,170
Kwon Shi Hyun, now that's a bit too much.

398
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,230
That hurts my pride, especially as someone who will be his younger sister.

399
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,500
If he tells someone else about it, what does that make me?

400
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,020
Shi Hyun didn't tell me about it from your perspective. He was just telling me about what was bothering him.

401
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,720
Then, I'll have to tell you about what's really bothering me, from my perspective.

402
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,860
That woman is your mom. The pottery maker, Seol Young Won.
