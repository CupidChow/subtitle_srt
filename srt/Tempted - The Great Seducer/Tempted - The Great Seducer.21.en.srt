2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,590
- Eun Tae Hee, password!
- Huh?

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,130
- Password!
- Ah, shut up!

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,950
I need to know the password to get in.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,030
Your phone number.

6
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,560
Are you okay?

7
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,440
I saved your head

8
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,240
It's not because of you.

9
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,710
Not because of you.

10
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,710
It's because of me.

11
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:18,750
I know that you were waiting for me to tell you my secret first.

12
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,540
Even if I didn't tell you,

13
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,500
I knew that you would pretend not to know until the end.

14
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,490
Even though you were like that, I was cruel to you.

15
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,570
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,810
Let's hold it in a bit.
♫ I couldn't say ♫

17
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,600
It'll get better, for you
♫ To pour our ♫

18
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,570
and me.
♫ my heart ♫

19
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,320
♫ In case  ♫

20
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,180
♫ I got farther away from her ♫

21
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,470
♫ I must have been hesitating ♫

22
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:27,650
♫ I should've said I love you first ♫

23
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,880
It'll get better, right?
♫ I should've said I was in love with you ♫

24
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,270
For you... and me.
♫ Now and like this ♫

25
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,150
♫ I wouldn't have regretted it ♫

26
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,780
For you.
♫ I wouldn't have regretted it ♫

27
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,000
And me.

28
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:56,240
♫ I should've approached you first ♫

29
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:03,360
♫ I should've said you were another me ♫

30
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,800
A rookie driver like you, driving at night?

31
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,090
I'm practicing.

32
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,960
You should adjust your rearview mirror so that it fits you.

33
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,570
Your mother said that she hasn't driven it in around two years, right?

34
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,440
Then it needs a full checkup.

35
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,470
What's up with you falling?

36
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,030
Shi Hyun's here?

37
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,310
He came for a little bit.

38
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,910
Soo Ji, right now,

39
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,700
let's tell Shi Hyun not to go look for that person.

40
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,260
It won't be good for either you or Shi Hyun.

41
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,490
Nothing bad will come out of it for me.

42
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,480
Shi Hyun will suffer in the end.

43
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,550
You think that you'll be happy?

44
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,580
I'm not criticizing you.

45
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,330
I'm telling you because I know your heart.

46
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,060
The three of us can't be just the three of us forever.

47
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,460
But none of us should be in that much pain.

48
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,660
Are you talking about yourself?

49
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,580
No. You and Shi Hyun.

50
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:43,890
You and Shi Hyun have already suffered enough because of your parents.

51
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,930
I'm just saying that we should just see how it goes from now.

52
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,060
Nice to meet you, Shi Hyun. I've returned to my workshop.

53
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,190
I am sending a rough map and my contact information.

54
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,780
Please contact me when you arrive at Icheon.

55
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,180
My head...

56
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,690
So this is a hangover.

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,020
Eun Tae Hee, where are you? Are you not coming to school?

59
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,840
You got back safely right? If you're alive, reply back.

60
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,980
Kwon Shi Hyun?

61
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,490
Kwon Shi Hyun!

62
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,500
- Get out.
- Move aside.

63
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,830
I have something to say so get out.

64
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,710
Get out!

65
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,620
What do you want?

66
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,470
That's what I want to ask. What is this?

67
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,310
What about it?

68
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,560
Tell me. Why would you do this if you hated me?

69
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,620
I did it out of pity, okay?

70
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,530
Out of pity?

71
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,710
Why would you pity me if you hated me?

72
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,140
Then what's this?

73
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,470
I usually give these things out to anybody.

74
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,530
Am I "anybody"?

75
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,400
Then throw it away. You're rich.

76
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,740
This is nothing for you.

77
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,170
Throw it away in front of me.

78
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,530
Say it again.

79
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,350
Was our relationship nothing?

80
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,920
Was I the only one who liked you?

81
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,160
Just stop it. I already have a lot of difficult things going on.

82
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,980
That's why you should say it!

83
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,740
Why should you be the only one suffering?

84
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,980
This is your mom's. Isn't it precious to you?

85
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,650
You're awful.

86
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,900
If you can't throw it away, why did you give it to me?

87
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,100
If you give it to me,

88
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,650
then I can't throw it away. What do I do?

89
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,760
The owner of this necklace

90
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,880
hit you.

91
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,850
- What?
- The shameless person who almost killed you

92
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,740
in the hit-and-run.

93
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,020
When we went on the trip and you told me about the country roads, I knew.

94
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,410
So please let me go.

95
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm sorry.

96
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,280
It's not your fault.

97
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,350
You didn't do it.

98
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,930
You didn't know when you started liking me, why do we have to break up over that?

99
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,800
You...

100
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,710
You suffered a lot.

101
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,900
You'll be reminded of the accident every time you see me.

102
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,440
No. I'm okay, so it's fine.

103
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,140
So please believe me.

104
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,490
Because we met,

105
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,150
I'm okay.

106
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,270
It must've been so hard for you all this time.

107
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,890
At least I had someone else to blame.

108
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,770
You were alone and hurting, though.

109
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,060
I'm okay.

110
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,030
Just like how I'm okay,

111
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,620
I want you to be okay, too.

112
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,710
Don't break up with me.

113
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,890
Do you want to talk?

114
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,650
What I did was wrong.

115
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,020
I'm sorry.

116
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,410
The words and actions that I didn't mean... I won't say or do them again.

117
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,660
I'm sorry.

118
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,280
That he was wrong and that he won't do that again.

119
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,030
You need to hear those words at least three times.

120
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,730
You need to think of accepting him or not at least three times, too.

121
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,250
What about afterwards?

122
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,390
Do what you want.

123
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,890
If you like him, then like him.

124
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,990
Or, if you don't like him, just pinch him once.

125
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,580
I think it's important

126
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,280
that you don't say anything that you don't mean in the future.

127
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,730
I've always only said sincere things to you.

128
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,280
Oh, I'm in big trouble.

129
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,090
I only had one forgiveness card and I used it all.

130
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:39,730
You may not have needed a forgiveness card from the start.

131
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,340
What are you saying?

132
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,110
Towards you, I keep being generous.

133
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,690
I'm only generous and tolerant towards you.

134
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,690
I've never been like this before.

135
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,370
My heart keeps trying to understand you.

136
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,360
This part of myself is sometimes unfamiliar to me.

137
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,830
Is it not like that for you?

138
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:14,560
Eun Tae Hee, I'm sorry.

139
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,430
I'm sorry.

140
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,200
Saying that you're sorry doesn't solve everything.

141
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,420
I know. Rather than being sorry, I'm more thankful.

142
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,810
Above all, I love you.

143
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,030
I'm telling you everything that's in my heart.

144
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,350
Oh, you!

145
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,390
If...

146
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,960
I need to beg for forgiveness regarding a wrongdoing again,

147
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,360
what should I do?

148
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,860
Why? Are you going to act wrongfully towards me again?

149
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,090
Then, I want you to tell me everything sincerely, just the way it is.

150
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:37,300
And I think that you'll need to give me enough time to think it through and forgive you.

151
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,850
Can you forgive me if time passes by?

152
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,180
Well, that depends on what you did wrong.

153
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,010
Drink this before it cools.

154
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:57,570
I... found out who my father's seeing.

155
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,680
Isn't he getting married soon?

156
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,210
Yeah.

157
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,250
You must hate them a lot.

158
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,290
He's apparently known her for a long time.

159
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,080
I think that my mom knew about it, too.

160
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,540
What are you thinking about?

161
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,880
I'm thinking about how I want to hurt her.

162
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,520
To be honest, I was on my way to see her today.

163
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,950
It must've been so hard for you. I was like that, too.

164
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,430
But, can I ask you who she is?

165
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,730
She's a better person than I imagined her to be.

166
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,940
Then, can't you just not do it?

167
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,800
I want you to only do things that make you happy.

168
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:56,600
I'm worried that you'll go through a tough time.

169
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,560
Do you really have to do that to feel better?

170
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,730
Let's see.

171
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,620
Something good must've happened.

172
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,760
You're giving a punk like me vegetable juice.

173
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,690
My investment is doing well.

174
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,530
Do well at work.

175
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,990
- What is it?
- Choi Soo Ji, did you sleep well?

176
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,040
I'm tired because I had dreams all night.

177
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,350
Should I get you some tonic? Unless you were dreaming about me.

178
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,410
- I'm hanging up.
- Hey, hey, hey!

179
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,950
You know that today's Shi Hyun's birthday, right?

180
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,810
It's amazing that I didn't forget. Bye.

181
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,130
Did she add some hormones to my drink?

182
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,190
When Choi Soo Ji hangs up on me, I feel like crying.

183
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,240
- Here.
- Wow, it's been forever since I've had breakfast!

184
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,710
Thank you for the food.

185
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,610
Eat this, and then let's go to school. I'll drive you.

186
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,360
Really?

187
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,980
What are you going to do after you drop me off?

188
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,560
I'm going to find the person that I told you about yesterday.

189
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,590
What are you going to talk to them about?

190
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,280
Who knows?

191
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,050
- Did you miss my love that much?
- Huh?

192
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,020
Here.

193
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,670
I usually eat the ketchup separately.

194
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,620
Eat it once more, hm? No, eat it three times.

195
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,080
Thirty four...

196
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,390
Four!

197
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,430
I'm studying super hard today, too.

198
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,490
When I think about seeing you, Joo Hwan, I make such great progress!

199
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,270
Be strong, my love!

200
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,910
Hye Jung, what are you doing?

201
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,130
Yeah?

202
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:49,220
It's Ki Young's father's birthday, so I tried creating this concept.

203
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,630
It's elegant, but

204
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,450
it's also pure and luxurious.

205
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,340
Oh, also, like this,

206
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,540
I add more purity.

207
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,400
Gyu Jung, turn off the sound.

208
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,880
Let him be. I also play games when I relieve my stress.

209
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,350
It'll be tighter here.

210
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,390
Why is the fabric all bunched up like this?

211
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,400
Mom, that's my waist.

212
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,650
Oh, Hye Jung's on a diet.

213
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,100
Hye Jung doesn't need to lose any weight.

214
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,210
Whatever she wears, she looks pretty in my eyes.

215
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,370
There's no soul. You're a great liar.

216
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,610
Hye Jung, it really is because you look pretty in my eyes.

217
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,290
Well, you probably don't even know much about fashion, anyway.

218
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,960
Mom! I want to buy clothes with Soo Ji now.

219
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,790
People are going to be constipated just by looking at this dress.

220
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,490
Hey, Hye Jung, where are you going?

221
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,980
I'm going to poop!

222
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,270
It's because she's going through puberty.

223
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,030
Did she eat something weird? Hye Jung!

224
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,840
Gosh, what a waste of time.

225
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,730
Hey. What are you doing?

226
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,180
Hey. Watch your manners. I'm your future brother-in-law.

227
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,520
What are you going to do if someone sees?

228
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,080
I can't believe this.

229
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,330
Achoo! Achoo.

230
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,190
Since I only have tutoring today, I'm getting off work early.

231
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,600
Let's eat dinner together.

232
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,040
Alright.

233
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,860
Something seems different. Did something happen?

234
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,670
No.

235
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,090
You're like this because I might not be in the best mood after I go there today.

236
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,290
There you go again with your serious thinking.

237
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,540
- It's not that!
- Ow!

238
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,360
Bye! I'll see you later.

239
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,820
Bye!

240
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,230
I'm thankful for the last time.

241
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,830
It was pretty difficult because of us, right?

242
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,910
A bit, yes.

243
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,390
I'm here today because I want to shamelessly ask you for another daring favor.

244
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,200
That's why I called to meet up.

245
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,960
- I heard that your marriage was postponed.
- Excuse me?

246
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,630
Is it because of the results of the atopi drug tests?

247
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,650
Yes. If this matter gets resolves soon,

248
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,990
I think we will be able to release it in time.

249
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm asking you for this favor.

250
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,430
Well, alright. I'll prepare myself because I believe you will follow the laws and regulations.

251
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:12,330
But, don't you think that I need to gain something this time, too?

252
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,500
I understand, Assemblyman.

253
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,010
How about the job for your daughter that we mentioned previously?

254
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,810
Like you said,

255
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,260
I want to aim for something bigger.

256

I would like you to

257
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,280
open a VIP center at Myeong Jeong for my supporters.

I understand.

260
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,690
How did you find me here?

261
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,690
Shi Hyun knows about Seol Young Won.

262
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,520
Soo Ji probably told him.

263
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,160
He asked if she was involved in his mother's accident,

264
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,590
so I told him that she got into the accident on the way to meet her.

265
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,680
Why did you tell him that?

266
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,220
It's better to tell him something like that to end it.

267
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,470
He won't look into it anymore.

268
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,770
Mi Ri, what did you do with the car then?

269
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,160
It's in the garage. I haven't seen it in a long time.

270
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,180
Shi Hyun will meet Seol Young Won.

271
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,000
Then the vice chairman won't be able to see her anymore. It works out for you.

272
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,020
If Shi Hyun digs more into the accident and finds out that...

273
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,820
his mother isn't the culprit, then I'll take care of it then.

274
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,680
What are you planning on doing?

275

Have you been drawing a lot?

No.

279
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,950
I've been lazy and haven't been doing much for a while but now I'm back on track.

280
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,480
Yes.

281

But why did you come see me?

282
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,040
Wow, these are my works.

283
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,780

Yes, Kwon Seok Woo is my father.

286
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,020
My mother passed away two years ago,

287
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,470
in a car accident in Jeongeup, where she had no reason to be.

288
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,330
I always thought that it was strange.

289
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,950
Why did my hospitalized mother go there?

290
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,980
I guess my mom wanted to see for herself.

291
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,870
If not, she wanted to beg you to break up with my father.

292
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,620
My mom was always lonely.

293
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,900
She placed a big ceramic vase in the company's lobby

294
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,120
and always looked at it whenever she walked by it.

295
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,760
"I am the owner of this place."

296

"I am worthy of being next to Kwon Seok Woo."

297
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:28,710
She would say this countless times to comfort herself.

298
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,870
That's how she lived.

299
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,280
Yes.

300
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,330
I know that even though I'm saying this, it won't change anything.

301
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,470
I also know that my mom will not come back from the dead, but

302
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,800
I really wanted to say this.

303
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,170
Since you two didn't know how to end things properly and just dragged it on,

304
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,470
because of that one day, my mother passed away,

305
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,800
and an innocent person had to deal with a huge accident.

306
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,310
But the fact that you two are meeting and laughing with each other again

307
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,240
it's too unfair.

Later!

324
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,550
I also don't like asking for favors from you!

325
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,470
But what can I do when it says I need guardian approval?

326
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:47,400
I said I get it already, so let's talk about it later! Just leave me alone!

327
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:28,550
Oh, your shoelace. Kwon Shi Hyun must be thinking about you.

328
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,410
Seriously.

329
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:33,560
Tie it tightly. I heard that you two aren't ever breaking up again.

330
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,390
Alright.

331
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,390
Are you alright?

332
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,640
How can that person not even apologize?

333
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,600
What's wrong?

334
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,370
It's... my first time seeing that car, right?

335
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,360
It probably is. What is it?

336
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,590
It's nothing.

337
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,460
Your grandmother is back.

338
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,700
I'm not sure when she will want to meet up with Director Myeong and Soo Ji, so wait for my call.

339
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,750
Is it really okay for me to join that kind of meet up?

340
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,340
Your grandmother

341
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,340
is someone who is firmly set on the idea of giving the business to you and Yeo Min.

342
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,370
That's why I need Director Myeong.

343
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,500
Don't act rashly and disappoint her.

344
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,490
Why don't you just come out and say it?

345
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,970
You want to get acknowledged by Grandmother, so you need Director Myeong and me.

346
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:29,690
You only keep people around you when you need them like that.

347
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,400
If you needed us that badly, whether it's to me or Director Myeong, you should've treated us better.

348
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,370
I don't have any thoughts about fighting with you. Let me check one last thing and end this today.

349
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,250
What are you planning on doing with Soo Ji in the future?

350
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,260
- What about Soo Ji?
- She came to talk to me.

351
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,590
She asked to get married to you.

352
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,500
It doesn't seem like it's because of love, so even if you do get married

353
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,130
- did you want to secure your spot in the family—?
- No.

354
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:08,600
It's you who wants to protect your spot in the family by using Director Myeong.

355
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,000
Should I tell you who I just met?

356
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,800
Seol Young Won.
