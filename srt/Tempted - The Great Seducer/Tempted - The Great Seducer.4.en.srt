1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,120
Are you testing me? Like before?

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,060
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,060
You think I can't?

4
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,990
Her dad, who attempted suicide, is still in prison and their business failed.

5
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,740
The mother and daughter are mentally strong.

6
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,520
Her mom comes out on TV these days,

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,530
as a successful female hospital director.

8
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,810
Attending Joo Sung High and playing the cello... She's doing quite a job of pretending to be a rich girl. She has no idea that everyone knows what she's up to.

9
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,420
Don't cry, Choi Soo Ji.

10
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,830
Get lost. If you hadn't come, then I wouldn't have cried.

11
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,890
They must be like that because they're jealous of you.

12
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,520
What do I have for them to be jealous of?

13
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,990
A good looking boyfriend like me?

14
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,210
I said get lost.

15
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,380
Want to date?

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,530
Let's go out.

17
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,930
- Do you pity me because they look down at me?
- Hey.

18
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,600
But then, no one would touch me if I dated you.

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,120
- That's not what I meant.
- Ah...

20
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,710
You're thankful because my mom is your mom's physician?

21
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,750
When will you start believing people?

22
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,790
I don't want to.

23
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,580
Why?

24
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,230
Those kinds of relationships break apart.

25
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,350
Instead,

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,170
you can kiss me just once.

27
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,280
Marriage...

28
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,610
You?

29
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,780
First floor.

30
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,620
I'm sorry but I have to cancel our plans.

31
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,760
Forget it.

32
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,990
Show me your heart in a different way.

33
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,700
The game we mentioned earlier, with that scholarship girl. You don't want to?

34
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,330
Sure.

35
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,260
Because what I will gain is far greater.

36
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,520
Door opened.

37
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,180
You might lose. How can you be so sure of winning?

38
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,760
Hey, how could I lose? How could she not like me?

39
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,690
Wow, that confidence. Hey! You just sounded like Se Joo. Don't do that.

40
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,830
Gosh, my plans got canceled.

41
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,180
What did you do? Did you finish talking?

42
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,980
Welcome.

43
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,340
Is Soo Ji doing better?

44
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Did you know what happened?

45
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,720
I heard about it from Mr. Yoon.

46
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,390
That's embarrassing. It's my fault. She shouldn't have found out that way.

47
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,490
She'll slowly understand. Eat.

48
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,860
When she talks back, she seems like my daughter again, but I'm not sure.

49
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,240
She hasn't talked to me since that incident.

50
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,490
Thank you for asking.

51
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,430
I see that you have soft spots, too.

52
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,170
Does Shi Hyun feel awkward, too? What did he say?

53
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,700
Let's talk about our children's problems together. I can also look after Shi Hyun too.

54
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,670
He listened to me well when he was young.

55
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,320
When his mom was alive, I saw him often at the hospital.

56
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,180
I've finished eating.

57
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,920
Already? This is why I wanted to meet at a restaurant.

58
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,510
I visited the Chairman.

59
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:11,740
She was worrying that if the TOJ market got canceled, it would be difficult to

60
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,190
join with Myeong Jeong.

61
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:19,190
I guess, the reason that JK Bio was able to grow despite the loss

62
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,350
was because of TOJ.

63
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,640
Don't worry. You can trust and follow me.

64
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,700
Was the supporters' night successful?

65
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,680
The marriage announcement was unexpected.

66
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,890
I didn't know that you would announce it there.

67
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,570
It was because you never proposed to me properly, I had no choice.

68
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,420
You didn't calculate it out beforehand?

69
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,810
That's what you thought?

70
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,580
I felt bad that I announced it at the event, but you didn't look too upset.

71
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,370
I didn't think you thought like that.

72
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,660
I should go.

73
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,320
Wait.

74
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,410
I wasn't able to propose to you properly, like you said.

75
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,620
Door closing.

76
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,350
The car the Chairwoman took is on standby.

77
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,780
I'm not asking you to fall in love.

78
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,090
I know.

79
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,610
How could I love someone besides you?

80
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:39,540
Make her completely fall in love with you.

81
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:49,330
But why does that sound like you're talking about yourself?

82
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,260
I got it. And then I dump her, okay?

83
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,090
How could she not like me?

84
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,490
Right, how can she not like you?

85
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,350
That was you? Eun... Tae... Hee...

86
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,990
Let's work well together.

87
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,940
Why do you keep following me? Just get a check-up alone and leave!

88
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,900
I barely got out on the condition that I come to your hospital.

89
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,520
I'm a patient after all.

90
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,660
Meet up with your mother quickly and buy me food. I'm hungry.

91
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,140
Use this. If someone sees us, they'll think I was the one that hit you.

92
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,570
Is she the one that got the scholarship?

93
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,420
Oh, she's very cute.

94
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,950
Soo Ji... over there.

95
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,340
I really love it!

96
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,550
Take a look at this, too.

97
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,450
- We're almost done with it.
- Wow.

98
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,940
I wish I could move in tomorrow.

99
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,920
We were planning to finish it up earlier, but we were delayed a bit.

100
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,450
It's fine.

101
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,710
When would you like to move in?

102
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,970
Moving in date... Please wait a moment.

103
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,690
- Thank you.
- Yes. Good-bye.

104
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,720
Good-bye.

105
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,630
Oh, hello, Madam.

106
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,070
I'm Eun Tae Hee, who received this year's scholarship.

107
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,520
Did you come here to turn in your documents?

108
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,820
Yes! I have always respected you.

109
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,030
Thank you. I'll try my best.

110
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,300
I'll see you again next time.

111
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,060
Yes. Thank you!

112
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,040
Good-bye.

113
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,990
Why does she seem so familiar?

114
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,200
- This is your prescription.
- Thank you.

115
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,420
You are very cute, Noona. When is your shift over?

116
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,390
She's pretty.

117
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:59,250
That punk, Lee Ki Young. You have such high standards. Ah, what a useless person.

118
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,760
When did you say you're getting off?

119
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,910
I am Student Eun Tae Hee who just signed off the scholarship.

120
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,150
What day did I say that I would move in again? I forgot all of a sudden.

121
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,990
It's written down for the Saturday of the first week.

122
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,300
I'm so happy that I can't think straight.

123
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,180
Thank you. Work hard.

124
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,570
What are you doing here?

125
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,780
I will give you one last chance. Are you really going to get married to Shi Hyun's father?

126
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,740
Yeah.

127
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,320
I already said that I opposed it!

128
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,250
Shi Hyun and I are very close. We're best friends!

129
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,650
That's great to hear. I was afraid that you were bullying him.

130
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,620
Mom!

131
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,700
What's the problem?

132
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,060
You can just stay quiet and become JK Group's daughter. I'll make it happen for you.

133
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,320
What's the big deal?

134
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,940
Don't pretend that you did this for me. This isn't something I ever wanted.

135
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,720
Then think about the one thing or hundred things that you want in a day.

136
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,770
You don't have to try hard, Soo Ji.

137
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,480
I will give you everything.

138
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,360
Is it about Shi Hyun?

139
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,410
Do you like Shi Hyun?

140
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,340
No.

141
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,820
At this age, no matter who you like is merely a friend.

142
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,050
Then why did you try to set me up with Lee Ki Young?

143
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,890
Stop complaining, Soo Ji.

144
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,940
Is this a ring? Wow!

145
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,630
You're doing all sorts of things now. Do you really like him?

146
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,650
Or is it because you want JK Group?

147
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,270
Both. Is that good enough?

148
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,340
What about Dad? Does he know that you're getting married?

149
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,530
I'm sure he'll know once he reads the news.

150
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,290
You're really amazing.

151
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,840
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you before.

152
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,680
However, this is my problem and you're an adult.

153
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,770
How could you bring up your father as a reason why you oppose this marriage?!

154
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,520
I hate it when you get something that you want.

155
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,640
Because you always have to sacrifice someone.

156
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,330
Soo Ji, I'm not going to give up.

157
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,530
I know. But it's not going to end the way you want.

158
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,920
If you have a way to stop me, then try. Just try to take my position in JK Group!

159
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,140
You're a girl that can get anything you want,

160
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,810
since that's how I raised you.

161
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,770
I know all too well, that I'm your daughter and that I can't do anything about it.

162
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:15,780
But I'm different from you. I don't play games because I want something like this.

163
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,800
I don't think I can wait long.

164
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,580
You need to try harder, Kwon Shi Hyun.

165
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:20,320
I'm really sorry about that time.

166
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,330
Either way, it was still considered an accident. Are your wounds okay?

167
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,490
What the heck?

168
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,950
- Shi Hyun.
- Ah.

169
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,740
How did you know where I lived?

170
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,610
Are you giving me these?

171
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,020
Yeah, I passed by and thought of you.

172
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:58,310
Thought of me... I also thought about you a lot.

173
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,990
You don't have to feel burdened. Just think of me as your friend's mom.

174
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,970
Hey, Shi Hyun. You shouldn't be in this neighborhood for a long time.

175
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,020
There are a lot of eyes in this neighborhood.

176
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,720
Ah, yes.

177
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,740
Ha! Give me a freaking break...

178
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,730
Isn't she crazy? What's up with my mom?
[You have received a friend's request from Na Yoon.]

179
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,270
Just accept it.

180
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,410
I don't want to! There should be a law
[You have rejected Na Yoon's friend request.]

181
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,100
where you can't follow your own family members.

182
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,370
Choi Soo Ji sent me a friend request. What's going on?
[You have received a friend request from Soo Ji.]

183
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,240
You should go in quickly. You must be very cold.

184
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,680
Hey, Kyung Joo, I'm suddenly craving tteokbokki. Let's go.

185
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,070
Tteokbokki?

186
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,000
Eun Tae Hee!

187
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,770
Kwon Shi Hyun?

188
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,650
Go Kyung Joo! Wow, it's been a long time.

189
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,770
What are you doing around this neighborhood?

190
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,750
Well... I had something to talk to her about.

191
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,190
Actually, that's not it. Uh...

192
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,430
Do you know each other?

193
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,690
- No.
- Yes. No.

194
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,640
- Tae Hee.
- Hmm?
- I have something to talk to him about.

195
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,160
Want to meet me at the tteokbbokki place?

196
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,680
No, it's fine. I need to go because I have some other plans.

197
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,920
You two should have a long talk. I'll see you later.

198
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,030
What should I do? Kyung Joo probably doesn't know about it, right?

199
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,240
No, how can she end up in a love triangle with her mother?

200
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,530
It's because I am so embarrassed about it and was planning on pretending that I don't know anything until I die,

201
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,220
but you've met my mother before, right?

202
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,790
However, nothing weird happened. It just happened naturally—

203
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,760
That's enough. Have you ever told anyone? Did you tell my friend?

204
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,550
- No!
- What about Choi Soo Ji and Lee Se Joo?

205
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,760
They probably don't know about it.

206
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,960
Aish, this is really embarrassing! I feel like I'm going to die from this embarrassment!

207
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,370
N-No! They really don't know about it! Also, nothing like what you're thinking of happened—!

208
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:32,410
Either way, it's true that you two did met in a club together!

209
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,090
What's wrong with today? Seriously...

210
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,950
He's such a jerk.

211
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,060
Hey. Hey.

212
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,770
She's crying like that and he's not even comforting her.

213
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,560
Oh! What should I do about Kyung Joo? She got rejected again.

214
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,130
Yes, Madam?

215
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:13,250
Oh, it's me. When can that teacher start tutoring my Hye Jung?

216
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,180
I already said that would be difficult.

217
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,020
That teacher only teaches the smartest students.

218
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,940
You need to be at least as smart as Kyung Joo, but Hye Jung is useless when it comes to mathematics.

219
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,440
No, since she's not good at it, she needs a tutor to help her study!

220
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,020
Don't be like that. You know how I talked about that tutor who's great with elementary students?

221
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,690
I'll introduce you to that teacher.

222
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:43,530
Fine. However, I saw that you received a bunch of pretty flowers earlier.

223
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,930
- What?
- Good luck, Kyung Joo's mother.

224
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,330
Hel—

225
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,740
What's wrong with this woman?

226
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,190
Did she see me?

227
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,660
- You're here.
- Yes. Who sent those flowers?

228
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,890
They weren't delivered, right?

229
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,350
Yeah, there was a young and handsome man that stopped by to give them to her.

230
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,120
Kyung Joo, what are you two talking about? I can't understand...

231
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,150
Yeah, Kyung Joo?

232
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,720
I think Kwon Shi Hyun came to see you earlier.

233
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,570
Me? Why?

234
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,620
Why didn't you tell me that you were almost hit by his car?

235
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:40,060
Ah, well... It wasn't anything important and I didn't know he was your friend.

236
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,720
Tae Hee. I'd like it if you didn't get involved with him.

237
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,980
Of course! What is there for us to get involved in?

238
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:53,610
That's amazing. He didn't even hit you, but almost hit you and he decided to come to the house to find you.

239
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,520
He didn't say anything else that night, did he?

240
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,870
Something else? What do you mean?

241
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:04,290
Nothing. If by any chance you get any side effects, make sure to tell me.

242
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,260
We've decided that I'll speak to him in your stead.

243
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,250
No, I'm—no. I don't have any side effects.

244
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,140
So you won't need to talk to him.

245
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,190
Alright. Good night.

246
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,680
You must've really liked him a lot, Go Kyung Joo.

247
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,570
What should I do?

248
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,360
No, what do I mean, "what should I do?" I don't have to get involved with him and that's fine.

249
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,580
Go Kyung Joo and Park Hye Jung follow each other, so I sent a friend request.

250
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,030
I heard that she's best friends with Eun Tae Hee.

251
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,200
Go Kyung Joo...

252
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,470
Ugh.

253
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,850
Hey, just what did you say to her? Did you say, "I'm sorry, I kissed your mother"?

254
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,080
Just try saying it again, huh?

255
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,500
I can't believe that noona would be Go Kyung Joo's mother.

256
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,290
That's what I want to say. That noona is completely... wow...

257
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,700
But why do you two keep calling her noona?

258
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,330
- She looked like one!
- She looked like one!

259
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,670
Should I help you find stuff out?

260
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,220
I'll handle it myself.

261
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,160
Why is he so confident?

262
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,320
Two people, please.

263
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,710
What the heck?

264
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,240
Are you following me right now?

265
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,610
I'm not following you. I just want to straighten out a misunderstanding.

266
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,130
Would you let go of me?

267
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,260
Oh. Sorry.

268
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,440
Crazy bastard. [Korean slang]

269
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,560
Excuse me.

270
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,350
Yes? Oh. Oh. I'm sorry. Oh, aigoo!

271
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,890
If you can't stand properly, I'll kill you.

272
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,830
Just where do you think you're going?!

273
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,500
Aren't you going to live properly?!

274
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,190
Hurry up and leave!

275
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,000
I want a guy like that...

276
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,220
It didn't go as the way you planned, but make sure to pay the leftover amount.

277
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,550
You don't need to thank me.

278
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,100
Did you make that scene up with that pervert?

279
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,070
- What?
- Why did you just let him go like that? I wasn't able to take him to the police station because of you.

280
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,100
Ah... you see...

281
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,560
Ah. I guess you did some digging on me.

282
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,940
If not, then why did you go to Go Kyung Joo's house yesterday and how did you get onto this bus today?

283
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,590
You must really not remember.

284
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:04,510
This is already our third time meeting each other. We already met twice on the bus.

285
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,830
Oh, you—

286
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,370
Now you finally recognize me.

287
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,310
Nice to meet you, Eun Tae Hee.

288
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,930
[Tempted]

289
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,690
You know your friend, Eun Tae Hee? Apparently she met up with Kwon Shi Hyun before.

290
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,580
What the heck? Why did he call me?

291
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,660
This will probably bother her.

292
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,790
What does he keep doing? What does he want? Ah... it keeps bothering me. Seriously!

293
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:09,350
Do you remember Kwon Shi Hyun? He's better than I thought.

294
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,820
How much longer are you going to continue to follow me. Why did you call me yesterday?

295
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,650
If you're curious, then you should've called me back.

296
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,290
Just tell me what you want since you followed me all the way here.

297
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,130
- I missed you.
- Why would you?

298
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,290
Because I'm interested in you.
