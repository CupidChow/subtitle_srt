Seol Young Won.

00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,040
I wouldn't have gone this far if you two hadn't met up again.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,970
I didn't want to get involved in your life.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:28,350
I also didn't want to see the woman who I've been imagining and despising my whole life with my own eyes.

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,890
You... what did you just do?

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,790
It's just too unfair.

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,960
My mom... lived her whole life being lonely like that.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,120
While the other woman knew nothing

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,070
and lived like a victim who lost her love.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,650
Don't you think that's too unfair? Why did you tell her?

13
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,470
Why did you tell Mom where that woman was?

14
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,140
What?

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,290
In the end, you couldn't give up on anything because of your own personal greed.

16
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,720
Do you realize now how many people have suffered because of your selfishness?

17

Alright, let's take a look at this.

20

When you take the square root of X to get A,

21
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,090
we say that the square root of A is X. Do you get it?

22
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,050
Oh, I get it now.

23
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,410
I think you're really good at teaching others.

Really?

25
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,600
My head's the only problem. How do I memorize all these equations?

26
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,690
You'll be able to do it if you do the homework I give you and review it.

You met him? What for?

64

I asked him to let us marry each other. Why are you asking when you already know the answer?

How can you just make that decision on your own?

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,610
I don't understand why you had such a hard time that night when you ended everything with Tae Hee.

Fine! You could've felt guilty towards her and I know you might have been a bit shaken because of her, but it's over already!

You threw her away because you said you were sick of her now.

No. That's not why I broke up with her.

I... have never stopped loving Tae Hee for a single moment.

79
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,830
Did you

80
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,800
pretend to break up, so that I would tell you who Seol Young Won was?

81

Did you use me, Kwon Shi Hyun?

My mom was the one that caused the car accident Tae Hee was involved in two years ago.

83
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,780
My mom got into an accident on the way to see Seol Young Won, the person you told me about.

84
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:35,250
The driver that was involved in the hit-and-run accident with Tae Hee was my mom.

85
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,260
That's why I broke up with her.

86
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,970
Because I thought I was going to go insane.

87
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,520
But do you know what she told me?

88
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,220
She said that I probably had a harder time than her.

89
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,350
She comforted me by saying that it's alright now that she's met me,

90
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,390
even though she doesn't know what motives I had when I approached her.

91
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:10,320
even though she doesn't know what kind of trash I am. She told me those things.

92
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:18,370
You are confused between thankfulness, guilt, and affection right now.

93
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:25,450
We were the most important people to you and the only thing that you cared about was stopping our parents' marriage. But at one point you became strange.

94
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,520
She was just the object of our bet, but how could you end up falling for her?!

95
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,220
How can she be more precious than us—no, more than me?! Does that make any sense?!

96
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,430
Soo Ji...

97
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,960
You should come back now, but why do you keep acting like this?!

98
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,160
Do you not like it?

99
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,630
Just tell me whether you hate the idea of marrying to me to stop our parents' marriage.

100
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,270
I don't like it.

101
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,090
I do not like it.

102
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,060
Let's stop these type of bets now, too.

103
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,840
Let's stop doing these things, too.

104
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,730
I have no right to be like this.

105
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,790
Even so, you have no right to like her either.

106
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,590
Yeah. That's right.

107
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:29,360
That's why I'm going to beg her until she forgives me.

108
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,290
Even if I die, I'll still beg her.

How can we celebrate a birthday in school? How depressing!

113
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,430
Also, we have to send this punk home today. Otherwise, he'll end up like me.

Are you seriously complaining about how hard it is for you right now? Light the candles!

118
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,820
- Hey, hey.
- Why don't we just go inside and light it?

Give it to me.

122

When we turn twenty, we're going to light just three candles,

123

I'm sorry, for the things you didn't know about.

143
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,760
I'm fine.

144
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,870
I expected it because I know how you feel about Shi Hyun.

145
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:49,620
But Soo Ji, Shi Hyun's feelings have changed. Even you know that now.

146
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,430
You shouldn't have played something stupid like a game in the beginning and just

147
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,020
told him that you liked him.

148
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,480
What were you so scared of?

149
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,260
Because I was scared of something

150
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,290
and couldn't be honest." Doesn't the same phrase goes for you, too?

151
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,870
That's true.

152
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,610
Out of the three of us, I'm the dumbest. So what am I trying to say?

153
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,490
I should've stopped you two.

154
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:25,860
When I came back to my senses, I should've still tried to stop you. But why was I acting foolish like that?

155
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,250
Why did I smile, walking around and pretending I didn't know anything?

156
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:39,750
Soo Ji, don't be someone foolish like me and stop now while you can.

157
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,450
Or, if you want Shi Hyun back, you have to be honest about your heart.

158
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,480
What you want is Shi Hyun.

159
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,710
But why do you keep on doing things that make you lose him?

160
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,050
How can I tell him when he has changed this much?

161
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,340
You should just blame everything on me, too.

162
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,690
Door opened.

163
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,320
Hello!

164
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,550
Why do I keep thinking about that one time?

165
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,130
What the heck?

166
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,860
You're here?

167
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,690
Why did you come out when it's so cold?

168
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,690
Because I wanted to see you sooner.

169
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,620
Wait a moment.

170
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,150
Thanks.

171
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,100
Do you know?

172
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,410
You know how flower petals fall because of the wind?

173
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:23,080
They say that if you catch one with your hand, your love will come true.

174
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,090
Really? Who told you that?

175
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,350
My dad. My dad said he saw it somewhere in a book a while ago.

176
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,470
But the important thing is you can't try to catch the flower petal.

177
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:42,890
You should be like this and let the flower petal fall right into the palm of your hand.

178
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:47,480
You shouldn't try to catch it but wait for it.

179
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Is that so?

180
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,290
Maybe it's because love isn't something you can just catch and hold onto it.

181
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,510
Whenever spring came around, I always saw my dad standing like this.

182
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:07,790
I guess each year when spring came, he would always wait for a flower petal to fall down into his hands

183
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,510
while thinking about my mom.

184
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,310
Who was my mom waiting for?

185
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,650
I try my best to not be curious about it, but there are times when I can't help it.

186
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,370
and wonder who my real father is.

187
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,890
and whether my mom loved my dad or not.

188
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:31,350
In my memory, my mom was someone who would be willing to love my dad all alone.

189
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,470
That's why she was so lonely.

190
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,350
I guess the flower petals aren't coming to me.

191
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,930
Let's go home now.

192
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,720
I really like hearing that.

193
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,140
Right? To you, I'm like your home, right?

194
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,220
Of course.

195
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,180
You are also like my real house.

196
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,830
Really?

197
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,820
Because... you're my landlord.

198
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,020
Let's go quickly.

199
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,130
Home!

200
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,800
♫ I can feel you anywhere ♫

201
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,510
♫ I can feel you anywhen ♫

202
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,830
♫ Please embrace me with your ♫

203
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,520
♫ I'll embrace it ♫

204
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,790
Just for today...

205
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,990
I hope I can be happy for just one more day.

206
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,590
♫ The one star that shines brightly ♫

207
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:51,200
♫ Me by your side, you by my side ♫

208
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,970
Until when are you going to keep avoiding me?

209
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,780
I'm tired.

210
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,340
I heard that you asked to get married to Shi Hyun!

211
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,530
How can you be like that? If you do that, what do I become in front of him?!

212
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,770
You told me to try.

213
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,490
You told me that if I could take your position as the owner of JK Group, then to try to do it!

214
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:20,320
You can't. I can never allow you and Shi Hyun to be together.

215
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:26,430
Shi Hyun isn't Seok Woo's real son.

216
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,850
What?

217
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,930
It's exactly what I said.

218
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,270
Does Shi Hyun know about it, too? Did his father tell you?

219
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,230
That's not important.

220
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,890
Why isn't it important? If that's the case, then Shi Hyun doesn't have anyone by him!

221
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,270
If you're that worried about Shi Hyun,

222
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,400
then be on my side. I'll protect Shi Hyun.

223
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,790
What are you saying?

224
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,630
If I don't stay still about this, are you saying that you'll use that as a weapon to chase Shi Hyun out?

225
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,910
Mom, please! It's not yours.

226
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,890
His heart and his company weren't yours, to begin with.

227
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,160
You said that you didn't throw Dad and his failed business away, that you were just protecting the hospital, right?

228
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:17,660
Since the hospital is the one and only thing you have, I'm trying my best to understand you.

229
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,300
So, listen to my last favor, Mom.

230
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,650
You were kicked out of the house, right?

231
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:37,020
Were you really thrown away? Did your father say to sell the house?

232
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,000
Why do you keep talking as if you're not in that situation?

233
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,260
Did you really leave the house? What happened with your father?

234
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,060
You can't tell us, either?

235
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,630
Just... later on, I will.

236
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,510
Later on, you'll find out.

237
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:03,200
Kwon Shi Hyun, you should've told us.

238
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,620
We didn't know all this time.

239
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,700
Do you not consider my perspective when it comes to my father?

240
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,300
Did it not matter to you how foolish and stupid I would look?

241
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,970
You don't have anyone.

242
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,850
Se Joo, Shi Hyun...

243
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,340
What?  What's wrong?

244
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,370
Let's go to Shi Hyun, okay?

245
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,420
Hurry.

246
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,470
♪ Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you! ♪

247
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:56,310
♪ Happy birthday dear Shi Hyun, happy birthday to you! ♪

248
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,580
What's this? Are you crying?

249
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,200
Were you that touched?

250
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,740
How'd you know about my birthday?

251
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,890
You dummy, we talked about your birthday when we were looking at constellations.

252
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,640
Oh, right.

253
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,350
Hurry and make a wish.

254
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,140
Okay.

255
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,190
But, can you give me this one?

256
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,740
Yeah, take it.

257
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,550
Please make Shi Hyun happy and healthy.

258
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:38,410
Please make our son have a happy and healthy life.

259
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,990
Why are you wishing for that?

260
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,980
Then, what more would I wish for?

261
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,790
Why are you wishing for that?

262
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:54,770
Then, what would I ask for? You're rich and you're not interested in studying.

263
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,030
Did you think of a wish?

264
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,990
My last birthday's wish came true.

265
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,690
- What was it?
- A secret.

266
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,370
I want to celebrate your birthday, too.

267
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:13,720
My birthday will return in nine months.

268
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,640
Where in the world did a girl like you come from?

269
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,360
Well, I was born to celebrate your birthday.

270
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,120
Sorry, I'm not good at things like this.

271
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,190
- It would've been nice if we'd met a little earlier.
- Hey.

272
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,370
Why does it matter when we met?

273
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,030
What matters is how we met and how we'll continue to meet.

274
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,410
- Right?
- Yeah.

275
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,390
So, make a wish now.

276
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,250
My wish...

277
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,550
- Hold on! You need to make it a secret for it to come true.
- Alright.

278
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,460
What's this?

279
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,940
Ta-da! It's a gift.

280
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,360
You even got me a gift?

281
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,120
Yeah.

282
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,490
You're so happy, as if it's your first time getting a birthday gift.

283
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,190
It's my first time getting one from my girlfriend.

284
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,850
Open it.

285
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,540
Oh, you.

286
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,020
What's this?

287
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,750
"From the person who wants to be a great happiness to you,

288
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,780
your girlfriend...

289
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,060
- "Tae Hee."
- Oh.

290
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,990
Tae Hee means "great happiness."

291
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,270
Oh, great happiness. Wow, your name's really nice.

292
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,590
What does Shi Hyun mean?

293
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,300
In order for Buddha to enlighten his students,

294
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,130
he transformed into many identities and came...

295
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,340
Something like that. My mom said it. I don't really know myself.

296
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,570
That's a nice name.

297
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,200
Maybe she wished for you to keep transforming into different versions of yourself, so that you could find the real you.

298
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,660
I'm not sure.

299
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,550
I made this myself.
 [Your idiot smile next to the railroad. ^_^]

300
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,420
- Really?
- Yeah.

301
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,130
[Such a happy, happy day because I was with Shi Hyun.] 
You said you couldn't really remember my smile.

302
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,350
So, just take this out and look at it when that happens.

303
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:40,320
I'll never forget the smile of my greatest happiness, then.

304
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,310
From the person who wants to be a great happiness to you...

305
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,750
Your girlfriend, Tae Hee!

306
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:22,820
[Let's fill this album with memories of us going to beautiful, nice places!]

307
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,160
[To my hidden happiness,]

308
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,510
[Tae Hee ♡]

309
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,350
I thought it'd be the last time

310
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,000
that I could leave you.

311
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,730
Am I allowed to receive your smiles like this?

312
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:14,660
In order to earn the right to love you,

00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,350
I decided that

314
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,670
I needed to tell you everything.

315
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,030
Please make Tae Hee not forgive me.

316
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:32,830
Please give me a very big punishment.

317
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:50,490
♫ I should've approached you first ♫

318
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:56,650
♫ I should've said you were another me ♫

319
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:03,230
♫ More than anyone, to you ♫

00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:11,890
Let's just live remembering each other's faces from our memory. That's our punishment.

322
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,500
That woman is your mom.

323
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,090
Did you hear this, too?

324
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,990
Two years ago, Shi Hyun's mother got in a car accident and died while she was going to meet your mom.

325
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,930
Did you do all of that while knowing?

326
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,190
Did you tell me after you knew that the woman was Tae Hee's mom?

327
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,660
Yeah.

328
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,110
There's no friendship between us anymore

329
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:36,450
♫ I couldn't say it because you were gone ♫
