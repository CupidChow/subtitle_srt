[Episode 11]

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,720
I hate drawing. A lot.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,390
People like us are forced to learn everything from tutors at an early age, so that's why I learned it.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,730
So do you think that I would like it?

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,720
That's what I did.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,990
Doing that was the most like me.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,740
I'll head out first. I have to call Kyung Joo, too.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,570
I was most comfortable with what I did before I knew you.

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,780
After I got to know you...

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,640
I became the most uncomfortable.

11
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,590
Don't leave here.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,290
I'll stay. Go ahead and tell me.

13
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,350
I'm not sure if I like you.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
That's why I said that.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,290
You don't like me.

16
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,500
If you liked me, you wouldn't have embarrassed me like that.

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm talking about drawing. Not you.

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,050
I said, I'm not sure if I really like drawing.

19
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,040
You don't need to explain. It was just me overreacting.

20
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,280
Were you upset?

21
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,750
Look at me.

22
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,470
Why didn't you ditch me this time? Why are you listening to what I'm saying?

23
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,160
You told me when you broke that grandma's plate...

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,030
I'm sorry for not contacting you beforehand.

25
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,280
But you can still listen to what I have to say, right?

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,850
But all I did was blame you for everything.

27
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,770
After that, I regretted it a lot.

28
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,010
Why do you keep pretending like you're a bad person?

29
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,670
That's why you're the one who's getting hurt.

30
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,450
Eun Tae Hee.

31
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,930
You're really an adult, huh?

32
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,370
What are you saying? Go.

33
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,360
Seriously! Seriously, go where?

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,130
- Don't do that.
- Come here.

35
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,290
I told you to go away.

36
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,370
Since you're so nervous like this...

37
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,180
I seem like a bad guy.

38
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,070
- I'm leaving first.
- Huh?

39
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:18,040
You told me to go. You won't ever get out if I stay here.

40
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,330
No, that's not it!

41
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,300
I won't look, so hurry up and come out. Let's go stargazing. I know a good place.

42
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,710
- Did you go swimming?
- Yeah.

43
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,440
What about Soo Ji?

44
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,600
Hey, I asked what Soo Ji is doing.

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,340
She said she's going to sleep.

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,870
Are you going somewhere?

47
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,920
Stargazing.

48
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,240
You're all excited right now.

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,790
Do well.

50
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,320
But, did you get Soo Ji's permission?

51
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,510
For what?

52
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:02,540
"If you start the game together, then you end it together." That's what you guys said.

53
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,330
Why would I need to get permission, you punk? Want to come stargazing with us?

54
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,780
Those words aren't even from your heart. I'm just going to drink, like the true Se Joo.

55
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:40,470
I know it, too... that Shi Hyun likes drawing.

56
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,600
But, why?

57
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,030
He's just being mean.

58
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:53,570
Acting like he doesn't know, like he doesn't understand... He's so mean and ignorant.

59
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,580
Its because he has to hide his feelings.

60
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,780
What do you mean?

61
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,660
He likes... both of us.

62
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,420
There are things that we can't go against.

63
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,220
Since we were young, we knew this very well as we grew up.

64
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,040
Since we can't stop our parents from getting married,

65
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,470
we have to put in effort to look like real siblings. We're working on it.

66
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,830
It's a relief that Shi Hyun met someone first.

67
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,370
So, what you're saying is... that Shi Hyun meeting me is...

68
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,980
part of that effort?

69
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,760
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,580
For making you keep this secret.

71
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,620
Why are you telling me this?

72
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,580
Because it's sad.

73
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,450
Our story ended without having a chance to start.

74
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,530
Nonetheless, if nobody knew... we would be too sad.

75
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,400
You don't need to be sorry.

76
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,030
It's not hard for me to keep a secret.

77
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,990
Do you know why? The thing about a secret is that

78
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,650
it's a big deal for the person who tells the secret, but it means nothing to others.

79
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,020
It's just something that passes you by, like a drama you saw yesterday.

80
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,600
Alright, then I won't be sorry.

81
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,800
But, I don't think people always convey exactly what they're feeling.

82
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,320
Like how you are misunderstanding this as something to be sorry about.

83
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,500
Well, you can be confused about the difference between old friendship and affection.

84
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,350
I wish it was something like that, too.

85
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,050
How much did you like him?

86
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,480
To the point where our parents can't ever find out.

87
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,470
I can't go stargazing. I'm just going to sleep. Good night.

88
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,240
Are you making that for me?

89
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,740
I'll make you some.

90
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,080
Forget it. I don't want to force you.

91
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,710
Aigoo. I'll make you some first.

92
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,060
Do you want me to put in some marshmallows? It seems your neck is a bit swollen.

93
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,780
I can't really digest right now.

94
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:29,350
One? Two? Three.

95
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,670
Give me your hand.

96
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,100
You know that marshmallows are good for sore throats.

97
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,470
If indigestion happens, you know where to massage.

98
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,050
We're probably the only ones in the world who know that you're this nice.

99
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,630
- End of me being nice.
- You should've just given me that cup in the first place.

100
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,680
You're nice, but lack common sense.

101
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,680
- You make a fuss even when I give you everything.
- Hey! I'll get fat!

102
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,610
- It seems like she likes you
- Does it look that way?

103
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,460
Wasn't our bet supposed to be that you make her fall for you

104
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,290
and then dump her? Why are you trying so hard?

105
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,530
You should be careful. What's going to happen if she hears?

106
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,050
You must be concerned that she might know.

107
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,090
Do you dislike how much Tae Hee likes me?

108
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,980
That's not it.

109
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,120
But I hope there are no more secrets between us.

110
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,890
What secret is there between you and me?

111
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,320
No, I mean between the three of us.

112
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,560
Se Joo doesn't know... that we placed a bet for marriage.

113
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,560
You're giving this to Tae Hee, right? I'll give it to her.

114
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,390
Is your bedroom cold? Should I make it warmer for you?

115
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,800
It's warm enough.

116
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,520
It's a shame. I wanted to show you the stars.

117
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,490
Maybe later. I'll drink this well.

118
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,020
Okay.

119
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,090
Sleep well.

120
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,820
You too.

121
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,560
I don't like it.

122
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,550
How you like her.

123
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,800
A secret...

124
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,010
Since you have high blood sugar, you should try to limit your snack intake.

125
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,830
No, it's only because I normally have no appetite. So in order to get energy, I have to eat something.

126
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,340
Are you going out for some sort of wrestling competition? How much more energy do you need?

127
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,360
Your teeth are all mangled and you're still eating snacks.

128
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,690
That's why I told you to stop eating snacks. I knew you'd get in trouble. Give it to me quickly.

129
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,850
You need to stop eating snacks completely, Father.

130
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm trying to limit myself. Don't laugh. Stop laughing!

131
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,830
We will give you treatment and make you new dentures. Don't worry.

132
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,110
Oh, my, that expensive thing?

133
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,570
Does that mean this Chuseok I can eat ribs?
(A holiday celebrated in Autumn)

134
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,780
Ribs?

135
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,120
How long do you plan on living?

136
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,340
You always have to speak like that.

137
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,620
Oh, what's that?

138
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,110
Oh, my!

139
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,830
Oh, my. What is that?

140
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,120
This is my first time seeing you this young. You look just like your father.

141
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,980
Long time no see. Seeing me here,

142
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,730
Would you be displeased?

143
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,840
I regret it.

144
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,130
But, I don't feel sorry.

145
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,000
It's not like I really did anything wrong.

146
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:23,140
CEO! By any chance, is the JK Foundation's sponsorship going to end?

147
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,920
Oh, no. The two foundations will merge.

148
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,690
I'm not very familiar with JK's policies up to this point, but I'll take responsibility and make sure that doesn't happen.

149
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,120
Oh, thank you so much! The hospital beds and other recreational items...

150
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,700
You were so detailed in your care. Everyone is so impressed.

151
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,350
This little kid is cute, right? He's already twenty.

152
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,300
He receives all the attention from the elders here.

153
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,010
Has he been coming here continuously?

154
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,230
No, he just started coming again recently.

155
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,990
Wait, why is there three?

156
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,180
Tae Hee left.

157
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,100
What? Why? When?

158
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,640
I opened her door to invite her to breakfast, but she was gone. What do you what me to do?

159
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,070
- Have you called her?
- Why should I?

160
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,220
You call her. Over there.

161
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,610
I had to leave early, but I forgot to tell you.

162
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,090
Thanks a lot. Have fun.

163
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,530
I'm leaving first. She can't go alone.

164
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,440
See? Whether he's playing a game

165
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,960
or acting like he's playing a game... You're confused, too, right?

166
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,560
I should drink a cup of espresso, to wake me right up.

167
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,580
I shouldn't have tried to butt into the relationship the three of them have in the first place.

168
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,340
Why do I feel like this?

169
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,920
[Kwon Shi Hyun]

170
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,620
Hey, Eun Tae Hee!

171
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:48,030
Gosh. Why didn't you pick up the phone?

172
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,770
Because I'll miss you, if I hear your voice.

173
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,640
Do you know how far you are from the villa? Get on my back.

174
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,240
My foot just fell asleep.

175
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,960
Hurry!

176
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:24,770
The grandmas must have loved it here. The world looks different.

177
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,120
Thank you... for finding me.

178
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,300
Why did you leave first?

179
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,360
Something came up.

180
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,210
Yesterday was boring, right?

181
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,310
No. Everyone was nice to me, except you.

182
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,370
Did something happen?

183
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,320
I said no.

184
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,740
- Okay, look here. One, two, three!
- Hey!

185
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,620
- What's this?
- Hurry up.

186
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,330
- One, two, three!
- Seriously.

187
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,730
- One, two, three!
- What is this?

188
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,390
Just look here, let's take a picture!

189
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,070
- Wait.
- One, two, three!

190
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,510
Ah, really?

191
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,030
We came on a trip and we didn't even take any pictures.

192
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,980
You should've just said so.

193
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,990
Oh, let's go to that place we were going to yesterday to see the stars.

194
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,620
We can't. If we don't leave, the traffic will get crazy.

195
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,760
Then, carry me on your back to Seoul.

196
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,910
Hey, if I did that with you on my back, we'd have to sleep somewhere.

197
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,690
We'll do that, then.

198
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,930
Let's go while holding hands. Hmm?

199
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,890
♫ No way, what do you mean love right now? ♫
You came because you were worried about me, right?

200
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,630
- Not at all.
- It's true, though.

201
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,700
Your eyes can't lie.

202
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,410
I know. They say my eyes are like Cinderella's mirror.

203
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,910
Mirror? That's Snow White.

204
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,760
Oh, Se Joo must've told you that.

205
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,080
How'd you know?

206
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,760
I feel like he'd get that wrong.

207
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,360
♫  I, I, I, I, I ♫

208
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,880
You thought it was Cinderella, too, right?

209
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,590
- No, I didn't!
- I don't believe that.

210
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,020
I told you I didn't.

211
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,150
- Did you not read the story?
- I did!

212
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,560
You're going the right way, right?

213
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,290
If you get lost again, you're dead.

214
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,200
Hey, you might as well just drink in broad daylight. Do you think this suits you?

215
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,490
Have a seat. Have a seat. There's nothing better than fishing to calm down your troubled heart.

216
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,460
You, seriously... You were born with the skill to piss people off!

217
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,750
Speak for yourself.

218
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,090
I'm going to take a taxi and leave.

219
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,870
No, no, no! Just an hour.

220
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,840
Do you even know how to fish? Did you learn from your father?

221
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,750
Are you crazy? Why would the chairman come here?

222
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,360
If that's the case, I would have a piece of metal tied around my ankle and...

223
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,120
I would've become fish food a long time ago.

224
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,290
I really feel like pushing you in as fish food right now.

225
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,300
This place is perfect for running away and hiding.

226
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,150
Who'd think that a teenager would be here?

227
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,420
This is a nice place. I learned how to drink here, too.

228
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,010
Wow, look at you bragging.

229
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,090
How many fish are you going to catch? Tell me now, I'm going to catch all of them.

230
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,630
I'm not catching anything.

231
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,840
What?

232
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,830
It's not about catching anything.

233
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:01,050
The fish are there, and I'm here. That's enough for me.

234
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,550
Geez. Crazy.

235
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,780
If you want to go, then go.

236
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,180
You were telling me to stay just a moment ago, and now you're telling me to get lost.

237
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,860
You don't like to be alone, except when you're shopping.

238
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,030
You know me so well.

239
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,360
So, it's annoying.

240
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,190
You see, a fisherman once told the bait,

241
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,120
"Shall we catch some fish?"

242
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,770
Ah, but it became friendly with the fish. The bait felt divided.

243
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,550
"Should it escape the hook safely and sink to the floor?"

244
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,660
- "Or—"
- What kind of nonsense are you saying?

245
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,680
Why do you think Eun Tae Hee left?

246
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,210
How would I know?

247
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm curious about whether Shi Hyun

248
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,910
really likes Eun Tae Hee or not.

249
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,000
So, we put them together in one spot, and would you look at that?

250
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,390
I became that fisherman.

251
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,420
Then, what should we do?

252
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,620
We would have to tell Eun Tae Hee that there's no space for her between us three.

253
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,100
What are you doing?

254
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,530
But, we failed. So, what should we finally do?

255
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,070
This is no fun. Stop writing a scenario.

256
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,770
What did you tell her at the swimming pool?

257
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,230
You can tell me, you know.

258
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,330
The way you're looking at me right now... What is that?

259
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,430
Interest.

260
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,040
Get lost.

261
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,750
Should I just catch one fish? I can make great spicy fish stew.

262
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,620
As Director Myeong asked, regarding the damage caused by Tiuzen,

263
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,130
the number of investigations will go down by ninety percent and you will receive an extension to submit your proposal.

264
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,590
If all goes well, it will pass this week.

265
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:07,430
I was extremely worried after receiving the first denial. Thank you so much.

266
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,030
Because of people that are going into politics like you, it helps

267
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,520
business people like us breathe.

268
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,130
As for me, I'm doing what I'm supposed to do.

269
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,720
Without JK, our nation's economy would fail.

270
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,140
I'm also thinking about using this chance to revise the screening process.

271
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,540
Thank you so much for your attention.

272
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,420
Well... this is an embarrassing matter, but...

273
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,060
Could you open up an intern position in JK's public relations department?

274
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,690
My oldest child is a graduating senior.

275
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:45,290
I told her to go into science but she decided to take liberal arts... it's hard to get employed.

276
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,240
Yes, I understand.

277
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,660
An intern position is no problem. Even a full-time position would be possible.

278
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,800
Aigoo... I wasn't expecting you to say that.

279
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,830
But after your daughter enters JK like that, how long do you think she'll last?

280
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,130
Would she even be able to become a manager for the PR department after fifteen years?

281
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,190
Geez... CEO Myeong.

282
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,670
Looking at the committees, there are a lot of problems because of personal reasons regarding people's children.

283
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,220
You have to keep climbing up the ladder. You can't ruin your big picture over something small.

284
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,150
Our kids are so precious,

285
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:32,040
it made me ask an embarrassing favor from you guys.

286
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,420
You have gotten yourself a great bride.

287
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,390
Congratulations.

288
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,720
Yes.

289
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,090
Since it's embarrassing for me today, I'll get going first.

290
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,260
Have a great lunch and next time I'll treat you to a congratulatory drink.

291
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,500
I'll get going.

292
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,000
What did you do on the weekend?

293
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,830
Did you rest well? Your face looks good.

294
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,970
It's the same as always.

295
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,010
I exercised, worked, and went on a drive.

296
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,480
You should spend time with your son.

297
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,990
Is that so?

298
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,710
Really.

299
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,120
I'm thinking of sending Soo Ji to study abroad.

300
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,910
Did she say that she would?

301
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,710
Soo Ji isn't just playing the cello pointlessly.

302
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,190
Although she doesn't like the idea of it now, she'll go after giving it some thought.

303
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,950
I see.

304
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:37,470
Since you have a business in your family, I never expected her to do anything in music.

305
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:43,530
If I wasn't going to marry you, I was thinking about donating my hospital and business to society.

306
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,690
I would've let Soo Ji play music to her heart's content.

307
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,710
It's true.

308
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,440
I'm trying to tell you not to worry about having to give her a share of the company or anything like that.

309
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,630
I'll also be clear about this to the chairwoman when she returns.

310
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,800
I've never worried about it.

311
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,470
I really hope that she becomes an amazing musician. It would be nice if she could be in charge of the cultural foundation.

312
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,150
What does Shi Hyun want to do? Is he not going to re-take the college entrance exam?

313
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,780
He has to take over the company later.

314
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,920
I'll have a talk with him.

315
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,370
Why do you want to do that?

316
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,570
Pardon me?

317
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:33,020
I hope you aren't getting confused about the purpose of our marriage.

318
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,990
Based on what Secretary Yoon said, Shi Hyun asked about his mom's car accident.

319
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,760
Have you heard?

320
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,020
No.

321
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,990
I'll deal with him myself.

322
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,340
She sleeps so well.

323
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,850
♫ You're especially pretty today ♫

324
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:18,320
♫ Your words, you pretend  ♫

325
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,400
♫  Not to care sometimes  ♫

326
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,560
♫ When I  ♫

327
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,920
♫  Carefully start the conversation, you don't say anything  ♫

328
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,210
♫  And smile ♫

329
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,810
♫ Why do you  ♫

330
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,070
- Look this way!
- No, no.

331
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,860
Why not?

332
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,840
Look over here!

333
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,380
Hey, I could make a mistake.

334
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,400
- Look here!
- Seriously.

335
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,660
Hey, did you know that your first impression seems cold, but you look like a fool when you smile?

336
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,560
Look at this! Your eyes are gone.

337
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,360
Soo Ji tells me that I look like a fool all the time.

338
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,420
♫ What do I do? I think I like you ♫

339
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,020
"Fool" really does suits you. Are the others back in Seoul?

340
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,600
I don't know. Soo Ji didn't answer my call.

341
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,500
You should've tried calling Se Joo, too.

342
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,180
He probably turned his phone off. 359 days a year, he's running away from home.

343
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,300
What about those six other days?

344
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,770
Five days are for memorial services, and the other day is for his father's birthday.

345
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,150
You guys seem pretty close.

346
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,970
Well, we're always together.

347
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,650
Has there ever been a time between the three of you when someone dated one another?

348
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,690
It's all done. Let's eat.

349
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,210
- I'll eat it well.
- Me, too.

350
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,040
Why do you keep taking pictures?

351
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,260
Hey, it's been so long since someone made me food.

352
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,330
I like it a lot.

353
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,470
Give it to me. I'll take one for you.

354
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,990
Okay.

355
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,490
I'll take a good shot.

356
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,590
One, two...

357
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,090
Here.

358
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,000
- Lift your plate, too.
- What?

359
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,190
Hurry up.

360
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,600
Okay, the foolish smile!

361
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,500
You really...

362
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,690
One, two, three.

363
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,320
You should take one, too.

364
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,420
Hurry and eat. The noodles will get bloated.

365
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,290
It's so good! Try it. Wow.

366
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,910
Yeah.

367
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,560
I couldn't even practice because of you. What time is it?

368
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,620
You enjoyed the spicy fish stew so much, you even mixed in your rice. What's with this talk?

369
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,530
I'm going to get my own license!

370
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,340
Who are these people?

371
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,140
Open the door.

372
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,730
Soo Ji, protect the blackbox, okay?

373
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,130
- Drag him out.
- Soo Ji!

374
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,440
Hey, Lee Se Joo!

375
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,180
Soo Ji, don't come out! Don't come out!

376
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,420
Let go of me!

377
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,780
What did he do this time?

378
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,770
Don't come out! I'm fine!

379
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,230
[Soo Ji]

380
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,020
Yes, Soo Ji?

381
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,110
What's wrong?

382
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,440
Okay, I'll go.

383
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,550
What's wrong?

384
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,360
Something must've happened. Don't wait for me, eat first.

385
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,250
Should we go together?

386
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,490
Why is he in such a hurry?

387
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,170
Did he borrow money from loan sharks? Or maybe he's been kidnapped.

388
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,640
Ugh, I told him to stop being so obvious that's he has money!

389
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,130
When just looking at Se Joo, he doesn't seem like a rich boy.

390
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,510
It must be about a married woman and her husband is the leader of a gang.

391
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,580
Ugh, Lee Se Joo's causing trouble even when meeting women. Should we report it?

392
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,060
Why would we? People from his house took him back.

393
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,360
Hurry up and get inside. He'll contact us soon.

394
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:55,160
Go in a little bit. Why are you trying to leave so quickly?

395
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:01,430
You should at least stay with me until we get confirmation that he's alive, where are you going.

396
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,520
Se Joo: It was a memorial service this time. Ha.

397
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,060
This crazy Se Joo. If it was a memorial service, he should've gone home quickly!

398
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,620
Does he think he's some sort of master fisherman?

399
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,190
You must've gone fishing. The spicy fish stew is good, right?

400
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,790
You know that place, too? What the heck? He said it was a secret.

401
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,610
Did you guys just get here now? It's late.

402
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,760
Hello.

403
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,690
Bye, Kwon Shi Hyun.

404
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,980
You can talk with her inside. Why are you outside?

405
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,540
No, I was about to leave.

406
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,160
Why are you hanging onto him like that? It's uncomfortable.

407
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,560
Hurry up and go.

408
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,690
It's Sunday. Where were you?

409
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,780
I met your dad.

410
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,280
He must've arrived at home by now.

411
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,730
He didn't even drop you off.

412
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,220
Are we children? We have our own cars.

413
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,640
I'll get going first.

414
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,630
Shi Hyun, your car's pretty old. I'll buy you a new one. What kind of car do you want?

415
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:08,530
Is that a bribe? Shi Hyun's family makes much more money than us, Mom. You should buy me one.

416
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,090
You don't even have a license.

417
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,000
You can buy one for Soo Ji. I'm alright.

418
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,480
No, it's because I want to buy you one.

419
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,870
A car accident happened with this car. It's unlucky.

420
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,790
No, I'm going to keep using this car.

421
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,960
My mother was going to give me this car as my first car when I turned twenty.

422
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,500
And I don't want to receive things like cars from someone else.

423
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,290
Even if one day I won't be able to drive this car, I'll deal with it using my own abilities.

424
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:44,990
Alright, I was a bit eager. I misspoke.

425
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,580
Get back safely.

426
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,160
Yes.

427
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,060
Hey, do you have to say it like that to her?

428
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,870
Eun Tae Hee.

429
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,570
Oh my gosh.

430
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,620
What's going on?

431
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,160
What?

432
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,630
Oh, Kyung Joo.

433
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,100
You're so lucky!

434
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,690
Just combine these! Live together!

435
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,000
What are you saying? Be quiet!

436
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,990
Looking at the pictures makes it seem like you didn't go.

437
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,680
What about the swimming pool? Do you have any pictures of Se Joo?

438
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,230
He didn't swim.

439
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,160
- Did Soo Ji come?
- Yeah.

440
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:36,520
Se Joo didn't even swim, why did she butt in?

441
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,120
Don't go telling this stuff to Lee Se Joo.

442
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,730
"Infinity"? Only Kyung Joo uses that term.

443
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,760
How'd you know about it?

444
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,070
I meet Go Kyung Joo from time to time.

445
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,530
She talks about you a lot.

446
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,690
What did you say to him?

447
00:33:54,690 --> 00:34:00,530
Soo Ji wanted to help Shi Hyun and asked for information, so I just...

448
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,160
What?

449
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:12,200
Then... the three of them all talked about me?

450
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,190
Since they're close to each other, he must've heard. You can play hard to get now, too.

451
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,390
- What?
- Kwon Shi Hyun plays hard to get.

452
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,360
Why would he go to Choi Soo Ji while eating?

453
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:26,530
Stop it. I'm already confused as it is.

454
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:32,590
He was coming at me at the speed of a hundred. Then, it seems like he change his speed, eighty, a hundred and ten,

455
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,070
and then fifty. It seems so drastic.

456
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,130
Is speed everything when you date? You don't have to stick to a speed limit.

457
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,910
You should turn left and right. You have to get to one hundred if you want to get into an accident.

458
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:43,730
Oh, I don't know! I'm going to do what I want to do.

459
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,390
Playing hard to get? I'm Eun Tae Hee!
