[Episode 8]

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,880
Let's go already. I'm hungry! Kwon Shi Hyun!

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,050
Is Soo Ji coming?

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,270
I don't know. She just said that she's busy and hung up.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,340
What? Do you have something to tell her?

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,130
You two have to make up today!

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,660
Let's go!

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,800
Hey, make up with each other.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,610
Oh-ho, if you don't, I'm going to make you guys hug it out over there.

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,730
- Crazy bastard.
- Crazy bastard.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,310
Hey, I'm the only one that cares about you guys. Have some of this. You need to eat a lot now if you're going on a hunger strike.

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,860
What?

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,430
The hunger strike bet reagrding your parents' marriage. He said he's going to stop meeting Eun Tae Hee.

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,940
Is this true? Why?

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,260
Yeah, I'm going to stop meeting her.

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,610
I know, but why?

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,170
It's annoying, it's not fun.

18
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,620
Hey, Kwon Shi Hyun. Is our bet a joke to you? Is it easy for you?

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,190
Why are you like this? Just tell him to starve to death.

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,450
Even if those two end up getting married,

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,250
do you know how much I did to get them to not move out of the house that you lived in with your mother?

22
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,410
But you're stopping because you think it's not fun anymore! Get up and answer me properly!

23
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,010
I know.

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,520
I know that you went through a lot and I'm sorry about that,

25
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,540
but she doesn't like me. She said so. So what else am I supposed to do?

26
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,960
Wow, how can she not like you? Huh? I'll date her instead.

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,940
Wow! I'm really curious about the girl that doesn't like you.

28
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,540
Don't lie to me. Are you Se Joo? Why were you rejected? You're not Lee Se Joo, you're Kwon Shi Hyun.

29
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,230
I get it, so stop and take a breath before you talk.

30
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,890
Do you think I can stop to take a breath right now!? I can't understand anything right now!

31
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,380
Ah, you see...

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,150
I made a mistake. I don't know if she believed me, but she told me to get lost.

33
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,990
What did you do?

34
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,430
Come here.

35
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,040
You better not stop until you finish the rest of the plan.

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,350
- What?
- Huh?

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,030
I'm talking about her moving. I canceled the date for her to move into the Myeongdong dorms.

38
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,420
What is this? Am I the only one that remembers? Did you guys forget?

39
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,860
No.

40
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,340
Can she get back into the dorms again?

41
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,800
Are you joking?

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,590
Why? Are you worried about her?

43
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,530
Your facial expression is saying that you want to help her out immediately.

44
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,190
I'll go, if you tell me to.

45
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,610
What?

46
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,710
It's not because I care for her, but I'll go if you tell me to go.

47
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm going to be near your office soon, do you want to get dinner together?

48
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,600
I finished dinner just now.

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,060
Is that so?

50
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,370
I contacted you earlier and there was no reply,

51
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,220
so I decided to drive all the way here. If you don't have a lot of work to do,

52
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,090
do you want to come out?

53
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,150
I just don't want to eat alone.

54
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,270
What should I do? I still have a lot of do.

55
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,490
Okay. Good luck.

56
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,900
Alright. Work hard.

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,970
Secretary Yoo.

58
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,400
Let's do the remaining work tomorrow.

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,430
You can get off work now. Tell the driver to get off work, too.

60
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,380
Yes, but how will you return home, sir?

61
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,850
I know how to take the subway. I'm going. I'll see you tomorrow.

62
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,210
This wind. These lights.

63
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,380
I must've been a vampire in my past life. Why do I like the night so much?

64
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,440
Vampires don't have past lives. Their lives just end when they get hit by sunlight and turn to dust.

65
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,910
Aren't I right, Soo Ji?

66
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,290
There are no girls that don't like vampires.

67
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,140
Just look at the movies, not only in the classics. There's "Interview with the Vampire"

68
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,000
and Jim Jarmusch's "Only Lovers Left Alive."

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,120
It's freezing! Roll up the window.

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,920
Should I?

71
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,000
Stop!

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,040
Right here. Stop.

73
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,170
Aigoo, this is why people need to come out at night.

74
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,800
The people who wake up early only catch insects,

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,370
but the people who come out at night catch things to eat forever.

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,900
I'm leaving first, my friends.

77
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,000
What the heck? Are you leaving?

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,200
Hey, where are you going?

79
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,580
Oh, Hyung! What are you doing here?

80
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,670
Is he someone you know?

81
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,350
That punk, he's pretty lucky if you think about it.

82
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,850
He made us come out in this cold whether, but he just leaves us.

83
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,050
Do you want to sit in the front?

84
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,960
I saw a picture of you as a kid today. Why didn't you tell me that you knew...

85
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,670
Ah, no.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,240
I think I misunderstood you, I'm sorry.

87
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,280
If there's something you want to ask, go ahead. You must be curious.

88
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,650
You were in Seoul?

89
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,820
No. My studio is in Incheon.

90
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,980
I'm only here temporarily because of my exhibition.

91
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,000
My daughter goes to a university in Seoul. It's her first year.

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,480
She still hates me. Since she's the same age as your son, you must understand what I mean.

93
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,650
Her dad still lives abroad and it seems like he keeps in touch with her.

94
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,810
Well, I'm sure he's living well there. As for me, I'm living well here.

95
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,590
I see.

96
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,360
I thought you were going to ask something like if I waited a long time that day.

97
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,450
How could I? I have no right to.

98
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,840
I've been keeping up with you from time to time. I know that you've become the vice chairman, and other things, here and there.

99
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,060
- How?
- You're a well-known person.

100
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,600
Even if I don't want to know about it, I will find out once I go to the hair salon and read the magazines.

101
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,800
Other times, I read the economic section in the newspaper.

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,760
I also found out about your wife, although I was a few months late.

103
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,670
I thought, perhaps that's the reason why you didn't come that day.

104
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,000
You must have resented me for a few months.

105
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,380
I wasn't in the right mind to.

106
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,390
My daughter was also very sick at that time because of a car accident.

107
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,210
I thought about things a lot.

108
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,870
How great would it have been if you really met up with me that day?

109
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,450
Then I wouldn't have been home and fought with my daughter so much.

110
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,880
Her mom went crazy waiting for a guy who never showed up,

111
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,970
and didn't even know that she had ran away crying.

112
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,210
I'm blaming myself, not you.

113
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,510
It's alright, since it's all in the past now.

114
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,790
You must've had a hard time, too.

115
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,880
Is your son alright?

116
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,450
Don't you think this place is the same as before?

117
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,460
No, it's changed a bit.

118
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,810
Ah, I come here from time to time.

119
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,140
I couldn't bring myself to. Whenever I was nearby, I would just get upset and pass by.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,250
You know, we barely move on.

121
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,570
We broke up twenty years ago and failed to meet up a few years ago.

122
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,490
So I've realized something.

123
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,170
If we missed that many chances in the past,

124
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,550
then we're just not meant to be.

125
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,780
But we still ended up meeting each other again like this.

126
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,470
But this will be the last time.

127
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,220
I really wanted to see you at least once.

128
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,570
Whenever it was going to be, I really wanted to tell you these things.

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,460
On some days, I wanted to resent you.

130
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,010
On other days, I wanted to tell you that I missed you.

131
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,780
I wanted to tell you everything, like that day two years ago.

132
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,300
I wondered how many days and nights that would take.

133
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,460
I thought about those things while waiting for you.

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,980
But look at this, it only took three minutes.

135
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,940
Maybe it's because we're old now, it seems like we don't need long talks.

136
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,740
It's hard. Let's not do things like that again.

137
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,810
You understand, right?

138
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,560
Yeah. Let's not do that anymore.

139
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,890
Phone number.

140
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,700
- What?
- You should at least give me your number.

141
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,520
What? Since we're old now, there's no need for long talks. Phone number.

142
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,920
You haven't changed a bit! You're still out of control and stubborn!

143
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,520
Do your employees know that you're like this?

146
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,440

♫ Oh, dream maker ♫

148
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,060
Director Yoon, do you feel sorry for me?

149
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,020
That's why you can't even get off work and are sitting here with me like this.

150
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,970
Stop looking at me like that.

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,670
What?

155
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,240
Our bet.

156
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,800
You rambled on saying the loser has to go on a hunger strike.

157
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,300
Why are you curious about that? You said you're quitting anyway.

158
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,460
If Se Joo finds out later, he might be disappointed.

159
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,360
It's not like he wasn't next to us when we said we should get married first.

160
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,800
Is that important to you right now?

161
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,690
I'm speechless.

162
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,010
Hey, Choi Soo Ji!

163
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,660
Choi Soo Ji! What are you doing all of a sudden?

164
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,140
What if you get hurt!?

165
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,730
You're worried that Se Joo would be disappointed. You don't care about me, right?

166
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,190
Why did I say that?

167
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,290
I said that to Se Joo because I was so embarrassed! So embarrassed!

168
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,770
I'm embarrassed enough by the fact that my mom is getting married. What else should I say?

169
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,680
Should I have said my mom is getting married for money, so I placed a bet over my pride?

170
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,480
Why are you saying it like that? What's there to be embarrassed between us?!

171
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,800
Do you know how I feel? You have no worries.

172
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,060
You just have to live in peace and then go back to your mom whom I protected by groveling!

173
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,610
I'll just be the one to live a frustrating life between those two.

174
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,640
That's why I'm the only one overreacting right now!

175
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,170
How can you say that? Huh?

176
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,990
- Listen to me.
- I don't care anymore!

177
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:03,340
Whether those two get married or not, whatever my mom decides to do with you... I don't care!

178
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:09,290
Stop trying to comfort me, don't pretend to understand me! Don't you do anything!

179
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,780
Can't you just trust my heart?

180
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,060
Eun Tae Hee, that girl... she has nothing to do with us.

181
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,900
She started to matter.

182
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,940
I can see it in your eyes.

183
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,760
What do you mean she matters? What do you mean you can see?

184
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,100
You were worried about her earlier.

185
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,310
Why would I worry about her?

186
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,760
I even forgot about the day she moved. You know this.

187
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,030
You told me to go if I'm worried. So, that's why I did it: out of anger. You know?

188
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,990
Listen to me, Choi Soo Ji, seriously!

189
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,760
You'll catch a cold. Let's go.

190
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,070
Look at me.

191
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,760
Look.

192
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,800
Say what you want to say.

193
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,600
Not knowing how you feel and getting you upset, I won't do that again.

194
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,420
My dad will be good to you. And it will be fortunate if the two of them are happy together.

195
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,040
You don't have to worry about anything and do what you want to do. Is that not enough?

196
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,320
- What about you?
- Huh?

197
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,080
Why do you keep talking as if you won't be in that situation?

198
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,610
I have to go to the army.

199
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,500
Come visit me, okay? So that I can be on your side after I'm discharged.

200
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,410
Move your hand.

201
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,620
Choi Soo Ji, you need to become more simple.

202
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,730
Why do you worry about so many things with your small head?

203
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,090
Don't.

204
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,770
Huh?

205
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:29,860
This. Don't do it.

206
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,540
If you behave like my older brother and treat me like your younger sister, you're dead.

207
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,580
I got it. I wouldn't.

208
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,100
- Go.
- Bye.

209
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,350
Soo Ji.

210

He's my friend.

Oh, no... my sunbae.

212
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,880
Sunbae, isn't my daughter incredibly beautiful?

213
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,130
She's never been this drunk before.

214
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,330
Good-bye, Yoon Jin Yeong. I mean, Director Yoon.

215
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,560
Excuse me. Did you come as a JK employee,

216
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,390
or as my mom's friend?

217
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,910
Don't worry.

218
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,500
Eun Tae Hee's Move-in Day!
Wake up. Wake up.

219
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,420
Eun Tae Hee's Move-in Day!
Wake up. Wake up.

220
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,610
I know!

221
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,960
I don't know. She'll handle it herself.

222
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,310
Bring your passport. Let's go to Hong Kong!

223

[What are you talking about?]

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,990
[We have to eat dim sum. I heard it's going to snow today.]

225
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,420
Soo Ji likes to eat dumplings when it snows. Right...

226
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,920
Why does it have to snow though?

227
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm sorry. I thought you were going to help move my things.

228
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,690
The moving van only does loading and unloading.

229
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,790
If you want me to move your things, it's additional 30,000 won.

230
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,970
Yes, please do it.

231
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,710
You should've asked your boyfriend to come. Don't you have a boyfriend?

232
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,270
I hate being cold.

233
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,650
Should I or shouldn't I...?

234
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,940
You have to move things when we arrive. That's another additional fee.

235
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,900
What?

236
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,620
Miss, you should be glad you met me because I'm cheap.

Give them to me.

239
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,150
It's okay.

240
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,710

[Myeong Jeong Happiness (Confederation) Dorm]

264
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,640
Hello, I'm Eun Tae Hee, a scholarship student.

265
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,790
I'm here to move in, but it looks like there's been a mistake.

266
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,910
Pardon?

267
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,080
I never called to cancel the dorm room.

268
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,280
Who said that?! I never called before!

269
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,220
Why would I cancel it?

270
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,970
I have no where to go...

271
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,690
- You don't have to cry that much, I'm sure you'll figure it out.
- Hey!

272
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,450
Then, how can I not cry when I don't even have a home?

273
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,270
Let's go for now. Okay?

274
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,800

You should go up first since it's cold. I'm sure it's nothing big.

I'm already angry as it is.

287
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,880
I told you, the password is your phone number.

288

It's not 4-1-1-2.

289
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,130
Are you an idiot? You have to put in your whole number.

290
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,680
Oh?

291
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,320
I'm hanging up now.

292
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,800
What the heck, Kwon Shi Hyun?

293
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,820
How many times do I have to tell you? It's my mom's car.

294
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,100
How can you charge me with theft, huh?

295
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,010
I'm not quite sure, we just have to investigate it since someone reported it.

296
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,990
Who decided to report it?

297
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,790
Kwon Seok Woo, your father.

298
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,460
How many times did you not go home for him to report you?

299
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,510
Please check the name that's registered under this car.

300
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,030
You said this was your mom's car, right, Shi Hyun?

301
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,380
O-Oh. That's right.

302
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,540
The registered name is the car owner.

303
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,560
In a case where the owner of the car passed away, the inheritance is commenced immediately.

304
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,920
Therefore, the inheritor automatically becomes the lawful owner.

305
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,620
Then that means this car is owned equally by both my friend here and his father.

306
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,290
Then, that obviously makes him the owner.

307
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,290
Since he is going around with his deceased mother's car, then that means there has been an implied agreement.

308
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,970
And if he is allowed to use it, then you don't have the power to lock him up.

309
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,820
Therefore, this isn't considered theft. Correct?

310
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,650
Well, that is right.

311
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:58,010
Aigoo. You should go home quickly and make up with your father. You should also report your inheritance while you're at it, too.

312
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,660
What's with family members reporting one another? The car's so clean it doesn't even have a single accident record.

313
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,620
What? There was no accident record?

314
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,740
There isn't any. Why?

315
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,530
Nothing. It's just that my mom died in this car

316
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,510
because of a car accident.

317
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,850
If someone died in a car accident, then it would definitely have been reported.

318
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,520
I am Mr. Kwon's legal representative. Any further communications can be done through me.

319
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,010
[Chief Secretary Yoon Jon Young]

320
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,770
His representative is right here...

321
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,560
I'll take care of the rest.

322
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,150
Let's go. You're hungry, right?

323
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,490
I think tofu would be a bit...

324
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:31,100
This is your first time seeing a father reporting his son, right? My family is a bit messed up.

325
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,610
My family isn't all that better.

326
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:41,520
Have you ever seen a dad who quit being a law professor because of a crush?

327
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:49,010
What makes it worst is the person he had a one-sided crush on was also his wife, my mom.

328
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:57,980
I guess the person you were talking about that made their heart fall ill because they hid their feelings was your dad.

329
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,150
My mom still thinks that he's working as a professor,

330
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,660
but he's a barista now. Isn't that amazing?

331
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,200
Yeah, it was amazing.

332
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,620
I heard that his girlfriend is law student.

333
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,750
What's wrong? Are you alright?

334
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,570
Nothing. It's just I ate it too fast.

335
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,080
I'm a bit cold.

336
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,830
I thought you said you burn up easily. Let me see.

337
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,450
Do you have a fever? You should've stayed home since it's so cold.

338
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,770
- You must've come out because you were worried for me.
- Of course.

339
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,420
What can a guy smiling like a fool solve at a police station?

340
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:58,380
I... saw the drawings that you made of me.

341
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,180
I completely caught you liking me, right?

342
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,130
Ah, about that—well—I wouldn't say I did that because of that...

343
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,480
It's alright. You don't have to answer right away.

344
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:26,800
I... think I like you.

345
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,490
Do you not regret it?

346
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,820
Huh? What?

347
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,080
One...two...

348
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:19,020
A secret has started to grow inside of me.

349
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,550
It's snowing.

350
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:39,040
Did you know that they say you'll get lucky if you move on a snowy day?

351
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,010
Will something good happen to me?

352
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,440
Thank you. If it wasn't for you, it could've been bad.

353
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,100
When we arrive, I'll treat you to black bean noodles and sweet and sour pork.

354
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,760
Okay.

355
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,630
Please let me live with someone I love.

356
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,450
I hope that my wish comes true.

357
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:36,110
♫ What do I do? I think I like you ♫

358
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:43,070
♫  Shining like the stars in the night sky, warmer than sunshine ♫

359
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:47,450
♫ I like you, I like you so much ♫

360
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:54,430
♫  Your gaze, it gently  ♫

361
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,600
♫  Melts my cold heart  ♫
