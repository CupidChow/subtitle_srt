1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,700
By any chance,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
do you not like me anymore?

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,390
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,490
You don't like me anymore?

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,550
Yeah.

6
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,130
[Episode 19]

7
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,340
Did the both of you know about this before you came here today?

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,350
This won't do.

9
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,270
I'll take Shi Hyun home.

10
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,580
Let's go together.

11
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,290
Let's also take Tae Hee home, too.

12
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,730
Let her be.

13
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,190
I'll call a designated driver to take him home.

14
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,610
You know where Shi Hyun lives?

15
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,070
What?

16
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,360
No.

17
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,590
Take Kyung Joo home.

18
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,830
I'll leave after taking Shi Hyun home.

19
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,620
But still...

20
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,860
Just let her go.

21
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,710
Hey, Kwon Shi Hyun. Come to your senses.

22
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,210
Let's go.

23
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,990
This won't do.

24
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,460
I'm going to go to Tae Hee.

25
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,350
How long are you planning on acting like that?

26
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,260
What?

27
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,990
I'm asking, until when

28
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,780
are you and I going to clean up after our friends?

29
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,010
We're here. Let's go.

30
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,430
I don't want to go in.

31
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,180
Alright.

32
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,220
Don't go in then.

33
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,390
Please drive.

34
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,710
Shi Hyun. Shi Hyun!

35
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,410
What's wrong with you?

36
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,050
Should... I stay here today?

37
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,330
What is it? Are you really sad?

38
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,190
Look at me.

39
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,320
You,

40
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,720
me, and Se Joo

41
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,320
were always together whenever one of us had a hard time.

42
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,490
If it wasn't for the three of us,

43
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,190
there would be no one to comfort us.

44
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,050
There was no one that would embrace you.
- Soo Ji! Choi Soo Ji!

45
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,920
That's what we all believed.

46
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,270
That's right.

47
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,590
That's why

48
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,290
I'm also here by your side today.

49
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,100
That was so natural for me until now.

50
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,700
You should sleep now.

51
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,990
Once you wake up,

52
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,680
come home with me.

53
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,670
But now

54
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,830
my heart doesn't feel that way anymore.

55
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,670
♫ I couldn't ♫

56
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,970
♫ say ♫

57
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,820
♫ To pour ♫

58
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,370
♫ out my heart ♫

59
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,610
♫ In case ♫

60
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,500
♫ I got farther away from her  ♫

61
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,840
♫ I must have been hesitating  ♫

62
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:14,830
♫ I should've told you I love you first ♫

63
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:22,040
♫ I should've said I was in love with you ♫

64
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,590
♫ Now and like this  ♫

65
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:34,190
♫ I wouldn't have regretted it ♫

66
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:43,570
♫ I should've approached you first ♫

67
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:51,640
♫ I should've said you were another me ♫

68
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,350
♫ More than anyone, to you ♫

69
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:03,440
- It was too dark, so I was feeling stuffy. Can you take this and give me the clippers?
- What? Oh.

70
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,060
♫ I'm standing here, repeating it alone  ♫

71
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,270
♫ I always want to ask ♫

72
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,570
♫ More than me, you are ♫

73
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,840
♫ Now and like this, I love you ♫

74
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,810
♫ A normal love that would be forgotten as another love  ♫

75
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,260
♫ I must be crying ♫

76
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,600
♫ because that's me ♫

77
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,750
♫ This is late ♫

78
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,610
♫ but I'll say I love you  ♫

79
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:57,710
What are you trying to say to me right now?
♫ I couldn't say it because you were gone  ♫

80
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,980
♫ That I love you, ♫

81
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:09,910
♫  That I love you, those words ♫

82
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,840
Yes, Director?

83
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,520
Can you send me Vice Chairman Kwon's medical check up from last year?

84
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,960
It will probably be difficult for you to get used to the JK Group from now on.

85
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,150
Whether it's your business or your child,

86
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,850
do you think you can deal with it using just your own rules and principles?

87
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm sorry, but we can't make false diagnoses.

88
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,260
It's considered forgery on official documents.

89
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,880
You should get help and through official processes, get a proper diagnosis

90
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,870
and get treatment from a doctor.

91
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,770
Let's talk about the medical certification for the military after that.

92
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,570
Do you think that I don't know the rules?

93
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,410
My Kyu Jeong is an heir.

94
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:04,210
I thought you would be able to understand me now that you're becoming a part of the royal families.

95
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,440
It's probably because you're so hard to talk to.

96
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,140
That's why Vice Chairman Kwon goes to a different hospital.

97
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,340
What are you saying?

98
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,450
My Hye Jung told me.

99
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,100
She said that at her optometrist, she saw Soo Ji's step-dad there.

100
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,010
Vice Chairman Kwon didn't get a check up last year.

101
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,210
He kept changing the appointment, but in the end, he never came.

102
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,010
I understand.

103
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,600
What brings you here unexpectedly?

104
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,450
I wanted to have a can of beer, but I didn't have anywhere to go.

105
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,840
Ah, about that—

106
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,220
Soo Ji always says something about this,

107
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,770
but I'm more comfortable this way.

108
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,580
If you're comfortable, then just stay like that. I also do that sometimes.

109
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,210
Sit down.

110
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,090
I really love chicken and beer.

111
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,840
It's been so long.

112
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,760
It's my first time seeing such a happy expression on your face.

113
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,870
Soo Ji won't eat it with me.

114
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,680
Do you eat this often with Shi Hyun?

115
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,550
No.

116
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,520
I'm sorry I didn't tell you properly when Tiuzen passed the screening.

117
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,570
This is so refreshing. No wonder, for some reason I wanted to stay late today.

118
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,360
Can I ask you for a favor?

119
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,790
Of course.

120
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,910
Soo Ji's department at school came up with an idea for a business and academic cooperation.

121
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:21,690
It's a program to sponsor new musicians. Can you consider their proposal?

122
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,350
You can make a decision and do what you want.

123
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,260
By any chance, is there something wrong with your body?

124
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,200
What?

125
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,190
To be honest, someone told me they saw you at another hospital.

126
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,560
I guess they saw me when I was at my optometrist's office.

127
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,290
No, I'm fine. There's nothing much.

128
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,600
You should get a check-up.

129
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,130
You should make some time.

130
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,220
You're really okay, right?

131
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,300
Yeah. I said I'm fine.

132
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,360
The optometrists at our hospital are pretty good, too.

133
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,700
I got it.

134
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,410
You have to tell me first if you get ill anywhere.

135
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:19,350
I'm not trying to pressure you or anything. It's just that it affects our businesses, too.

136
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,410
Alright.

137
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,030
I'll tell you first.

138
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,340
Did Shi Hyun really like Tae Hee?

139
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm sure Eun Tae Hee knows that answer the best.

140
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,340
You really can't know how people feel. How can you be like that to someone you like?

141
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,250
Did she like Shi Hyun a lot?

142
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,800
A lot. That's why I think she's holding it in.

143
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,450
Go Kyung Joo, are you certain about your heart?

144
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:02,750
Then, does everyone know their heart that well? How?

145
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,460
Once you kiss, then you find out.

146
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,630
You might not even like me as much as you say you do.

147
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,100
I must've not liked you.

148
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,850
I must have just liked you as a friend.

149
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,980
What should I do? This is so embarrassing.

150
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,840
I'm leaving.

151
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,420
Good-bye!

152
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,540
Kyung Joo.

153
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,350
What's wrong, Kyung Joo?

154
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,290
What happened, Daughter?

155
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,690
Let's meet up. I have something to say.

156
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,190
Go Kyung Joo, are you not going to school today either?

157
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,680
My Kyung Joo won't eat and can't sleep.

158
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,020
Look at this. I also aged a bit, Tae Hee.

159
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,160
I brought you spicy rice cakes and tempura.

160
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,360
Get up.

161
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,540
Here.

162
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,530
After he kissed you, you finally realized

163
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,200
that you really do like him, right?

164
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,740
And you also realized that he doesn't like you, right?

165
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:34,790
Eat up. Now that you've confirmed how he feels and how you feel, then that's enough. Why do you keep crying?

166
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,320
Are you alright?

167
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,650
I'm fine! What? Do you die from not dating anyone?

168
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,510
It was for the best.

169
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,710
Without realizing it, I kept relying on him and kept thinking about him.

170
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,620
I don't like him anymore.

171
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,230
Lies.

172
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,630
I'm being serious. From now on, don't even mention his name in front of me.

173
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,320
I congratulate you on ending your one-sided love, Go Kyung Joo.

174
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,630
Still, this is the first time I ended it myself, right?

175
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,630
Yeah.

176
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,580
Also, now the both of you can still remain as friends. It's a good thing.

177
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,590
Will you really end it like this?

178
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,370
I thought about whether or not I should hold onto him and argue with him.

179
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,340
Forget it. It's a waste of time.

180
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,710
Where did he go?

181
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,320
Door opened

182
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,550
Did you get home safe?

183
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,700
Ah, that's right. I had a hard time grabbing the cab.

184
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,200
You really shouldn't drink, you barely drink and you forget everything. You're going to become an alcoholic.

185
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,730
I'm sorry.

186
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,780
You're sorry? For what?

187
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,260
You don't remember anything.

188
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,710
Door opened

189
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,880
I don't remember. Did you do something wrong to me?

190
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,630
Alright then.

191
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,420
What the heck? Did you guys start fighting the minute you got here?

192
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,250
Did you get home okay?

193
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,080
I slept here.

194
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,220
Soo Ji dropped me off and left.

195
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,690
Why didn't you just sleep at home instead of here?

196
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,440
Why did you call us, Choi Soo Ji?

197
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,950
Seol Young Won. She's a ceramist. She's the same age as your dad and they went to the same university.

198
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,900
You get the story, right?

199
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,620
[Ceramist Seol Young Won]

200
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,790
Is she someone you know?

201
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,690
No. Did you check properly?

202
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,210
I saw them together with my own eyes.

203
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,820
She held an exhibition at the JooSeum Hotel.

204
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,990
Does your mom know about it?

205
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:10,050
Well, I'm embarrassed to say this, but my mom even bought some of her works.

206
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,680
I'm sure there are some in your house, too.

207
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,120
She must have been very popular back in the day.

208
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,550
In an interview she said that all her works were sold, but doesn't know where they all went to.

209
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,620
For an artist to become an important person, their buyers should exhibit them,

210
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,930
give them as presents, and brag about it.

211
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,090
The only way for an artist to become famous is for people talk about them.

212
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,970
You're saying someone did something to ruin that chance of hers, right?

213
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,500
Did my mom try to stop this woman's future?

214
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,510
Hey, there's no way.

215
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,560
It might even be the opposite.

216
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,040
Your dad might be helping her without letting anyone know.

217
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,520
Isn't that is bit touching?

218
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,620
She even has her email on that leaflet.

219
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,020
She has two studios, one in Icheon and another in Jeongeup.

220
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,960
What are you going to do?

221
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:10,360
Revenge is stealing something precious to them.

222
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,930
What could it be for her?

223
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,450
Shi Hyun's dad? Her work?

224
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,090
Or... her children?

225
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,080
Choi Soo Ji!

226
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,170
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

227
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,860
Is she married? Any kids?

228
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,990
No. I don't know.

229
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:35,630
Will you guys just stop it alre—Isn't it enough that you know who it is?

230
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,960
When your parents get married, it'll be all over the news.

231
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,190
There's no way that she won't know about it. If he keeps meeting her after that, you can figure it out then.

232
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,190
That's alright, too. But it's your decision.

233
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,310
I'll take care of it by myself. I'm going.

234
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,750
Work hard.

235
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,260
Hi, my name is Eun Tae Hee.

236
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,670
She's Kyung Joo's friend and a very smart student. Say hello.

237
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,250
She got full marks on the CSAT and has a lot of awards from math competitions.

238
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,460
She's a Myeong Jeong scholarship student.

239
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,070
Hello.

240
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,780
Hye Jung, can you first show me the books that you use to study?

241
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,720
Yes, yes, yes. Come this way.

242
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,770
Okay, let's see.

243
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,320
Hye Jung, your handwriting is really nice!

244
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,320
For math, it's important to go over the basics and to really get them down.

245
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,620
I went back to middle school math a lot, too.

246
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,380
Really? Wow.

247
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,600
So I wasn't wrong after all.

248
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,100
I think we're going to have to work on factorization a little more.

249
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:17,210
If you can't factorize, equations will be hard to solve, and then linear and quadratic functions will be really hard.

250
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,980
To be good at factorization...

251
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,970
Here.

252
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,170
Myeong Jeong is largely divided into hospital groups and medical foundations.

253
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,730
It looks like she stepped away from management to research

254
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,810
but CEO Myeong is the actual person behind management.

255
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:39,010
If our JK Bio merges with artificial organ research and stem cell therapy...

256
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,230
with Myeong Jeong Medical Research Center,

257
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,400
we're anticipating much profit and expansion in bio research and development.

258
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,210
What's the most doable in terms of new research?

259
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,260
It's a new drug for atopic dermatitis stem cells.

260
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,510
If there are no issues at the clinical trials, I think it will be launched in the market in the fall.

261
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,330
Fall is too late.

262
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,960
And that ceramist... I heard the vice chairman is seeing her again.

263
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,410
I confirmed that she ended their relationship first.

264
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,430
The vice chairman isn't contacting her either.

265
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,500
I am well aware of your capabilities.

266
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,550
But you tend to cause some clatter while doing your business.

267
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,460
The matter regarding the shares under borrowed names has resurfaced.

268
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,270
I am quite uncomfortable.

269
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,780
I'm sorry.

270
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,500
And please talk comfortably.

271
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,040
I will do as I please after you become a part of my family.

272
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,310
And as of now, you're not my employee either, right?

273
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,590
Yes.

274
00:25:54,590 --> 00:26:00,110
I heard that you're running clinical trials for a new drug. I will keep my eyes on it when it gets released.

275
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:07,110
I hope it will create great results so it can silence the matters regarding the shares under borrowed names.

276
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,750
- Mother.
- I'm talking about work.

277
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,620
I don't give this kind of pressure without compensation.

278
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:20,920
Depending on the result, I plan to transfer a sizable amount of my shares.

279
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,070
And it depends on your performance whether my shares will go to you two,

280
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,640
or my grandchildren, Yeo Min and Shi Hyun.

281
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,080
It all depends on you, CEO Myeong.

282
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,110
Chairwoman, I may be out of line, but if it's not an inheritance but a transfer, there may be issues with taxes...

283
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,210
That's why I said it's up to CEO Myeong.

284
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,620
If you're capable, you can run the company

285
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,930
with fewer shares.

286
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,640
I understand. I will try my best.

287
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,280
♫ Near the sun, it wasn't bright ♫

288
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,470
♫ I was a stupid, for a while ♫

289
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,270
♫ Swept away ♫

290
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,520
Here. A present.

291
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,650
It's good. You sure are a barista's daughter. You make great coffee.

292
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,760
Did you know that Dad doesn't lecture anymore? Do you two contact each other?

293
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,760
How can we become complete strangers with such a precious daughter like you between us?

294
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:03,170
When you were in the hospital, it was so scary and tough so I called once.

295
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:08,290
As soon as he answered the phone he said, "The coffee beans I'm roasting right now, they're yours."

296
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,700
That's what he said.

297
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,850
Sounds like Dad.

298
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,350
I couldn't tell him that you got into a car accident.

299
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,740
I told him that working with coffee suits him so well.

300
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,490
I told him to stay healthy and be well. And I hung up.

301
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,870
Why didn't you tell me something like that?

302
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,810
If you knew, you might have false hope.

303
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:42,010
Dad still wants to see you.

304
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,870
I'm like that at times, too.

305
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,290
But staying like this might be better for our relationship.

306
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,630
If I want to see your dad, I can just see you because you resemble him so much.

307
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:59,590
Your dad will probably be like that too, because you resemble me as well.

308
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,320
I'm going back to Icheon.

309
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,080
My exhibit is over and I got to see that you're doing well.

310
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,000
Okay.

311
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,280
Also, I'm not dating right now.

312
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,450
I came here to tell you that.

313
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,200
I'm not curious.

314
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,750
If I reminded you of your dad, you would've come to see me.

315
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:34,110
Dad is such a warm-hearted man and Mom is very cold, right?

316
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,530
Why is your face like that? Are you sick somewhere?

317
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,960
No.

318
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,960
Did you get dumped?

319
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,310
What are you saying? I said I'm not dating anybody.

320
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:56,560
And I'm the type of person who'd dump someone, not get dumped.

321
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,790
Good for you.

322
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,310
When I go back to Icheon, I'm just going to focus on my work.

323
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,430
When you have break, come once.

324
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,020
I'll see.

325
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,460
You're not saying you don't want to?

326
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,890
If you have a boyfriend, come together. I'll make you some delicious food.

327
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,030
You can't even cook.

328
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,460
So you do have one. You have a boyfriend.

329
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,430
No, I don't.

330
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,760
That's not it.

331
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,790
I said no. Do you know whose fault it is that I never date?

332
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,550
What's with this excessive reaction?

333
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,910
It's quite refreshing to hear you say words like that.

334
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:34,220
I don't know. Finish your drink and go.

335
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,270
Tae Hee.

336
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:53,050
Thanks a lot for accepting my present.

337
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:06,430
Do you remember when I asked you about why there was no record of my mother's car accident?

338
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,310
Ah, you did.

339
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:11,990
You said you would look into it, but you haven't said anything.

340
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,800
I know...

341
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,590
why you didn't tell me.

342
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:25,360
Because you're worried that I would be shocked by the accident my mother caused.

343
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,320
Then, please answer this.

344
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,790
There's no way you wouldn't know about this.

345
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,690
Did you know there is some sort of relationship between the one who made this and my father?

346
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,260
My mother told me this...

347
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,150
"When I see this..."

348
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,090
I feel like I am the owner of this place.

349
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,930
I think I understand what she meant now.

350
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,390
Did my mother buy these works?

351
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:14,390
Or... You aren't telling me, just as I thought.

352
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:20,790
Then tell me the connection between this artist and my mother's car accident.

353
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,860
What do you mean, a connection?

354
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,230
Please just tell me or else I'll have to find out myself.

355
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:47,350
Your mother was on her way to meet with this person.

356
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,230
And there was an accident in the process.

357
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:58,560
As for the work... it's something the chairwoman ordered us to do a long time ago.

358
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,590
Grandmother did?

359
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,060
My entire family knew about this except me.

360
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:44,810
♫ I'll stop and wait next to you ♫

361
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:51,960
♫ So that you can stay and rest ♫

362
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,960
♫ When whatever words, and whomever ♫

363
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,360
♫ Can't comfort you ♫

364
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:07,190
♫ Lean on me ♫

365
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,830
♫ I can feel you anywhere ♫

366
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:17,740
♫ I can feel you anywhen ♫

367
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,270
♫ Your weary heart ♫

368
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,330
So you act like you don't even know me?

369
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,770
That's not it. I can't pretend like I know him.

370
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:29,040
Because it's over.
