Ramen is just a ramen and an egg is just an egg.

Hey, Kyung Joo. I just made some ramen, it's no joke.

Come here quickly and I'll make you some, too.

How can food even go down your throat right now? You're an animal.

Animal—Animal—

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,530
What's wrong with you? You're acting like an animal.

7
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,310
If we miss the last train, what are you planning on doing?

You're like an animal...`

9
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,950
Animal...

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,050
Hey, if you use the word "animal" in front of me again, I won't forgive you!

11
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,060
I guess you're going insane, too.

12
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,020
I keep eating, but I'm not getting full.

13
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,420
Why am I so angry?

14
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,590
He said he wasn't mad at me!

15
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,000
If he's not, then why did he suddenly dislike me?!

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,550
Why did he hug me and make me breakfast then?!

17
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,370
If he disliked me, then just don't like me. Why did he end things like this?

18
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,790
Ah! Kwon Shi Hyun, you bastard!

19
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,450
You went a little overboard, Eun Tae Hee.

20
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,030
You're the one who said you wouldn't die if you didn't date.

Leave your assignment in the office.

Don't forget and make sure to get a confirmation.

23
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

24
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,620
Ah, also. Please don't try to get out of our post-project gatherings or after-parties.

25
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,410
We're going to have to spend time with each other from now on, so it's nice if we get friendly.

26
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,370
Hey, here's the attendance book.

27
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,930
Eun Tae Hee, you're coming to the after-party later, right?

28
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,720
Yes, I'll go.

[Process Validation Report for Myeong Jeong Stem Cell Drug]

30
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,980
- What is it?
- You know, the new drug...

31
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,040
I heard the clinical trial results didn't turn out well, so it's being halted. Are you okay?

32
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,500
We're not stopping. It's just a rumor.

33
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,610
I'm going to apply for a change in testing.

34
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,350
When we get our license, we can push up the launch date.

35
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,720
Getting the license won't be easy.

36

If you're overdoing it because of the chairwoman—

No. I can get the approval moved up.

38

Don't let anything else be said from JK.

39
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,680
Okay.

40
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,500
I wish you'd live a carefree life.

41
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,500
- Give it to me.
- Don't take it. This is a warning.

42
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,570
I'm a doctor. I can deal with my own prescriptions.

I have something to say. Please make some time for me.

Here, sit down.

45
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,700
Marriage? I think I misheard it.

46
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,140
No, you heard right.

47
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,450
Please let Shi Hyun and I get married.

48
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,290
Will you say it in a way that it's easy for me to understand?

49
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,740
As you already know, we've known each other longer than the two of you have.

50
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,910
We're not that innocent either.

51
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,660
Did you call me just to tell me this?

52
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,460
If you say that, did you think the grownups would be shocked and change our decision?

53

If it's a joke, stop here.

Seeing your shocked expression makes me feel as if I've done something wrong.

55
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:43,960
You shouldn't be more shocked than I was when I saw you with another woman.

56

- Stop it.
- I saw the two of you by chance.

59
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,870
Don't blame me. Blame your own carelessness.

60
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,490
It's not a big deal. You have nothing to lose.

61
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,880
What are you saying?

62
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,360
Whoever gets married, you'll get what you need for your business.

63
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,320
You can continue to meet up with the one you truly like and I

get to stop watching JK Group use my mom. Aren't I right?

65
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,720
Based on what you said, I can't really tell.

66
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,650
I'll talk to Shi Hyun on my own.

67
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,850
Please do that.

68

Do you remember Lawyer Do Ji Young who helped JK a few months ago?

69
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,200
You already knew what we did.

70
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,940
It was bothersome, so you just pretended not to know.

71
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,960
Yes, we're like that.

72
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,060
We're mean. We act without thinking about the future, and we don't care if anyone suffers because of us.

73
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,270
So you won't be able to stop us.

74
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,030
Give us an official engagement.

75
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,960
Then I'll convince Shi Hyun and we'll go study abroad together.

76
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,910
Why are you telling me this, instead of your mother?

77
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,820
Because it's of no use.

78
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,570
People who are in love can't hear what other people say.

My mom hasn't been able to sleep well. She was like that before, but it's worse now.

80
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,130
It seems like she slept well some days, but on other days, she stays up all night.

81
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,810
She can barely wake up because of her sleeping pills.

Where have you been, Tae Hee?

89
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,860
Here, sit down.

90
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,180
I bought some steamed buns!

91
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,730
Wow!

92
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,090
- Look at at that
- That's amazing!

93
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,260
It's so great now that you're here, Tae Hee!

94
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,390
Thanks!

95
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,250
Yay!

96
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,170
You should have some, too.

97
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,450
Enjoy it.

98
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,790
You have to watch out. This is all sugar.

99
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,260
It's alright as long as I only eat a little bit.

100
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,770
Where did you buy this? There are real countryside steamed buns.

101
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,200
I had to go to Yangpyeong to do an assignment.

102
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,580
So, you must've gone with Si Hyun, huh?

103
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,060
Yeah...

104
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,550
- You should've come here with him!
- He said he was busy.

105
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,320
He's not even employed nor does he go to school, so what's making him so busy?

106
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,980
Both of you come here when you fight, huh?

107
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,130
If you're finished eating, go get some ice water yourselves.

108
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,020
Let's eat slowly, my baby.

109
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,940
Good.

110
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,840
It's okay, it's okay.

111
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,730
I'm going to head out now.

112
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,320
- Bye!
- Bye, Tae Hee.

113
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,530
- Come back later.
- Good-bye.
- Alright, good-bye.

114
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,540
I knew he'd be a player.

115
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,700
Should I just go and get him?

116
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,350
They say, "After a storm comes a calm."

117
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,940
What is she saying to her? She's not even all there.

118
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,760
Alright.

119
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,490
Do well. Alright, good-bye.

120
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,610
Thank you.

121
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,360
Yes, what brings you to give me a call, CEO Myeong? You're such a busy person.

122
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:57,030
- Madam, I'm calling to discuss your son.
- Oh, my...

123
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:03,750
CEO Myeong... do you know how upset I've been ever since that day?

124
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,660
There's something I need to request from you as well.

125
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,820
I believe you were greeting Assemblyman Kim Se Chan at our Sponsor's Night.

126
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,170
Would you be able to set up a meeting with Assemblyman Kim?

127
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,200
Oh, my cousin's husband? I understand.

128
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,740
I'll ask her and call you later.

129
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,350
Cheers to us!

- Oh my!
- Hello!

135
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,780
Hey, Tae Hee. Sit here.

136
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,380
Why would we even sit next to you?

137
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,510
Right?

138
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,780
What's with her?

139
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,670
Game, start!

140
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,980
Ramen, noodles, go!

141
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,520
Kyung Ho, noodles, go!

142
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,190
Ah...

143
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,230
One, two, three!

144
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,560
Drink, drink, drink.

145
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,820
- Drink, drink!
- Eat, eat!

146
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,930
We didn't order drinks.

147
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,930
It's on the house.

148
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,850
Thanks.

149
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,620
You did a great job on the design. Let's enter the competition together.

150
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,110
Well, I'll think about it.

151
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,740
Cheers.

152
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,450
Actually, there's a topic I'm thinking of. It's amazing.

153
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,270
No, I already said that I'll think about it.

154
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,420
I'm not doing it! Don't ask me again.

155
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,890
Sorry. Sit down.

156
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,510
Hey, why aren't you drinking?

157
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,020
Hey, hey. Let's all have a toast!

158
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,780
Okay.

159
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,780
Why do you come here so often?

160
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,550
What are you saying?

161
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,240
You want me to be in charge of management for JK Bio?

162
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,230
Like I said,

163
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:31,090
I want you to take the position regardless of our marriage.

164
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,940
Is it because you don't think I'll be able to release the new drug?

165
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,260
I don't want you to strain yourself.

166
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,670
When did you ever care about me overworking myself?

167
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,450
If you want to call off our wedding, tell me.

168
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,720
No. I don't know if you'll believe me, but even after marriage,

169
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,760
I was going to put Bio under your care.

170
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,290
You don't believe me?

171
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,400
I've always believed you.

172
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,020
We have to merge and eliminate JK Bio's deficit.

173
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,370
That's the only way I can be acknowledged to go up.

174
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:17,020
But I don't want to do this anymore.

175
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,640
I thought it would be best to leave this business

176
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,230
to a family member, to someone I could trust.

177
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,620
I really mean it.

178
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,330
I'll pretend that I didn't hear this offer of yours today.

179
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,090
I met Soo Ji.

180
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:41,550
I think we misunderstood Soo Ji and Shi Hyun's relationship.

181
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,260
They want to get married.

182
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:57,230
I thought for a long time about how I would bring this up, but this is the best I could do.

183
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:04,230
We said we'd discuss the matter of our children together, but I never thought it would be like this.

184
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,240
That's probably not it.

185
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,150
I'm going to talk to Soo Ji.

186
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,150
Please don't misunderstand.

187
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,490
At first, I needed you and Myeong Jeong.

188
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,220
Then I found that you were trustworthy.

189
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,480
I know that you are considerate of me,

190
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,920
and I know that you don't consider our marriage as an only business.

191
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,630
I'm thankful for all of that.

192
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,200
But?

193
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:57,590
But if this is the case with our children, I don't think we should make a move.

194
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,200
Are you sure there are no other reasons?

195
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,350
Regardless of our children,

196
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,370
I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing.

197
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,050
Drink up! Drink up!

198
