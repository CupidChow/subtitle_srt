Kyung Joo!
 [Episode 10]

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,700
Kyung Joo!

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,450
- Kyung Joo!
- Why do you keep calling me?

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,360
Just have a bite. I mixed this really well.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,800
How annoying.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,980
My mom's teasing me right now, right?

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,570
Kyung Joo, it's so nice to hear you speak in Chinese. Ah!

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,350
You really hate me, don't you?

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,540
I'm going on a trip tomorrow. Will you take responsibility if I eat late at night and my face gets puffy?

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,680
I'm sorry! I was afraid it would all go to waste...

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,400
Have a seat. Let's eat this together.

13
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,310
Which is better?

14
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,600
For what?

15
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,220
Just, whichever looks prettier.

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,620
Are you going somewhere?

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,810
I think I'm going to have to meet someone for brunch.

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,410
Brunch?

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,310
You're like a corpse on Saturday mornings. Then, you go to the hospital like a zombie in the afternoon.

20
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,040
I need those kinds of days, too.

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,370
What time are you meeting them? Why are you so busy already?

22
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,610
Just in the morning.

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,090
You're leaving for a trip today?

24
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,900
Yeah. We're going to Shi Hyun's vacation home, so don't ask for anything else.

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,070
Which is better?

26
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,560
Both are fine. If I have to choose, I'd say that gray isn't really your color.

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,320
You have the right eyes. Have fun on your trip.

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,340
What's with her? It's making me nervous.

29
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,950
- What are you doing here?
- Hey.

30
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,660
Get in.

31
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,720
Are you feeling sick?

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,820
Get in.

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,660
When will you fix your old-fashioned style?

34
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,400
Let's just talk inside. Geum Sil is about to get back from the supermarket.

35
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,280
Why'd you come?

36
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,270
What are you doing right now?

37
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,140
Let's go somewhere.

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,800
- What?
- I want to go somewhere we couldn't go before.

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,740
I was driving and you were sitting next to me, looking at the map.

40
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,720
We couldn't find it, so we fought a lot and came back to Seoul. Did you know?

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,170
How could I forget about it? You criticized me so much because I couldn't read a map.

42
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,500
If we went there that time, then we would have made the boat and changed the past.

43
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,180
Whose fault do you think that is? You don't remember that you were a beginner driver at the time, right?

44
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,460
I told you I could drive, but you kept saying that driving is a man's job. You were so stubborn.

45
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,800
What did you expect? Besides having my driver take me around, I never drove myself.

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,350
Still, you were the only woman I drove with my two hands. Do you know that?

47
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,400
Yes, it was an honor.

48
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,680
Then do you remember how you kept driving in the fast lane, so we couldn't stop to eat or rest?

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
You seem to remember all of that, Seol Young Won.

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,390
It's because it was unfair.

51
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,230
So, let's go. Now, we have this. I drive well.

52
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,750
Excuse me. I don't even have my wallet.

53
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,880
A wallet?

54
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm a vice chairman.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,410
Let's go.

56
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,040
Pervert. Sex maniac. (In German)

57
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,370
What's so great about that boy?

58
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,170
Gosh, I'm crazy.

59
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,200
Are you going somewhere?

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,430
What's this? Isn't he going on the trip?

61
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,040
I'm off to meet Kyung Joo. Where are you going?

62
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,290
I'm going home—

63
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:20,010
Mr. Landlord, I'm a bit busy. If you have anything to say about the contract, text me.

64
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,330
The library's not that way, though.

65
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,740
Did she hurt her ankle?

66
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,100
Mom, I'm going!

67
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,120
Kyung Joo. I think I'm dying.

68
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,900
What do I do?

69
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,950
What did you eat to make you sick?

70
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,150
I'm fine. You can go.

71
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,530
How can I leave when you're in this much pain?!

72
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,980
Tae Hee, I'm really sorry, but you'll have to leave first.

73
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,540
Oh, then, let's just not go.

74
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,710
No, I can't do that. I'm watching a movie with Se Joo at night.

75
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,990
Alright. Just come quickly.

76
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,910
Where are you?

77
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,780
Go Kyung Joo? I'm going to meet the others.

78
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,620
About that trip... Something came up, so Tae Hee left first.

79
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,820
Can you go pick up Tae Hee? I'll come tonight.

80
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,390
What did Eun Tae Hee ride?

81
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,330
He knew that it's his great-grandfather's death anniversary and still left?

82
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,220
He snuck out and stole the car, too.

83
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,350
That's right. Do whatever you want.

84
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,620
Starting next year, we'll just start honoring you too during the death anniversary service.

85
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,420
Why'd you come? Where's Shi Hyun?

86
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,490
What is this treatment? I'm a human, too.

87
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,650
You should've gone with Kyung Joo.

88
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,960
Just go!

89
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:07,170
One, two, three.

90
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,890
Lower your hands slowly.

91
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,470
The two of you, sit and face each other.

92
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,950
Have you found a school to put your rude boy into?

93
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,710
Why would I put him into a school? I'll send him out of the country.

94
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,250
The two of you, raise your legs.

95
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,680
I hate this the most.

96
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,850
Can't you send over one of the Joo Sung High School's math teachers? For Hye Jung's math.

97
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:44,880
You're saying all sorts of childish things in front of a teacher. I'm a woman with a teaching license.

98
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,040
Have you forgotten?

99
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,560
Now, let's have the both of you go into the cat pose.

100
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,360
Then, can you let me borrow Jeong Won's math tutor for a couple of months? Jeong Won's good at math, right?

101
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,850
I'd rather let you borrow my husband. Don't touch my kid's tutors.

102
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,330
Do you think I would be like this if I wasn't this desperate?

103
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,930
Hye Jung has bad grades. She might as well find something else to do besides studying.

104
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,670
Why is everyone being like this?! They keep saying she has "bad grades" over and over again!

105
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,200
Until when are you going to be like this!?

106
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,350
Mr. Oh?

107
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,170
Mr. Oh, you only teach Geun Sook yoga, right?

108
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,760
Pardon me?

109
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,810
Why are you so nervous? I keep my secrets.

110
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,290
Geun Sook, it's me.

111
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,990
Youngest Daughter Oh.

112
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,790
I've been wanting to go out these days.

113
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,290
Yes! Yes, Big Sis Se Ri.

114
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:55,300
I'll arrange it. Good-bye.

115
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,000
"Youngest Daughter Oh"? She's really getting ready to attack.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,660
Mom, who's getting ready to attack?

117
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,790
Just go over there and eat. I have a headache.

118
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,730
Mom! Is that someone's name?

119
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,870
Stop eating and study!

120
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,560
You're the cause of so many of my problems!

121
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,410
Aren't you going to eat lunch?

122
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,110
I'm about to head to the office, so I'll eat there.

123
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,760
Yes.

[Cheongpyeong Station]

125
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,570
I don't want to. I'm going back to Seoul.

126
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,630
Help me out this once.

127
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,980
If you're not there, what excuse can I make to go?

128
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,780
What do you expect me to do while I'm awkwardly waiting for you?

129
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,500
Actually, Kwon Shi Hyun went to get you.

130
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,610
You should go and talk to him!

131
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,440
What?! Hey, you're really—!

132
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,420
Hey, Eun Tae Hee!

133
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,600
Why are you here?

134
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
What?

135
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,870
Let's go. I'll take you back to Seoul.

136
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,560
I don't want to. Why? Will you be uncomfortable if I'm there?

137
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,110
Don't worry! I was already planning to wait until Kyung Joo comes and then leave.

138
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,070
Get on.

139
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,040
Are you kidding me? You asked me why, I came putting me on the spot.

140
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,900
I should be asking you that question! How can you take a train here with an injured ankle?!

141
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,890
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have raised my voice.

142
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,870
I like that you're here, but I didn't know that you were coming today.

143
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,000
I also didn't know that you were coming today either.

144
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:41,300
I'm sorry about not telling you about the building. I also recently found out that I was the owner.

145
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,880
You were pretty quick to say it.

146
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,040
No... I was going to tell you when we were eating sweet and sour pork, but...

147
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,940
Why did I leave the tools there...?

148
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,690
This prevented lewd demon.

149
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,600
Hey, you keep doing that. You cussed me out in German earlier, too, right?

150
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,640
Hey, did you think that I didn't know that you were calling me an idiot in German all along?

151
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,160
It's a relief. I said it for you to hear.

152
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,990
However, what did you say just now? It was a bit different.

153
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,630
Pervert, sex maniac, and a lewd demon.

154
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,010
Well, something like that.

155
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,470
Oh, that's right. I was going to tell you this last time.

156
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,980
You know that condoms have expiration dates, right? You should be careful.

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,670
- What are you doing, not leaving already?
- Oh!

158
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,350
You seemed to be having a great nap even though you're the one that wanted to come.

159
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:22,570
I wonder, how busy you must be if you forgot to update this?

160
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,430
You still use the same cologne.

161
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:37,870
Why didn't you just live easily? I don't blame you, so you don't have to live like you're running away.

162
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,360
I'm dreaming right now, right?

163
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,980
Yeah.

164
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,360
How rich...

165
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,160
Wow.
♫ You're  ♫

166
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,160
♫ Especially pretty today ♫

167
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,290
Should we prepare these things before they get here?

168
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,660
Sure.

169
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,920
Let's go.

170
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,670
♫ When I carefully start the conversation,  ♫

171
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,380
Here, go.

172
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,570
♫ You don't say anything and smile ♫

173
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,450
♫ Why do you keep doing this?  ♫

174
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,370
♫ It's making me confused ♫

175
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,320
♫ I don't even know why,  ♫

176
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,700
I should make some rice.

177
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,320
♫ But I'm going to you ♫

178
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,760
Do you think this should enough?

179
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,240
Give it to me.
♫ What do I do? ♫

180
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,720
I told you to stay put.
♫ I think I like you ♫

181
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,800
Stay seated, since you hurt your ankle.

182
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,760
♫ Shining like the stars in the night sky ♫

183
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,330
I'm fine, though.

184
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,730
♫ Warmer than sunshine ♫

185
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,880
♫ I like you, I like you so much ♫

186
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,320
♫ Your gaze ♫

187
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,830
Oh, it looks like you know what you're doing.

188
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,700
I can cook. I liked my mom's cooking, so I spent a lot of time watching her cook.

189
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,010
We would even cook together.

190
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,010
How come you can't cook ramen then?

191
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,960
It was my first time eating it.

192
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,140
What?

193
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,750
They don't make me ramen at home.

194
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,260
Hey, you can't even follow the GPS?

195
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,540
How can I even hear that thing when you kept talking next to me non-stop?

196
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,310
If I didn't say anything, then we would've been lost right now!

197
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,790
Don't get in my car tomorrow!

198
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,380
I'm going to ride with Shi Hyun!

199
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,790
Seriously, I should just get my license.

200
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,170
- Do you want to die?
- Alright.

201
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,680
Okay, I'm sorry. Here, eat this. I'll feed you this.

202
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,630
- How is it?
- Oh? It's yummy.

203
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,990
Did you go somewhere?

204
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,240
Hi.

205
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,400
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

206
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,160
We met at school, right? It must've been tough preparing all of this.

207
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,920
You guys must've had a hard time today.

208
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,000
No, I was just sitting by comfortably. Shi Hyun did all the work.

209
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,820
Is that so? That's a relief.

210
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,080
You should go inside and rest. We'll finish this up.

211
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,900
Okay.

212
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,340
Either way, I am really thirsty and tired... because of someone.

213
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,980
I'll get you something to drink.

214
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,290
You left it in the fridge, right?

215
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,520
Just stay still, I'll do it.

216
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,420
No! You should grill the meat.

217
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,780
Be careful on the stairs and come back.

218
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,450
Thank you, Tae Hee!

219
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,830
- You came here really early.
- More like you came late.

220
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,380
- We agreed that all three of us were going to come together.
- I told you not to invite Eun Tae Hee here.

221
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,680
Kyung Joo wanted to use this chance to get close to Se Joo, so I told her to bring Tae Hee along.

222
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,420
Did I say anything? I had to pick her up because Kyung Joo said she couldn't come.

223
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,730
Eun Tae Hee must love it. You helped her with moving and even picked her up at the train station.

224
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,660
You're doing everything a girl wants her boyfriend to do.

225
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,270
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

226
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,970
Don't you see how hard I'm working, like you asked?

227
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,490
I see it. That's why I invited her here for you to keep working hard.

228
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,860
Go inside and rest. I'll grill the meat.

229
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,940
- Just give it to me.
- No. It's dangerous. Let me do it.

230
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,760
- I said I can do it. I'm only like this because I think I can do it better.
- It's really dangerous.

231
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,420
- I'm going for it! Oh, there's flame. It didn't work. Wow!
- Wow!

232
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,730
- Should I push the swing for you?
- Don't mess with me.

233
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,490
We should've gone to the beaches by the East Sea. The vibe over there is so great!

234
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,040
Do you like it because Kyung Joo isn't coming?!

235
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,730
Why are you being like this to me?

236
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,890
I told you not to mess with me today.

237
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't do this! Se Joo's really good at grilling meat. His nickname is "Mr. Grill."

238
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,540
Mr. Grill?

239
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,640
Hey, Lee Se Joo! Hurry up and come here! You need to grill the meat!

240
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,590
Yes, ma'am! Mr. Grill is coming!

241
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,600
- He even calls himself that.
- It's really good.

242
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,690
Don't touch anything. Don't touch anything. Get out.

243
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,470
It's dangerous.

244
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,990
Did you eat it?

245
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,320
- I'll do everything.
- No, it's fine.

246
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,570
Here. Have this.

247
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,560
Thanks.

248
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,310
Here you go.

249
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,540
Give that to me.

250
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,170
Isn't there a fork? Soo Ji needs a fork.

251
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,260
Of course I brought it. Here it is.

252
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,580
Thank you.

253
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,870
- What do you want to drink?
- Ah, anything.

254
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:30,380
Inside there, there's a lot, so drink all that you want. I heard your alcohol limit is infinity.

255
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,170
"Infinity"? Only Kyung Joo uses that term.

256
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,250
How'd you know?

257
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:47,870
- I see Go Kyung Joo from time to time. She talks about you a lot.
- Ah, I see.

258
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,890
Hey, how can you just keep meeting her from time to time? How long are you going to just flirt with her?

259
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,490
What are you saying, Choi Soo Ji?

260
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,690
I hope things turn out well for you two.

261
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,490
Kyung Joo was really sad that she couldn't come today.

262
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,940
She'll come with Se Joo, just the two of them, later on. Right?

263
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,040
Soo Ji. Should we stop eating meat?

264
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,140
- Do you want more wine?
- Sure.

265
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,760
Why is Choi Soo Ji mixing her drinks?

266
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,160
It's making me nervous.

267
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,710
This looks really good. I'll open it.

268
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,600
- Hey, give it.
- Hand it over.

269
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,850
I'll do it myself. I want to.

270
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,590
Hand it over.

271
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,880
Since Soo Ji plays the cello, she can't hurt her hands. So, she doesn't use chopsticks for long, either.

272
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,970
Oh, I see. You guys are all so close and considerate.

273
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,600
Choi Soo Ji, stop mixing your drinks. Who are you trying to give a tough time?

274
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,560
It's up to me.

275
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,090
They're a bit too much, right? I use my hands often, so lately my hands have gotten tired easily.

276
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,770
Even if it's cringe-worthy, please understand.

277
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,910
Cheers!

278
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,490
Nice to meet you.

279
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,960
When did you guys start being friends?

280
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,630
Testicular friends.

281
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,220
What? You use that term.

282
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,550
There's a difference between me using it and you using it!

283
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,260
You two are at it again. Here.

284
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,340
Thanks.

285
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,960
If you felt uncomfortable by that phrase, then sorry.

286
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,100
It's fine.

287
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:33,150
Anyway, even though female-male relationships usually don't just stay friends, weirdly, it's not like that for us.

288
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,700
I'm jealous of you guys. I don't have a lot of friends from middle and high school.

289
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,170
We met at an art academy in middle school.

290
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,630
Oh, so you did learn to draw.

291
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,060
That's what I thought.

292
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,860
Ah, it wasn't much.

293
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:58,800
At that time, my mom and dad were getting a divorce. Then, my dad went to prison, so the kids at the academy looked down on me.

294
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,680
That must've been hard for you.

295
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,930
Do you know what that's like?

296
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,030
What?

297
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,460
It's just that normal people usually don't know.

298
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,290
Anyway, Shi Hyun and Se Joo were on my side.

299
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,860
Why are you bringing up the past?

300
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,690
Whenever the three of us got together, we would pull pranks on the kids that we didn't like.

301
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,190
Hey, stop it.

302
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,900
At that time, there was this assistant teacher that majored in art at a university—

303
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,760
Why are you talking about that?

304
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,250
She was pretty.

305
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,480
But, she started to be obviously jealous of me.

306
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,180
Afterwards, when her boyfriend came to the art classes and saw me,

307
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,450
he told her that there was a female student that was prettier than her.

308
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,310
There you go again with that arrogant talk.

309
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,280
So, what happened next? These two made a bet on seducing her.

310
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,910
Shi Hyun probably brought it up first.

311
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,250
Honestly, in our third year of middle school, he was a man. So, what happened next was—

312
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,630
Hey, cut it out. Why are you bringing up the past?

313
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,820
Okay, I got it. I'll stop.

314
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,200
Shi Hyun drew well in middle school, right?

315
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,160
I actually saw Shi Hyun's drawing when I went to his house in the past.

316
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,080
What are you saying? Shi Hyun hates to draw.

317
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,030
What?

318
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,790
We know him the best. Who else would know?

319
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:24,190
He got scolded so much for scribbling instead of drawing what he was asked to draw in the art classes.

320
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,970
She said Shi Hyun liked to draw. What do we do?

321
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,620
That's not true.

322
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,720
At the retirement home, the elderly women get to make pottery.

323
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,920
There, Shi Hyun's drawing is really popular. Shi Hyun also liked drawing for them.

324
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,390
In the past, he drew forsythia—

325
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,710
What are you saying?

326
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,830
I don't like to draw. I really don't like it.

327
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:56,550
People like us are forced to learn everything from tutors at an early age, so that's why I learned it.

328
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,880
Do you think we'd like it?

329
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:08,200
See? Why are you getting so angry over it?

330
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,830
I'll go in first.

331
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,420
I need to call Kyung Joo, too.

332
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,040
Is this your first time seeing someone from Jeju Island?

333
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,060
Yeah, it is.

334
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,400
Didn't you say it's a great place to live in?

335
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,480
Are you okay?

336
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,150
Yeah. I'm not drunk.

337
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,330
Seoul...

338
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,350
Why are you being like this?

339
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,120
What?

340
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,180
You've become confusing.

341
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,940
Didn't you want him to sleep with her and then dump her?

342
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,050
Then, do your parents still live on Jeju Island?

343
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,940
And?

344
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,990
It's going on that course, but in my eyes, it seems like you keep trying to get in the way of it?

345
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,650
Don't laugh, just answer me.

346
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,580
Shi Hyun's playing the game, so what's wrong with you?

347
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,050
Whether Shi Hyun is playing around,

348
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,240
or acting in front of us,

349
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,400
Right?

350
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,050
is something that you and I don't know anymore.

351
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,660
Don't do it.

352
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,920
Don't leave.

353
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,630

354
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,490
You should just play hard to get now. Kwon Shi Hyun does that, too.

355
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,280
Why does he go to Choi Soo Ji in the middle of eating?

356
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,360
I don't really know if I like you.

357
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,870
Whether he's playing games or pretending to be playing games..

358
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,030
you're confused, too, right?

359
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,400
Come to your senses!

360
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,190
Choi Soo Ji.

361
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:53,060
Are you going to stay that way? Don't do that. Get down here and eat with me.

362
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,300
Gosh, I'm going crazy. Why am I hearing his voice now?

363
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,280
So annoying.
