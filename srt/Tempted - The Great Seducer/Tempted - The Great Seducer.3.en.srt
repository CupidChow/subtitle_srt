[Episode 3]

2
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,590
Soo Ji, I'm so surprised!

3
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,760
Did you guys not know either?

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,830
Oh my, well you should have at least given me a hint.

5
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,570
I'll leave first.

6
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,410
Shi Hyun...

7
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,560
Don't drink too much.

8
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,530
I mean, even if he's that shocked,

9
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,350
he didn't even say good-bye to me.

10
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,930
Shouldn't we be celebrating? This a good thing.

11
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,780
Ki Young, if you don't have anything to say you should just keep your mouth closed. Okay?

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,450
Se Joo, what kind of attitude is that?

13
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,450
It's just because I'm worried for my dongsaengs as a hyung.

14
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,050
What are you worried about though?

15
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,060
What are you curious about? If you had known earlier, what would you have done?

16
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,740
Okay, then.

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,210
I wonder why the adults in my family didn't tell me.

18
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,510
If I had known earlier,

19
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,330
I would've at least told you so you wouldn't be this shocked.

20
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,530
I was inattentive, sorry.

21
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,760
Damn it. Are you bragging about about your family's information right now?

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,470
She's in hell right now.

23
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,150
If you have eyes and common sense then shut up!

24
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,730
Stop it.

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,660
Just go to Shi Hyun right now.

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,220
I'm saying go.

27
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,320
If you need me, call me immediately.

28
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,990
Ah, what losers.

29
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,280
Those guys don't have a brain and only rely on money.

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,590
Why would someone as smart as you hang out with those pun—

31
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,450
I mean, with them?

32
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,010
Lee Ki Young,

33
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,570
or just some guy I know.

34
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,240
Guys like Se Joo who have no brain and only rely on money are losers,

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,370
and I am a loser because I befriended a loser. But when there are people who look down on those losers,

36
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,370
what do you call them?

37
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,200
You guys are sensitive right now, so you can get angry like that.

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,720
I was a bit narrowed minded just now.

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,250
Cheer up. Do you want to go and have a drink with this oppa—?

40
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,980
Everything you say, you end with "oppa!"

41
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,180
Soo Ji.

42
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,740
Too much for you, right?

43
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,370
I, who have no fame nor fortune, but only a nasty temper. It must be hard for you to endure your anger, right?

44
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,990
So just pick a more realistic partner,

45
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,120
if you don't want to end up with a loser like me.

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,320
Be stupid or rude. You should just pick one.

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,710
I see you aren't in a condition to talk right now.

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,650
I'll see you again later.

49
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,990
Good work, everybody!

50
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,460
- Good job.
- You've worked hard.

51
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,600
But isn't it too early to be celebrating?

52
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,660
What if only the flies show up tomorrow at the opening?

53
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,840
Then, we'll order something else and drink tomorrow.

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,960
Oh my, you're pretending to be tough.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,480
Even though you've been stressed out about the exhibit.

56
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,510
Don't even get me started on that topic. She had so many stomach cramps.

57
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,720
We got so scared.

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,020
Sorry about that.

59
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,080
But thanks to you three, we're done.

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,290
- What will we do if we sell all of these?
- As if we could it all.

61
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,620
What? I'll sell them all without any regrets.

62
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,630
These only feel like mine when they're clay.

63
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,750
I'm going to sell them all,

64
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,010
and give the money to my daughter.

65
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,450
Aigoo... you're basically doing this exhibition to send your daughter to college.

66
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,960
She said she's going to sell it and give it to her daughter again.

67
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,180
I think it'll do well. Potter Seol Young Won's first exhibit in ten years.

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,990
There were even many articles about you and you also did some interviews.

69
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:22,170
Stop that. I'm fine, so stop trying to make me feel good.

70
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,490
The light went out.

71
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,290
- I'll take care of it!
- Hey! Hey!

72
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,790
Leave her be, leave her be. Leaver her. Let's eat.

73
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,020
That's why she never gains weight.

74
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,960
Just sit down.

75
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,410
You've worked hard.

76
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,780
You've worked really hard...

77
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,210
Tae Hee!

78
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,630
If you're here you should've come in! What are you doing? Come in.

79
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,930
Have a good time.

80
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,120
You're pretty today.

81
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,320
- What is this?
- For four years, they're going to give me tuition and a dorm.

82
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,420
You're amazing, Eun Tae Hee.

83
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,470
If you were going to receive something like this, you should have told me.

84
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,750
I already told the apartment that I'm moving out. Since you gave me money all these years.

85
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,300
Well, I know you worked hard. I'll pay you back later.

86
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,420
Pay back what?

87
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,620
I'll keep sending you money.

88
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,210
I closed the bank account. You don't have to act like a good mom anymore.

89
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,390
You can stop trying to be my sponsor now.

90
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,540
How can you say it like that? Why am I considered a sponsor?

91
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,730
Didn't you know? People like you are called sponsors.

92
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,080
You don't take responsibility through love. You just pay my bills,

93
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,380
and just in case I die, you'll come identify my body.

94
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,130
Eun Tae Hee. You haven't seen me in a long time. Must you act like this?

95
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,130
It's been so long since I've talked to you, it seems like you forgot.

96
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,550
Should I remind you what kind of a mom you are?

97
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,980
You didn't call Dad once for all four years when we were in Germany.

98
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,500
Meanwhile, you both signed divorce papers and you gave him all the parental rights.

99
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,560
Without knowing anything,

100
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,110
with every birthday cake that I lit,

101
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,740
I wished all three of us could live together again. Just the three of us.

102
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,610
I'm an adult now, so we can go different paths.

103
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,130
I came to tell you I'm fine with that.

104
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,790
That's right.

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,700
You turned twenty years old last week.

106
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,360
I'm sorry. I was so busy preparing for the exhibition that I forgot—

107
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,770
Why bother anymore? You even sent a cake.

108
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,460
Tae Hee!

109
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,740
I will never see her again.

110
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,000
I won't see her.

111
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,160
I'll never see her.

112
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,890
Are you crazy!? You can't just run in the middle of the road like that!

113
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,600
Seriously.

114
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,230
Hey, are you okay?

115
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,330
I didn't hit you, right?

116
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,770
Please don't go. Don't leave me. Please stay.

117
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,040
It's obvious that you're overreacting right now.

118
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,690
Don't leave me.

119
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,600
Please don't leave me..

120
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,320
Please don't leave me.

121
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,260
Get up. I told you to get up.

122
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,760
Let go!

123
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,240
Wow.

124
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,630
Let's be clear, that wasn't my fault. You—

125
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,970
Contact me, I'll compensate you.

126
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,540
-  Where are you? 
- There was an accident in the parking lot.

127
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,830
Hurry up and come here! Soo Ji, she's...

128
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,230
What happened to Soo Ji?

129
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,160
Okay, I'm coming.

130
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,580
What the—?

131
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,110
[Kwon Shi Hyun]
[010-4181...]

132
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,570
Shi Hyun... so that's his name.

133
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,500
Put it down, Soo Ji.

134
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,350
You can hear me, right?

135
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,280
Put it down and let's talk.

136
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,060
What more do you need from me?

137
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,210
What else do you want to take from me?

138
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,510
Soo Ji. Soo Ji, what's wrong?

139
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,360
No, Soo Ji!

140
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,260
No, you can't go closer.

141
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,590
Soo Ji, come to your senses!

142
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,650
Talk to me, huh?

143
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,690
Shi Hyun?

144
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,670
What's wrong, did you get hurt?

145
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,030
No, I'm fine. It's nothing.

146
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,910
I'm fine.

147
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,160
It's all going to be fine.

148
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,740
It's all going to be okay.

149
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,030
The people that I like,

150
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,550
are all disappearing.

151
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,090
I won't disappear. I'm right next to you right now.

152
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,040
What do I do?

153
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,790
When I only have you guys on my side.

154
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,070
Don't worry, I'm on your side.

155
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,050
Choi Soo Ji's side.

156
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,210
I'm on your side.

157
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,000
Choi Soo Ji's side.

158
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:25,300
♫ I walked on a rainy path, on the road I used to walk with you ♫

159
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:32,020
♫ Before my eyes are stories of the past ♫

160
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,010
♫ Are they memories? ♫

161
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,880
♫ That day, it was raining too ♫

162
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,090
♫ The day you left me ♫

163
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:52,620
♫ Along with the rain, if your heart ♫

164
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,220
♫ is crying as well ♫

165
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,350
♫ Come back to me ♫

166
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,340
♫ To the me, that is waiting ♫

167
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,890
♫ With the smile you always had when you ran towards me ♫

168
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:17,820
♫ With that appearance ♫

169
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,240
♫ You're the only one I love ♫

170
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,540
♫ It wasn't a dream ♫

171
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,080
♫ Only you can stop this ♫

172
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,740
♫ cold rain ♫

173
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,890
You had nothing to do, so you stole a car?!

174
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,060
And your friend's father's car at that!

175
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,080
You're a bastard who's more useless than dog shit!

176
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,990
Hit him one more time!

177
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,030
Yes, sir.

178
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,830
Father! Please stop, Father!

179
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,490
Young Master has done nothing wrong.

180
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,600
Please punish me instead, Father.

181
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,100
All throughout his third year in high school, whether at school or at home,

182
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,760
I tried everything to let him know how much I cherish him...

183
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,100
However, my affection wasn't enough.

184
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,990
I'm the criminal, Father!

185
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,600
Tell Jung Won to come and sit at that end seat.

186
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,350
That's Mom's seat.

187
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:01,170
Shut up! If you want to talk, go to college or earn some money.

188
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,140
If we've left it empty for this long, then that's enough.

189
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,720
I want to seat my eldest grandchild. Do any of you have problems with that?

190
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,680
Father, Jung Won is in his third year of high school, so he left early in the morning.

191
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,550
- I will make sure he comes tomorrow—
- Then you sit there.

192
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,260
Don't bother a studying kid.

193
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,050
Pardon? Thank you. Thank you, Father.

194
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,160
Instead, find a school that'll accept that pathetic guy.

195
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,950
Okay. I will do my best, Father.

196
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,910
What the?

197
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,620
How many spots are there? Fourteen?

198
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,570
Hey. A great actress lives in my house.

199
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,290
Her acting gets better every day.

200
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,000
Father, I'm sorry! I'm the criminal! Boo hoo!

201
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,720
How am I supposed to be patient and live like this?

202
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,650
You should've left the car. Why did you have to take it?

203
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,620
Look who's talking. You have no money and nowhere to go.

204
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,100
It's because I stole your dad's car that he can't tell you to leave.

205
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,480
Just keep my room safe.

206
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,770
Okay, I get it. Sorry.

207
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,020
Until when are you locked up?

208
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,110
Well...

209
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,220
if I stay nice and calm, then a way will appear.

210
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,080
Oh, right, what about Soo Ji?

211
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,900
I don't know, I haven't called her.

212
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,990
That makes sense. What would you guys talk about in this situation?

213
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,520
When did you start taking the pills?

214
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,530
I'll put it simply for you: the anti-anxiety medication that you're taking has the opposite effect with alcohol.

215
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,680
You may black out and not know what you've done.

216
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,170
You won't be able to process things like right now. Do you understand?

217
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,730
Then you should have told me earlier. Why are you telling me now?

218
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,500
Because you haven't been drinking up until now.

219
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,320
You knew that your high school daughter was taking psychiatric meds,

220
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,700
but it didn't matter because she wasn't drinking?

221
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,560
Stop being a child. Everyone is sick somewhere.

222
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,110
I think that a person who takes medication on their own free will is healthy.

223
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,990
That is something you believe, Doctor Myeong.

224
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,890
Who prescribed you the medication?

225
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,890
Don't worry, it isn't that quack.

226
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,790
Choi Soo Ji.

227
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,780
Fortunately, you aren't saying Kwon Soo Ji yet.

228
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,120
The medication is yours.

229
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,240
You didn't know?

230
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,750
My head hurts.

231
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,990
You should get to work.

232
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:20,800
(Buddhist chanting)

233
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,440
What about Shi Hyun?

234
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,000
Ah, he went on a graduation vacation with his friends.

235
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,560
Your face looks tired. Is work difficult?

236
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,840
- It's okay.
- You can't even take care of yourself.

237
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,200
I'm worried whether I can leave the company in your care.

238
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,560
Congratulations on your marriage, Uncle.

239
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,340
Was it your idea to break the news about the wedding like that?

240
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,350
I apologize.

241
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,310
All the damage that Bio Medicine has done to JK Group can't be taken back just because you filled in the losses.

242
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,100
If the TOJ market is canceled, it's all ruined.

243
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,150
This is the only reason why I'm allowing you to marry her.

244
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,310
Yes. I know that very well.

245
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,310
Keep this in mind.

246
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,710
I only let you become the vice chairman because of Shi Hyun.

247
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,490
All the things that your older brother couldn't enjoy should be left for Yeo Min and Shi Hyun to enjoy.

248
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,670
Grandma...

249
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,800
However, Shi Hyun wants to do something else.

250
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,000
All kids are like that at that age. Your brother was like that and you were, too.

251
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,130
There will come a day when he will accept

252
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:50,280
that living as a heir is a job. As for you, accepting that fact is your job.

253
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,710
Shi Hyun's mother also passed away like that because of you. Of course he wouldn't listen to you.

254
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,980
Don't push him needlessly.

255
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,010
If you're not confident enough, Yeo Min can take him and teach him.

256
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,640
He always listens to everything you say.

257
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,010
Grandmother, next time I will try to talk things out with Shi Hyun.

258
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,770
- It's cold. Let's get going.
- Okay.

259
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,170
It's been a few days since the Bio Medicine affiliates

260
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,580
and the Myeong Jeong heads heard our offer.

261
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,430
The business world thinks that Myeong Jeong Bio will join us, JK, and succeed as well.

262
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,590
What about the executives and shareholders?

263
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,610
Since the marriage news broke out before the company became one big company,

264
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,530
they seem pretty relieved.

265
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,920
It wasn't a bad time to bring up the marriage.

266
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,320
I'm sure it wasn't, since it was Director Myeong.

267
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,340
Can you show me my schedule for the latter half of the year? I'm not too sure if I have time for a wedding.

268
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,000
I came because I have something to say to you.

269
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,250
I bet it's not something to tell me, but a favor to ask.

270
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,030
The car accident doesn't have anything to do with Se Joo.

271
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,650
- So could you tell his family—?
- Relay the message

272
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:11,630
that it was my son's fault. Therefore, I sincerely apologize to you. What? Something like that?

273
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,030
I'm asking you this favor. Se Joo did nothing wrong

274
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,590
Do you think I didn't know that when I called them about the car?

275
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,250
What? Do you think I wanted to get the car repair fee?

276
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,700
What is it that you want?

277
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,970
Make sure to keep the promise you made when I kicked you out of the house.

278
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,730
I don't care what you do with your life. Just stay inside the palm of my hands.

279
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,570
If you were that furious, then you should have driven it off a cliff.

280
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:37,360
However, you decided to make a mess for everyone to see.

281
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,090
- Wasn't that it!?
- So is that why you made the marriage announcement like that?

282
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,530
To try to stab your unsatisfying son in the back?

283
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,310
It's barely been two years since Mom passed away. Do you know that?

284
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,520
Are you that confident in front of me?

285
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,160
If your mom was here before you, are you certain that you could call yourself a good son?

286
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,560
What can you do on your own?

287
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,190
You lived with everything we gave you, but you don't want us to interfere?

288
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,550
Don't kid yourself.

289
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,590
You are in the most pathetic state you've ever been since birth.

290
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,200
Do you know that?

291
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,630
He didn't choose a wedding day yet, but it will be soon.

292
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,460
The chairman already gave him permission, too.

293
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,100
To expand our bio industry, we really need Myeong Jeong Stem Cell Center.

294
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,730
What about the cultural foundation Mom used to run?

295
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,560
It'll probably be absorbed by the Myeong Jeong Foundation.

296
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,740
I know what you're worried about.

297
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,720
Since the Vice Chairman didn't like that foundation.

298
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,660
Grandma said that she hated this.

299
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,960
Yeah, it's because I told her I wanted to place it here.

300
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,710
Why do you like this, Mom?

301
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,160
It doesn't have a title nor an artist name. It's just a jar.

302
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:35,380
When I look at this, I feel like I am the owner here.

303
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,380
Young Master, I think your package came.

304
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,930
I'm coming in.

305
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,970
It's nice.

306
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,950
Your brother gets flustered by these things, huh?

307
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,850
What package is it?

308
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,710
When you're bored in the house, internet shopping is the best, isn't it?

309
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,510
The only one that understands me is you, Sister-in-Law.

310
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,910
I'm hungry.

311
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,030
She should've also given me something to eat. What am I supposed to do if she only gives me this rope?

312
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,940
Ah, it's so tiring.

313
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,390
I'm so hungry.

314
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,630
Door opened.

315
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,600
You're here?!

316
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,340
As expected. How did you know that I got beaten up?

317
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,420
Is there ever a day where you don't get hit?

318
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,020
Do you want some pizza, my friends?

319
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,480
You should take a look at yourself in the mirror and apply it!

320
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,020
Trying to get sympathy doesn't suit you.

321
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,650
I know. They'll beat you up more, so why did you come out?

322
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:24,250
I don't even know what's going on between you two. How can I just stay still?

323
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,500
Yes, it was pretty shocking, but what can we do?

324
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,650
I also don't like the idea of you two becoming family either.

325
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,240
But what can you do? You can either accept each other coolly and as family...

326
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,230
or you can take care of each other and cherish each other, and be close like just now.

327
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,290
Family?

328
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:48,980
Whether it's your family or mine, is there anyone that actually cares for us?

329
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,000
In my house, there's a war between siblings 365 days a year.

330
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,790
Well, it's fine. It's actually quite fun to watch.

331
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:01,680
I'm sure they are thinking of reasons to kick us out or take something from us.

332
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,170
If we become family.

333
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,910
My mom can't know that you left your house. Don't ever get caught.

334
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:16,660
If she finds out, my mom... will really love it!

335
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,830
She will think it's so easy to take what's yours.

336
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,690
The hangouts between all three of us will probably come to an end.

337
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:32,370
Well, is there any solution? Should we go on a hunger strike or something?

338
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,970
Like doing that would help us out in any way. Aish..

339
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,920
What if we get married first?

340
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,450
That's right! You two throw the first punch and give them the big, fat finger!

341
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,370
You're crazy.

342
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,560
The companies will become one either way. So why does it matter who gets married first?

343
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,630
This is the reason why I gave up on movies.

344
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,460
The movies are never as good as this!

345
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,150
I will make an offer that you can't refuse.

346
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,600
- This marriage is like a noir movie.
- Both of you, get lost.

347
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,870
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

348
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,850
You don't want to? In the end, we can just get a divorce.

349
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,700
I guess I must really hate the idea of my mother becoming your step-mother.

350
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,210
- Then what can I do? It's not like I can seduce your mom.
- Hey!

351
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,050
That was a bit much.

352
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:39,580
What's wrong with the both of you? It's not good to have a fight between us. I really like this idea.

353
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,170
Let me see... in order to register for marriage...

354
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,950
Fine. Let's say we do get married

355
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,260
and I take the position as the wife of JK Group's grandson.

356
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,930
Hey, it's really easy to register for marriage. You just have to bring your ID to the district city hall. It's not even work!

357
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,550
However, if I'm like my mother and take everything and refuse a divorce, what will you do then?

358
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,330
- Go right ahead.
- What?

359
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,400
- Just take it all.
- Kwon Shi Hyun!

360
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:11,730
I understand that you're trying to get back at your dad, but don't get me involved.

361
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,910
I have many other ways to get back at him besides this.

362
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,870
Divorce is a bit troublesome. You have to go to court for it.

363
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:24,120
Do you even know what a divorce is like? Just search up Myeong Jeong Hospital right now.

364
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,730
After his business failed, he got divorced, and sent to prison! As for the child between those two,

365
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,640
which is me—every detail is there.

366
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,900
No matter how hard you try to erase it, it stills comes back. It follows you for the rest of your life, so what's the point of me going through that again?

367
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,950
Amazing. Thinking about marriage and divorce, I'm getting tired.

368
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,920
Let's stop writing a movie script and just come back to reality.

369
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,640
Where are you going?

370
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,190
The sun has set.

371
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,700
You said that you were always worried about us.

372
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,830
Yeah. However, I worry more for all the ladies that are waiting for me.

373
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,830
You should leave later.

374
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,390
Make sure to crawl your way back home! Okay?!

375
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,650
Door opened.

376
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:40,080
Kwon Shi Hyun... are you really going to get married to me?

377
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,560
Yeah.

378
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,150
I'm not asking if you're going to drink juice, I'm asking about marriage.

379
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,020
Yeah.

380
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:53,790
I don't like it... fake marriages.

381
00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,950
Where's a real one then? Have you witnessed it before?

382
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,020
You've never seen one before, so why do you hate it?

383
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,460
You... me... and Se Joo.

384
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,200
We won't be able to marry whoever we want.

385
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,220
So that's why we don't have a reason to want to get married to whoever we want.

386
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:42,630
Even if we do get married, it's probably not the real marriage that you're dreaming of.

387
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:49,030
A marriage in our households is like a trump card for our parents.

388
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,310
Let's use that as our weapon.

389
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:56,920
You can use me as a trump card, too. Use me as much as you want. If you don't want to go through a divorce again, then you don't have to.

390
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,750
If you want to take something from me, then take it all.

391
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,560
I don't care.

392
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,100
I don't want to.

393
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,300
Why not?

394
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,750
You told me to use you.

395
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:18,070
You're saying "Your mom is using my household, so you should use me, too."

396
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,690
You were sympathizing with me and almost convinced me.

397
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:26,230
No. I'm also trying to protect what's mine.

398
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,620
This is a deal.

399
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,260
Why do I need to make a deal with you? You don't need anything.

400
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,280
Do you still like me?

401
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,580
If what you're trying to save is not me, but our friendship,

402
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,800
then I'm right. This is a fake marriage.

403
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,060
No, it's not fake.

404
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,420
Then... can you kiss me?
