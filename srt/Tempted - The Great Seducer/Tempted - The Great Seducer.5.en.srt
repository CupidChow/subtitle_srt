[Episode 5]

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,910
Her fashion... Is she abused at home?

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,820
She probably doesn't even know that she's like that at all.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,280
She doesn't have any friends.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,050
It seems like that.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,060
You know your friend, Eun Tae Hee?

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,730
What kind of person is she?

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,800
Well, Tae Hee...

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,740
Stuff like seeing guys waiting for her on her way home...

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,110
What the heck?

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,940
...she completely hates it.

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,140
If...

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,830
I'm in front of your house. I'll wait until you come out.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,480
they wait all night...

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,100
Maybe it's because she's just never received a confession before?

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,280
I heard she was popular, even when she was in Germany.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,410
All the men that Go Kyung Joo like always end up liking Eun Tae Hee. She said she's jinxed because of it.

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,710
She said, fortunately, that Eun Tae Hee doesn't think dating is necessary, so they're still best friends.

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,150
She doesn't find dating necessary, huh?

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,830
However, why did Go Kyung Joo just tell you all this?

21
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,290
So, what did you tell her on the bus?

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,480
That... was you?

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,530
If it's to this extent, wouldn't you consider this destiny?

24
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,280
If your wound is fine, then that's enough.

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,190
How could you just leave after saying that?! You should've followed her until the very end!

26
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,220
You said she was a nice person.

27
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:45,780
If I just get off without a word like that, I'm certain she'll feel guilty.

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,970
I agree. I think it will make her less cautious when you meet next time.

29
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,530
That's right.

30
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,850
Then, the next time you'll run into her at... a district library?!

31
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,840
You're going to follow her again? And pretend like it's a coincidence again?

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,940
If coincidences keep occurring, then it will make her feel like it's really destiny.

33
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,750
That way, she can't help but accept that we're destined to be. Why?

34
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,070
Because she'll want to believe that.

35
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,810
This is really not right!

36
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,260
It's lame if you give her a back hug when she's putting back the books like in TV dramas.

37
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,930
Instead of a hundred words, it could be done within one touch,

38
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,160
from a forty-five angle with a defined jawline. Wow!

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,870
You have to show her that.

40
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,620
What's her name again?

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,780
Eun Tae Hee. Don't forget it!

42
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,490
Eun Tae Hee. That's right, it's Eun Tae Hee.

43
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,530
If our great seducer, Kwon Shi Hyun, is able to do some method acting, with these handsome features, he could rule the whole world.

44
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,360
Right?

45
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,110
Why do you think I can't do method acting? I can really like her!

46
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,390
Look. Look here. Your eyes are like Cinderella's stepmother's mirror.

47
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,220
They are full of honesty. I can see exactly what you're thinking.

48
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,150
It's fine.

49
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,700
There was never a girl that was able to look right into my eyes... because their heart was fluttering too much.

50
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,760
Be quiet! Leave her before lunch.

51
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,260
Why? I have to eat with her in order for us to get closer.

52
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,120
The best meal to help you get closer would be brunch after sleeping with her.

53
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,380
You can't. You eat like a fool.

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,760
Then... how about day drinking?

55
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,260
Her alcohol tolerance is... eight glasses.

56
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,800
Eight bottles?!

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,310
It's an infinity sign!

58
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,980
I know the answer. An idol group.
(Infinite is a Korean pop idol boy-group)

59
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,460
You don't know the infinity sign? Like in math?

60
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,060
That's what it means?

61
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,740
Do you know what it means, too?

62
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,920
Me? No.

63
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,730
What am I doing with these kind of people?

64
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,750
What am I doing so early in the morning?

65
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,460
Ah, it's so bitter. Why do people even drink this?

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,760
Do you have something to say to me?

67
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,850
If you don't, then I'm leaving.

68
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,490
Will you... eat with me?

69
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,720
I've been hungry since before.

70
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,320
It seems like you had a great nap.

71
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,190
I didn't get a lot of sleep because I was moving.

72
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,650
- Do you live around here?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,840
- Do you visit the library often?
- I visit often enough.

74
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,320
- And you came to see me today?
- That's right.

75
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,590
Ah, seriously. I got caught red-handed.

76
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,210
Actually, I came here a couple times before today. I thought I could see you here if I did.

77
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,930
When I first saw you, I saw you getting off in front of the library.

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,900
It seemed like you had a great nap.

79
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,460
When—did I...?

80
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,700
I'll teach you a way so that you can eat this more comfortably.

81
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,460
If you do this, the bones in the back and the stomach...

82
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,120
Take out the big bones on both side first and enjoy.

83
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,360
Hurry up and eat. It's your favorite. You won't be able to eat it anymore once we go to Germany.

84
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,290
Mom's really not coming.

85
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,610
You already know that she doesn't leave the kiln once she starts baking her pottery. You should try to understand her.

86
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,760
I know, so why did she choose today of all days to do that?

87
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,940
No. Don't feel sorry.

88
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,460
You don't like cutlass fish? Should I order something else?

89
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,520
I heard a lot about you. The popular guy from Joo Sung High School.

90
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,190
You're so famous that students from other schools across town come to take a look at you.

91
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,780
Why would Go Kyung Joo tell you things like that? Hurry up and eat.

92
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,570
She told me to be careful.

93
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,180
You're a troublemaker and would do anything to seduce a girl.

94
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,840
Maybe since the first time you saw me on the bus, you put out your will as bait to ridiculously get me going after you.

95
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,630
Is this how you seduced Kyung Joo's mother?

96
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,360
Fortunately, I didn't do anything immature like this.

97
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,660
I guess you didn't hear about it.

98
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,010
Should I tell you in details? What I did with her?

99
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,380
No. It's fine.

100
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,750
I don't want to waste my time with someone who messes with people's hearts.

101
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,750
I hope we don't have to see each other again.

102
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,890
What's with that old lady-like skirt? It's not your style.

103
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,720
It's a battle suit, so to speak.

104
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,510
I already know what kind of family it is.

105
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,260
I'll compliment you since you won't nag your girlfriend about her skirt being too short.

106
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,350
I need to sue all the men that complain about women's skirt length. It's a violation of basic human rights.

107
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,330
I just figured out who can be your girlfriend!

108
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,280
Huh? I slept by myself last night, though.

109
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,960
I'm not talking about your pattern of you sleeping with women and becoming friends after.

110
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,810
What is she talking about?

111
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,970
What is it? Who is it?

112
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,280
Am I dating someone?

113
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,660
The crazy Lee Se Joo? Why!?

114
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,740
He's cool because he's crazy. What kind of girl does he like?

115
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,440
I don't know. I don't care—was what I thought... but someone just like you?

116
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,260
You should just sell your country! How could you sell your friend?

117
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,290
Who told you to really date her? I'm telling you to just meet up with her. It's not like you have anything to do.

118
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,620
I'm busy. I have a lot of women.

119
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,750
I'll call her out to the hospital. Through the secretary's office. Legally.

120
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,430
- Here you go.
- Ah, thank you.

121
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,420
I am a humanist. I can love every human, but not Go Kyung Joo!

122
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:57,300
First off, you have to get close to Hye Jung's mother in order to see her. Her family's like that.

123
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,460
The most important thing: your fashion.

124
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,030
She thinks she's Meryl Streep from "The Devil Wears Prada" or something.

125
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,410
Welcome! Goodness, you've finally come to our house.

126
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,250
Thank you for inviting me.

127
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,130
Oh my goodness, how beautiful!

128
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,080
Bravo! The speed our Hye Jung is learning is amazing.

129
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,930
Amazing, Park Hye Jung!

130
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,560
That was great.

131
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,320
Her arm strength, I mean.

132
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,060
You should ask Soo Ji to teach you a lot of things.

133
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,120
You can do it if you try a bit harder.

134
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,130
It would be nice for you two to go to concerts together.

135
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,300
Yes, when we have the time.

136
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,890
I was disappointed to miss out on your performance at the sponsors' night.

137
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:25,400
But it seemed like you didn't know about your parent's wedding announcement.

138
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,300
I was wondering why you weren't bringing it up.

139
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,150
I was pretending to be surprised for the event.

140
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,340
My mom is pretty cute.

141
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,980
I see. So playful.

142
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,170
Then, can I ask you to play a song right now?

143
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,300
You're good at lying, without even blinking.

144
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,920
I'm sorry. May I play for you with my own instrument next time?

145
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,240
Do I seem like a pushover because my mom constantly defers to you?

146
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,330
Right, of course your own instrument is more comfortable.

147
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,600
I don't know anything.

148
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,640
Look at that rude arrogance, perfectly responding to everything.

149
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,380
What are you going to do about my arrogance? I'm JK.

150
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,310
What are you two doing? Telepathy?

151
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,040
Then I'll be going now.

152
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,020
I have a book to finish.

153
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,390
Have fun.

154
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,770
I will see you next time.

Look at her saying everything that's on her mind with that sly smile on her face.

157
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,170
She's just like her mother.

158
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,030
I don't want it even if you give it to me. What's wrong?

159
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,120
Unni, I'm hopeless with the cello, right?

160
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,110
Yeah.

161
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,200
Right? Can't you tell my mother the truth?

162
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,940
In my dreams, I get choked by the cello bow and get squished under a piano. I can't stand it!

163
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,800
I'm not your tutor.

164
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,860
Okay.

165
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,430
Why is it so hot?

166
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,040
Oh my God! This is so sexy! Wow!

167
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,170
I'll see. If she asks, I'll tell her.

168
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,360
Where did Turi go?

169
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,920
I have to introduce you to her.

170
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,470
Turi? What Turi?

171
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,030
Turi. Where did she go?

172
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,030
Turi! How can you scare Unni from over there?

173
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,290
You were scared, right, Unni?

174
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,420
This is my younger sibling, Turturi.

175
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,420
- Do you want to hold him?
- No! That's alright.

176
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,610
Hello, Turi.

177
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,950
He doesn't bite. Okay, Turi, go into your room.

178
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,960
Unni, Unni, want to take a selfie? Huh?

179
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,800
Shall we?

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,600
Come here.

181
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,350
Unni, shall we take a picture with this little guy?

182
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:41,000
This cake... the second son of Seowon Law Firm sent it for you.

183
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,660
Thank you!

184
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,120
Looks delicious!

185
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,700
Your mother says she'll thank him, so you don't call him yourself, Miss.

186
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,780
I got it.

187
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,160
I thought of you when I ran into a great pastry chef.

188
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,190
I hope this is a sweet gift for you. From Ki Young.

189
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,090
What's with his tone?

190
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,600
Are we in the 19th century? Is he writing a poem?

191
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,820
What did you say? Are you not going to eat? It's delicious!

192
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,170
Didn't you say you wanted to take a selfie?

193
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,740
One, two, three!

194
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,320
Once I met her, I felt a bit sorry for her.

195
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,040
She's all fond of her turtle and all.

196
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,500
So, I thought there for a moment, maybe I should change my mind and be a good unni to her. But wow, Lee Ki Young...

197
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,350
Lee Ki Young... that pretty cupcake...

You're on your fourth serving right now.

199
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,290
Leave me alone. I need energy for my battles.

200
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,960
If you gain weight, you'll lose your fighting advantage.

201
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,210
Gain weight? What?

202
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:44,100
- Huh?
- Why do you get to decide that my figure is my fighting advantage?

203
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,240
- No, I just had no idea that you eat pork skin.
- Hey.

204
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,570
You respect a woman's sexuality, length of her skirt, hairstyle, shoe style, and everything else.

205
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,020
Yet you deny her her appetite?

206
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,230
I know how to eat pork skin! I like it!

207
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,030
That's what I mean. I set up everything by myself. It was hard.

208
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,210
Good job.

209
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,090
You know my nickname is "Goopshin, Goophin" (literally means to bow, but sounds like grill) since I can grill well right?

210
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,930
The oil splatters, so only I can grill it.

211
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,410
Make sure you dip it in bean powder.

212
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,730
I'm ruined.

213
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,330
Ah! You too? What is it?

214
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,200
She knows everything. Everything including me meeting Go Kyung Joo's mom.

215
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,170
Did Go Kyung Joo tell her? That her mom and you—you know?

216
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,590
- Can't be! That looks bad for her mom.
- Whatever!

217
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,440
But what did you guys say you bet on? I didn't get to hear that.

218
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,290
What? You didn't know? She said she doesn't want to get married without falling in love, so—

219
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,730
What? What's the bet?

220
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,160
The loser will have to go on a hunger strike. And one of the kids will have to starve to death when we get married.

221
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,770
A hunger strike? You?

222
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,350
Why don't you hurry and grill? He's hungry!

223
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,760
Okay, let's see. If you win, you'll starve. If you lose, are you going to go hungry, too?

224
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,840
His father would never give into something like that.

225
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,200
I know. He's going to hand over his car to me.

226
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,330
Huh?

227
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,930
Geez, you can't give up then! Eat and get strong.

228
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,710
I can bear to see your parents get married, but I can't stand to see you lose your car.

229
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,290
So, you want me to starve?

230
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,430
Eat a lot now.

231
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,950
It's not here either.

232

Are you looking for something?

233
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,850
Oh? A plane.

234
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,970
- Is it good?
-Of course!

235
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,570
Hurry and send a picture. It's polite to send a picture for proof.

236
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,290
I don't want to. It's cheesy.

-Hurry in.
- Bye!

Was I too harsh?

252
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,390
It's not like I'm the one who went through it.

253
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,190
Should I tell you in detail what we did?

254

I don't know.

Go Kyung Joo. Don't forget about my favor.

314
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:24,010
I got it. But it's not on me if things don't work out between them.

315
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,700
Of course.

316
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,640
He came!

317
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,570
What do I do? You should have told me!

318
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,790
Do well.

319
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,180
Hello, Go Kyung Joo.

320
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,190
Oh, long time no see.

321
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,590
I thought he hated her to death.

322
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,770
Oh no! I have an appointment!

323
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,570
- An appointment?!
- An appointment?!

324
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,320
Se Joo, take good care of Kyung Joo.

325
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,580
Even your names are so similar.

326
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:10,720
Go Kyung Joo, Lee Se Joo. Se Joo, what are you doing? Why aren't you opening the door for Kyung Joo?

327
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,330
We should go together. It must be really urgent.

328
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,740
Yeah, very. Take care.

329
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,150
Do well. If you mess up, it voids the contract.

330
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,490
You better keep your promise.

331
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,720
Thank you!

332
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,570
Should we race to your house, Kyung Joo?
( A pun on Kyung Joo's name, which sounds like "race")

333
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,820
Where do you live?

334
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,670
It's okay if we go slowly.

335
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,780
No, we should go quickly.

336
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,290
Are you eating dinner?

337
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,640
No. Go Kyung Joo went home.

338
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,280
You should have eaten with her.

339
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,780
My family is holding a memorial today.

340
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,350
I got it.

341
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,490
[Aunt]

342
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,390
Yes, Aunt?

343
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,800
I'll go home and eat.

344
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,910
Yes.

345
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,470
Door opened.

346
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,500
- Why are you here?
-Just cause. Are you leaving?

347
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,190
No, I just came.
 Door opened.

348
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,120
What's with you? You said you had a memorial.

349
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,320
And? I'm hungry. What do you want to eat?

350
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,560
- Sushi!
- Down!

351
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,170
Oh my god, it's so ridiculous. Do you know what she did?

352
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,090
She wouldn't get me a new bed! She told me to suck it up!

353
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,960
Just buy what you want.

354
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,860
Dummy, what are you saying? She's saying wait and suck it up because we're going to live a new married life.

355
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:58,470
Okay. Let's say they get married. Do you think my mom would move into your place? Of course we would move!

356
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,520
Since we gathered for that reason, let's have a meeting. Hurry, beautiful.

357
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,810
Choi Soo Ji, you asked Go Kyung Joo properly, right?

358
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,340
Just focus on what you're doing.

359
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,090
You can just meet her during the weekend. Here.

360
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,170
[Part-time at a cafe. Volunteering at a nursing home.]

361
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,260
A nursing home?!

362
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,010
Weekends? No, this really isn't fair!

363
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,490
What is this?!

364
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:30,030
♪ You were born to serve others! ♪

365
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:35,300
You know the stories of ahjummas whose husbands don't notice their cosmetic surgery?

366
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,770
It's because it's her husband, not her boyfriend.

367
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,920
This is the girl who didn't rinse her hair because she was lazy.

368
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,550
It's affection if the guy notices even the tiniest change.

369
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,150
Men are more perceptive than we think.

370
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,380
What book said that?

371
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,920
It's all the theory I've learned over the years.

372
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,800
I'll show you everything in real life now.

373
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,410
Let's go to a club on Saturday. Dress up!

374
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,450
Wow!

375
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,450
Who is it that's making you so happy?

376
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:11,410
Choi Soo Ji. I thought she'd be cold and chic, but she's not like that at all.

377
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,770
That's good. It would have been nice if you guys had been close before graduating.

378
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,960
Are you sad?

379
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,170
No!

380
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,270
I said I was sorry.

381
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:25,640
You might not be able to see me much once I start dating.

382
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,460
You should hurry and find a boyfriend.

383
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,500
No, thanks. Why is the conversation going there?

384
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:37,760
Do you remember Kwon Shi Hyun? We saw him in the neighborhood last time.

385
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,350
Yeah.

386
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:45,480
He and Soo Ji are going to be step-siblings because their parents are remarrying. Don't you think it'd be shocking?

387
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,790
Oh, really?

388
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,880
So, Soo Ji worries a lot about him.

389
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,200
After Shi Hyun's mom passed away, I think he was confused for a bit.

390
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,490
He was badmouthed for being immature and there were bad rumors spread about him.

391
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,850
But he's a better guy than I thought.

392
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,850
He's quiet.

393
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,960
Wake up. Wake up. Nursing Home. Wake up. Wake up.

394
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,890
He's caring. Kind.

395
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:18,490
Handsome. Tall. Cool.

396
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,520
So there are those who mistake him for a player,

397
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:29,170
but he's not. He appears to be nice to everyone, but in reality he's only kind to the girl he really likes.

398
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,960
He's a real man!

399
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,990
You cut your hair.

400
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,850
It looks cute.

401
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,080
How long are you going to follow me? Why did you call me the day before yesterday?

402
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,360
- Call?
- Yes.

403
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,900
I had three missed calls from you.

404
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,550
If you were curious, you should've called back. Now, why did I call you?

405
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,320
Do you have nothing to do or just a lot of free time?

406
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,560
It's both.

407
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,630
Anyways, tell me what you want since you followed me here.

408
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,170
It's because I missed you.

409
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,840
I came because I missed you.

410
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,670
That—why would you?

411
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,740
Because I'm interested in you.

412
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,330
Tae Hee!

413
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,900
Hello.

414
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,450
You said you were going to bring a friend sometime, but it looks more like your boyfriend.

415
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,060
What?

416
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,450
No, that's not it, ma'am.

417
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,190
Nice to meet you.

418
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,860
This is Father Mateo, Secretary Park, and I'm Colomba.

419
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,990
It's good that you came.

420
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,990
It's good you came. It's really good you came.

421
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,830
Let's go together.

422
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,230
Thank you for coming.

423
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,560
It's okay.
