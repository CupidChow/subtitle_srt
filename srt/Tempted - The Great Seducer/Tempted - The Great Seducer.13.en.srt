Right now, here,

you gave me a chance to stop.

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,850
Even though I know that, I don't want to stop because

you've already begun being drawn in my heart.

I won't get flustered. I won't get lonely.

I don't know.

17
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,360
It's really painful.

18

But I want to keep being in pain.

Even if you have never experienced loving someone before,

20
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,950
there's probably a lot of people that love you.

Maybe.

What did I do?

91
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,280
Do you want to block those two that badly?

92
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,340
Why? Because Shi Hyun is yours?

93
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,490
What is it that you want to confirm from Shi Hyun that badly?

94
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,460
Was that kiss from that time that upsetting?

95
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,680
What?

96
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,000

What is it?

100
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,960
Why don't you ask Soo Ji to be your girlfriend?

101
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,980
Are you out of your mind?

102
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,730
She wants you to, punk.

103
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,450
I did, but she said she doesn't want to.

104
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,750
What did she say?

105
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,050
That our relationship is bound to break up.

106
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,680
Is that so? So what?

107
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,190
Well, she just asked me to kiss her once.

You're a crazy punk. Aigoo, is that the case?

109
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,690
But I couldn't.

110
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,700
I just couldn't.

111
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,960
Why can't you? When you even do it with me?

112

You hopeless punk. Aigoo.

113
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,000
Then, what was it? Do you dislike her that much?

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,250
Or, is it because you like her too much?

115
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,930
I like her. I really like her.

116
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,320
I like how things are right now.

117
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,060
You didn't and couldn't kiss her.

118
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,260
Yeah, that's right.

119
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,420
Shi Hyun is your friend. No, he's a friend that you like a lot.

120
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,060
That's why he didn't and couldn't. Do you not know that?!

121
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,450
What do you know to be telling me this?

122
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,500
You could've been touched because it seemed like he was protecting you.

123
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,720
If not, then you could've been upset because you thought he didn't like you like that.

124
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,280
But whatever happened is for you to interpret,

125
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,270
and it's just your outer shell trying to protect yourself. Got it?

126
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,590
You're hilarious. You're telling me that I was mistaken and everything started from that misunderstanding?

127

You get sad and touched all by yourself.

Now, you're even thinking about it for a long time because of how sweet those emotions are!

129
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,030
That's why the one that's having a hard time is you, isn't that right?!

130
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,880
Speak for yourself, you're the one that's mistaken. It's all because of that first kiss?

131
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,740
Get rid of your childish analysis!

132
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,750
If it's because of something else, given our relationship, it doesn't make sense.

This is me? Really?

164
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,120
It's okay. It's okay. Your face is blurred.

165
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,380
What were you doing instead of stopping me?

166
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,960
When we arrived, you were already hammered.

167
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,450
We?

168
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,580
Me and Soo Ji.

169
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,160
Soo Ji was there, too. You don't remember?

170
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,100
I'm not sure.

171
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,190
Wow, I can't believe it.

172
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,150
What happened that day that made you drink so much?

173
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,740
No reason. Why didn't Soo Ji come with you?

174
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,290
No reason.

175
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,920
Hey, concussion, did Eun Tae Hee come?

176
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,180
It's over, completely.

177
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,960
Then, your bet with Soo Ji is over, right?

178
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,220
Whether it's fake or real, the marriage or whatever.

179
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,150
Yes.

180
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,580
Then, I'm going to date Soo Ji.

181
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,830
Okay.

182
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,700
I'm leaving.

183
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,740
So cool, you bastard.

184
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,910
But, when are you going to give me your car, huh?

185
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,320
Hurry up and give it to me so I can go on have fun with Soo Ji.

186
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,470
You're completely fine.

187
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,820
His car is better.

188
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,050
Your expression looks bright, even though it's a posed photo.

189
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,940
I wasn't posing.

190
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,020
It was really fun. It reminded me of the time I used to do medical charity work during training.

191
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,570
I've never seen this kind of facial expression before.

192
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,130
Now do you think that I am qualified to take over JK Charitable Foundation

193
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,420
- and not look awkward?
- Yeah.

194
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,160
This is the article you asked to confirm in the woman's magazine.

195
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,250
Do we have to do this much?

196
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,560
We needed to release a story to show that your marriage isn't just a business deal.

197
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,510
I liked this article. You should read it.

198
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,420
Tell them to change the headline.

199
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,120
[Sponsor's Night Scandal]
[JK and Myeong Jeong Foundation's Romantic New Start: Vice-Chairman Kwon Suk Woo and President Myeong Mi Ri's Surprise Engagement Announcement]

200
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,900
I'll confirm the second round of revisions.

201
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,980
Yes, I understand.

202
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,480
Also, I'm thinking of getting a full physical for Shi Hyun since he's in the hospital anyway.

203
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,750
You didn't know? He's at our hospital right now.

204
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,930
No, I didn't know he was still there.

205
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,270
Also, why would a youngster like him need a full check up?

206
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,610
You already scolded him a lot.

207
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,890
Those kinds of twenty-year-old patients are common.

208
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,730
They're in the process of figuring out how tolerant they are of alcohol.

209
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,470
Anyway, please tell your staff to keep quiet.

210
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,080
Make sure to be careful of outside exposure.

211
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,240
Yes, I understand.

212
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,990
And I think we'll get permission from the investigation this week.

213
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,860
Once the chairwoman returns, I'm sure she'll be happy.

214
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,450
Then... we should pick a date.

215
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,720
Let's make it next month.

216
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,790
I like it. I'll schedule it.

217
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,160
Why did it have to be Myeong Jeong Hospital?

218
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,400
If he was somewhere else, then—

219
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,980
Do your job properly.

220
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,470
If you don't have confidence, then quit being in charge of Shi Hyun.

221
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:40,970
Until the investigation goes through, we're not commenting on anything.

222
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,270
Tell them that we're just waiting on the results.

223
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,320
Respond that way to questions about my marriage, too. Understand?

224
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,780
Yes, I understand.

225
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,240
Are you embarrassed to face me? Why aren't you coming to our hideout?

226
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,530
Why would I be embarrassed?

227
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,090
Just in case, I don't want you to be upset.

228
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,080
Ahh, Se Joo, I should just ask him for a car.

229
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,300
Are you not going to see Shi Hyun?

230
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,870
Why visit him for being drunk?

231
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,510
Come here later. You have to!

232
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,030
He's going overboard. This is a place where people go on dates.

233
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,680
Why is he being like this? Has he gone crazy?

234
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,070
Have you arrived, Miss Soo Ji?

235
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,050
You said it was annoying to go all the way over there, so I brought it here.

236
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,620
What's all this?

237
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,790
Just try it first.

238
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,840
Wow. Did you call me here so I could eat this?

239
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,450
Yes. From here to there, try all of them.

240
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,790
I'm in the middle of planning for a business.

241
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,630
According to marriage statistics firms, fifty-five percent of female and

242
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,630
forty-two percent of male want extramarital affairs.

243
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,340
This is for real.

244
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,270
If you include potential cheaters who didn't answer honestly,

245
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,060
then this is a complete blue ocean.

246
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,660
See? You're real, live proof.

247
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,420
If you just guarantee that your family won't find out,

248
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,370
then customers will just be—

249
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,550
It almost spilled over.

250
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,040
How is this? If it's delicious, I'll open a business in front of your school.

251
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,590
Right outside the music department.

252
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,980
Do you think this is something that would suit being in front of our school?

253
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,960
It doesn't matter. As long as you enjoy eating it.

254
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,120
As expected, it's so delicious that you want to take some home, right?

255
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,350
I'm gonna give it to Shi Hyun.

256
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,710
Shi Hyun couldn't remember anything from that day.

257
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,590
Probably, since he drank that much.

258
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,870
Kwon Shi Hyun and Eun Tae Hee are completely over.

259
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,230
So the bet between you two is also over.

260
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,870
Why do I have to hear these things from you?

261
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,230
- In case Shi Hyun is keeping it a secret from you.
- What?

262
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,460
I'm telling you this in case he keeps it a secret that it's over with Eun Tae Hee

263
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,950
and keeps giving you false hope.

264
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,550
Two secrets are more than enough between the three of us.

265
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,550
Who knows? He might be telling us that it's over with her,

266
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,230
but he's secretly dating her.

267
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,660
Don't you know Shi Hyun? He can't lie to us.

268
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,790
When I get his car, let's go somewhere. Just the two of us.

269
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,280
Wow, you're saying all sorts of nonsense now.

270
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,430
- Suspend it!
- Suspend it!

271
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,570
This is a threat to public health. It's a threat! It's a threat!

272
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,770
- This is a threat!
- This is a threat!

273
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,050
Block the results!

274
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,370
Suspend it! Suspend it!

275
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,460
- Suspend it!
- Suspend it!

276
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,070
I think the media found out about the approval of Tuizen.

277
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,030
There are protesters in front of our company.

278
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,830
Until the official announcement, he said to continue to deny it.

279
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,440
I understand.

280
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,940
There will be protesters at your office, too.

281
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,090
Be careful.

282
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,730
Her son's here and he doesn't even have a thought of leaving.

283
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,820
Vice Chairman? Do you think he'll want to come here? He's always in a bad mood.

284
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,800
I heard it's a heart condition.

285
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,280
Aigoo, she's only here because they can't stand to look at each other.

286
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,270
What's there to pity about her? This place is better than a hotel.

287
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,390
Just pretend like you don't hear it.

288
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,970
Even though they're like that, the secretaries

289
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,560
are nice to me and tell me a lot of things.

290
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,970
Hello, Madam.

291
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,390
How is your condition today? Did you have a good sleep?

292
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,810
Yes. I'm good.

293
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:50,310
Thanks to you, this place is as good as home.

294
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,120
Hello.

295
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:58,220
You should come here often. She gets so much better whenever you visit.

296
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,010
I think I know why, when I look at you.

297
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,210
How's the patient from yesterday?

298
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,590
Well, there were some problems, but we got them figured out.

299
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,730
Well, you're eating well, right?

300
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,020
Excuse me, but can I have a cup of tea?

301
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,310
Come in.

302
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,630
There are some things I want to know about the day my mom passed away.

303
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,000
Like what?

304
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,680
There were no records of the car she was driving ever being in an accident, so I found that a little strange.

305
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,410
It was probably just a simple error when they were inputting the records.

306
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:57,900
No. On the same exact day, there was another accident reported in a different district.

307
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,580
There was only one and I heard it was a hit-and-run.

308
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,830
No matter how much I think about it, it's strange.

309
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,790
I wonder why she went to the unfamiliar city of Jeongeup when she was supposed to be in the hospital.

310
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,250
It was a big accident, so it's a bit suspicious that there's no record of it.

311
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,730
I'm alright now.

312
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,450
You were my mother's primary doctor.

313
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,840
You even went to the hospital in Jeongeup when my mom passed away.

314
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,250
So, I was wondering if you knew anything.

315
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,900
Did you hear the details about the hit-and-run accident?

316
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,290
No. Besides the fact that the victim was a student—

317
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:45,680
Don't you think that there's a reason your family didn't tell you the exact details of your mother's death?

318
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,150
Whatever it is, I can take it.

319
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,900
Did it ever occur to you

320
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,680
that your mother might have been the driver of the hit-and-run accident?

321
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,360
The company decided to erase that record.

322
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,280
Your father, the vice-chairman, and I, her primary doctor, are probably the only ones that know.

323
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,220
We couldn't let your deceased mother remain as the guilty party.

324
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,400
Let's just hope that the female student is doing well.

325
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,030
Even though we broke up, he should at least know that this is a different matter.

326
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,950
What the heck? I don't like him being like this.

327
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:18,500
I'll just leave him a voicemail. I'll use all the cuss words I know.

328
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,230
It's ringing.

329
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,210
Hello? Are you the owner of this phone?

330
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,110
You weren't in your ward, so I was planning on seeing my mother and then leaving.

331
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,040
I just came for a cup of tea.

332
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,960
Since you are both here, I have something to say.

333
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,910
Although your dad is probably going to tell you this, we've decided to have the wedding next month.

334
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,560
- Mom.
- It will just be a small family dinner,

335
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,170
so there shouldn't be anything bothersome for you two.

336
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,510
- That's fine, right, Shi Hyun?
- Yeah.

337
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,390
Hey, Kwon Shi Hyun.

338
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,940
He must be thinking about his mother, since she was also admitted often in this hospital.

339
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,720
Don't tell his dad that he's been admitted to our hospital.

340
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,910
Does he not know that he's been admitted?

341
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:25,190
Yeah, he probably doesn't know because they rarely see each other at home.

342
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,900
We were hanging out with him, so I'm afraid he'll get in trouble for it.

343
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:59,010
I asked what was going on with Kwon Shi Hyun, and Se Joo told me.

344
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,710
He's basically telling you to go and see for yourself.

345
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,820
That's right... just for his phone.

346
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,130
Let's leave after giving him back his phone.

347
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,670
Mom was a good person, though.

348
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,350
But why?

349
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,360
What was so hard for her?

350
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,960
Why are you crying?

351
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,760
Because my head hurts.

352
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,080
H-How did you get here?

353
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,010
Look at you changing the subject. Here.

354
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,580
Where did you find this?

355
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,830
Someone picked it up at the bar, but they couldn't call because your phone was locked.

356
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,660
The person forgot that he had this phone, so when he was charging it and turning it on, I happened to call.

357
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,900
You called me? Why?

358
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,170
I should at least tell the landlord.
[I'm putting the house on sale. Answer my calls. I found someone who wants to rent it. I'm going to start packing up.]

359
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,590
Don't go, okay? Do you have to be like this?

360
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,860
It's uncomfortable between us.

361
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,880
Did it hurt a lot?

362
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,080
What about you?

363
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,650
Me?

364
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,150
You also had a hard time.

365
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,680
Well... I'm going to get going before the last bus leaves.

366
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,190
Already?

367
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,450
I only came to give you your phone.

368
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,790
Then, take care.

369
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,160
I'm sorry for confusing you.

370
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,590
I know what Soo Ji might have said to you.

371
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,380
It's true that I did like Soo Ji.

372
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,410
I liked her a lot, and I still do.

373
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,040
But... all these feelings are just friendship.

374
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,800
Both Se Joo and Soo Ji are very precious to me.

375
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,800
We have a friendship that I can't really explain with words to people.

376
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,200
But there's one thing I can explain properly to you.

377
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,590
You and Soo Ji are different to me.

378
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:55,180
I think... I like you, too.

379
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,640
I'm getting discharged tomorrow, so can't you stay with me?

380
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,900
Aigoo, well...

381
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,830
I can't even get discharged. I don't have a guardian, so how can I get discharged?

382
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,200
Why don't you have a guardian?

383
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,940
I don't really talk to my dad.

384
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,320
Then, I'll leave after you get your discharge papers.

385
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,940
Really?

386
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,100
Sit here.

387
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,580
I'm only staying because I know how lonely it gets when you're alone in the hospital.

388
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,740
Were you hospitalized once?

389
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,470
Yeah. I was involved in a car accident before.

390
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,930
Please don't leave. Please don't leave me.

391
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,130
Get up.

392
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:02,310
Oh, so that's why you were so scared at that time.

393
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,930
I'm sorry.

394
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:09,190
Your eyes are really like Cinderella's mirror.

395
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,660
Huh?

396
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,760
I'm going to believe you.

397
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,430
But don't ever make me lonely.

398
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,760
Also, when I don't like you anymore, I'll tell you.

399
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,500
You have to promise to tell me right away when you don't like me anymore.

400
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:36,800
There's nothing more tortuous than being caught up in a one-sided relationship. I don't do things like that.

401
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,240
Okay.

402
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,760
Here.

403
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,940
Wow.

404
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,940
This must be his mother.

405
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,510
Are you giving me this?

406
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah.

407
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,230
Come here.

408
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,110
Even though I'm hospitalized, it's so great that someone's here with me.

409
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,290
I should've visited my mother more often when she was here.

410
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,770
My mom stayed here to get treatment for a really long time.

411
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,710
I did everything here, including throwing birthday parties and getting scolded for my grades.

412
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,820
Mom, let's hold a birthday party at our house next year. Okay?

413
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,920
Let's do that.

414
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,220
I really wanted to go home with her.

415
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,750
You should go to sleep now. Once you wake up,

416
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,420
go home with me.

417
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,460
Yeah.
