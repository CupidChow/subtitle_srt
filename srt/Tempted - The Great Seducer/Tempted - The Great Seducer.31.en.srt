1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,990
Don't you dare drag Tae Hee into this.

2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,590
Aish!

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,410
What the heck?

4
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,800
You know you're being hilarious right now, right?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,680
You're the one that started this joke in the first place, so how can you end up liking her for real?! Huh?

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,340
Who gave you the right to like someone like Tae Hee? Huh?!

7
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,420
You think you're pathetic, too, right?

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,740
How angry do you think Tae Hee is?

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,260
Should we ask her?

10
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,220
Oh, Tae Hee. You called me earlier.

11
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,920
I got a phone call from Hye Jung just now, Oppa.

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,440
What are you doing right now?

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,130
I found Hye Jung and sent her back home safely,

14
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,020
so don't worry too much. But Tae Hee,

15
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,450
did you know that Kwon Shi Hyun was messing around with you?

16
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,570
Eun Tae Hee, hang up! Don't you ever listen to this bastard's words!

17
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,480
I just couldn't stand aside and watch,

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,300
so that's why I'm in the middle of teaching this punk about manners right now.

19
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,640
What should I do to him? Just tell me.

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,130
I... will do everything that you want.

21
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,390
O-Oppa, if this becomes a problem, then you're the one that's going to get hurt.

22
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,660
Please, don't do it.

23
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,950
How can I just stand still?

24
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,930
What are you going to do if he keeps following you around? He's not remorseful at all.

25
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,230
He's even pretending to be sincere.

26
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,130
What the heck, you punk?

27
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,110
I'll take care of it. This doesn't involve you.

28
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,690
But why are you taking Kwon Shi Hyun's side?

29
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,120
I'm not siding with him. I'm just saying that you don't have a reason to take it this far.

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,190
Right? Since we're both victims.

31
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,580
Eun Tae Hee, hang up!

32
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,420
Shut up!

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,020
Taxi!

34
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,860
You pathetic punk. Do you not have anything better to do?

35
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,720
Does your family know that you're like this?

36
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,190
Let's just leave already.

37
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,390
Door opened.

38
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,630
Tae Hee...

39
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,920
What are you doing right now, Oppa?

40
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,160
You're surprised, right, Tae Hee?

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,490
He's bleeding a bit, but he's not that hurt.

42
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,540
No, this is too much! This is a crime.

43
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,880
Hey, what do you mean?

44
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,960
I... also got hit here. I also said we should stop, but he kept—

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,420
What are you saying? I helped you because you asked for help.

46
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,600
You didn't hit them with that, did you?

47
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,720
We were just using this to scare them.

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,250
You know how they don't listen.

49
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,220
Hey, you should take it, it's yours.

50
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,710
Why did you come here? Go quickly.

51
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,730
Alright, let's all go now. That's good enough, right, Tae Hee?

52
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,360
How can you untie them? He's already weak as it is.
[112 - Emergency]

53
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,970
Tae Hee, let's go. I'll take you home.

54
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,010
No. He should go with the police when they get here.

55
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,990
- Police?
- Hey. I knew she was going to do that.

56
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,510
Give me your phone!

57
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,330
Why would you report this, Tae Hee? You didn't, right?

58
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,950
Even if you did, there isn't much evidence.

59
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,910
What do you mean? I heard and saw everything. I'm going to give them my statement—

60
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,580
Her phone! She can be tracked, you punk!

61
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,870
Eun Tae Hee, go quickly! Go!

62
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,910
Tae Hee... give that to me while I'm being nice.

63
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,860
Give it to me quickly. Give it to me!

64
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,000
Why are you being like this to me?!

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,070
You bastard!

66
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,260
S-Shi Hyun...

67
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,050
- Shi... Shi Hyun.
- Door opened.

68
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,690
S-Shi Hyun. Open your eyes, Shi Hyun.

69
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,380
Shi Hyun!

70
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,220
Shi Hyun! Look at me.

71
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,560
Surgery Room

72
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,890
Yes, Father.

73
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,450
You crazy bastard. What did you do with JK Group, huh?

74
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,690
Where are you hiding right now?!

75
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,880
Do you know that, because of you, Seo Won is in chaos right now?

76
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,110
Yes... I'm coming.

77
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,080
Yes. I'm coming.

78
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,700
What are you doing at other people's house early in the morning?

79
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,720
I heard that Director Myeong is getting investigated by the prosecutor's office for her testimony.

80
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,120
I thought you would be too worried.

81
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,460
I don't need you. It would be helpful if I didn't see you, so just go.

82
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,340
Don't worry too much. Within twenty-four hours she's going to be released.

83
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,310
If by any chance she is found guilty and needs a lawyer,

84
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,470
then my family should step in and help.

85
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,320
You should stop talking your crap and just get lost!

86
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,660
Soo Ji. You should use some prettier words.

87
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,170
You have such a pretty face, but...

88
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,890
If you keep acting rudely like that,

89
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,340
one day you're going to end up badly hurt. Like this.

90
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,040
Lee Ki Young.

91
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,530
What did you do to Se Joo?

92
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,230
Where is Lee Se Joo?!

93
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,460
Are you worried only about Se Joo?

94
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,150
What about him?

95
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,210
Your hideout is pretty nice.

96
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,010
You crazy bastard.

97
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,870
What did you do to them?

98
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,070
Why are you swearing at me? This was all because of you.

99
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,010
You're the head. You plan things out and they act.

100
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,100
But... did you like me that much?

101
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,860
Were you that mad at me that you did all this?

102
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,200
Lee Ki Young, you...

103
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,430
I'm going to kill you.

104
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,990
Right? The best kind of revenge I can take is showing you those two punks looking like that.

105
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,480
If you want to protect your precious Shi Hyun and Se Joo,

106
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,580
then don't do anything. Got it?

107
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,620
I just stopped by here to tell you that.

108
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,860
I'm leaving.

109
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,320
Give me your phone.

110
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,900
For the time being, I'm banning you from going outside and using your phone.

111
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,670
You know why I'm being like this, right?

112
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,400
What do you mean by, "for the time being"? You should ban her from going outside for the rest of her life! Aigoo, Park Hye Jung.

113
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:10,010
Park Gyu Jung. If you treat your little sister like that from now on, I'm going to teach you a lesson!

114
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,770
A-Alright.

115
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,310
Mom...

116
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,740
I was wrong.

117
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:26,070
Park Hye Jung. I'm not going to do something like marrying you off to a horrible household

118
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,410
like Seo Won. I was also wrong,

119
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,200
so you should stop thinking about other things.

120
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,510
Just do what you need to do. Alright?

121
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,970
Yes.

122
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,470
Let's go, Gyu Jung. Let's leave Hye Jung to study.

123
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,950
What happened? What's the matter? Why aren't they answering?

124
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,300
Lee Se Joo!

125
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,300
Se Joo...

126
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,160
How did this happen?

127
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,650
Rest well. I'll come back tomorrow.

128
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,910
Let's go see Shi Hyun together.

129
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,090
It must've been hard for you. There isn't going to be anything tiring like this anymore.

130
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,810
The company will also try their best to help.

131
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,890
How's Soo Ji? Is the vice chairman recovering well?

132
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,330
Yeah.

133
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,650
In the end, you're the only one that came to get me.

134
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,210
It was the vice chairman that told me to come here.

135
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,560
It's still hard for him to call you.

136
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,700
Thanks for coming.

137
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,680
Let's go. I'll take you home.

138
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,050
It's pretty.

139
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,800
Flower vase.

140
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,720
Where's the vase?

141
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,120
Soo Ji.

142
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,830
Are you sleeping, Soo Ji?

143
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,670
Soo Ji?

144
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,960
Soo Ji! Soo Ji!!

145
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,220
Look at me.

146
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,730
During the accident, due to the physical trauma to his head, there's a cerebral edema.

147
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,070
He's still in a coma because the swelling won't go down.

148
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,710
We're giving him medication to lower the pressure,

149
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,610
so for now, we just have to wait for him to gain consciousness.

150
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,790
Okay.

151
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,520
Did any of his other family members come yet?

152
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,650
They'll come.

153
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,100
Alright.

154
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,540
Wake up, Kwon Shi Hyun.

155
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,320
What do you expect me to do with you?

156
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,730
What do you want me to do?

157
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,680
I already decided not to see you again. I was going to...

158
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,270
hope that only bad things happen to you.

159
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,840
I want you to hurt as much as I despise you.

160
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,430

Also, the biggest one he messed with was JK. He got cut off from them in one go.
