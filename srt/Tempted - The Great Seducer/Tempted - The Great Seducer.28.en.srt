1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,310
And you hit Tae Hee.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,360
Can't you stop here?

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,760
I won't tell Soo Ji and my father.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,950
Soo Ji... won't be able to handle it.

5
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,880
Choi Soo Ji. You're not awake because you can't fall asleep, right?

6
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,620
A shot of cognac when you can't sleep is the best.

7
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,870
You should count "One Goo Se Joo," "Two Goo Se Joos"

8
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,630
"Three Goo Se Joos," and try to fall asleep. Got it?

9
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,830
Alright.

10
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,300
Do you have something to tell me?

11
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,680
No.

12
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,090
You don't have to come here all the time on purpose.

13
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,890
Mom really hated being alone when she was hospitalized here.

14
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,650
After spending a couple of days here, I can understand why.

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,120
I came of my own will, so you don't have to worry.

16
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,760
I won't come anymore if you feel uncomfortable.

17
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,390
No. It's nothing like that.

18
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,220
I'm going to go to America with Grandma after you finish your surgery.

19
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,360
I've already told Grandmother.

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,280
I want to find what I want to do.

21
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,550
The things I want to do and things I can do.

22
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,590
Alright.

23
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,200
Aren't you going to say anything?

24
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,220
You should think about it slowly and make a choice you won't regret.

25
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,780
When I look back, I think that I wasn't able to do that.

26
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,310
Things I liked to do and people I liked...

27
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,460
Joo Hwan, I'm being dragged to some old person's birthday party.

28
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,960
This is really the worst.

29
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,090
I miss you, Hye Jung.

30
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,650
Nothing much happened at home, right?

31
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,430
Why is she taking such a long time?

32
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,120
Hey.

33
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,670
Aish. Stop it already.

34
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,500
"Aish"? How can you be saying that to me when I'm older than you?

35
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,530
Stop picking on me again.

36
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,840
I'm doing this because I'm thinking about you. It's for your own good.

37
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,550
I told you to quit playing games.

38
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,460
It's because you always play games, that's why your eyesight keeps getting bad and you gain weight.

39
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,780
You use more violence and become anti-social. You don't even know any of this.

40
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,990
Who are you calling violent?

41
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,700
Shall I reveal everything? I'm going to be your brother-in-law.

42
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,890
Plus, this is my house!

43
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,490
This punk.

44
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,380
This won't do. You should get a beating today.

45
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,340
Stay still. Hey.

46
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,320
- Stop it.
- Stay still.

47
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,690
I told you already!

48
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,620
If you touch my brother again, I'm going to kill you!

49
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,320
Did you just hit me? Did you just lower your speech?

50
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,120
These idiotic people, you don't know how I've been nice to you all this time.

51
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,390
What?!

52
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,260
You weakling!

53
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,920
Seriously, you jerk. Hey, hey.

54
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,950
Just hit him, Oppa. Hit him to your heart's content!

55
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,960
- Don't.
- Just ease your heart.

56
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,270
Take this! Take this one, too!

57
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,850
Hit him more!

58
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,030
Just you wait and see! Once we get married, I'm going to train you properly!

59
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,130
Whatever! Wait and see what? Let me see it now. Just let me see now, then!

60
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,640
Fine. Just look at it now! Look at it right now!

61
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,890
Let me see it right now! Show me!

62
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,800
- Aish. I'm going to hit you.
- Hey!

63
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,860
Oppa!

64
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,020
Let go!

65
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,150
Hye Jung?!

66
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,730
Mom...

67
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:45,070
I'm going to officially discuss what happened today with your parents.

68
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,700
Mother, I know that it's the parents' choice to call this wedding off or not,

69
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,630
but did you know that Hye Jung is dating someone?

70
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,290
What did you say?

71
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,200
No... she doesn't have to get engaged with me. She doesn't have to,

72
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,160
but because she's naive, I'm asking you to protect her well. Don't you agree with me?

73
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm telling you this because I've already known you for many years.

74
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,130
Who could my Hye Jung be dating? Who?

75
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,690
I don't know.

76
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,310
Didn't I tell you that she was influenced by Soo Ji since they started hanging out?

77
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,310
Dad!

78
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,800
Eun Tae Hee!

79
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,440
This school has changed a lot since the time I used to lecture here.

80
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,930
I want to go to school with you.

81
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,030
It would be nice if you start lecturing again.

82
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,880
You should show me that male student quickly.

83
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,020
Where is he? I came here to meet him.

84
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,560
What?

85
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,460
The person who interrupted our video call. Is he from the same department?

86
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,290
We broke up already.

87
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,880
Why? Did he say he doesn't like you?

88
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,350
No.

89
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,790
Then, why did you break up?

90
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,730
If it's not because he doesn't like you anymore, then what's the problem?

91
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,380
We didn't break up because we started disliking each other...

92
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,590
Ah, just forget it! It just didn't work out.

93
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,870
You should continue meeting each other, if you like one another.

94
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,110
Do you know how much of a miracle it is for two people to love each other at the same time?

95
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,280
But that miracle doesn't last forever. I don't like it.

96
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,120
Although it doesn't last forever, the time and the emotions,

97
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,060
are too beautiful and precious.

98
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,230
Don't you think so?

99
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:57,130
Do you still believe in love even after Mom made you that lonely, Dad?

100
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,560
Of course. I believe in my love.

101
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,480
Don't underestimate a one-sided love.

102
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,430
Although Mom didn't love me as much as I wanted her to,

103
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,030
she still allowed me

104
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,590
to love her as much as I did. That's enough for me.

105
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:22,990
Although I didn't win over her heart, it was enough to fulfill my heart.

106
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:43,820
♫ I couldn't say ♫

107
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:50,980
♫ To pour out my heart ♫

108
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:58,060
♫ In case I got farther away from her ♫

109
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,320
♫ I must have been hesitating ♫

110
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,210
If you like someone, you should love and be loved to your heart's content.

111
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,980
I know that you got hurt because of your mom and me.

112
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,800
I also know that because of that, you don't believe in love. However, if you can't break free from that,

113
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,590
I will feel more apologetic towards you than anyone else.

114
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:28,430
♫ Now and like this, I wouldn't have regretted it ♫

115
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:37,400
♫ I should've approached you first ♫

116
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,190
Nothing happened to me though.

117
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:40,970
♫ I ♫

118
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:46,360
It's just because I want to hug you.

119
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,190
It's nice that you're hugging me.

120
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,290
Tae Hee...

121
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,870
Eun Tae Hee...

122
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,200
What is it?

123
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,070
This is amazing.

124
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,070
You're the one that called me.

125
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,470
You're really here.

126
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,650
Tell me. Why did you call me?

127
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:23,000
Alright. I also decided to get to the point about my feelings.

128
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,050
Will... you hang out with me for the whole day tomorrow? Just for the whole day tomorrow.

129
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,040
Why? Are you going somewhere?

130
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,260
Just one day.

131
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,540
Alright.

132
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,800
Really?

133
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,660
I said okay already. So... see you tomorrow.

134
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,810
Oh.

135
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,660
You should've woken me.

136
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,600
Are you feeling a bit better? It's been a while since you slept so long.

137
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,630
Well, just...

138
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,920
Mom. Should I go study abroad?

139
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,420
Why all of a sudden?

140
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,710
I want to get a hold of myself and only play cello for a few years.

141
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,320
Will you come with me, Mom?

142
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,370
What do you think about going with me and taking a break from work for a few years?

143
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,950
I have to work.

144
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,900
If you want to go, just go. I'll prepare everything for you.

145
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:18,910
However, you always said you didn't want to go abroad and now both you and Shi Hyun are going to study abroad.

146
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,740
Shi Hyun is going overseas, too?

147
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,900
It seems like it.

148
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,610
I think they're looking into it.

149
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,880
If you don't want to, you don't have to go. Just stay here.

150
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,760
No.

151
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,210
I made this decision without thinking about Shi Hyun.

152
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:44,300
If you're contemplating because you're worried for Ahjussi, let's just wait until he gets better after the surgery.

153
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,310
Go with me.

154
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,480
Let's take our time and think about it.

155
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,220
Rest up.

156
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,830
Let's fill this album up with us going to beautiful, nice places.

157
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,110
♫ When I saw you the first time, I didn't know it'd be like this ♫

158
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,140
Alright, I'm here.

159
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,520
What are we going to do?

160
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,590
Here!
♫ I know it with my head, but it doesn't happen like I thought ♫

161
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:48,520
♫ I can't do anything about my heart going closer every day ♫

162
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,790
♫ Even if  ♫

163
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,970
Is this the place you wanted to go to?
♫ I promise myself, always that place ♫

164
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,910
Wait a moment.

165
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,690
♫ Maybe it's his love that shakes me ♫

166
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,680
What is this?

167
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,930
What do you mean? It's a flower headband.

168
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,000
♫ No way,  ♫

169
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,330
Let's take a picture.
♫ What do you mean love right now? ♫

170
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,850
When did you prepare all of these?

171
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,850
♫ Rather than love, pretending not to know would be better ♫

172
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,790
Tae Hee! Tae Hee! Quickly.

173
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,980
What?

174
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,940
I realized that pictures are the only thing left of your memories.

175
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,120
♫ But I don't think this is easy, it's difficult to say ♫

176
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,950
You're not doing this and then not going anywhere, right?

177
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,960
You promised me that you'll spend the entire day with me.

178
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,320
It's taking a picture! One, two...

179
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,770
Who's the flower?

180
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,710
Alright. One, two, three.

181
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,730
There must be no customers.

182
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,990
I reserved the whole place, so we can spend time alone.

183
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,770
You're crazy. These are all expensive, right?

184
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,330
I'm just joking.

185
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,770
It's a restaurant that only takes one table a day.

186
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,780
I looked into a place where we could eat dinner alone.

187
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,130
You prepared a lot.

188
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,420
Would you like a glass of wine, my lady?

189
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,190
Cheers.

190
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,520
Lately, whenever I wake up in the morning,

191
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,890
the first thing I think about is how you're somewhere nearby.

192
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,400
However, there will come a morning when the first thing I think about

193
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,620
is how you're not here with me.

194
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,300
There will come a day when all I think about is

195
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,400
how I lied to you.

196
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,990
Even if those days do come, I want to remember your smile.

197
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,340
I pray for it everyday.

198
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,930
We did all sorts of things, seriously.

199
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
What was her name again?

200
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,220
Eun Tae Hee. Don't forget it!

201
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,190
What is it?

202
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,900
Choi Soo Ji. What do you think about a night walk in Seoul?

203
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,150
Out of nowhere?

204
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,990
I want to see you right now.

205
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,850
I won't make you tired. I'm coming to your house.

206
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,430
♫ If you, are the moon ♫

207
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,660
Here.

208
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,990
I'll hold onto you every day.

209
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,130
♫ And so you flew ♫

210
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,890
♫ whether ♫

211
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,010
Se Joo...

212
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,630
I thought that none of us would change.

213
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,830
At what point did it all go wrong? And from what point did I mess up?

214
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,290
♫ I have taught ♫

215
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,170
If I told him that I liked him first,

216
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:58,250
if I told him that I trusted him when he asked me why I didn't trust anyone, would it have not ended like this?

217
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,290
I wanted for nothing to change.

218
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,530
You did nothing wrong.

219
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:13,300
We've... just become a bit different.

220
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,010
What would I have done if I didn't also have you by my side?

221
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,390
It's a relief that you're at least here.

222
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,890
What the heck? All of a sudden...

223
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,550
I think Shi Hyun's going to study abroad.

224
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:39,250
My mom said that. I'm planning on going, too.

225
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,390
I'm also trying to convince my mom to quit everything and just go with me.

226
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,950
Why would you? Where to? Why are you leaving?

227
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,170
You and Shi Hyun shouldn't be like this. Why are you all leaving?!

228
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,590
Fine. We were bastards, but that's not something that should've divided the two of you up.

229
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,130
It was nothing that should've broken up the three of us.

230
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,100
We shouldn't have started this in the first place.

231
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,370
It's none of your faults.

232
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,540
Soo Ji! I'll catch her immediately for you.

233
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,470
Don't waver and just endure it.

234
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,330
Come here.

235
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:29,090
Park Hye Jung! Tell me honestly. Are you dating someone?

236
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,830
It's not a crime to date! Don't punish me like it's a crime.

237
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,820
It is a crime!

238
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,560
Why? When it makes me happy?

239
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,750
Is it important to you that I'm happy or me getting married to Lee Ki Young?

240
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,470
Did I ever say I wanted to marry him?!

241
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,160
Hey, Park Hye Jung! How can you be like that to her!

242
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,290
You're an idiot! Just shut up!

243
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,960
How can you stand still when Ki Young hits you like that?

244
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,830
What? You—Hey!

245
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,110
Shut it, the both of you!

246
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,460
Who are you dating? Just who is this—?

247
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,620
First off, just know that you're banned from leaving this house.

248
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,900
Mom! You saw him hitting us!

249
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,240
I'm telling you, that punk isn't even human!

250
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,260
Still, he has Seo Won.

251
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,040
Seo Wan Law Firm! Don't you know how scary rumors are?

252
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,610
Mom!

253
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,800
To: Park Gyu Jung
If you starve Turi,

254
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,290
know that you will die when I return.

255
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,770
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

256
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,540
You can take that off now.

257
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,420
Ah, this?

258
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,730
The cherry blossoms are all wet now.

259
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,540
The lilacs will probably bloom soon, and then the roses.

260
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,410
Flowers will continuously bloom.

261
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,410
- Do you know all of those things?
- Of course.

262
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,210
When tomorrow comes, everything will go back to the way it was, right?

263
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,670
Then, give me one day, too.

264
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,240
Even if it's not tomorrow, just give me one day.

265
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,740
I can give you one day or ten days,

266
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,380
but before that, I have something to tell you.

267
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,740
Ring my doorbell whenever you're prepared to listen to it. I'll tell you then.

268
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,350
Alright.

269
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,690
I don't know how and from what point to start this story off,

270
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:24,810
but I need to tell you this big mistake I made to you.

271
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,720
What brings you here?

272
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,470
I can come in, right?

273
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,460
I closed down our hideout.

274
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,130
Okay.

275
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,900
I'll ask you one last time, let's say that the three of us are done.

276
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,800
Do you have any thoughts of going back to Soo Ji?

277
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:26,310
Kwon Shi Hyun. Whenever Soo Ji talked about you, her eyes would always sparkle.

278
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:30,650
However, starting at some point, every time your name came up, her eyes got sad.

279
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:36,570
You should've let her like you as much as she wanted and you should've liked her as much as she did.

280
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:42,310
When she got tired of you and left you, that's when you should've started liking Tae Hee or not.

281
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:47,700
If you had, we wouldn't have ended like this.

282
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,900
Se Joo. I already left the hideout, and you know that.

283
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,800
You should stay by Soo Ji's side and treat her well.

284
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,520
I can't because of you!

285
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,390
I can't help but only think about her!

286
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,740
Are you also going to leave her and end it like that?

287
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,350
Was I the only one that wanted to protect the relationship between the three of us?

288
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,370
Alright. Even if that's the case, you should at least go back to her.

289
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,210
Just like how you played with her heart,

290
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,200
you should at least stay next to her until she tells you to get lost!

291
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,350
I'm sorry, Lee Se Joo.

292
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,080
I'm also... sorry.

293
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,490
Hello?

294
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:27,470
I'm Lee Se Joo. I have something I want to talk with you about, regarding Shi Hyun.

295
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,750
What is it?

296
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm in front of Shi Hyun's house right now. Can you come down for a little bit?

297
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,320
What for?

298
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,560
We fought on the day of Shi Hyun's birthday.

299
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,860
You're the only person that can help us make up.

300
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,960
It's been a long time.

301
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,730
Is there something you want me to relay to him or something?

302
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,950
I have something to tell you about Shi Hyun.

303
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,350
Things about Shi Hyun, I'll hear it directly from him.

304
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,030
He lied to you.

305
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,400
I'm saying that he lied to you.

306
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,780
I'll also hear that personally from him.

307
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:24,530
I'm not quite sure. I have evidence

308
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,770
of everything he lied to you about.

309
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,960
Did she fall asleep?

310
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,780
Do you want to go in?

311
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,250
No.

312
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,920
Really?

313
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,720
Door opened.

314
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,880
This is our hideout. Our broken nest.

315
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,670
Have a seat.

316
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,960
Take a look at this.

317
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,470
Take a look and see how you ended up in our nest.
[Name: Eun Tae Hee.
Gender: Female
Age: 20
Birth: January 22, 1999]

318
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,920
[7:00 - House
Part time at the district library
10:00 - Kyung Joo's house
13:00 - School]

319
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,970
[Scholarship student of Myeong Jeong]

320
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,190
What is all of this?

321
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,650
How can you just get off like that?

322
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,920
You should've stayed with her until the very end.

323
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,310
Why? Honestly, when girls hear those type of things, their heart flutters.

324
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,760
It's possible that from her perspective, she would've not liked it.

325
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,580
I'm giving her a chance to turn me down.

326
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,090
This is my carefully calculated move.

327
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,050
- You said that she's a nice person.
- If you followed her all the way there, what does that mean?

328
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:23,830
If I just got off after saying that, she'd start to feel guilty.

329
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,160
Then, the next time you'll run into her is...

330
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,450
- The district library.
- What?

331
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,320
That's a love classic.

332
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,610
If coincidences keep occurring, then it will make her feel like it's destiny.

333
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,590
That way, she can't help but accept that it's destiny. Why?

334
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,620
Because she'll want to believe that.

335
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,430
Why can't I do method acting?

336
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,920
I can really end up liking her.

337
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,360
Your eyes resemble Cinderella's step-mother's mirror.

338
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,100
They're full of honesty. I can see everything you'll think about.

339
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,270
It's alright.

340
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:56,450
There was never a girl who could look at me right in the eye because her heart was fluttering too much.

341
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,030
Can you really end up with her?

342
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,160
Are you crazy? What's there to like about her? Just looking at her, I know that she's not my type.

343
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,480
Stop saying weird things.

344
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,420
Why are you still dating Tae Hee? Did your seduction tactics weaken?

345
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,670
Or, do you like her to the point of keeping it a secret from us?

346
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,290
Did you go on the trip with her in secret because you knew that Soo Ji wouldn't like it?

347
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:20,960
What are you saying? Our relationship is bound to end anyway.

348
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,660
How come there's nothing that we have in common? I need something in order to seduce her.

349
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,370
Hey, I really don't want to do this.

350
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,150
You need to memorize it quickly!

351
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:33,490
You should change your door house's password to her phone number ahead of time.

352
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,390
The door house's password is your phone number.

353
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,560
The password is your phone number.

354
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,320
Nice to meet you, Eun Tae Hee.

355
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:54,150
♫ I can feel you anywhere ♫

356
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,830
♫ I can feel you anywhen ♫

357
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,190
♫ Your weary heart,  ♫

358
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,290
♫ I'll embrace it ♫

359
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,200
♫ During the cold days, ♫

360
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,750
♫ One shining star ♫

361
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,830
♫ Me by your side ♫
