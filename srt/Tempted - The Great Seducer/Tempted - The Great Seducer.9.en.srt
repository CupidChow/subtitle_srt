1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,620
I think that I...

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,320
like you.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,260
Do you not regret it?

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,940
One, two...

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,050
[Episode 9]

6
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,340
Everyone must have somebody waiting for them.

7
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,700
Lucky them.

8
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,000
About what time will you get here?

9
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,610
Door opened.

10
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,530
Hey! Why didn't you text me back?

11
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,050
Why text you back when I'm coming anyway? You didn't eat yet, right?

12
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,900
I already ate while I was waiting for you guys.

13
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,600
Oh, really? I guess I'll eat it then.

14
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,070
Hey! I have another stomach just for dim sum!

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,110
- Hey, this is from that Hong Kong place...
- I went and picked it up.

16
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,290
Is this why you were late? Also, you got your credit card stolen. Did you steal this?

17
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,630
Breathe before you talk. My big brother's credit card.

18
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,680
Hey, call Shi Hyun and tell him to come quick!

19
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,230
It's the place in front of his.

20
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,020
I happened to have one empty room, and it was coincidentally this one.

21
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,140
Okay, I quickly cleaned up and also turned on the boiler.

22
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,980
Let's see.

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,030
Why didn't they finish installing it?

24
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,960
Excuse me. I didn't have a chance, so I'm asking you this now. What about a contract?

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,050
I think I'll have to start with meeting the landlord.

26
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,180
Oh, haven't you already discussed it with each other?

27
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,650
Excuse me?

28
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,640
The owner of this building is...

29
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,400
Ah, mister, mister!

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,130
Say hello, he's the owner of the entire building.

31
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,430
This entire building? Wow.

32
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,690
He even charges really low rent for students.

33
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,350
Thank you so much! So, how much is the monthly rent—?

34
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,400
Isn't it time for you to get off work?

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,150
He's a very precise person.

36
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,390
Oh, well... Rest comfortably for now.

37
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,860
We'll talk about your contract at another time.

38
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,830
Thank you.

39
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,010
Then, should we start moving your luggage?

40
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,170
No, it's okay. I can take care of it.

41
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,850
Alright.

42
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,420
If you need anything, come inside.

43
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,080
You know the passcode, right?

44
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,030
Haha, thanks a lot for today.

45
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,120
Why right in front of my place...?

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,060
Ah, geez.

47
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,600
I still look so cool even after going through all that.

48
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,320
Yeah, are you still there?

49
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,580
Okay, I'll be there.

50
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,010
Hey, actually I don't think I can today.

51
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:02,350
Huh? Oh, it was kind of dark and so it was a bit uncomfortable.

52
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,650
Take this and give me the pliers.

53
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,210
No, the one next to that.

54
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,420
The one next to it.

55
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,020
Yeah.

56
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,980
And next to that, cut pieces of the duct tape, five centimeters each.

57
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,280
Duct tape...

58
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,190
No, the black one, that one.

59
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,670
- Oh, this?
- Yeah.

60
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,360
What?

61
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,870
What is this?

62
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,790
Are you doing this because I drank all of it?

63
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,570
Yeah. I can return this to the landlord, right?

64
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,500
Hey!

65
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:23,530
Why did you do something you weren't told to do? You didn't even put on the lid, so why would you return it?

66
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,300
I have to pay three times as much for things like this. It's so expensive...

67
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,160
What are you doing?!

68
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,790
I was crazy.

69
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,150
Ah, for real!

70
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,000
Why did I even bring this?

71
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,220
Ah, seriously!

72
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,990
I've never seen such a klutz.

73
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,850
I can really understand how you broke that grandma's plate.

74
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,860
That's not it.

75
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,320
But still, he's good at drawing.

76
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,630
Was I too harsh?

77
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,880
Gosh, me and my temper...

78
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,180
Just eat. I'm sure things will be taken care of with the secretary there.

79
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,150
Shi Hyun must have been shocked.

80
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,400
I guess he couldn't reply because he was at the police station.

81
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,230
- What's with the alcohol?!
- It's snowing outside.

82
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,210
Shi Hyun is probably starving at the police station, how can you swallow your food? Huh?

83
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,550
You're never serious!

84
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,430
Are you mad? Stop pretending like you are!

85
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,830
You criticize me for never being serious and don't treat me like a person, but

86
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,760
if I was serious, would you be my friend?

87
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,240
This is my way of life. Just accept it.

88
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,660
What would I ever expect of you?

89
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,350
Hey, the food's cold. It's useless to the person who bought it.

90
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,710
This tastes especially good today. Is it from that place I ate at?

91
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,810
Something's different.

92
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,940
Maybe it's because it's snowing, but this tastes fifty thousand times better than eating there.

93
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,550
Hey, just do whatever you feel.

94
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,850
That's you, and the person who accepts that is me.

95
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,970
Whatever.

96
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,580
Use the fork gently! How ignorant. Do you know how precious your wrists are?

97
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,180
But why is it so dry in here?

98
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,840
Seriously.

99
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,350
Soak it in...

100
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,910
Great...

101
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,750
You've become a professional.

102
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,600
Pay me a salary. I'll become your secretary when you become a cellolist.

103
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,310
It's cellist! A cellist! What salary?

104
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,810
I'll get kicked out of my house if I can't earn money.

105
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,120
My father told me to go to college or make money. Should I enlist in the army?

106
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,960
If you guys go to the army, who will I play with?

107
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,180
It feels so empty even when just Shi Hyun's not here.

108
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,560
Get married then.

109
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,750
I have to send you two off, so that I can get married in peace.

110

[Orphism]

111
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,840
Wow... Soo Ji...

112
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,070
What the heck...?

113
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,650
Am I sick?

114
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,990
I got beat up so much that even my hormones have become weird.

115
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,710
Just say that you were moved.

116
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,420
That's not it.

117
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,300
My mom was like that, too.

118
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:26,210
Just once... She teared up without realizing it while listening to my performance.

119
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,460
She was more flustered than I was.

120
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,880
My mom only knows how to work herself to death.

121
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,920
What kind of music I'm performing...

122
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,850
How hard I'm studying...

123
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,110
All she has to do is to listen to me play.

124
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,480
Come out later. Park Hye Jung wants to meet, but I have a lesson.

125
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,420
I can't. I'm super busy.

126
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,180
Shi Hyun, how about you?

127
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,320
I'm extremely busy.

143

They're for new residents. I received them, too. Good job.

144
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,030
"Good job"? Why'd I say that?

145
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,980
Did she put on makeup? She looked cute. No, I must be crazy.

146
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,900
Ugh! No, I don't like this.

147
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,630
Yes, sir?

148
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,130
I should've told you sooner that Madam put the building under your name.

149
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,560
Vice Chairman asked me to look into it when you were moving out. So, I decided on that building.

150
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,930
But, mister, is it true that my mother was in a car accident?

151
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,630
Why are you asking about that all of a sudden?

152
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,350
I found out when I went to the police station.

153
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,380
This car doesn't have any records of an accident.

154
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,140
I'm not sure, then. I'll look into it.

155
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,580
You take care of your friend moving in. Let me know if you need me again.

156
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,060
Aren't you going to see the vice chairman before you leave?

157
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,530
I'll just get going.

158
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,290
The chairman must be particularly fond of art. Rather than painting,

159
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,010
she's more interested in pottery.

160
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,590
Leave it to our team.

161
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,860
Mother has a deep knowledge of pottery.

162
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,180
So, she'd obviously have an interest in pottery.

163
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,340
Take it slow. It'll be a while before Mother will come.

164
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,310
Why are you in such a hurry?

165
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,540
There's so much to study.

166
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,700
I just don't know much about music and art. So, I'm just trying to follow along.

167
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,610
Fine then. If you need anything more, ask Secretary Yoon.

168
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,860
He knows it the best.

169
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,170
I understand.

170
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,780
It's just because I don't know much.

171
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,540
Shi Hyun's mother managed all of that before.

172
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,110
It's fine.

173
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,320
I bought you a necktie and a few things.

174
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,020
I have a personal shopper.

175
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,150
You don't have to worry about these things.

176
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,830
I wanted to.

177
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,730
I'm allowed to do that.

178
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,990
Thanks, I'll use it well.

179
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,740
What do you mainly do on the weekends?

180
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,830
Not much. I work and exercise. Things like that.

181
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,810
What about you?

182
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,990
I listen to the cello and... I'm not sure.

183
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,760
Do you not often meet with your friends? For brunch on the weekends?

184
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,360
For breakfast meetings, I have them about three times a week.

185
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,550
But I've never done social gatherings like brunches.

186
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,350
That's the same as me.

187
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,950
That's true.

188
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,650
I just realized it now.

189
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,430
To be honest,

190
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,780
isn't it a brunch when we meet and eat in the morning?

191
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,290
This week, or whenever it is.

192
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,600
Yes.

193
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,010
There's things I want to do. Like watch movies.

194
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,450
And, one more thing.

195
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,280
Have you ever gone camping?

196
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,690
I want to make food in delicate dishes...

197
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,200
We can have coffee from cups that have folded handles. We can look at the sky, too.

198
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,890
That's unexpected, CEO Myeong.

199
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,430
You asked, so I just answered.

200
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,140
Shi Hyun came and took his car.

201
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,730
What's he been doing?

202
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,220
He seems to be doing well.

203
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,270
I didn't ask if he was doing well. I asked what he's been doing.

204
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,150
Shi Hyun asked about his mother's accident.

205
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,930
By any chance, if there's any situation that I need to know about, please let me know.

206
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,660
- Situation?
- Is there a specific reason why you made Shi Hyun move out—?

207
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,630
I know that I make you handle family-related affairs,

208
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,810
but can't you just do what you're told?

209
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:06,700
Whatever you do, Secretary Yoon, or whoever you meet, I don't intervene.

210
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,550
I apologize.

211
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,920
Eun Tae Hee!

212
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,960
Oh, Kyung Joo!

213
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,060
- Did you bring your books?
- Yeah, I did.
- Look at that.

214
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,530
- Wow!
- Let's go.

215
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,900
[Class of 2018 - Choi Soo Ji (Cello)] 
When I'm entering college, I'm Choi Soo Ji. Will I be Choi Soo Ji when I graduate, though?

216
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,120
Where are you? Are you coming to me?

217
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,110
Coming to you?

218
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,870
I can't right now.

219
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,970
What nonsense is that? Are you coming to me?

220
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,050
Did you sleep?

221
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,570
I've been up.

222
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,150
- What about now?
- Right now... I'm hanging up.

223
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,170
Hey! Hey, hey! Ugh.

224
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,680
I can't believe this... he said he was coming first.

225
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,370
- Do you want to drink today?
- Yeah!

226
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,180
You can't even drink, so why are you saying that?

227
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,840
What's up with you guys? You've been skipping out on bungalow meet-ups.

228
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,800
I got it, I'll be right there.

229
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,680
Don't just wear your jacket. Wear something nice.

230
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,330
What are you saying?

231
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,850
So you can make me feel good, okay?

232
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,620
What am I, huh?

233
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,680
The reason why he suddenly put duct tape on your lips is...

234
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,310
What is it?

235
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,050
It's because you drank all of the drink.

236
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,120
"Let's drink it together." You should've said that!

237
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,740
That's probably true, right?

238
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,690
I'm sure you were hard on him.

239
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,210
Throw away your tool kit.

240
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,470
The fact that there's a woman like you who can even assemble a tank,

241
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,400
men cannot comprehend that.

242
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,730
I wasn't hard on him.

243
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,160
And, it was frustrating, but I kept it in.

244
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,630
Did you say how thankful you were that he helped you?

245
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,920
Oh, I don't know! I'm not made for this kind of stuff!

246
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,440
Has he really not contacted you yet? He's really flirting with you.

247
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,220
But, is it possible for a person to forget about a kiss?

248
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,400
If it was while they were drunk, yeah.

249
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,900
I want to blackout.

250
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,830
We didn't drink though...

251
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,480
It really felt real.

252
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,490
- Did you two kiss!?
- Hey!

253
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,820
Someone might hear.

254
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,250
How was it?

255
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,330
Oh, I don't know!

256
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,920
It's a hundred times easier living isolated.

257
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,630
Choi Soo Ji!

258
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,220
Is the college of music also starting today?

259
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,820
I'm on my way to get my practice room assignment.

260
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,420
Say hi. This is Tae Hee. This is Soo Ji.

261
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,210
Hi.

262
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,100
If you're free tonight, do you want to go to a fashion show? Se Joo might come.

263
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,960
Huh? Oh, me, yeah.

264
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,940
Oh, there's only one ticket left. Sorry.

265
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,400
I have go to work anyway. It's fine.

266
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,140
Hold on.

267
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,280
I'm by the building next to the music school.

268
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,160
Hey, she's way prettier in person.

269
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,360
You're prettier!

270
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,150
Isn't that Kwon Shi Hyun?

271
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,570
- You came quickly.
- Yeah.
- You must've run over as soon as you got the call.

272
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,700
Oh.

273
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,850
You two know each other, right?

274
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,550
Nice to see you here.

275
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,420
Long time no see.

276
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,720
Give me that. Let's get in.

277
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,520
Kyung Joo, you can get in the front. I'll sit next to my instrument.

278
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh, should I?

279
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,520
There isn't a lot of space because of the cello, but let's still ride together.

280
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,570
No, it's fine.

281
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,570
Have fun.

282
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,840
- Shi Hyun, let's go.
- Yeah.

283
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,950
I'm sorry. I'll call you later.

284
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,120
Earlier, when you were putting the cello in the car, everyone was staring.

285
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,970
You two are truly the Visual Siblings.

286
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,650
- Must be nice for you. You have someone who picks you up.
- Yeah.

287
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,750
Shi Hyun's considerate.

288
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,480
Oh, right. Tae Hee couldn't express it well, but she's really thankful.

289
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,480
As soon as she saw you, she was so happy that she almost cried.

290
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,710
It wasn't anything big.

291
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,700
Since it snowed that day, it was tough for you, right?

292
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,150
No, it wasn't anything much.

293
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,480
Shi Hyun, you said you were helping someone move in.

294
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,100
So it was when it was snowing last weekend.

295
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,930
She said he came without saying anything!

296
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,870
Wow! He's so cool.

297
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,590
♫  Starlight is falling ♫

298
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,510
Give it to me. I'll put it at our place.

299
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,850
You must be interested in her.

300
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,100
What's with you?

301
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,810
Then, why'd you lie to us about being at the police station because of your car?

302
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,550
It wasn't a lie.

303
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,040
You told me not to do stuff like this.

304
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,290
Visual Siblings, look here.

305
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,550
Have a good time.

306
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,670
I'll be going, Go Kyung Joo.

307
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,820
It seemed like Eun Tae Hee and Shi Hyun were a bit awkward earlier. I thought he even helped her with the move.

308
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,920
Why is Kwon Shi Hyun playing so hard to get? It's making Tae Hee go through a hard time.

309
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,480
Should we all go on an overnight trip? Then the two of them will get really close.

310
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,210
That sounds pretty good!

311
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,190
But, knowing Tae Hee's personality, she won't go.

312
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:41,800
First, say that you want just the two of you to go. When you arrive, Se Joo will treat you well without making it awkward.

313
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,070
Se Joo's coming?

314
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,030
Of course. The three of us always travel together.

315
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,370
Okay, let's go. I'll ask Tae Hee.

316
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,740
Yeah.

317
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,460
What's this? What's wrong with her?

318
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,170
I saw an angel.

319
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,580
- What?
