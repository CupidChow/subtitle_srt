[Episode 30]

2
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,600
How's Tae Hee? Is she alright?

3
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,580
She won't explain anything to me. I'm sorry for making you come like this.

4
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,300
How can you say that?

5
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,430
What about you? Are you alright?

6
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,890
You should go in.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,410
Honey.

8
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,180
I'll leave Tae Hee in your care.

9
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,360
Don't worry.

10
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,490
The weather's really nice. Because of my daughter,

11
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,440
I get to see your mom and go for a drive. This is nice.

12
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,730
Dad. I'm going to go back to Germany with you.

13
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,120
Okay.

14
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,160
I looked into how to take a break from school.

15
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,790
Okay.

16
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,530
What kind of answer is that?

17
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,190
I'm sure that you thought about it for a long time before you made your decision.

18
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,460
You can also go back to school after resting and continue studying, or transfer somewhere else.

19
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,000
Aren't you going to ask me why?

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,070
Yeah. I'm not going to ask.

21
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,620
Because I know that you're going to get hurt answering it.

22
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm just worried that you didn't make that decision with a happy heart.

23
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
Well, even if that's not the case,

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,300
you can always change your mind later.

25
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,020
You became a philosopher after breaking up with Mom.

26
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,170
I saw how you smiled at Mom earlier.

27
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,220
How can you smile like that?

28
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,450
I wonder how. I'm not sure either.

29
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:22,090
Perhaps, it's because you can't hide the fact that you like someone.

30
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,880
Your feelings are like your muscles.

31
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:33,000
When your liking for someone becomes stronger, it's hard for it to move in another direction.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,320
It's like your body remembers how you felt when you like someone, so it keeps moving towards that direction.

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,790
I can't ignore that yet.

34
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,570
I'm just going to leave it until it slowly disappears on its own.

35
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,450
If that doesn't disappear, then there's nothing I can do.

36
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,670
[Secretary Kim]

37
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,850
As you asked, I traced Ryu Joo Hwan and found a place where Park Hye Jung could be at.

38
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,150
It's in Seoul, right? As expected, where else could she have gone?

39
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,860
Yes. However, the place belongs to Joo Sung.

40
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:30,860
Joo Sung? Alright, I understand. Just text me the address.

41
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,520
If she's not at a hotel in Seoul, you should search the whole country until you find her!

42
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,360
It's already been days since she left and you still haven't been able to find her!

43
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,880
Search for her as if you're looking for lice! Hurry up!!

44
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,090
Is it more important to you that I'm happy or that I get married to Lee Ki Young?!

45
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,900
Mom! You saw him hit my brother and me!

46
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,290
I'm telling you, that bastard isn't even human!

47
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,440
- Stop it, Hyung. Seriously.
 - Hey.

48
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,260
Stop using your phone.

49
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,960
Ah, seriously—

50
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,720
Take your hands off of him right now!

51
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,780
We're just messing around like friends. Why are you being so sensitive?

52
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,980
I'm going to officially break off the engagement.

53
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,680
What?

54
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,690
Mother... I'm going to tell my family what Hye Jung's been doing.

55
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,330
Just do it. Tell them that she has a boyfriend,

56
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,580
that she left home. Just tell them all and try to do something, you fool!

57
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,690
It's obvious how your family treats others when I see you carelessly treat other people's children!

58
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,900
It's better that I found out about it now and broke it off!!

59
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,470
You're going to regret this, Mother. Our side won't take this standing still.

60
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,950
Gyu Jung. Aigoo, my Gyu Jung.

61
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,260
I'm sorry about what happened in the parking lot the other day.

62
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,760
I got too worked up and made a mistake.

63
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,960
Forget it. I'm not here to get an apology from you.

64
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,610
Since I'm not even your friend, I'm not going to be hurt by it.

65
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,770
But did you apologize to Kwon Shi Hyun?

66
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,350
Since you two were friends, I'm sure he was hurt.

67
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,790
We were friends.

68
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,350
Well, I'm sure you two are no longer friends either.

69
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,270
I'm not sure if you heard about it or not, but I found out how you three played around with me

70
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,520
and everything else.

71
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,350
You played around with me, with a plan that you made.

72
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,260
However, because of that plan, your mom's evil past was all revealed.

73
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,600
Also, how does it feel to have Shi Hyun, the most precious person to you, leave you?

74
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,400
Considering how much you played with me, can't you at least tell me this?

75
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,540
You used and played with me like a toy, but I wonder how it feels to pathetically beg in front of me because of what your mom did?

76
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,990
Well, I'm just asking because I'm curious.

77
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,570
But—

78
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,490
I know everything. I know, so stop it.

79
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,240
There's nothing to be scared of.

80
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,960
I don't plan on using people's weaknesses against them, like you do.

81
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,720
But I do hope that you suffer for a long while.

82
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,960
Don't you think that I deserve to say at least that much?

83
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:09,850
You are seriously... It must be nice to be so unwavering.

84
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:15,080
Before you showed up, I didn't know that my love was one-sided.

85
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,660
I realized my feelings too late, but I don't think that's solely my fault.

86
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:28,200
Not everyone is certain of their heart and can do what they want, like you.

87
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,050
I just hope that you know at least that.

88
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:40,430
I'm going to leave. Just like how you desperately wanted, I'm going to disappear from Shi Hyun's side.

89
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:45,410
I'm going to continue living well like nothing happened. I'm going to forget about everything, too.

90
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,170
I wonder if you guys can.

91
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,940
Not everyone,

92
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,730
is certain of their heart and can do what they want, like you.

93
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,240
I just hope that you know at least that.

94
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,560
Tae Hee!

95
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,550
You're okay, right?

96
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,410
Of course.

97
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,530
Did you meet someone?

98
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,520
Yeah, Choi Soo Ji.

99
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,700
Did you beat her up?

100
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,580
Yeah, I did, but why don't I feel any better?

101
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,730
You did well. You did well, no matter what.

102
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,060
Yes, hello, Mother. I also had something to tell you regarding Hye Jung's tutoring.

103
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,340
Tae Hee, has my Hye Jung called you?

104
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,050
What? N-No. What's wrong?

105
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,510
My Hye Jung...

106
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,940
hasn't been coming home.

107
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,530
I'm going to trust you because you're Kyung Joo's friend, but don't go around telling others.

108
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,520
If Hye Jung calls you, make sure you call me immediately.

109
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,070
You must!

110
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,820
Yes. I understand. Yes.

111
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,800
[Hye Jung]

112
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,930
The customer that you're trying to reach has their phone off—

113
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,680
Where did Hye Jung go?

114
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,590
Excuse me, where are all these things going?

115
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:47,190
I'm not quite sure. I heard it somewhere in Icheon. Do you know the owner?

116
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,360
Yes?

117
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,440
The vice chairman is recovering well. You don't have to worry.

118
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,830
Okay, I'm going to change and go straight there.

119
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,840
You should rest some more and come tomorrow.

120
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,560
Ki Young, just as I've always led Seo Won,

121
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,330
I worked hard so that you could climb higher.

122
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:20,030
Wasn't Sam Yeong Foods a better choice than Myeong Jeong?

123
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,520
So then, what is this?

124
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,700
Father... Sam Yeong... they're not normal.

125
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,960
Do you know what kind of humiliation I just went through?

126
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,120
I told you not to behave recklessly without reason!

127
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,980
If you don't have power, even if it's not your fault, it is.

128
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,090
Didn't you realize that when they sued you, even though JK Group's son is the one who beat you up?

129
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:50,770
Apologize to Sam Yeong and get them to break the engagement.

130
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:58,020
With your skills, the only place you can get up to without the support of a family like Sam Yeong...

131
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,390
Don't disappoint me further.

132
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,180
You don't have a fever.

133
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,620
Do you want to get a shot before you go?

134
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,510
No. I'm sure I'll be fine after some rest.

135
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,410
Se Joo's coming, so I'll go home with him.

136
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,170
I have something urgent to talk to you about, ma'am.

137
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,090
You should go home.

138
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,600
Why? What's wrong?

139
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,580
You don't need to know. You should go home quickly.

140
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,730
Assembly Kim Se Cheol has been subpoenaed by the Prosecutors' Office for bribery.

141
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,460
Looks like they'll come to us next, since they're conducting a search and seizure.

142
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,990
You must clear it up now if you have anything to get rid of.

143
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,450
During the evaluation of the controversial new medicine Tiuzen...

144
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,920
It's been brought to our attention that Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol of the National Party has been involved.

145
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,510
Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol has been identified as a suspect and is being investigated at the Prosecutors' Office.

146
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,600
This way.

147
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,550
The Prosecutors' Office suspects that Assemblyman Kim received bribes from the pharmaceutical company...

148
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,230
and confirmed that he pressured the passing of the new medication.

149
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,440
Did something go wrong?

150
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,610
What's going on? What is all this?

151
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,270
It's just an investigation for their reference. It's nothing big. Don't worry and go home.

152
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,440
This is about JK, right? It's not about you, right?

153
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,330
Soo Ji!

154
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,800
Soo Ji, I didn't do anything wrong.

155
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,280
This is about JK. Why are they out of the picture again and you're going through this?

156
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,990
I'll take care of it. Please go home.

157
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,090
My mom and Shi Hyun...

158
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,690
all the people I love are disappearing.

159
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,560
I'm sorry.

160
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,390
Why are you?

161
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,520
You don't even do anything to me, but why are you always sorry?

162
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,790
You're always the one that suffers the most from the three of us.

163
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:03,320
Eun Tae Hee said that she wanted me to suffer for a long time.

164
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,520
And now it's really happening...

165
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,770
Don't think like that.

166
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,570
Let's rest at home. We'll come back first thing in the morning.

167
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,760
Se Joo...

168
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,210
No matter what happens, don't ever feel sorry towards me.

169
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:29,580
Hearing people say sorry... is really sad.

170
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,960
What?! There's no reason for you to be calling me now, don't you think?!

171
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,560
What's with your attitude? I found out where Hye Jung is.

172
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,720
What?! Where is she?!

173
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,280
Be quiet and come out to the address I'm sending you.

174
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,390
I'll see you in a bit.

175
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,650
Don't be nervous. You just need to take Hye Jung home.

176
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,080
A-Alright, Hyung. But don't try to act so scary!

177
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,410
I won't. I won't.

178
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,720
That...

179
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,410
Lee Se Joo, what did you do at Mom's studio?

180
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,680
Come here immediately, before I burn everything down.

181
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,110
I'm eating everything my mom said not to because she thought I was going to get fat,

182
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,800
and I'm not getting tutored. This is the happiest day of my life.

183
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,920
You have to promise to go home tomorrow, Hye Jung.

184
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,630
Promise?

185
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,070
You promised already.

186
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,130
Did they come by to get the dishes already?

187
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,310
I'll go take a look.

188
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,490
Wait a minute!

189
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,330
Door opened.

190
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,810
Park Hye Jung!

191
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,830
You—!

192
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,440
The customer that you're trying to reach couldn't answer. In a moment—

193
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,220
You hit him well.

194
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,100
It's easy.

195
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,840
You, a**holes! How can you drink at a time like this!?

196
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,160
We can go now, Hyung! It also seems like he got really hurt.

197
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,420
This crazy bastard. We have to see Lee Se Joo before we go.

198
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,790
I heard that Lee Se Joo was the one that introduced them to one another.

199
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,010
Ki Young! He's bleeding out a lot, Hyung—

200
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,290
What are you doing?

201
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,470
You're being noisy. Are you stupid?

202
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,840
What is this?

203
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,590
[Lee Ki Young's first love]

204
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,250
"Lee Ki Young's first love"?

205
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,700
What do we have here? What is this place?

206
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,270
Choi Soo Ji, Kwon Shi Hyun, Lee Se Joo, these bastards...

207
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,610
There are even cameras?

208
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,710
Don't come here!

209
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,500
He got hurt really bad. Hey!

210
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:24,120
Did you know Hye Jung first? Or, did you know Lee See Joo and Kwon Shi Hyun first? Huh?

211
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,820
Speak! I'm asking you a question, you punk.

212
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,450
I met Se Joo... and Shi Hyun, first.

213
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,690
I knew it.

214
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,980
They purposely dragged your sister into their plan with a purpose: to ruin her.

215
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,770
No! We met because we're fated to be together!

216
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,490
Shut up, Park Hye Jung!

217
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,720
Isn't it because of you that things turned out like this?

218
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,160
Why are you yelling at your younger sister?

219
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,460
Hye Jung and I are both victims right now!

220
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,420
When is Lee Se Joo coming?

221
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,440
I should call Kwon Shi Hyun here, too.

222
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,100
I have to pay him back, don't you think?
[Door opened.]

223
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,290
Here he is.

224
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,760
Oppa!

225
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,150
Let them go. I'll explain.

226
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,210
Shut up. Since you're here now, hurry up and get on your knees.

227
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:24,230
You locked yourself in here and came up with a plan to ruin other people's lives?

228
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:28,000
Should I call Soo Ji, too? That's right.

229
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,890
You only listen whenever she's around.

230
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,370
You crazy bastard!

231
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,910
That scared me.

232
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,660
[Sa Do Se Joo]

233
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,630
Yeah?

234
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,140
It's me, Ki Young.

235
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,600
Shi Hyun Oppa! Please stop these gangster-like bastards!

236
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:31,020
Hye Jung. I'm going to explain this to you nicely just once.

237
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:37,090
You, me, and Tae Hee are victims.

238
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,260
Just let them go! Hurry up! Hurry!

239
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,050
Park Gyu! Just take them away and get lost.

240
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,870
Hurry up.

241
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,280
You two should have a talk with me.

242
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,810
Lee Ki Young.

243
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,560
Whenever we see each other, this punk always speaks informally to me.

244
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,490
All the evidence is here. Don't even think about calling the police or suing or stupid things like that.

245
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,670
If you do, then your brother's going to prison immediately.

246
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,600
This is something we all did together.

247
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,830
Hey, Hye Jung! Let's sit down here!

248
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,150
Put him down here, Oppa.

249
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,010
Be careful. Be careful.

250
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,550
I'm going to call a taxi, Hye Jung.

251
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,760
Hye Jung... will the two of them be alright?

252
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,680
What should I do?

253
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,810
I'll see what I can do. Ah, what can I do?

254
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,550
Yeah, Hye Jung. Where are you?

255
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:59,360
Unni! I'm at Se Joo's hideout.

256
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,920
- There's a big problem right now!
- What?

257
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,040
What are you talking about? Tell me properly.

258
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,530
Lee Ki Young hit Joo Hwan really bad!

259
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:15,730
We just barely escaped, but Se Joo and Shi Hyun are still inside!

260
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:21,570
Lee Ki Young kept saying that he, you, and I were some sorts of victims or something.

261
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,620
H-Hello? Hello?

262
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,750
What are you trying to do?

263
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,230
That's what I want to ask you.

264
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,690
What were you guys doing?

265
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,580
Let Se Joo go. You can just talk to me.

266
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,820
You're the one that should leave, Kwon Shi Hyun. These bastards won't stop halfway.

267
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,110
Be quiet, you son of a b*tch.

268
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,340
This is something that I started. If you want to take it out on someone, then do it to me.

269
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,100
I have something to pay you back for.

270
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:13,230
If you avoid it or play smart, he'll die.

271
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,460
Do as you wish.

272
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,030
What the heck is with this punk?

273
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,880
Fine. I'll just do what I want.

274
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,240

Don't you think this is enough already? Do I have to hit him some more?

277
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,830
You said I can do whatever I want.

278
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,820
If you're a coward, just take your little brother and go.

279
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,760
What do you want?

280
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,230
For you to know how hideous you are. Why are you asking that now?

281
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:10,710
That's right. Does Tae Hee know about all of this?

282
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,370
Don't bring her up.

283
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,410
This is something that doesn't involve her.

284
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,820
This all started because of me, so why doesn't it involve her?

285
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,060
How can she just call at the perfect time?
[Tae Hee]

286
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,020
Should I answer it? Should I answer it and tell her to come here?

Did you know that Kwon Shi Hyun met with you for a reason?

290
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,190
Hang up, Eun Tae Hee! Don't listen to this bastard!

291
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,880
You should think about it again. Why are you the one that's leaving? Why are you avoiding him?

292
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,260
I'm not leaving because I'm trying to avoid him. I'm just taking a break from my studies.

293
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,920
It's my choice.
[From the person who wants to be a great happiness to you, your girlfriend.]
