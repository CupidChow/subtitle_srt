Shi Hyun's mom got into an accident and passed away while she was on the way to meet your mother.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,630
I won't get involved in whether you guys love each other or not.

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,430
But don't get involved with our family.

Where are we?

We're almost in Seoul. I'll go to Director Myeong's hospital.

- Let's go to the company.
- Just go to the hospital.

14
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,130
I just overworked myself.

15
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,630
The woman earlier told me that you're a person who hides it when you're in pain and deals with it by yourself,

16
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,960
and to take care of you.

I came to tell you that.

I thought my dad was the only one in pain.

33

I thought my dad and I were the only ones in pain.

I also told you so many times to break up with her, but

You know that this is a problem between you and me.

But why must you drag Tae Hee into this situation?

Don't worry. I didn't tell her it was all a game.

93

I told her that I don't care if she interferes with our friendship,

but not to interfere with us as siblings.

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,620
But I'm not happy either.

162
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,110
Eun Tae Hee told me this,

163
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,350
that my heart wasn't angry, but sad.

164
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,660
She said that

165
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,300
I look sad because Shi Hyun doesn't love me back.

166
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,530
What brings you here?

167
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,440
Is this the place? Eun Tae Hee's house?

168
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,520
- What is it?
- Let's go out.

169
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,840
It's so annoying.

170
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,580
They want me to go to a mental clinic tomorrow. It's not like that with me.

171
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,620
It's way better than enlisting.

172
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,920
Honestly, a lot of my family members had to serve but didn't.

173
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,880
I know, right? This punk, you never have gone through anything hard before.

174
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,130
Stop it! Seriously.

175
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,290
Drink up. When you start getting treatment tomorrow, it'll be annoying for you.

176
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,260
Cheers.

177
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,430
What the heck is this?

178
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,260
You're paying tonight, right?

179
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,310
My brother-in-law will. Drink some more, Brother-in-Law.

180
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,950
If you need anything, just tell me.

181
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,850
Just tell me. I know you came to find me because of what I said to Soo Ji.

182
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,690
I'm thinking about getting rid of our hideout.

183
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,210
Alright.

184
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,020
We won't be able to gather like we did in the past.

185
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,850
It was also your place to begin with, so do whatever you want.

186
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,020
You're not caring about it beyond what I thought you would.

187
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,090
What has changed has changed.

188
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,340
Yesterday, Soo Ji and I were in front of your house.

189
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,050
That's when you saw Tae Hee and me.

190
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,720
I don't know the reasoning behind it, but she called me late at night crying.

191
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,760
Maybe she heard something from Director Myeong, but she worried about you and told me to go to you immediately.

192
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,200
That's why I went, but I found out you two live across from each other.

193
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,950
How do you think Soo Ji felt?

194
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:31,280
Honestly, when I saw how you lied to us about liking Tae Hee, I got more confident about Soo Ji.

195
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,830
I was planning on being honest instead of liking her unrequitedly.

196
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,150
But she asked for us to just remain as friends.

197
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,590
What do you think that sounds like?

198
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,990
Because all relationships change.

199
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,680
You know, Choi Soo Ji is usually like that.

200
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,050
She's acting like that because she's is barely holding on right now.

201
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,160
Because if things with me don't work out, it'll be the end for her and so lonely.

202
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,130
Se Joo, I can't even get in touch with Tae Hee anymore.

203
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,630
Do you know what Soo Ji told Tae Hee today?

204
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,030
- I know.
- What?

205
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:14,200
- I knew it from the start, about your parents and Eun Tae Hee's mom.
- Hey.

206
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,220
Then, you should've told me at least—no, you should've done something to stop her!

207
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,100
I warned you many times in the past!

208
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,640
I clearly told you to either end it with Tae Hee or tell Soo Ji how you feel.

209
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,210
You're the one that couldn't do it!

210
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,740
Just what do you expect me to do?

211
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,530
What do I have to do to make you guys feel better?

212
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,820
This is also driving me crazy.

213
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,000
I know that I was wrong at first,

214
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,660
so that's why I was looking for a chance to ask for forgiveness from Tae Hee, but Soo Ji ruin that chance—

215
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,530
Don't blame it on Soo Ji. Don't you know why she's acting like that?

216
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,960
She was the villain for you and Eun Tae Hee, and that was all.

217
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,210
Lee Se Joo. Soo Ji is not the same person I knew from before.

218
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,230
How can you say "from before"?

219
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,450
Who was the one that made her like that?

220
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,060
Do you know how much she had to endure because of you?!

221
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,550
I know. I know that.

222
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,210
However, that's from her perspective.

223
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,360
What did you say, punk?!

224
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,430
Don't ever appear in front of Soo Ji again.

225
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:26,060
If you touch her one more time, I don't know what I'll do.

226
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,700
What the heck? Isn't that punk Lee Se Joo?

227
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,980
It is, it's your brother.

228
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,460
That crazy punk.

229
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,130
This punk talks about nonviolence all the time at home, but look at him here?

230
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,390
What are you two doing?

231
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,880
Why are two best friends fighting?

232
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,830
I'll buy you a drink.

233
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,310
Excuse me—ah, that's right.

234
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,720
Kwon Shi Hyun. This is the bar where you did drugs and fainted that one time.

235
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,390
How can you come back here again fearlessly?

236
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,710
Just leave!

237
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,160
This punk, how can you act like that to your hyung—?

238
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,890
You're pretty skilled.

239
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,960
I'm going to tell you this because I worry about you, Shi Hyun.

240
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,820
But why did you two fight? Is it because of Soo Ji?

241
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,860
I knew this was bound to happen. There's no way opposite genders can just be friends. That's right.

242
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,140
Soo Ji does have her own way of going around flirting and luring men, right? Don't you think so, too?

243
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,890
Don't say her name with that mouth of yours. Just leave already, punk!

244
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,940
I'm not sick, Mom! Mom—

245
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,120
Hello.

246
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,100
Hurry up and greet her.

247
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,270
Hello.

248
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,730
Welcome, Gyu Jung.

249
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,900
[Stress Clinic]
[Psychology Clinic]

250
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,850
I know that your goal is to try to get Gyu Jung exempted from the army,

251
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,260
but our priority is to give him proper treatment.

252
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,040
Thank you, Director Myeong.

253
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,910
I'll trust you, so please take care of him well.

254
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,660
If you need to talk to my cousin's husband, Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol, again

255
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,250
just tell me. I'll do my best in what I can.

256
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,830
Yes.

257
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,300
I saw your results, and from the look of it, there seems to be a tumor in your brain.

258
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,390
Tumor?

259
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:33,030
We'll know more after further testings, but there's a tumor located across your optic nerves.

260
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,470
Even though it's harmless right now, I'm sure that have seen some symptoms already.

261
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,210
I thought that this was a problem that an optometrist could treat.

262
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
Please excuse me.

263
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,340
Director Myeong, I need your help as a doctor.

264
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,870
Please schedule me for a checkup.

265
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,390
What's the matter? Are you hurt somewhere?

266
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,880
I'll tell you the details in person.

267
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,200
Eun Tae Hee! Did you not go home yesterday?

268
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,320
I was working, and I ended up sleeping here.

269
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,380
She didn't go home, so where is she?

270
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,480
Dad!

271
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,730
What's the matter, my daughter? It's morning over there, so aren't you busy?

272
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,490
Your daughter is always busy.

273
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,170
The cherry blossoms at school are so pretty, so I wanted to show them to you.

274
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,770
It's pretty, right?

275
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,760
You're right.

276
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,060
It's even prettier if you see it for yourself.

277
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,620
Ah, that's right! I'm going to Korea next month. Are you going to hang out with me?

278
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,640
What? What for?

279
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,550
I'm going so I can meet my daughter.

280
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,880
I have a few things to take care of, too.

281
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,040
Dad, can I stay with you wherever you're staying?

282
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,160
I would definitely love that.

283
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,520
I was afraid that it would be bothersome to you, so I didn't say anything.

284
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,100
I would love it a lot. But what about the dorms, can you just leave like that?

285
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,430
Of course, I can just tell them I'm going home for a little bit.

286
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,650
Dad! Look at this.

287
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,310
This cherry blossom tree is the prettiest.

288
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,260
Lately, when I go to school, I always stop by here.

289
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,740
Daughter. Are you sure you're showing me flowers?

290
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,130
What?

291
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:23,830
Who's that person behind you? Who's the person that keeps looking at you instead of the flowers?

292
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,490
Is this your way of showing me your boyfriend?

293
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:38,720
Tae Hee, I—I know what happened to you yesterday.

294
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:49,360
I'm not sure how and from what point I should tell you, but I just found out yesterday, too.

295
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,430
About your mother.

296
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,680
Shi Hyun. Let's not talk about things that are hard to talk about.

297
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,860
We found out why our relationship got all twisted, too.

298
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:18,700
Above all, what's important is I know that because of those two we had a very rough time.

299
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,630
I'm really sorry.

300
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,350
Why are you sorry?

301
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:33,030
If I never appeared in front of you, it would've been alright.

302
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,710
You could've lived well without knowing all these things, but because of me, your own world turned upside down.

303
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,220
No. You were the one that told me this,

304
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,500
that it wasn't my fault and that you're alright because you met me.

305
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,440
That's right...

306
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:57,620
However, looking at you right now is too hard for me.

307
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,370
Look at me. Please?

308
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,270
I still have a lot of things to tell you.

309
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:13,950
I still also have a lot of things to apologize for, so please don't turn your back on me.

310
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:28,630
Shi Hyun. Let's stop seeing each other.

311
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,350
No!

312
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,650
What am I supposed to do if I don't have you? Please...

313
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,610
It's because I'm having a hard time.

314
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:48,670
Whenever I see you, I keep thinking that I'll remain feeling like a criminal.

315
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,950
Thank you.

316
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,110
♫ I can feel you anywhere ♫

317
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,810
♫ I can feel you anywhen ♫

318
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:18,290
♫ Your weary heart, I'll embrace it ♫

319
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:22,150
♫  During the cold days ♫

320
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,570
♫ One shining star ♫

321
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:35,360
♫ Me by your side, you by my side ♫

322
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,390
♫  If we get a bit far, I'll hurry to you ♫

323
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:52,530
♫  To where your hands can reach  ♫

324
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,680
♫ In harsh winds, in harsh hardships ♫

325
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,030
♫  When it's hard for you to endure  ♫

326
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:07,190
♫  Lean on me  ♫
