[Episode 18]

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,630
I'm sorry, but I want some time alone.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,190
What?

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,530
♫ You are the tide that brings love ♫

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,880
What is it?

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,960
Drink it. I ordered it for your hangover.

7
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,440
Drink it.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,770
Seeing how you were hit, you must've gone home yesterday.

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,790
You should've just gone home to sleep and then gone to open up the store, why'd you shut yourself up in a hotel?

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,510
I guess someone's there.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,300
♫ Leave that side in morning's come ♫

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,320
You're embarrassed, right? To the point where you feel like dying?

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,610
Is this your way of... paying me back because I kissed you once?

14
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,780
If you repaid me, then you did, but why are you not picking up your phone out of humiliation?

15
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,550
Since I'll be generous and understand you this time, come to your senses and reflect on your actions.

16
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:16,310
You can't even contact Shi Hyun well after something happens to him. But, with me, you do it so easily.

17
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,320
♫ You are the time of the  ♫

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,890
Hey, Lee Se Joo, just like you always said, it doesn't make sense for something like love to exist between us.

19
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,670
You said it yourself.

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,220
"Instead of dating and crying, just sleep with each other one day and forget about it. Hey, it isn't going to work."

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,650
♫ With me, you'll ♫

22
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,000
What did I do to you?

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,700
Huh?

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,710
Why are you laughing? I didn't hear you.

25
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,380
No, it can't happen.

26
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,940
Then... do you want to sleep together once and forget it?

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,090
Should we go up?

28
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,500
There are jokes that can't be made between us.

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,820
As I saw this being painted, I felt better after being sad.

30
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,650
Mr. Artist, you don't look like you're too happy, either.

31
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,650
Is that pretty girl doing alright? Your girlfriend, that is.

32
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,350
Yes, she's doing well.

33
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,780
There must've been something sad that happened between you two.

34
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,930
You just know when you get older.

35
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,740
There's something that I feel so sorry about towards her.

36
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,180
Try apologizing.

37
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,700
A man who apologizes properly is a cool man.

38
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,520
It's something that I can't apologize for.

39
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,400
There's something I want to get an apology for.

40
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:27,660
I learned that the person I like has been hiding something.

41
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,900
Isn't that funny? That I feel terrible because of someone I like at this age?

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,400
What was it like after you learned about it? Were you mad?

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,180
In the beginning, I thought he tricked me, so I was angry.

44
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,390
But, thinking about the fact that he hid it, I'm sad.

45
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,600
I guess he wasn't able to bring himself to tell me.

46
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,670
If he apologizes, will you accept his apology?

47
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,500
An apology wouldn't mean anything.

48
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,830
It wouldn't have worked out for us, anyway.

49
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm just thinking about it.

50
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,430
If I tell him that I know his secret,

51
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,630
I won't be able to see him again.

52
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,770
There's something I'm hiding from her, too.

53
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,240
If it were me,

54
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,460
I'd tell her everything, or I'd stop before I was caught.

55
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,170
Not knowing about it hurts less.

56
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,450
Hello, detective.

57
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:57,430
Could I know the name of the victim of the hit-and-run incident that occurred two years ago January?

58
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,090
Also, if there were any tip-offs.

59
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,140
I can't tell you because of the Protection of Personal Information Act.

60
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,980
I think the victim is someone I know, so I'm concerned.

61
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,560
I still can't tell you.

62
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,850
Also, I heard something while looking into the case. The victim recovered,

63
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,100
and got into a good university this year.

64
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,520
Okay.

65
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,080
Don't worry. That's all I can tell you.

66
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,660
Door opened.

67
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,020
Okay, thank you.

68
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,600
What call did you have that made you so serious?

69
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,390
It's nothing.

70
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,410
Why did Soo Ji leave her cello behind? Did something happen?

71
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,050
Didn't you call her?

72
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,340
No, why?

73
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,120
Her mom gave a press conference about your dad's company.

74
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,770
For your dad.

75
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,920
I see.

76
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,560
Soo Ji worries about you every day, but you went on a trip. Did you have fun?

77
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,670
How did you know?

78
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,050
Go Kyung Joo, seriously...

79
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,540
It's okay. Soo Ji doesn't know.

80
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,850
Why are you still seeing Eun Tae Hee? Did she find out about one of your weaknesses or something?

81
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,560
What weakness?

82
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,880
Or, did you like her to the point where you had to meet her in secret?

83
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,400
Tell me. Since Soo Ji wouldn't be happy if she found out, isn't that why you kept it a secret and went on that trip?

84
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,790
What do you mean a secret? It won't work out for her and me anyway.

85
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,250
Is this Romeo and Juliet or something? That it's not going to work out?

86
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:50,320
If it won't work out, then you should stop properly.

87
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,580
Don't worry about it. I was going to anyway.

88
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,420
What a bastard!

89
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:10,050
I look forward to it. I'm finally able to see Kwon Shi Hyun's nasty side after a long time.

90
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,960
Is it working well for you and Soo Ji?

91
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,230
We're the ones who it won't work out for anyway, don't you think?

92
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,460
Door opened.

93
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,340
You're all here.

94
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,700
Something's off.

95
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,390
You hit him again, right?

96
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,670
- No.
- No.

97
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,360
What do you mean "no"? Stop hitting him, Choi Soo Ji.

98
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,660
I said I didn't.

99
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,520
Just make up with him already.

100
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,650
This is all because of you. You didn't come on the weekend!

101
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,950
That's right.

102
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,250
Why didn't you come on the weekend? What were you doing? Where were you?

103
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,730
He will answer, so give him some time to take a breath.

104
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,260
He's looking at the big picture of things.

105
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,970
A big picture? Is it something fun?

106
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,540
It's Eun Tae Hee.

107
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,620
I was thinking it wouldn't be, but it was true. You were with her on the weekend.

108
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,670
Did you fool us?

109
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:37,270
The bet between you and me ended, anyway. Do I have to tell you everything?

110
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,550
Why'd the deal end? You still want to know something from me.

111
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,820
You want to know who the woman is, the one that your father's seeing.

112
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,000
You're going to talk about this here?

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,160
Why not? Can Se Joo not know about it?

114
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,170
Are you afraid that it will make your father look bad?

115
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,160
No, it doesn't matter between us.

116
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,680
I'll tell you who the woman is based on what you do with Eun Tae Hee.

117
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,860
It's their business, stay out of it.

118
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,070
Both of you.

119
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,350
I already found out, so how can I do nothing about it?

120
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,590
That isn't really what we'd do, right?

121
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,970
But, I'm curious about

122
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,150
what Eun Tae Hee's expression will be when you abandon her.

123
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,930
Did you like her a lot?

124
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,220
If you're not sure, just meet her for a bit longer and then break up. I think that'll be more fun.

125
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,030
There's no need to drag it out like that.

126
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,300
But, this doesn't involve Eun Tae Hee.

127
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:59,010
I'm making a decision whether you tell me about that woman or not. I will do it my way.

128
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,530
I'm sorry. Please believe me just this once.

129
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,510
You know I'm your chest of secrets, right?

130
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,360
Mom.

131
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,090
What do you want me to do?

132
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,150
I'm asking you for this favor.

133
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,300
I have something to say to you, Mom.

134
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,390
What is it?

135
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,320
Isn't Aunt Mi Soon's husband still staying at the hospital?

136
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,450
I heard that the hospital bill was expensive.

137
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,640
Lower your voice.

138
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,610
No, I was just wondering if you pay her lot.

139
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,090
I saw that she bought a lot of pottery.

140
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,120
I was the one that bought it.

141
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,330
Why? To give it to him?

142
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,570
No, I was going to keep it.

143
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,520
You don't know this, right, Mom?

144
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,990
Even if you fool everyone else, I can see everything through your expression.

145
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,560
The artist isn't famous, so you're not thinking about selling it later for a higher price.

146
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,270
You're also not someone who likes giving presents,

147
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,350
so I was thinking about why you bought so many ceramics.

148
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:02,080
I figured it out right away after thinking about what the cello means to me.

149
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,920
What would it be like if I lost the last chance I got to perform?

150
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,140
How would I feel if I recorded an album, but someone destroyed it all?

151
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,090
Just tell me how you found out.

152
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,320
I really didn't want to know,

153
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,090
but at the exhibition hall at the hotel we had dinner together,

154
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,390
I saw him alone with the ceramist.

155
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,980
Mom. Let's stop now, please.

156
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,970
It's pitiful.

157
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,760
No, it's not pitiful at all.

158
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,500
You don't need to worry.

159
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,650
If Mom doesn't stop, I can't either.

160
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,010
The deadline for Tiuzen's PMS (post-marketing surveillance) has been extended.

161
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,300
We will be releasing it to the press this afternoon.

162
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,600
That's good to hear. You've worked hard.

163
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,950
You should also tell Myeong Jeong.

164
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,350
How about you call her personally?

165
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,590
I'll take care of it.

166
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,830
Yes.

167
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,350
[Tiuzen's Deadline Extended]

168
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,840
[Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol]

169
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,610
I am Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol's secretary.

170
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,500
Hello.

171
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,580
You see, I wanted to thank him for helping Tiuzen pass the screening.

172
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,320
Is the assemblyman very busy?

173
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,450
He asks that you should try to refrain from calling him on his private number.

174
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,050
What do you mean?

175
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,590
Honestly, JK also benefited from this.

176
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:28,500
Because of this, the assemblyman has gotten into a lot of trouble.

177
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,290
Are you going somewhere?

178
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,930
Yeah.

179
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,920
Are you still mad at me?

180
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,130
I'm not mad at you. I just needed some time to think to myself.

181
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,800
Shi Hyun, I'm going to trust your words as they are.

182
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,980
When you say that you're mad, you're mad. And when you're happy, you're happy.

183
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,260
You know that I'm someone who will take your words for what they are, right?

184
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,040
I'm going to listen to those words exactly as they are.

185
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,790
Okay.

186
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,210
Then, I'm going to go to school now.

187
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,130
Tae Hee!

188
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,360
Do you want to go to school with me? I'll drop you off.

189
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,390
Huh?

190
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:43,430
Also, if you're free later, do you want to meet up?

191
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,290
Yeah.

192
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,830
Let's go.

193
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,020
He drops you off at school and even tells you to meet up for dinner.

194
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,210
He's not mad anymore, then.

195
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,650
I don't think that he's completely over it yet.

196
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,770
He's going to need more time to completely get over it.

197
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,870
It's been a while.

198
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,660
Hi.

199
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,150
Is this our first time seeing each other after the trip?

200
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,220
Do you have a lot of classes left?

201
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,990
No. Our class is over already.

202
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,980
Is that so? Alright, then I'll see you at dinner.

203
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,800
What?

204
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,120
What's this? Is she coming, too?

205
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,140
This won't do.

206
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,160
You should go home quickly.

207
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,820
Do exactly as I tell you!

208
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,680
What is it?

209
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,400
Wear something bright and pretty instead of something dull.

210
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,520
Don't just put on sunscreen because it's bothersome.

211
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,590
I know. I know. You start with the toner.

212
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,550
Please get rid of that old lip balm that you use.

213
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,890
It's because I don't do it a lot, but when I do, I do it properly.

214
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,910
Mom.

215
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm sorry that it's been a while.

216
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,800
You're watching me, right?

217
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,870
But,

218
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,880
if you're watching me,

219
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,730
do you know how much my heart aches?

220
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,630
There are so many things I want to ask you.

221
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:22,550
How could you leave me without telling me anything?

222
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:29,700
During all that time, I never resented you. I never did,

223
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,530
but why did you do that?

224
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,120
I finally found someone that I sincerely like for the first time,

225
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,490
but why did you do that to her?

226
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,590
If you were watching, you should've stopped me from dating Tae Hee, at least.

227
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,660
You should've done something to stop me.

228
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,430
No.

229
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:18,960
Don't feel sorry towards me. It was probably the hardest for you.

230
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:28,890
Before Tae Hee... before Tae Hee...

231
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,330
before we feel more sorry,

232
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,580
I'm going to take care of this.

233
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,820
Can you come to where I am?

234
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,360
I...

235
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,730
You're getting married.

236
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,690
Like I said, you're famous.

237
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:38,290
But, it would've been nice if you'd told me this time.

238
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,740
It's not like it's the second time you're doing this to me.

239
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,870
Why are you getting married?

240
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,200
Do you like her?

241
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,080
No.

242
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,050
I need her.

243
00:20:55,050 --> 00:21:00,420
Then, do well. If you need her, you need to be even more devoted to her.

244
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,870
When you were freer than you are now, you couldn't come to me.

245
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:11,500
In the past, it was just me getting hurt. But, now, our children,

246
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,080
the public eye, your mother who hasn't changed...

247
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,610
How could we be free?

248
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,680
And you and I have failed before.

249
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,400
Let's not do it again.

250
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:35,060
Young Won, I know that I'm a really bad guy.

251
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:43,240
I know this is crazy talk, but... could you just let us meet from time to time

252
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,880
so that I can see you?

253
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,830
Even if it's for just a few months.

254
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,970
No. Then, that makes me so trivial.

255
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,930
I waited for you three times.

256
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,220
The first time, your employees told me about your wedding.

257
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,960
The second time, I waited like a mad woman after you had gotten divorced.

258
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,420
Please go now.

259
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,570
I'm doing it again.

260
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:23,710
I always tell you to go. Even though I knew you'd never listen.

261
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,950
I'll go.

262
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,580
If we missed that many chances in the past, then

263
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,940
we were never meant to be.

264
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,500
But, we met again like this.

265
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:16,190
Yes. But, this is the last time.

266
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,840
I should've listened to you that time.

267
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:27,100
I should've made that the last time, while you still didn't know.

268
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,590
Yes, yes.

269
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,430
♫  To myself ♫

270
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,170
♫  One, don't pick up the phone, you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone. Two, ♫

271
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,150
♫  Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again. Three. ♫

272
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,800
I thought you'd be here.

273
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,430
♫  You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning ♫

274
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,640
You already drank this much?

275
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,000
It was just while I waited.

276
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,850
Did you eat?

277
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,650
Nope.

278
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,810
But, does she know we're coming?

279
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,220
Do I have to tell her?

280
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:26,400
♫  I keep pushing forward, but he keeps pulling me backwards  ♫

281
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,050
You told me to come looking pretty.

282
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,250
It seems like the lights are only shining on you.

283
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,700
Why would he make us meet him here? It looks super expensive.

284
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,090
They probably all meet each other at places like this.

285
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,060
It's Soo Ji.

286
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,980
Soo Ji: Kyung Joo, where are you?

287
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,130
Is it some kind of special day today?

288
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,130
This is an event!

289
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,050
An event?

290
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,760
He probably felt really sorry for you.

291
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,090
You better make sure you act really surprised as if you didn't know anything.

292
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,390
I don't like things like that.

293
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,790
♫  Every day ♫

294
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,140
You'll get drunk before they all come.

295
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,750
Are you going to tell her today?

296
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,180
About what?

297
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,030
That you approached her with a purpose in mind.

298
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,690
Why would I?

299
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,810
Yeah, why would he say that?

300
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,930
Then, you, Hye Jung, and Go Kyung Joo... It's all over.

301
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,660
I don't have any regrets.

302
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,880
What a lie.

303
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,360
Anyway, leave that topic alone. Eun Tae Hee's pride will be harmed enough today.

304
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,380
They've appeared.

305
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,490
♫  I need you  ♫

306
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,490
♫  Flower needs the rain, you know I need you ♫

307
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,250
♫  Guess I'll  ♫

308
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,720
You arrived quickly. Take a seat.

309
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,420
♫  You know I need you ♫

310
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,940
Oh.

311
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,120
Se Joo and I are here because Shi Hyun told us to come.

312
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,130
There seems to be something he's specially prepared.

313
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,370
Soo Ji, you aren't the main character today, so can you sit still?

314
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,480
♫  Guess I'll start it all  ♫

315
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,020
Kyung Joo, you look very pretty today.

316
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,160
You too, Tae Hee.

317
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,550
Thanks.

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,390
♫  I need you ♫

319
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,330
Kwon Shi Hyun. You've gathered us all here. Say something.

320
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,290
Tae Hee looks so pretty today, doesn't she?

321
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:44,930
Shi Hyun, say it. Doesn't she look pretty?

322
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,170
No, it's fine.

323
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,280
Yeah, she's pretty.

324
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,860
I didn't know she was this pretty.

325
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:03,430
But, she looks very uncomfortable.

326
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:09,090
Aren't you uncomfortable? In this situation? In this place?

327
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,720
Those clothes, those shoes, my friends, all of it.

328
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,000
Kwon Shi Hyun, what's wrong with you?

329
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,280
I'm the one who's uncomfortable.

330
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,060
Seeing you here, Eun Tae Hee, makes me uncomfortable.

331
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:34,830
When I asked you to come here, I thought you'd say you didn't want to at least once. I thought you'd ask me why.

332
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,090
But, you didn't even ask a question and ran over here.

333
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,860
It's because you told me to come.

334
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,450
I came because it isn't anyone else. It's you.

335
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,010
I'm not uncomfortable right now.

336
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,630
Really? You and I are truly different.

337
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,560
Where should I start with our differences?

338
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,090
Shi Hyun, don't act like a bad person.

339
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,420
What are you trying to do to me right now?

340
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,670
I'm not acting like a bad person. I've always been bad.

341
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,670
I'm sick of acting like a decent person. Let's stop.

342
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,100
Why are you all doing nothing?

343
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:38,360
Shi Hyun, I know why you're doing this, so let's stop and talk, just the two of us.

344
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,360
You know why? What's the reason, then?

345
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,530
I don't even know who my real father is. I don't want to know.

346
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,890
Se Joo and Soo Ji both don't know.

347
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:56,050
If it was possible, I didn't want anyone in the world to find out.

348
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:03,520
Well, this is something between the two of us, so I can't say it here.

349
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,020
It's fine. Say it.

350
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:30,270
You... By any chance, have you started to dislike me?

351
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:48,220
♫ I should've said I love you first ♫

352
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:55,340
♫ I should've said I was in love with you ♫

353
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:02,480
♫ Now and like this ♫
♫ I wouldn't have regretted it ♫

354
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,390

355
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,070
So, he really is going to pretend like he doesn't know me, huh?

356
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,810
No, he shouldn't be acting like he knows me.

357
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,760
We're over, anyway.

358
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,970
Did Shi Hyun ever like Tae Hee?

359
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,830
I'm sure Eun Tae Hee knows the answer to that best.

360
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,830
You really can't know a person's heart.

361
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,530
How could he do that if he liked her?

362
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,960
It's fine. Don't bring him up in front of me.

363
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,500
- Will I die from not dating someone?
- You said you weren't angry at me!

364
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,260
If you weren't angry, why'd you start disliking me so suddenly?

365
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,870
Why'd you hug me? Why'd you make me breakfast? Why?

366
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,240
Kwon Shi Hyun, you bastard!

367
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,850
♫  Oh  ♫
