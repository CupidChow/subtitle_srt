[Episode 12] 
When I want to be good to him, I will. When I'm sad, I'll tell him.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,290
I'm Eun Tae Hee. I might as well not date at all.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,370
Playing hard to get? I don't do things like that.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,160
Yeah. That's a good attitude.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,480
Hey, if I start to care about him again, just hit me.

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,680
Then, are you going to eat with him tomorrow?

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,260
Yeah. Eat with him?

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,390
Gosh, I'm going crazy. Why can I even hear his voice?!

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,300
♫ No way, what do you mean love right now? ♫
- Oh.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,140
♫ Rather than love, pretending not to know would be better ♫

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,380
Let's eat something good tomorrow.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,180
♫ I probably am a fool for being like this ♫

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,710
I'll see if I have time.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,190
I'll be going. Bye, Go Kyung Joo.

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,650
- Oh, bye.
- Hey!

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,140
Why didn't you tell me? Huh?

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,780
Party A, Lee Se Joo, will

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,280
help Party B, Choi Soo Ji, become a successful cellist through material and moral support.

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,650
Party B will hire Party A

20
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,170
whenever she needs an assistant.

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,790
What's with him scribbling this stuff on my sheet music?

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,050
What is this?

23
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:45,080
[Lee Se Joo - House Arrest, Whereabouts for 23 days] 
I'll be reporting "House Arrest, Whereabouts for 23 Days."

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,530
Five official appointments that you approve of. In order to help him heal his torn lip and sprained ankle,

25
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:56,830
and get a check-up, we will contact Myeong Jeong Hospital and send him over.

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,550
He snuck out and spent the night outside of the house a total of eight times.
[Absent Without Leave, Permission X]

27
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,140
When he went out, he'd stay out for three nights and two days.

28
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,350
In the past twenty-three days, when he should've been shut inside his room, there was only one day that he was confined in there.

29
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,770
Why haven't you died of starvation yet?

30
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,020
How are you looking that good?

31
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,770
Who ignored my orders and gave this punk food?!

32
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,400
Who let him loose to sneak out and run around?! Who was it?!!

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,760
My eldest hyung helped me.

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,600
He gave me a card and a car.

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,280
You did that when you met me at Gangnam.

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,610
You see—he's still young. I thought it was for the best if we wait a bit longer. I apologize.

37
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,290
Let my husband take him to the United States when he goes to the American branch, Father.

38
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,280
I'll take responsibility and search for the school he'll attend there.

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,700
Oh, it's harder to get into college in America.

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,300
And, we should figure out his enlistment first.

41
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,050
Yes. I'll go.

42
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,260
I'll go study abroad. It isn't anything big.

43
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:12,210
But, I'm not really okay with America. The only English words I know are "love" and "sex."

44
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,850
S-E-X.

45
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,740
That's all I know. If I go there, that's all I'll ever do, too.

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,820
Father, Father, Father!

47
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,560
- Father
- Oh, our father!

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,160
Slowly, slowly.

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,110
- Father?
- Oh, Father!

50
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,590
- Father!
- Father!

51
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,160
Father!

52
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,090
It stings.

53
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,130
Brother-in-Law, this is best for breaking a fever.

54
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,590
- Drink it up.
- Thanks, Sister-in-Law.

55
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,760
This looks more like poison.

56
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,190
But, you must be treasured by my brother-in-law.

57
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,490
Why did he give you his card?

58
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,860
I'm really curious about you.

59
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,290
I can't tell if you're a friend or a foe.

60
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,250
You fool. You can't divide this house like that.

61
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,160
That's true.

62
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,400
Oh, also. Don't you think my brother-in-law has a woman problem?

63
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,890
What should we do? If Father finds out, he'll cause havoc.

64
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,470
You must still not know. That's not even considered causing trouble in this household.

65
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,870
It would be an issue depending on how much money he spent. Brother-in-Law is quite generous and brazen on top of that.

66
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,690
Sisters-in-law, please do this somewhere else.

67
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,720
Seriously. Aigoo. Seriously, I can't take this.

68
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,850
Se Joo: What are you doing? Let's go exercise.

69
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,590
Shi Hyun: No, I can't. I have something.

70
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,330
Se Joo: Is it Eun Tae Hee?

71
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,600
Why are you meeting her during the day? Meet her at night!

72
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,950
Choi Soo Ji, Choi Soo Ji! I'm bored!

73
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,660
He-hello?

74
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,260
Tae Hee went to her part-time job. You should go there.

75
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,220
Oh, okay. Thanks.

76
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,860
You should do better. I told you to treat Tae Hee well on the trip.

77
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,650
Huh?

78
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,050
I'm talking about the swimming pool.

79
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,840
Why'd the three of you hang out, including Soo Ji? I sent Tae Hee there so she could get close to you.

80
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,960
The three of us?

81
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,070
Do better.

82
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,070
Detective Kim

83
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,160
Thank you, enjoy.

84
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,880
Kyung Joo: He was looking for you. Kwon Shi Hyun is going there.

85
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,460
Act like you weren't expecting it.

86
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,320
Whether he comes or not, whatever.

87
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,670
- Oh, you're here?
- Yes.

88
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,480
Since your girlfriend kept asking us for a favor, I remembered it.

89
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,660
I looked into it and there was only one car accident

90
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,840
in Jeongeup the night your mother died.

91
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,060
It was a hit and run. The victim was a high schooler. It wasn't your mother's car accident.

92
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,030
I see.

93
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,620
I think you might have been misinformed about your mother's car accident or there might be another situation.

94
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,730
Another situation?

95
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:17,050
- People like us wouldn't know about it. I saw that you're from an amazing household. I was surprised!
- Ah, well...

96
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,360
Anyway, thank you.

97
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,160
Mom! Hurry up!

98
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,680
She's pretty, that Eun Tae Hee.

99
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,120
What?

100
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,320
I came here to drink coffee.

101
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,630
I know that you don't drink coffee.

102
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,520
- Let's eat after you finish up.
- I finish after I eat.

103
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,380
Do you want to go to an amusement park? It opens at night. There's one nearby.

104
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,860
I have a fear of heights.

105
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,490
Do you want to go to a supermarket? You ran out of things to eat at home too, right?

106
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,470
I order online.

107
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,240
Yeah, I'm sure that's more convenient.

108
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,070
Why did you not come until now?

109
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,170
Look at how clean the screen is.

110
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,930
- That's right.
- Let's watch that show.
- Stop changing the channel!

111
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,170
Hey. What has she been up to?

112
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,070
- Look at that.
- Let's watch a drama.
- That's enough.

113
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,820
[Missed call]

114
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,300
Yes, hello?

115
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,920
Ah, Father!

116
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,110
Yes. It's me, Shi Hyun.

117
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,100
What a busy person.

118
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,980
Ah, yes.

119
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,720
I really miss the grandmothers, too. I'll tell her and we'll go together.

120
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,130
Thanks. But why did you personally give this to me?

121
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,440
- Ah, Eun Tae Hee! If you're free when you get off, do you want to go with me and meet the gra—
- Eun Tae Hee!

122
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,050
- Ki Young.
- Eh?

123
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,060
What brings you here?

124
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,630
Will you still be able to work part-time job when you start going to school? Will you be able to manage it since you're majoring in architecture?

125
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,980
I have to. As of now, it's still pretty fun.

126
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:17,530
I just feel bad that my Tae Hee is doing such a low-valued work.

127
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,580
What the heck? What are you saying?

128
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,850
Who does he think he is to say someone else's job is of low value?

129
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,030
Do you want to try working at my law firm?

130
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,890
It's things like organizing documents and case files, and you can work just on the weekends.

131
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,630
I would love that. However, can I really just work on weekends?

132
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,390
Of course. Do you want to go right now to say hello as a kind of interview?

133
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:46,480
Really? You provide meals on weekends, too, right? And minimum wage is guaranteed, right?

134
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,280
What do you take me as? Minimum wage? Of course.

135
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,400
Does he even how much the minimum wage is?

136
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,230
Excuse me.

137
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,390
- Then do you know the minimum wage?
- Huh?

138
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,290
How about you say everything you want to say or just stay out of our conversation completely?

139
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,200
Well, it would be great if you stay out of it.

140
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,740
Just let him be. It's not like we don't know each other.

141
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,540
When is your parents' wedding, Shi Hyun?

142
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,960
Is Soo Ji doing well?

143
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,190
Why don't you just ask her yourself?

144
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,090
Is it strange to ask questions about someone's younger sister?

145
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,880
Either way, I texted her a couple times and didn't get a reply. Is she still upset?

146
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,140
She probably didn't reply to you because she didn't want to get involved with you. Also...

147
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:41,740
you can't just sum up all her feelings right now as her being just "upset".

148
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,610
It's about time for the end of your shift. Let's go. Go change and come back.

149
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,760
- Why do I have to go with you?
- Because we live next door to each other.

150
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,320
- You live next to each other?
- No.
- Yes.

151
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,830
However, what type of relationship are you two in?

152
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,450
He's my friend's friend.

153
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,890
Somehow in some way... We kind of got to know each other...

154
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,700
"Somehow in some way"? Hey, Eun Tae Hee, we're not like that...

155
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,640
Give me ten minutes, please. I want to go to your law firm.

156
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,260
Hey, Eun Tae Hee!

157
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,120
Just leave. I'll see you next time.

158
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,900
- That's what I meant.
- Just go inside.
- Go with her!

159
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,670
Grandmas!

160
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,630
- How could she do that?!
- What was that for?!

161
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,000
Welcome.

162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,340
You came in a black coat again.

163
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,520
You're here?! It was cold, right?

164
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,810
I came because I missed you!

165
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,460
Wow, you got a new TV. It's really nice.

166
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,600
- Where was it again?
- Myeong Jeong.
- They decided to support us from now on.

167
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,650
The director there must be a great person.

168
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,920
Aigoo...

169
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,430
You must've been in a lot of pain when you were younger. We also had no idea.

170
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:05,420
But did you fight with Tae Hee? Why didn't you come with her?

171
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,080
Ah...

172
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,270
I don't know. It seems like she's upset about something.

173
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,440
You should go and ask her to buy you food.

174
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,150
There's a point to this.

175
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,470
Don't say that you'll pay for the food, just ask her to buy you food.

176
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,770
You see, it's easy for people to reject you when you say you'll buy them food.

177
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,680
But if you ask her to buy you food,

178
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,450
their hearts get soft. This is a woman's heart.

179
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,790
- He has a point!
- Wow. There's nothing he doesn't know.

180
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,070
No!

181
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,060
Since Tae Hee is the one upset about something,

182
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,240
you should go and buy her something delicious.

183
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,180
- That's right.
- Here. Take this and buy her something.

184
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,160
What? N-No. No. It's fine. I have my own money, Grandmother.

185
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,110
- Hey, take this!
- Take this, too!
- Here, take it!

186
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,820
I'm really fine, though!

187
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,670
Does your law firm normally interview part-timers in a nice place like this?

188
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,780
Only because it's you.

189
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,060
Let's eat and then talk.

190
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:21,020
When will the others get here? Or are we going to see them at your office after we finish eating?

191
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,800
To be honest,

192
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,610
I was joking around a bit because I wanted to go on a date with you.

193
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,020
If I were to ask you to have dinner with me, you would've said no and just left.

194
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,090
So, it's not a part-time job interview?

195
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,330
Did you really fall for that?

196
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,430
I thought you were annoyed with Kwon Shi Hyun, so that's why you pretended not to know and followed me.

197
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,440
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad. Try and understand me.

198
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,780
Try to understand my feelings because I wanted to treat you out to dinner.

199
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,660
Of course, I feel bad.

200
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:03,560
I also won't accept your apology. By the way, when you apologize, you shouldn't say things like, "if I made you feel bad." You should apologize properly instead.

201
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,210
This is my limit as to how far I'll show you respect because you were my dad's student.

202
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,390
- Eun Tae Hee!
- Sit down.

203
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,040
- Please charge me for one of the portion of the bill.
- Okay.

204
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,460
I should date a girl like that...

205
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,810
As expected, there's no other girl that's better than her.

206
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,480
Hey, I already spent half of my living expenses.

207
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,740
That was enough to pay for so many rooms.

208
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,500
Aish, seriously.

209
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,790
What's with me today?

210
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,030
Hey, Kyung Joo, I'll call you back later.

211
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,130
What should we do?

212
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:22,450
- Wow.
- That's amazing.
- How did she get up there?
- This is really awesome.

213
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,990
Kiddos.

214
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,510
What the heck, Kwon Shi Hyun?

215
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,790
People sometimes need to use their head rather than their strength.

216
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,640
Give me that.

217
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,650
Eun Tae Hee. Hold on tight.

218
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,650
- Wow!
- That's so cool.
- Amazing.
- Wow. That's awesome.

219
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,580
Here. Go home quickly. Your parents must be worried about you.

220
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,140
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

221
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,440
Are you going to keep staying up there?

222
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:00,910
Don't be like that. You should come down and eat with me. Hmm?

223
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,080
What are you saying right now?

224
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,070
Hurry up.

225
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,830
Move! I'm going to jump off.

226
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,990
What? Oh. I got it.

227
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,850
- Hey...
- I know.

228
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,530
Let's go.

229
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,460
Are you telling me to eat all of this?

230
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,610
Of course. You climbed such a tall tree even though you have a fear of heights.

231
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,130
You need to eat to regain energy.

232
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,370
Oh? Those are your drawings. I can take a look at them, right?

233
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,880
This is the first time I've ever shown anyone those.

234
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,800
- Ah, seriously?
- Yeah.

235
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,640
What sorts of things did you draw?

236
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,630
This and that. Things I like.

237
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,320
Don't have high expectations.

238
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,570
Will you draw me later, too?

239
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,380
No. I'm not good at drawing.

240
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,520
Wow. You drew this really well.

241
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,760
This must be your mother.

242
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,760
How much do you like him?

243
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,890
To the point where our parents can't ever find out.

244
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,210
That was a really stupid question...

245
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,870
[Dad]

246
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,590
I have to pick up my dad's call, so...

247
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,520
Oh. Okay.

248
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,080
Dad!

249
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,730
Okay! Here's the bathroom!

250
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,470
And...

251
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,740
This is my bed!

252
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,740
- And... This is my desk.
- Wow!

253
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,080
That's pretty nice. I feel more at ease now.

254
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,000
Why? You don't need to worry about anything.

255
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,880
Mom's doing well, too.

256
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,660
Is Mom's exhibition going well?

257
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,320
You heard about that, too? Do you call each other?

258
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,220
No. It's nothing like that.

259
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,540
Did you search her up again? What for?

260
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:05,180
Just because... I was happy to hear that she's finally working again after a long time. Well, I want to support her, too.

261
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:11,140
I'm going to send this to you, so give them to Mom! Don't tell her it's from me.

262
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,780
Hey, Daughter. Don't you remember that your mother loves coffee blends?

263
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,350
That was all there was, Dad.

264
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,670
She only liked you because of the coffee blend you made.

265
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,710
She only used you to get over her broken heart.

266
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,840
That's also why she had me. Did you forget everything?

267
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,250
Still, your mom stuck by my side.

268
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,440
She was just an empty shell, but why do you still miss her? Why are you the only one like this?!

269
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,840
That's why you're the only one that's left with a shattered heart!

270
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,040
You were basically burned to ash!

271
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,290
You were the one that said this, right? "It's fine because I like you."

272
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,190
"You can slowly give me a reply because I don't mind waiting."

273
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,520
But in the end, did you get a reply? You never got one!

274
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,370
It's okay. You don't have to answer right away.

275
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,800
I... think I like you.

276
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,790
At this rate, I deserve a 100.

277
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,710
Eun Tae Hee, I—

278
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,060
I want to stop now.

279
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,760
What are you talking about?

280
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,740
It's too hard.

281
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,390
I was thinking about this during the trip.

282
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,630
How I want to be a friend that's like Soo Ji and Se Joo to you.

283
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,680
Fortunately, we can never be like that... because we met each other too late.

284
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,180
But that wasn't the thing that was giving me a hard time.

285
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,900
It's not that I want to be a friend to you like Soo Ji and Se Joo.

286
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,660
It's because... I wanted to be your girlfriend.

287
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,370
You asked if I was going to regret it or not, right?

288
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:26,220
Well, I regret it... about going on a trip with you and staying behind when I wanted to go back to Seoul.

289
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,800
I regret everything from feeling happy just looking at you and telling you that I like you.

290
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:39,180
You weren't pretending to be a bad person. You just didn't like me in the first place.

291
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,970
I realized it too late.

292
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,030
No.

293
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,990
I want to take pictures of you, but why aren't you like that?

294
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,550
Why don't you hold onto my hand first?

295
00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:00,800
Why do you make me wonder if our first kiss was a dream or not?

296
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,300
Why do you run over whenever Soo Ji calls, but forget all the plans you make with me?

297
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,160
Why do you make me ask you all these questions?

298
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,460
See? You're being very vague while you're holding onto me like this, too.

299
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,540
What... did Soo Ji tell you?

300
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:33,570
I don't like people that seem strange. I also don't like having a one-sided relationship.

301
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,370
And I'm just talking about the two of us right now.

302
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,570
Not giving a thought to whatever Soo Ji said.

303
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,400
Leave.

304
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,460
Let's go to my house and talk.

305
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,260
