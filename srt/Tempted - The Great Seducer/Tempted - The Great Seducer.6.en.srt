[Episode 6]

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,180
You need to put this here. Here. Let me teach you.

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,080
It feels like the morning sun rose in this nursing home.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,380
These type of guys are called "eye candies."

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,480
Just looking at him makes me happy!

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,670
Here you go!

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,460
Why did you bring your handsome boyfriend just now?

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,520
He's not my boyfriend.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,130
I should take this, too.

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,070
This is singing class with Tae Hee!

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,770
- Let's go!
- I love this song!

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,380
♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,360
♪ What's wrong with my age? ♪

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,870
♪ It's a perfect age ♪

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,520
♪ to fall in love ♪

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:14,530
♪ One day, when I look at myself reflected in the mirror ♪

17
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,220
♪ I'll tell myself time just flies ♪

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,620
She's having fun all by herself...
♪ What's wrong with my age? ♪

19
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,570
♪ It's the perfect age to love! ♪

20
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,700
She's pretty when she smiles.

21
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,390
I must be crazy!

22
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,400
I can't think straight now.

23
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,900
Hey, Choi Soo Ji! I think I'm about to die!

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,030
What now, what is it!?

25
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,010
Let's come up with a different plan, okay?

26
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,430
I don't think this is right. This place is weird.

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,940
- What's with both of you today?!
- You can't put me under anesthesia? Really?

28
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,270
No, I can't. Please stay still.

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,700
Seriously?

30
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,740
Wait, wait! Soo Ji, Soo Ji, Soo Ji!

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,030
Sit properly!

32
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,010
I thought about it a little—

33
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,390
Hello?

34
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,470
I should just run away—AH!

35
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:11,060
- You're following our Tae Hee around everywhere. Qhat are you going to do with her?
- Huh?

36
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,240
Ah... I'm just here to carry the cabbages.

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,210
Don't even think about lying to her, especially since she used to be a shaman.

38
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,650
- Kiddo.
- Yes?

39
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,990
That's too much...

40
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,070
Your face has some value...

41
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,470
I'm just a friend.

42
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,550
Why waste your time if you're just her friend?

43
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,470
- Did you look at him carefully?
- Let me take a look at his ears.

44
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,400
My ears?

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,710
Tae Hee said she is going to Seoul National University.

46
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,460
Then, you must be going to Seoul National University, too?

47
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,230
I'm not going to attend college.

48
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,410
Our Tae Hee is such a smart girl.

49
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,590
- Then, you're not good enough for her.
- What's wrong with cabbage delivery?

50
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,440
- Cabbage?
- Kiddo. You should live with confidence, alright?

51
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,910
Guys are all about their looks.

52
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,760
Yes, looks.

53
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,360
That's true, too. A diploma is good for nothing.

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,230
Even when a woman feels angry,

55
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,100
a face like this, a chest like this, and a butt like this

56
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,970
will make her cool down instantly. Don't you think?

57
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,880
You're right!

58
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,000
What did I just go through?

59
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,200
I really don't think this is right.

60
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,920
- Oh my gosh
- You, forsythia.

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,000
Pardon? Did you just swear at me?
(the word she said sounds like bastard/jerk/etc.)

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,280
Forsythia.

63
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,030
- Oh, the flower. Forsythia the flower...
-Yes.

64
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,820
There, it's finished.

65
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,960
- Where have you been?
- Pardon?

66
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,190
Why did you finally only come now?

67
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,060
I thought you were dead!

68
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,740
What's going on? Why is she crying?

69
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,090
She wanted me to draw a forsythia and then...

70
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,030
Who told you to do that?

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,720
Grandma, it's alright. I'll make another one for you.

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,140
He left.

73
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,240
He picked a flower for me, then just left.

74
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,060
Madam, you saw your husband again, didn't you?

75
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,880
You've been seeing him quite often these days.

76
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,090
- I think I did something wrong.
- Hmm?

77
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,470
It's nothing like that. Don't worry about it.

78
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,800
She has been like that lately.

79
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,610
Your friend must be very surprised. Take him out to rest.

80
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,840
Let's go. Don't bother her.

81
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,770
Where are you going again, husband?

82
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,170
Wait a minute.

83
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,050
I'll be right back.

84
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,560
I'll leave for a moment and come right back.

85
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,640
I promise.

86
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,570
Okay...

87
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,650
Thank you for the meal, Father!

88
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,210
- Eat up!
- You're here?

89
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,160
Great job today!

90
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,400
Thank you!

91
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,040
Take this home and eat.

92
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,360
Oh? No, it's fine. You shouldn't give us this.

93
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,840
Just take it. Thanks to you, we were able to make delicious kimchi.

94
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
- That's right.
- Give it to me.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,820
- Aigoo! Be careful.
- You should dress more comfortably next time.

96
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,330
Don't wear the black coat.

97
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,880
I don't want us to overlap.

98
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,910
- Then, we're going to leave now.
- Okay!

99
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,410
- Take care!
- Good-bye!
- Bye!

100
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,960
- Be careful on the way back.
- Good-bye!

101
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,830
- Good-bye!
- Okay!

102
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,190
Come back next time!

103
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,940
Bye!

104
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,480
I'll let you off just this once.

105
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,550
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

106
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,640
Go ahead.

107
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,150
No, it's okay.

108
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,930
I'm here already.

109
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,450
Oh, alright.

110
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,920
Good-bye.

111
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,760
Eun Tae Hee.

112
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,550
Do...

113
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,050
you want to eat with me?

114
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,240
I'm not quite sure.

115
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,050
I'm going, then.

116
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,510
- Hey!
- Oh!

117
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,620
- You should eat it.
- Oh my. This is so heavy...

118
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,310
I don't need any kimchi since I'm moving into the dorm soon.

119
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,620
Then I'll call you instead of waiting at the bus station.

120
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,350
No, don't.

121
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,380
If I made you misunderstand, then I'm sorry. I'm also sorry for speaking harshly to you.

122
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,730
However, I'm not going to meet you anymore.

123
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,860
Do you hate me that much?

124
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,970
It's because my friend likes you.

125
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,580
And you?

126
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,850
How do you feel?

127
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,940
It just turned on.

128
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,530
I'll enjoy the kimchi.

129
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,090
Go inside. It's cold.

130
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,010
It was a great performance to watch. They drew blood for a check-up and he's acting like he's dead, as if they took out a lot of blood.

131
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,540
They took about this much out. My whole world was spinning around.

132
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,260
I even asked my mom to get him to leave.

133
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,230
What are you doing? Come here!

134
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,720
I'm tired. I'm going to eat and then I'm going to sleep for two days.

135
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,090
Did you really not eat together because I told you not to?

136
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,530
You're doing well, Kwon Shi Hyun.

137
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,860
I did a great job. Yeah...

138
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,340
The grandmas love me.

139
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,280
You should do that much if you think of me. Don't you think?

140
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,670
That's right. Go Kyung Joo likes Se Joo.

141
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,850
Isn't that ridiculous?

142
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,560
Wow!

143
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,800
My friend likes you...

144
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,580
It wasn't me, but Se Joo?

145
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,260
Have you been well, Se Joo?

146
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,960
I was in a bit of pain.

147
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,780
I see...

148
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:15,160
No wonder you look a bit different.

149
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,180
Oh, Se Joo! It's been a long time.

150
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,090
Han Na Noona.

151
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,870
- Did you just get back from somewhere?
- Oh, I went on a trip.

152
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,880
You got a bit tanner. How did you get even sexier?

153
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,450
Are these your friends? Let's go have a drink.

154
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:57,180
"Boil 500cc of water." How am I supposed to know how much 500 cc is?

155
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,240
Let's see...

156
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,520
Hello?

157
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,590
Uh, do you know how much 500 cc of water is?

158
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,660
Are you eating ramen?

159
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,700
Yeah.

160
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,540
Ready, ready, go.

161
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,700
Stop!

162
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,690
- Is it boiling?
- Yeah.

163
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,980
Then, add the soup packet.

164
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,310
Adding.

165
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,310
Put in the flakes.

166
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,390
It's tastes better if you break the noodles in half.

167
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,080
Are your noodles already cooking?

168
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,650
Yeah.

169
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,940
I have to wait a bit because the gas at my house is weak.

170
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,820
You're following along, right?

171
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,520
Of course.

172
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,020
Do you have a pint of milk?

173
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,480
Yeah, I bought some today.

174
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,120
You can measure the water with that.

175
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,100
Oh, I'm an idiot.

176
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,040
I can't measure water for ramen well either.

177
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,580
Enjoy your food.

178
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,820
Huh? Oh. You, too.

179
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,410
She can't hang up. She can't.

180
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,880
Wow. Amazing.

181
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,340
Unbelievable. She rejects me because of Go Kyung Joo?

182
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,270
We should've eaten together.

183
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,090
I want ramen, too.

184
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,680
Okay.

185
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,450
Cheers!

186
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,300
Unni, what are you doing? I got permission to go outside, can't you hang out with me?

187
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,480
She always end everything with "can't you?". It's so burdensome.

188
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,100
Sure, when?

189
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,200
You have to drink more. Do one shot.

190
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,780
Noona, you can really hold your alcohol.

191
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,880
- Now that he's not trapped in his family's hand, he's getting all excited.
- Love shot? Okay.

192
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,380
I should've left when Kyung Joo left.

193
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,560
Of course. I'll feed you one. Now you should give me one, too. Quickly. Quickly.

194
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,210
I'm leaving, okay?

195
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,890
It's so delicious.

196
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,130
- It was amazing.
- Was it yummy?
- If you do it, it's the best.

197
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,540
Oh? Why are you leaving already?

198
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,090
Move.

199
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,460
I know a good place.

200
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,440
Let go while I'm still being nice. My hand is very precious to me.

201
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,140
You should come with me.

202
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,240
I said let go!

203
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,720
Let go!

204
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,480
- What the heck?
- What just happened?

205
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,920
Wasn't he too much?

206
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,960
- What the heck?
- What did he do?

207
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,650
He should've been careful.

208
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,050
My mouth...

209
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,900
Thank you.

210
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,760
What did you do that for? You always said you hated violence. Let me take a look.

211
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,370
Then, am I supposed to just stay put?

212
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,790
When it's a chance for me to get beaten up?

213
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,900
How many times should I visit the hospital? He should've punched out a molar...

214
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,480
Hey, you crazy bastard!

215
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,360
No—it's just that you get beat up at home...

216
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,380
I was upset since you also get beat up in public, too. Did that hurt?

217
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,470
Please hit me somewhere where it shows up.

218
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,550
Look at my ribs. My ribs... My ribs are completely fine.

219
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:14,090
What should I do? What should I do when all my bones are so strong? Huh? I don't even feel any pain.

220
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,770
- Ah! Seriously! Ugh!
- Hey.

221
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,800
Go home immediately!

222
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,100
I got it.

223
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,720
Apply it to your wrist before you go to bed.

224
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,590
You should use it. I'm fine.

225
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,730
Listen to the person who gets beat up all the time. It's going to hurt tomorrow.

226
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,750
You have to go home right away. Don't get beaten up somewhere else.

227
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,480
I said I get it. Please drive her safely, sir. Go!

228
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,860
Hey, rice.

229
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,770
It's going to get on your hair. Eat slowly.

230
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,990
How could he not notice this? How can he not?

231
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,540
Did he not notice that you got a perm?

232
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,660
Yeah! It was really dark in there, but

233
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,060
he noticed a girl like "this" had gotten a tan. What did I say? Men...

234
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,390
"...are visual beings. If they care, then they will immediately—"

235
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,320
You cut your hair. It's cute.

236
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,830
"—notice." Right?

237
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,040
He's probably sweeping the club and smiling here and there.

238
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,710
No. He's eating ramen right now.

239
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,210
What are you saying? Are you dreaming?

240
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,700
You said you met him today?

241
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,280
That's what I've been saying. Do you have any kimchi?

242
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,190
No. He's eating ramen at home right now.

243
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,240
What do you keep saying? How would you know if Lee Se Joo is eating ramen or drinking?!

244
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,780
Lee Se Joo? Hey! It wasn't Kwon Shi Hyun?

245
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,190
What?

246
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,780
Then the person you like is...?

247
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,180
- Oh my god!
- Oh my god!

248
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,680
Hey! I definitely said that he's the most handsome one!

249
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,160
Kwon Shi Hyun is the most handsome guy in there to you, right?

250
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,320
Hey! Just try asking anyone on the street. Is this the picture?

251
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,510
It's a three-year-old pure love.

252
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,800
Alright. Then, what are you going to do with Lee Se Joo?

253
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,550
What do you mean? No matter how much I think about it, this hairstyle isn't his type.

254
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,960
Hey! That's not right.

255
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,850
You should style your hair the way you want to. Why get it done again?

256
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,940
Forget it, look at who's talking. Even if I were to say I do like Kwon Shi Hyun,

257
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,030
why do you care? It's enough if you like him.

258
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,260
You cried.

259
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,060
That... anyway, don't try to make me an excuse.

260
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,800
What about you?

261
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,180
This is my first time seeing you ever being remotely interested in a guy.

262
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,620
How do you feel?

263
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,570
What about you?

264
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,130
How do you feel?

265
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,370
My heart just feels a bit lighter.

266
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,850
I'm here.

267
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,160
You must've forgotten what your adorable youngest son looks like.

268
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,370
I'm sorry. I was a bit busy.

269
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:08,920
Well, it's just that I'm too popular. You know that, right?

270
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,590
I'm going to sleep next to you tonight, Mom.

271
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,500
Mom, I punched someone today.

272
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,970
Do I take after Dad?

273
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,420
I really hate it though.

274
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,030
They didn't even tuck you in properly.

275
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,100
It's my fault, right?

276
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,940
Mom.

277
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,920
Please get up and scold me.

278
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,160
Get a proper check-up once you finish your lesson.

279
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,510
This is good enough.

280
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,120
Do you want to study abroad? I'll let you go if you want to.

281
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,570
Once you come back after a couple of years, everything will have settled down.

282
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,500
You would get everything,

283
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,060
and I would lose my friend, family, and everything else. Is that considered settled?

284
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,700
How are you losing everything?

285
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,620
Don't you know? How hard I'm trying to protect everything?

286
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,450
Se Joo got hurt because of me.

287
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,960
Tell their secretary's office to bring him to the hospital.

288
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,170
Also, Hye Jung needs a math tutor. Introduce her to my tutor.

289
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,350
What are you doing?

290
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,460
A deal with you. You told me not to be late.

291
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,730
I'm not talking about that. What have you been doing lately?

292
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,560
Socializing, developing friendships, making friends, and things like that. So what?

293
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,040
There would only be people around here if we have a party, and I have to give them presents to make them come.

294
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,370
That's how it has always been up until now.

295
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,150
I'll show it to you.

296
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:34,710
The way to obtain everything without doing all that work.

297
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,870
Why are you standing outside? It's so cold. You should've gone upstairs.

298
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,280
You treat me as if we're siblings.

299
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,060
Give me your hand.

300
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,300
Are you alright? Does it hurt?

301
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,140
This is normal. You're asking me if I'm alright before asking what happened.

302
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,960
I heard someone was trying to hit Se Joo, so you hit them back.

303
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,900
- What?!
- Let's go.

304
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,550
Let's go!

305
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,090
This way I won't be hungry later.

306
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,510
Okay. Eat up.

307
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,600
Are you coming later?

308
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,080
No, I have somewhere to go.

309
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,080
She told me to study abroad today.

310
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,900
She told me that everything will be settled once I get back.

311
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,670
Do you think,

312
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,610
that my mom and your father really like each other?

313
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:55,900
Then, in that case, even though we're siblings, don't you think we will be able to live like friends?

314
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,180
You're only saying that because you don't know my mother.

315
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:04,140
What? Does it sound quite alright if you have the prettiest girl in the world as your sibling?

316
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,580
What? Did you decided to give up being the prettiest wife in the whole universe?

317
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,640
Ah... look at this. I told you to be careful with your hand. You always have a bad temper.

318
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,300
Hey, I—only use my fists because you act like these words are nothing at all.

319
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,810
You looked so down just now.

320
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,800
Don't...

321
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,480
feel sorry towards me because of your mom.

322
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,090
I know. Just make sure to not get on your dad's bad side too much. As for me, I'll try my best to stop my mom.

323
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,800
Okay.

324
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,760
At this rate, you'll really get kicked out.

325
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,130
What kind of conversation is this?

326
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,960
Even though we're twenty years old, nothing changes.

327
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,300
I like this.

328
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,140
Can I lend you a hand?

329
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,330
Sure.

330
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,110
Where's the cabbage delivery guy?

331
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,880
Did he not come with you today?

332
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,080
Cabbage delivery guy?

333
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,980
Your boyfriend.

334
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,560
Ah! I told you, he's not my boyfriend, Grandma.

335
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,270
Did you two have a fight? Put him on the phone.

336
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,030
How can she call him first?!

337
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,030
Don't ever do that, okay?

338
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:21,340
Aigoo! Maybe it's because we gave him a hard time for not being able to get into a college?

339
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,620
That boy... He was so shiny and pretty as he could be. He was so handsome and...

340
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,340
Just wait.

341
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,070
♪ He's coming... ♪

342
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,600
- Is your drawing and counting some sort of fortune-telling?
- ♪ He's not coming... ♪

343
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,270
- Is that so?
- Aigoo...

344
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,920
He's coming. He's coming. He's coming.

345
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,380
The restaurant is this way, though.

346
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,850
You came just on time.

347
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,780
Don't you think it's too quiet?

348
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,990
When the silence kicks in, it's going to get extremely awkward.

349
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,220
Your exhibition is almost over.

350
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,880
The flowers are withering, and the daughter that you've been waiting for isn't coming.

351
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,000
She doesn't have to come. I'm just grateful for her mere existence.

352
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,010
What are you thankful for? The fact that she sheds your heart whenever she does come?

353
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,420
It's her way of letting her anger out.

354
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,870
She should cry, smile,

355
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,380
and even yell.

356
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,570
I'm thankful she's doing all of that right now.

357
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,760
Unni, a trauma isn't necessarily something that happens in a big way.

358
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,140
Just all of a sudden, one day.

359
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,770
You just focus your mind on that one wound.

360
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,760
You can't move forward or backward.

361
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,430
You just stop and are unsure of what to do.

362
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,810
That's what happened to my Tae Hee when her father and I divorced.

363
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,800
When she had to come back to Korea by herself, too.

364
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,720
Because of me,

365
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,680
that car accident happened, too.

366
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,440
It's not because of you. It was just an accident.

367
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,130
That's why, whenever she stops by each time and say those things,

368
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,080
I'm thankful for it more than anything else.

369
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,650
No matter what, saying our good-byes properly,

370
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,170
is very important. Don't you think?

371
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,540
Stop thinking about your daughter's feelings.

372
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,590
You should take care of your feelings, too.

373
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,830
Let's clean up!

374
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,460
Why are you comforting me all of a sudden?

375
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,770
I forgot all of those things.

376
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,800
Young Won.

377
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,200
Let's call him later. Something urgent must have come up.

378
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,750
I'm leaving for a moment.

379
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,390
I'm not anywhere.

380
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,130
Hello.

381
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,910
You're going to fall over at this rate.

382
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,910
What are you doing here?

383
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,440
It was you who sent it, right?

384
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,300
I shouldn't be addressing you informally anymore.

385
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,220
I just wanted to come.

386
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,060
That's why I sent it.

387
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,650
You should have a cup of tea and leave.

388
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,840
Young Won.

389
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,330
I missed you.

390
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,670
A lot.

391
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,200
Why are you here today?

392
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,090
Ah, that's right. You promised Grandma that you would come back.

393
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,620
Right?

394
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,570
I...

395
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,280
came because I want to know how you feel.

396
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,500
I'm not sure what kind of person are you.

397
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,800
Don't you want to find out?

398
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:24,130
I do, but... I'm a bit scared.

399
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,570
I too

400
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,470
am scared.

401
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,420
Why?

402
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,580
Because...

403
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,510
I might hurt you.

404
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,550
I'm sorry.

405
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,180
[Tempted]
- Preview -

406
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,930
I'll wait and take you home. Should I carry you?

407
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,640
Let's go together!

408
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,430
- She likes it.
- Could he tell that my heart was fluttering?

409
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,890
If we broke up twenty years ago and missed countless chances over the years, then we're just not meant to be.

410
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,410
But we met each other again like this.

411
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,540
Did I get caught

412
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,780
liking you?

413
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,880
You can answer me slowly.

414
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,060
I think I like you.

415
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,100
Do you regret it?
