She's probably more shocked than you are. Let's just go.

4
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,210
Are you alright?

5
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,800
Wait a moment.

6
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,300
Can you stop the car for a little bit?

7
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,570
I'm cleaning out our hideout right now. Come and clean up with me.

8
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,700
There's a lot of things that I can't seem to get rid of.

9
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,460
Soo Ji?

10
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,420
Hello?

11
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,770
What's wrong? Are you crying?

12
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,790
Se Joo... I really...

13
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,330
I think I really ruined everything.

14
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,970
I'll go there right now. Just stay where you are.

15
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,890
From what point did everything go wrong?

16
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,030
I want to put the blame on someone, but there's no one to blame.

17
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,730
Even if I explode and tell my mom that it's all her fault, it only hurts my heart more.

18
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,990
How can Soo Ji and her mom do that to you?

19
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,260
How can a person be like that?

20
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,070
I know, right? I only told her to apologize to Shi Hyun.

21
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,290
How can Soo Ji do that to me? Should I just reveal everything to her, right now?

22
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,690
"Shi Hyun got even more hurt because of you."

23
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:15,130
Yes! Tell her everything. Just reveal it to her and let her get hurt, too.

24
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,790
No. That doesn't solve anything and that's not something I would do, either.

25
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,360
You're the one who got hurt!

26
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,580
You should've just leaned onto Kwon Shi Hyun and cried it all out.

27
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,800
If Shi Hyun had never met me,

28
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,870
he would've just lived his life not knowing anything.

29
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,780
Forget it. Just think about yourself now. Just yourself.

30
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,570
Kyung Joo, what should I do?

31
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,720
It'll all pass. Everything will pass.

32
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,740
When? When will it get better?

33
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,660
When will it not hurt anymore?

34
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,510
If I knew the answer, I would be able to endure it,

35
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,740
but since I don't, I'm going insane.

36
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,950
Soo Ji! Soo Ji, open the door! Soo Ji!

37
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,350
What's wrong, Soo Ji?

38
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,850
Let's go home. If not, should we go to the hospital?

39
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,370
I don't want to. I don't want to see my mom.

40
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,440
I don't want to go home, either.

41
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,040
I don't want to see anyone.

42
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,220
I want to disappear from this world.

43
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,950
Can you turn off the lights?

44
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,910
You were right.

45
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,130
Shi Hyun left.

46

We can't return to our old selves.

- Yeah?

going to abandon me, too?

There's nothing easy about this.

You said her name is Soo Ji, right?

69
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,400
- You need to teach her some basic manners.
- I apologize.

70

In our house, we never allow people who speak of useless things.

What do you mean?

The day Shi Hyun's mother passed away, the things you told my daughter-in-law,

73
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,340
I don't know if others do, but I know.

74
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:33,370
You may not have known that things would turn out the way they did, but words said out of greed are a way of showing anger.

75
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,990
Your mother was on her way to meet this person, and there was an accident on the way.

76
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,990
Yes, Director Myeong, this is Shi Hyun. Can you meet me at the hospital for a bit?

77
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,460
I was thinking about taking the day off today.

Is it something urgent? Is it about your father?

Yeah.

84

But why did you ask to meet me?

85
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,570
I will just ask you directly.

86
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,660
Why did you lie to me?

87
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,550
You told me that my mother was the driver of the hit-and-run accident.

88
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,400
Shi Hyun, about that...

89
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,130
It was also you, who told my mom to go to Jeongeup.

90
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,410
It's as I suspected.

91
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,190
You were the one that told my mom to go there.

92
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,910
I believed that you were a good person. I disliked your marriage because of my father, but I tried to accept it.

93
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:16,300
However, I don't think I can do that now. You knew my mom's condition better than anyone, but you still told her to go there.

94
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,690
I'm certain that you had a different motive in mind.

95
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,840
- Shi Hyun.
- Why did you do that?

96
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,850
Is it because you wanted my mother and father to divorce?

97
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,480
Shi Hyun... it's just that...

98
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,470
I... just found out about the vice chairman going to Jeongeup coincidentally.

99
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,990
I just mentioned it to her because she was worried about it.

100
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:49,240
Alright. I will acknowledge that I was being unnecessarily nosy.

101
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,220
I'm sorry.

102
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,400
But it was her decision to go there.

103
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,250
I was worried about her, so I set everything aside and followed her.

104
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,110
And then...

105
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,310
you hit Tae Hee.

106
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,950
If you have a conscience, please stop here. I won't tell Soo Ji or my father.

107

Soo Ji...

108
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,140
She really won't be able to handle it.

109

My mom is crying right now because of you!

110

If you hear what I have to say, you can't be like this to me.

114

Did you stay out overnight? Where were you?

115
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,900
After going to the hospital yesterday, I went to orchestra practice again. I'm going to sleep for a bit and go back to school.

116
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,670
You should rest.

117
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,550
I never doubted you, but I wanted to confirm it with my own eyes.

Aigoo...

122
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,960
My mom probably did it

123
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,770
because she wanted to hurt my father's feelings.

124

I will talk to my father.

125

But first, I have to take care of some things.

129
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,200
I want to find what I want to do first. Inheriting the company...

130
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,510
doesn't really suit me well and I don't have the confidence to do well either.

You should leave it to a person who's skilled at business. Like my father, or Yeo Min.

In 1939, Gudun Station was a strategic location that connected Yangpyeong and Wonjoo.

After the orange subway line was established, it closed down.

We'll now look at Gudun Station's current state.

Wow. Your school's cafeteria food is really delicious.

160
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,510
But don't you think that homemade food is a bit better? Like the pasta that I make, or my eggs.

161
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,040
If not, my ramen.

162
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,470
Is your dad doing well?

163
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,470
Yeah. We chose a date for his surgery.

164
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,980
I sincerely hope that he gets better quickly.

165
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:33,310
But that's all I want to say to you. Finish eating and go.

166
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,770
It's cold, right? Warm clothing brought from home.

167
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,360
Public universities are pretty nice. All you need to do is show them your ID and they let you in.

168
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,570
Why do you keep acting like this?

169
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,480
What do you mean?

170
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,170
How far are you going to keep following me? Why are you being like this?

171
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,590
How far are you going to follow me?

172
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Anyway, if you followed me all the way here, just tell me what you want.

173
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,370
This is just like how it was when we first met.

174
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,830
Tell me why you're being like this. You know that

175
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,800
we can't return to how we were before.

176
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,040
It's hard for me if you keep being like this.

177
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,480
I'm not doing this to return to how we were before.

178
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,680
Then, why are you like this?

179
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,860
Tae Hee... come home.

180
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,260
I'll take care of it. Why do you care?

181
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,310
I know it's because of me, so that's why you're not going home and staying uncomfortably elsewhere.

182
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,030
You should go home for your own good. Then, I won't bother you anymore.

183
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,140
Schools are different depending on what you're interested in majoring in.

184
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,170
Since you want to major in drawing, you should try to get into an art school.

185
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,530
If you're interested in other things like designing, it's better to apply to a general college.

186
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,490
I didn't think about it that widely yet.

187
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,760
When are you thinking about applying?

188
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,980
As soon as possible.

189
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,140
Why are you thinking about leaving all of a sudden?

190
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,860
I need to go to an unfamiliar place to forget about some complicated things.

191
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,180
I also thought that I'd think about new things.

192
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,730
Alright. If you need any more help, just tell me.

193
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,580
Thank you.

194
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,530
I was always thankful towards you, Ahjussi.

195
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,900
What are you saying all of a sudden?

196
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,260
Here. These are all the practice books and memos I used when I started playing the cello. It'll be helpful to you.

197
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:33,720
Wow. Why are you giving me this, Unni? Are you going somewhere?

198
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,370
Just because. I want you to do well if you end up wanting to learn to play the cello.

199
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,510
Thank you! I'll try my best.

200
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,430
I'll buy something delicious for us, I have a lot of coupons.

201
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,940
Ah, yes. Thank you.

202
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,740
Your boyfriend is really thoughtful.

203
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,730
It's all thanks to you and Oppa.

204
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,080
Aren't you going to meet Goo Se Joo and Shi Hyun today?

205
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,400
We have to. We have to, but...

206
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,530
Where do you go to meet them? You meet up all the time.

207
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:13,660
We don't have anywhere to go, so we always go to the park or the cafe.

208
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,770
We had a hideout that only the three of us knew about.

209
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,040
It was more comfortable and warm than our own houses.

210
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:26,620
That's so cool. Can you invite us there some other time later? I'll keep it a secret.

211
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,050
We'll see.

212
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,400
What are you two doing here?

213
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,100
What brings you here?

214
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:44,140
This is by my law firm. Is it just the two of you?

215
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,170
- Give it to me, Joo Hwan.
- Alright.

216
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,180
Ah, hello.

217
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,320
You're that part-timer at the bar, right?

218
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,940
Hey, Choi Soo Ji. If you're going to go on a date, just go alone. Why did you have to drag Hye Jung here?

219
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,770
Don't interfere with what I do and just go.

220
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:07,770
I'm just saying this because I think it's so sad seeing you dating a nobody and ruining your life.

221
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,880
"A nobody"? "Ruining her life"?

222
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,940
Let's go, Hye Jung. This is not a place where an innocent thing like you should be.

223
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,290
What's wrong with my Joo Hwn?!

224
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:24,530
Who are you to judge when you don't even know a crap about fashion and look really ugly?!

225
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,650
You must have thrown away your manners or something. There's an extent as to how far I can withstand all your crap.

226
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:35,000
Look at the color of your shoes! It makes you look so pathetic!

227
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,980
Let's go, Joo Hwan. There's no reason for us to listen to all this crap he's saying.

228
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,990
- Let's go, Unni.
- Aigoo.

229
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,410
Are you dating someone, Park Hye Jung?

230
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,470
The color of his shoes was really dull. Seriously.

231
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,550
He won't tell your mom about this, right?

232
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:59,400
There's nothing we can do about it now that it's happened. If I get caught, I'm going to stand up to her.

233
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,610
You can't do that since you provoked Ki Young. He's a person that can't stand anything that hurts his pride.

234
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,300
That's right. His personality is seriously...

235
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,550
I saw him fighting at the bar I work at.

236
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:16,640
You should hurry up and go home, Hye Jung. If Ki Young says anything, just say that Joo Hwan is my boyfriend. You should also so the same, alright?

237
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,170
Yes.

238
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,810
Thank you so much, Unni.

239
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,460
Go quickly. Quickly.

240
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,100
- I'm leaving.
- I'm leaving.

241
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,330
The door's closing.

242
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,170
[Dad]

243
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,330
Yes, Dad?

244
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,510
- Where are you, my daughter?
- Me?

245
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,200
I-I'm on the way home.

246
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,690
I'm about to get on the airplane. I'll go to your school tomorrow.

247
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,880
You'll be pretty tired, so what's the point of coming to school?

248
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,290
You said that you're busy lately. You should head home quickly. I'm sure you're tired.

249
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:12,970
Alright. I'm here already. I'll rest well.

250
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,030
Thanks for coming, Eun Tae Hee.

251
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:36,290
♫ I can feel you anywhere, I can feel you ♫

252
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,560
- It's enough now that you're here.
- This is home.
♫ Anywhen, you weary heart ♫

253
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,880
It's a relief.

00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,890
♫ I'll embrace you ♫

255
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:48,810
♫ During the cold days, ♫

256
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:55,110
♫ One shining star ♫
