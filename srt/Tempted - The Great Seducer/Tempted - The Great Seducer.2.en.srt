But how did they find out?

Joo Han, it's me.

165

It's no big deal, but you know the guy that we met at the nightclub?

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,320
Was his name Kwon Shi Hyun?

I know that you can understand Korean.

You heard what my mom has been saying on the phone, right?

Well, he is pretty handsome.

- Did the ladies not leave yet?
- No.

What about the cake? What is it? Did they say something again?

181

No.

182
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm feeling tired, Tae Hee. I want to sleep.

Oh, sleep. I'll go in a bit.

Until when are you going to stay here?

185
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,290
I will return home when my dad comes back to Korea.

186
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:10,350
It's best for everyone that I'm not home until then.

187
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,350
I guess I won't be able to stay here long then.

Are you going somewhere?

189

You're not going anywhere so I should go somewhere.

Am I baggage to you?

191

Yes.

192

If you stay a few more days, I'm going to age.

193

Alright, I'll go to our hideout.

Stop grumbling and get dressed. Go show your face at the event so you won't get scolded more.

Uncomfortable?

You begged for a donation,

Don't try to sound nice while saying it. Just be honest about it.

318
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,050
Is it really necessary to go that far? It's such a nuisance.

319
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:27,480
"Go that far?" Why do I have to be the only one that's miserable?

320
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,180
You said you'll help me get back at Lee Ki Young! I want him to understand what's it like to be rejected.

321
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,090
I can't stand by, watching him get his way easily.

322
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,250
You know he only gets angry at his father.

323
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,160
- Shut up.
- Kwon Shi Hyun.

324
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,890
Guys, I'll do it.

325
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:55,640
What do I need to do? Do I just need to seduce Hye Jung or that smart student? Perhaps both? I'm fine either way.

326
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,980
The famous player in all the rumors is you. Don't you think her mother will know?!

327
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,660
Go away, kiddo.

328
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,320
[Secretary Yoon]
[The vice chairman will be there soon. He won't be there long, so come here.]

329
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,840
I'm sorry, but I'm out of this.

330
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,960
Shi Hyun.

331
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,240
Is there something that you're hiding from us?

332
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,100
Did you get kicked out of your house?

333
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,850
You got caught messing around with Go Kyung Joo's mother, right?

334
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,960
No. Stop.

335
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,820
What do you mean by that? Tell me honestly, until where did you go with her?

336
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,390
He's said that's not the case! Hey, I'll do it. I can like anyone.

337
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,310
Seriously, please, you can't. Go away.

338
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,760
He's acting strange, right?

339
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,990
Let him be. When he's ready, he'll tell us.

340
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,870
Where are you going?

341
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,660
What the heck? He was like that yesterday, too.

342
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,590
I'm sorry.

343
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,790
Why did you reject all of my calls?

344
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:41,720
I felt uneasy, so that's why I called you.

345
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,510
Were you afraid that I spread rumors?

346
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:49,040
You didn't perhaps, tell Kyung Joo about us, right?

347
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,820
If you did, and she finds out...

348
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:57,570
"Since I'm sorry, I'll date you too" is what I'll tell her.

349
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,810
Although, I have no rights to say anything, I ask this favor of you.

350
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:11,420
Kyung Joo... hates me a lot.

351
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,940
I know that she'll leave the house once she finds out,

352
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,350
but I have nothing to say and...

353
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:23,220
I'm... not Kyung Joo's biological mother.

354
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:29,520
She doesn't know. Without her, I won't be able to live.

355
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,870
I can't even tell if we're close or not...

356
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,870
I won't tell her.

357
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
Thanks.

358
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,510
You see, I kind of miss you from time to time.

359
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,070
I look funny, right?

360
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,170
Good-bye. I'll see you next time.

361
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,560
- Bye.
- Bye.

362
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,490
Ahjumma?

363
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,110
M-Marriage?

364
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,530
As we worked together, we naturally...

365
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,570
I didn't have any intentions of telling everyone this way.

366
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,440
President Myeong's vision is similar to mine.

367
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,220
Since we announced it, let's make this our engagement.

368
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,480
[Tempted]
- Preview -

369
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,890
It's a relief that you're not calling me, Kwon Soo Ji. Everyone I like just disappears...

370
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,290
She's going through hell right now,

371
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,090
so if you have common sense, just shut up!

372
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,260
Marriage, huh?

373
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,160
I'll give you one last chance. I'm against this marriage.

374
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,250
Is it about Shi Hyun? Do you like Shi Hyun?

375
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,270
Kwon Shi Hyun, do you still like me? Then, can you kiss me?

376
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,380
Tae Hee!

377
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,530
Do you guys know each other?

378
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,360
- Yes.
- No.

379
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,090
No.

380
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,770
How am I supposed to hate you?
