[Episode 14] 
 [Myeong Jeong Hospital]

2
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,920
I was supposed to go, but it's so busy at the company.

3
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,550
No, it's okay. We know how to do it.

4
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,190
Alright.

5
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,810
Take care of your body. If you feel any worse, make sure to call Director Myeong, alright?

6
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,570
Shi Hyun.

7
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,840
Yes. Don't worry about it.

8
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,080
[Payment Declined]

9
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,820
He's probably just being like that right now because he's mad.

10
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,330
Cheer up. You just don't have to do that next time.

11
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,840
Thank you. And thanks for paying the hospital fee.

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,680
What would I have done without you?

13
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,290
It's nothing. I'm paying for it instead of rent.

14
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,130
For interest, let's add it retroactively to this month's rent.

15
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,760
Retroactively?

16
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,910
Why glasses all of a sudden?

17
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,480
I'm planning on studying seriously from now on.

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,650
I'm going to get prettier glasses than my brother's.

19
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,740
I don't like your brother.

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,400
Don't be like that too much. He's ill.

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,550
He's sick? Where?

22
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,230
His heart. That's why he didn't attend school.

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,560
Is that why you did homeschooling, too?

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,410
- Yes.
- Mr. Kwon?

25
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,060
Who is it?

26
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,820
My mother's new husband.

27
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,280
I think my vision is okay, but my eyes seem to be more sensitive to the light.

28
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,940
We can't predict anything due to the unknown cause of the illness,

29
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,840
but we do think it will be difficult to stop your eyes from losing sight.

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,030
[Young Won]

31
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,690
Let's live separately and meet up when we really, really miss each other like crazy.

32
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,820
But I don't think we have to be that way anymore.

33
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,570
Because we endured it well up until now.

34
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,690
Just let me see, until I can still see.

35
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,520
Go.

36
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,850
Are you okay?

37
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,720
Do you need to go back to the hospital?

38
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,400
No, it's okay.

39
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,140
I can just draw it again. Today will be our real first day of dating.

40
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,280
Hey, you need to rest. Hurry and go to your bed.

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,000
My bed?

42
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,110
Will it be okay? I'm like a beast when I'm in bed.

43
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,780
Give me something to eat.

44
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,460
I'm sleepy after eating. I want to sleep.

45
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,790
Water.

46
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,990
I want to use the restroom.

47
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,750
All the way to the restroom?

48
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,390
Ah, so heavy!

49
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,070
- Ow, my head.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

50
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,090
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

51
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,220
Hurry and pet my hair. Hurry. Hurry.

52
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,360
Ah, you're so pretty. Ah, you're so pretty.

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,580
♫ Always ♫

54
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,680
Hey, I'm hungry.
♫ That place ♫

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:34,050
♫ Maybe it's his love that shakes me ♫

56
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,910
♫ No way, what do you mean love right now? ♫

57
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,760
♫ Rather than love, pretending not to know would be better ♫

58
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,020
♫ I probably am a fool for being like this ♫

59
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,450
We used to meet up often, even when we didn't make plans.

60
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,890
Aren't you going to come to our hideout?

61
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,570
I heard that Shi Hyun got discharged, what are you doing?

62
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,760
Let's meet at night.

63
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,820
Why does he keep making me go somewhere else?

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,620
Okay, I'll go there.

65
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,360
Hey, Soo Ji!

66
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,590
Unni, here!

67
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,860
Is it some special occasion?

68
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,390
It's the opening of Se Joo's business.

69
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,320
Huh?

70
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,640
Please give us premium pork skin, quickly!

71
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,960
Yes, Boss!

72
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,840
He bought out this restaurant. He has to make money quickly or else his family is going to kick him out again.

73
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,360
- Here.
- Cheers!
- Yeah!

74
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,180
Since this is close to your school, come often.

75
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,720
I personally added pork skin and rice as a lunch menu item.

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,510
You really need to eat more pork skin. Why is your skin so crumbly?

77
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,320
You usually have such soft skin.

78
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,530
Okay, Mr. Grills. These are grilled specially for you. Eat it quickly.

79
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,870
Why are you giving me old meat?

80
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,200
Get me some more when I leave, so I can grill it at home.

81
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,050
What do you mean eat at home? Here, just eat this.

82
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,060
You must be raising a dog at home. An adorable dog.

83
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,990
Don't be so cheap. You should come here to eat and pay for your food, punk.

84
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,550
My card was cut off.

85
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,510
Did your dad know that you got hospitalized?

86
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,930
Well, that's probably why he cut it off.

87
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,160
Hey, give me some meat.

88
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,190
Seriously...

89
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,180
— Lunch Menu —
[Rice with pork skin / pork skin set,
Deep fried pork skin / Pork skin pasta]

90
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,740
I should come here everyday for lunch.

91
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,030
You wanted to take some meat home to share with Tae Hee, right?

92
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,300
Yeah, that's right.

93
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,120
I know what you two did that night.

94
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,040
Really?

95
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,260
- Go back safely!
- Good-bye!

96
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,350
Good-bye!

97
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,800
Everyone's having a great time.

98
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,790
Yeah?

99
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,790
You called?

100
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,500
You told his dad that Shi Hyun was hospitalized, right?

101
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,280
I asked you not to, so why are you being like this?

102
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,230
This is why I don't like this. Because it's obvious that you'll treat Shi Hyun as an outcast when you guys get married.

103
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,530
Go Kyung Joo, can I ask you for a favor?

104
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,700
Can you keep it a secret from Soo Ji and Se Joo that I'm dating Tae Hee for now?

105
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,690
I know. You have finally come to your senses.

106
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,340
What do you mean?

107
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,780
Your future step-sister is acting like a sister-in-law to Tae Hee.

108
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,680
"Sister-in-law"...

109
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,460
Kwon Shi Hyun, you know that I thought you were really rude, right?

110
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,880
Well, do you have to say it so harshly like that?

111
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,920
But I kind of like you now.

112
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,620
Why? Why is that?

113
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,790
Just because!

114
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,000
Of course! We still didn't drink yet.

115
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,140
I'm doing this right now.

116
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,350
- I took this picture to send it to you on purpose.
- What the heck?

117
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,980
Did you get into a lot of trouble with your dad?

118
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,230
Get into trouble? We don't even talk to each other.

119
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,950
It was probably my mother's doing. I'm sorry.

120
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,260
There's no way my dad wouldn't have known.

121
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,830
Also, I told you this before. Don't ever feel sorry towards me because of your mother.

122
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,220
Do you still hate me?

123
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,590
There's no way that you don't remember what I said when you asked me what I told her.

124
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,820
When you were sick, I kept thinking about something.

125
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:04,700
Our plot, our plan that we came up with together. Was it all for nothing?

126
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,870
The adults don't even blink in front of us,

127
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,650
and we just roam around for nothing.

128
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,680
But it's more like me to think, "Are there crazier ways?"

129
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,260
It didn't work when I saw you in the hospital.

130
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,640
- It felt like you were hurt because of me.
- No, that's not true.

131
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,730
Hye Jung, were you eating well?

132
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,660
- It's so good!
- Is it?

133
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,200
Is he doing business or is he just making a playground?

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,130
He set it up for you to eat.

135
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,280
Do you believe that?

136
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,130
It's rain.

137
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,170
It's spring rain.

138
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:59,520
When the weather gets warmer, should we go on a trip again?

139
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,200
Yeah, just the three of us.

140
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,420
We'll have fun, like how it was before.

141
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,290
Kwon Shi Hyun!

142
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,570
Kwon Shi Hyun, are you sleeping?

143
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,580
I'm coming in!

144
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,140
Gosh, I knew he'd be like this.

145
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,920
♫  Today  ♫

146
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,280
Wake up! We have somewhere to go.

147
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,250
I'm going to sleep. Where is there to go?

148
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,560
- The sun's already halfway up. Get up quickly!
- Hey.

149
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,020
What's wrong with you? You're acting like a beast.

150
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,640
No, I won't let this one go this time.

151
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,920
Why? Why are you doing this in the morning?

152
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,010
Hurry up.

153
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,970
Why are we here?

154
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,680
I found my friend who will draw.

155
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,190
Huh? What are you saying?

156
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,230
They're looking for someone to draw, and I recommended you.

157
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,740
No, I can't do that.

158
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,050
No, you can.

159
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,560
I like your drawings.

160

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,690
She sings really well.

317
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,140
You are pretty cute. You even sing quite well.

318
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,820
Thank you.

319
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,840
What are you doing, Geun Sook? Get up here.

320
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,360
Yes, Unni!

321
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,190
Unni, you know that I really adore you, right?

322
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,420
But why are you going through such a hard time? Huh?

323
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,440
- What do you think about this? Are you ready to party through the night?
- Yeah!

324
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,520
Finished with drawing. See you at home.

325
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,860
Yeah, I'll be doing my homework.

326
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,860
That's Eun Tae Hee's mom?

327
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,550
But I'm sure that I saw her somewhere before.

328
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,390
Are you heading home?

329
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,420
What the heck? What are you doing here?

330
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,930
Well, I was just drawing some things.

331
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,810
How long has it been?

332
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:14,230
- You go to school and Se Joo works, so I'm supposed to sit around and play?
- Yeah.

333
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,610
Can you drop me off at the hospital?

334
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,320
Let's go.

335
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,090
Is your head alright now?

336
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,750
Yeah.

337
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,750
I just need to go up for a bit. Let's go eat dinner at the hideout after. You don't have anything going on, right?

338
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,790
You should eat dinner with Director Myeong sometimes.

339
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,760
You must've gotten angry at her because of me.

340
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,160
In order to eat with her, I need to check her schedule.

341
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,360
Dismiss the director that's a risk to public health!

342
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,630
Wait a moment.

343
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,030
Huh?

344
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,100
We're against the corporation of Myeong Jeong Hospital!

345
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,090
We're against it! We're against it!

346
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,460
Dismiss the director that's a risk to public health!

347
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,260
Dismiss, dismiss!

348
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,420
We're against the corporation of Myeong Jeong Hospital!

349
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,720
We're against it! We're against it!

350
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,500
Oh, here comes the director!

351
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,330
That's the director!

352
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,720
Dismiss!

353
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,410
Step down from your position!

354
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,220
She's going to be very sad if she sees you here.

355
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,470
Wait a minute.

356
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,460
Let's go. Get in the car.

357
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,220
Hurry up, Choi Soo Ji!

358
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,750
- Resign!
- Resign!

359
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,160
Let's go inside.

360
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,240
Let go. I'm alright.

361
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,660
Let's go inside first!

362
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,660
Let's register for our marriage!

363
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,940
I'll do it! Let's do it tomorrow, immediately! Right away!

364
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,050
- What?
- Let's get married tomorrow.

365
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,720
I can't let my mom and your dad get marry. This is too dirty and cheap!

366
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,350
He's going to use her like that if we go to your house.

367
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,520
Don't be emotional, Choi Soo Ji.

368
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,830
While he's using Myeong Mi Ri's name as a shield, what is he doing in the back hiding?

369
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,350
He's really the worst!

370
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,360
Do you feel bad? Then let's get married.

371
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,430
What? Are you scared that you'll make me like that, too?

372
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,660
Are you going to use me like how your dad uses my mom? You won't!

373
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,550
You don't even care about business and you're just going to live comfortably like right now.

374
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,330
I said that I'll do it with you, so why aren't you saying anything?

375
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,570
I'm giving you want you want, without any conditions, and I'm throwing my pride away!

376
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,550
I don't want to.

377
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,760
What?

378
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,620
I hate everything now.

379
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,220
Fine. This is what you're really like.

380
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,090
You always pretend like you don't have a care for the world and try to selfishly stay out of everything.

381
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,420
Am I wrong?

382
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,460
You even stop our bet on your own without telling me.

383
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,210
I'm getting sick of this. I'm sick of your selfishness and your dad.

384
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:16,430
Choi Soo Ji. Stop using our friendship like this as a weapon.

385
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:26,670
If you're like this next time, I'm not sure if I can hold onto you like this.

386
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,120
I saw your dad meeting with another woman!

387
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,460
Your dad is meeting with another woman.

388
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,170
Where did you see them? How did you see him?

389
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,340
Who was it?!

390
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,760
[Tempted Preview]

391
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,520
I'm going to find out about the woman that you're meeting right now.

392
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,400
Don't even dream of doing something so useless.

393
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,150
Did you have a child out of wedlock like me with that woman?

394
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,290
Nothing happened to me.

395
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,290
You can tell me anything.

396
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,350
I'm really alright.

397
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,090
How did you know that my dad was meeting another woman? I need to know.

398
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,170
I don't want to. I never had rice wine before.

399
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,230
It's really delicious.

400
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,020
Hey! This won't do, I think we should spend the night here.

401
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,340
- Beast...
- Hey!
