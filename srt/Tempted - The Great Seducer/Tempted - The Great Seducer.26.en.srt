Door opened.
[Episode 26]

2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,460
[Happy Birthday ♥]

3
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,760
I guess this place has become an empty nest.

4
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,360
An empty nest...

5
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,900
- Don't peek. You can't peek.
- Come here, Kwon Shi Hyun.

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,110
Hey, take it slow. Slowly. Oh my.

7
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,740
- Right now—
- There's something there!

8
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,420
Hey, hey! Hey. Come to the front. To the front.

9
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,860
- Oh my!
- Hey!
- Wait. Wait.

10
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,340
One, two, three! Ta-da!

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,450
What is this?

12
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,450
I welcome you to Lee Se Joo's palace.

13
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,460
Wasn't this used as an art gallery before?

14
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,980
It's basically a club now.

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,850
Oh, hey! There's even a grand piano here!

16
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,420
I had to leave school early for a month just to decorate this place.

17
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,280
If you don't get kicked out of school, is this really going to be your's?

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,190
Of course.

19
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,200
It's going to be so nice to sit here each time I come here.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,390
Let's set up the world's biggest video game place here.

21
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,540
- Deal.
- Deal.
- Hey!

22
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,170
Come here. We need to come up with rules.

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,120
Why do we have to? Just use it however you like.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,760
No, the both of you have no self-control.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,850
- No one is allowed to enter here.
- Deal.
- Deal.

26
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,770
- Gather here if a war breaks out.
- Deal.
- Deal.

27
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,260
You have to come here in case of an earthquake, too.

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,410
- Deal.
- Deal.

29
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,100
- We have our sixtieth birthdays here.
- Deal.

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,060
That's right. You can't eat and sleep here if you run away from home.

31
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,010
This is the best place to run away to though.

32
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,230
But, Soo Ji, honestly

33
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,890
I think my mom left me this place in case I get disowned by my family, so please let me off the hook.

34
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,830
You just need to not get kicked out, then.

35
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,590
That's right, Sa Do Se Joo. You have to hold back your anger in order to protect this place. Got it? Deal?

36
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,750
- Deal.
- Hey, but there's no desk here.

37
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,010
No studying here!

38
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,070
Of course. What are you talking about right now?

39
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,660
Then I shouldn't stay here overnight to study for exams?

40
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,220
- You definitely can't do that.
- You definitely can't do that.

41
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,760
This.

42
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,610
You said her name is Soo Ji, right? It seems like you need to teach her some basic manners.

43
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,540
I apologize.

44
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,420
I didn't tell them to leave just to tell you this.

45
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,940
I'm going to give you a piece of advice and a warning.

46
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,830
In my household, I will never accept people who talk too much about useless things.

47
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,750
Wow, I can't believe it. Seriously.

48
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,300
Just what did I do to make her say I need to learn some manners?

49
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,240
What's with Mom acting like that, too?

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,360
She even treated her like she talks a lot just because she took my side.

51
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,380
And to a person who did a press conference for them!

52
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,940
Talks a lot about useless things?

53
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,140
- What is it?
- Hey.

54
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,690
What do you have to do to get on your grandmother's good side?

55
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,350
What are you talking about?

56
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,290
I will have to live a suffocating life while living with your family,

57
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,490
so I thought I would have to at least be on your grandmother's good side.

58
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,910
What did you do to make her adore you like that?

59
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,970
Is it just because you're blood-related?

60
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,240
Choi Soo Ji, I'm not in the mood to talk to you about that right now.

61
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,190
I'm not doing this because I want to.

62
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,010
Do you know what your grandmother said to my mother when she told us to stay outside?

63
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,370
I was curious, so I recorded it.

64
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,700
She told her to teach me some manners first.

65
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,710
That's because she's a grandma.

66
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:18,360
It's probably okay for her real grandson to act like a pampered child.

67
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,200
But you're not, right?

68
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,470
So I changed my train of thought.

69
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,850
We failed to stop our parents' marriage by getting married, whether it was fake or not.

70
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,230
We're also done being friends.

71
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,150
So I need a way to survive and get treated like a person once I become part of JK Group.

72
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,660
How can you say it like that, "treated like a person"?

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,860
Do you want to hear what your grandmother said?

74
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,730
Soo Ji... later, please.

75
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,960
I'm at the hospital because my father's unwell right now.

76
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,930
Then, just open it later and listen to it.

77
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,830
Are you alri—?

78
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,850
Excuse me, Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

79
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,370
- Are you alright, patient?
- I think he's unconscious.

80
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,570
Patient!

81
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,330
What happened?

82
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,140
He suddenly fell unconscious.

83
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,760
Look at him...

84
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,460
Do you think he'll be alright?

85
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,110
Please look at me, patient.

86
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,700
Can you move?

87
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,580
Can you move your hand and head?

88
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,750
I think he hurt his leg, too.

89
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,470
Don't worry too much and just wait a little bit. The doctors will be here soon.

90
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,930
Can you move your hand and your head?

91
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,850
I think you also hurt your leg. You shouldn't move.

92
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,560
Can you wait for me just a little bit?

93
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,650
- Please move aside.
- Please get out of the way.

94
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,240
- You should be careful with his head and leg.
- Yes. I understand.

95
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,120
Give him an IV immediately.

96
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,550
Yes!

97
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,560
- Please move.
- Get out of the way.

98
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,090
What are you doing here, Student Eun Tae Hee?

99
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,180
You met me before in Jeongeup, right?

100
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,660
- What are you—?
- Why didn't you come back then?

101
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm not sure what you're talking about, but have a cup of tea, and then leave.

102
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,630
When I held onto you earlier, why were you so shocked?

103
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,230
I'm not quite sure. Was I?

104
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,720
I got into a car accident two years ago in winter.

105
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,860
It was in Jeongeup.

106
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,170
It was a hit-and-run accident and I just recently found out who the driver was.

107
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,140
I see. You must've had a hard time.

108
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,720
However, lately I've been thinking that

109
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,020
she wasn't the driver.

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,890
That night, while I was trying to save someone,

111
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,530
I got into a car accident.

112
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,310
The customer you're trying to reach is unavailable—

113
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,030
Excuse me!

114
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,030
I think I caused an accident.

115
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,770
Accident?

116
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,430
No, it's alright. You don't have to worry.

117
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,190
Alright...

118
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,830
Are you unwell somewhere?

119
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,710
Is there a hospital nearby?

120
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,070
Can you call them?

121
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,520
Ah... I don't have a phone on me right now...

122
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,500
Just stay like this for a little bit. I'll go and call 119 and get some people here.
(T/N: 119 is Korea's emergency number)

123
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,070
Wait a moment.

124
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,140
Just wait a moment.

125
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,310
While I was running like that, I got involved in an accident.

126
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,790
Since you're a doctor, I'm sure you know this very well.

127
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,850
That most car accident victims forget the color or shape of the car

128
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,890
that hit them.

129
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,870
That's what people say because of the huge shock.

130
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,320
I also forgot about the car that hit me,

131
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,520
but recently when I saw a car, I felt like it was oddly familiar.

132
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,290
At school, I saw the car that Soo Ji drove

133
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,120
and for some reason, it looked strangely familiar to me.

134
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,350
Then, just earlier, when I saw you giving emergency care to that man also seemed familiar.

135
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,580
Why didn't you come back to me?

136
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:31,480
It was you, the person who hit me!

137
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,670
You were the person that told me you'd be right back! You told me to wait

138
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,920
and that you'd be right back.

139
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,950
Do you know how scared I was?!

140
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,970
It was cold and I was in pain!

141
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,580
Everything was dark and there were no cars passing by, so I couldn't even hear a thing.

142
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,940
I was scared that if I closed my eyes, I wouldn't be able to wake up later.

143
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,790
So I turned around and I couldn't fall asleep because I thought you wouldn't be able to find me.

144
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,100
Do you know how much I endured through each moment that passed?

145
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:06,790
I trusted you when you said that you'd be back.

146
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,300
Although I was scared, I trusted that you would've come back.

147
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,390
No. You were mistaken.

148
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,580
I've never been there.

149
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,200
You should've came!

150
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,240
No matter what, you should've came to me!

151
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,430
Because of that, I couldn't walk properly for a while.

152
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,290
Since I was getting treatment, I couldn't even go to school properly.

153
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,790
At that time, I also had no other choice.

154
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:59,230
I, also—I came to save the same person, too.

155
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,750
When she passed away, I was so taken aback, so I forgot.

156
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,530
When I came back later, you weren't there.

157
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:11,950
No. All these excuses aren't effective on me.

158
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,430
Wait...

159
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,340
By any chance, is that patient Shi Hyun's mother?

160
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,880
Then, you also lied to him!

161
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,110
Shi Hyun's mother is the driver of the hit-and-run accident?

162
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,440
How could you do that?!

163
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,930
Did you think about how guilty Shi Hyun felt because of this?!

164
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,920
I also went there to save his mother!

165
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,530
She ran away while she was hospitalized.

166
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,800
Her heart wasn't healthy, so she needed constant monitoring.

167
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,130
It would've been bad if something were to happen.

168
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,970
I told Shi Hyun that because...

169
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,190
That... Although... I'm not sure you'll understand,

170
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,700
I thought it was best if I told him that.

171
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:14,250
There's a reason why I can't tell him why his mother went all the way to Jeongeup.

172
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,940
We both know about it.

173
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,230
How his mother passed away while looking for my mother.

174
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,320
That's enough, then.

175
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,680
If it wasn't for Seol Young Won, then none of this would've happened.

176
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,710
No, Director Myeong! Don't come up with ridiculous excuses.

177
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:43,840
If I wasn't Seol Young Won's daughter, then would you apologize to me right now?

178
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,250
That's why you should properly admit what you did wrong.

179
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,780
It ended up like that while we both went to save the same person.

180
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,740
What do you want? Even now, I'll still compensate for it.

181
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,530
How would you like for me to repay you?

182
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,090
Please admit that it was your fault.

183
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,930
Think about it well, I—right now—even if I go to the police station and confess, I won't get punished harshly for it.

184
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:19,090
I know, since we're talking about you, I'm sure you will be able to avoid charges.

185
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:24,800
However, I think that if you sincerely apologize to me, I will feel a bit better.

186
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,530
You should reveal everything and sincerely apologize even though it's a been a while.

187
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,810
That's way, you can also help lessen Shi Hyun's guilt.

188
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,330
I also won't report you.

189
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,890
Yeah.
[Yoon Joon Young]

190
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,550
I'm almost there.

191
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,900
But I still can't see her car and she's not picking up either.

192
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,340
Are you sure that Madam went all the way to Jeongeup?

193
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,320
I looked everywhere that she could've gone, but I couldn't find her.

194
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,600
That's right! I'm sure she came here.

195
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,490
So why did you tell her that?

196
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,960
I also didn't know that she would go looking for her!

197
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,060
What's wrong? Hello?

198
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,160
What's that matter, Mi Ri?

199
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,690
It's nothing.

200
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,790
I'll call you again once I find Madam.

201
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,600
Are you alright? I'm sorry, I wasn't looking straight.

202
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,790
Excuse me. Wait a moment.

203
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,970
Excuse me, do you think you can move?

204
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,840
Can you move your head and hands?

205
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,520
Get up. Slowly.

206
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,560
I think that you also hurt your leg.

207
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,720
I don't think you should move.

208
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,960
Can you call the hospital for me?

209
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,050
There's a patient over there...

210
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,250
A patient?

211
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,970
Yes. There's a woman in a car.

212
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,610
I was on my way to look for people right now.

213
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,330
Let's hurry—

214
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,460
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but can you wait a little bit?

215
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,910
I promise to come back.

216
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,840
I'm sorry.

217
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,340
Madam! Madam!

218
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,150
Madam!

219
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,790
Eun Tae Hee?

220
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,370
What's wrong, Mother?

221
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,310
Soo Ji... Soo Ji... I...

222
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,240
Just why are you crying?!

223
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,680
Is it because Ahjussi's unwell? Is his condition that bad?

224
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,230
It's Eun Tae Hee, right?

225
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,390
The person that just left was Eun Tae Hee, right?!

226
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,590
Calm down, Mom.

227
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,830
It's alright. It's alright.

228
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,860
Tae Hee.

229
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,890
Shi Hyun... I have something to tell you,

230
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,640
so can we meet where we saw each other earlier?

231
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,660
I'll go there right now.

232
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,840
Yes, thank you.

233

[Choi Soo Ji]

234
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,920
The customer that you're trying to reach is unavailable

235
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,080
When you hear—

236
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,000
[Eun Tae Hee]

237
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,300
[Shi Hyun]

238
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,050
The customer that you're trying to reach is unavailable

239
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,380
When you hear—

240
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:02,180
I'm not sure from where and how to tell you,

241
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:07,230
but I found out who the driver of my hit-and-run accident was.

242
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,010
It wasn't your mom.

243
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,730
What are you saying? Then...?

244
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,860
Director Myeong.

245
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,910
She's going to tell you everything soon.

246
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,620
Are you alright?

247
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,310
M-Me?

248
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,750
I'm asking if you're alright.

249
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:53,010
I pondered here, wondering whether I should tell you about Director Myeong or not.

250
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,750
She said that when she was hurrying to save your mom, she accidentally hit me.

251
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,490
Are you alright?

252
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,310
This might be more of a shock to you than it is to me.

253
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,410
I don't care about that right now.

254
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,780
The first thing I thought of was whether you're alright or not.

255
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,630
Let's make everything straightforward now.

256
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,500
Let's report her and get an apology statement from her. I'll go with you.

257
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,280
No.

258
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,800
I don't want to dig further into this.

259
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,650
Then, are you just going to let this go?

260
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,120
Even when it tortured you for such a long and difficult time?

261
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,690
Either way, it all started because of my mom.

262
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,580
If I looked into the matter a bit more and knew about it earlier, it would've been better.

263
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:48,090
I regret that. If I had, I would've been able to lift up some of your burdens.

264
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,130
None of it is your fault.

265
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,690
I know it's not my fault either,

266
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,540
but I'm just upset because of all the hard times you and I have had.

267
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,460
There's nothing that we can do about what our parents did.

268
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:14,690
I think the only thing that we can do is change whatever will happen to us in the future.

269
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,690
You see...

270
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,930
I'm alright even if the driver that hit me was really your mom.

271
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,320
No, I became alright with that. Really.

272
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,920
But why does it seem like you suddenly became an adult?

273
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,420
What?

274
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,120
I can't believe I get to hear that from Eun Tae Hee.

275
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,050
I know, right?

276
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,590
I'm leaving.

277
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,180
Yeah.

278
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:35,980
Hey, Tae Hee. Can you wait for me? I'll take you home after checking on my father.

279
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,820
I can go alone.

280
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,470
It's late.

281
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,670
Please just let me do that tonight.

282
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,730
Then, take your time. I'll be down there.

283
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,320
Eun Tae Hee!

284
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,040
You met my mother earlier, right?

285
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,250
So what?

286
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,050
What did you tell her to make her end up like that? Huh?!

287
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,360
Tell me what you said and then leave!

288
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,460
Do you really want to know? Once you hear it, you wouldn't be like this to me.

289
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,320
Why do you keep bothering the people around you?!

290
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,290
My mom is crying because of you right now—

291
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:46,320
That's why, if you're wondering why, then you go ask her yourself instead of being like this to me.

292
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,220

Shi Hyun—

297
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,830
Why were you holding onto her? Just what more do you have to discuss with her?

298

Soo Ji... just leave me alone.

301
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,650
There's nothing good that would come out of us talking.

302
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:34,500
While I'm warning you, just leave. Also, don't interfere with our relationship.

303
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,730
Don't you think that you can't be like this to me?

315
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,060
Let me ask you one last time. Do you have any thoughts of going back to Soo Ji?

316
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,290
Are you also going to leave Soo Ji and end it like that?

317
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,410
Was I the only one that wanted to protect the relationship between the three of us?!

318
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:04,390
Lately, whenever I wake up in the morning, the first thing I think about

319
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,590
is how you're somewhere nearby.

320
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,820
♫ When it's hard for you to endure ♫

321
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,000
♫ Lean on me ♫
