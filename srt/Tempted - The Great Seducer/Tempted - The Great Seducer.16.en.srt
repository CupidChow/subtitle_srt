00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,520
Sorry, I've been busy working on my paper.

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,560
No, no, it's fine. It's pretty clean.

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,990
Right? This is nothing.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,750
I'll make you coffee. You can do your homework.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,000
Huh?

7
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,090
Oh... ah... I don't eat much at home, so...

8
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,960
Oh, I usually use two bags of ramen when I eat.

9
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,320
Really?

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,680
Why are you surprised?

11
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,460
But, if you just eat ramen, you won't be getting enough nutrients.

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,700
If you add in eggs and veggies, it's fine.

13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,450
There are no eggs or cold rice. Why is there only cat food?

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,860
If you're just going to nag, then leave.

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,230
This won't do. I'll just come often.

16

Like the Snake Lady of the old fables.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,800
You mean the Snail Lady...

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,100
So, uh...

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,100
Can't you make your door password be my phone number, like how mine is yours?

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,400
It already is.

21
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,920
But, you should still ring the doorbell.

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,830
Letting you in or not is up to me.

23
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,080
Of course.

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,290
You should finish working hard on your homework.

42
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,640
Is it okay for a person to be shut up in their room, just doing homework like that? You have to get out and exercise.

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,860
- You should get some sunlight, too.
- Oh, I don't know!

What do you not know? Just hurry up. One, two, one, two!

Gosh, I'm so tired! I really am!

Here.

51
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,320
What kind of homework is it that's making you suffer so much?

Since I've never been there myself, I don't really know.

55
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,080
You can just go, then. Should we go together?

56
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,020
I think I picked a really difficult location.

If I poke you, I feel like you'll cry.

65

If you do this one more time, I really will cry.

If you're that worried, you can just come with me.

Of course I will. Were you going to go by yourself?

Yeah.

No, you can't. I'm going, too.

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,200
You need a driver and someone to carry your things.

Take me.

73
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,200
I guess I will.

I've been watching you since a while ago.

Soo Ji, your sound is very bright.

78
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,610
As for your technique, it's something you can work on.

79
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,840
Starting next class, how do you feel about getting a solo part?

80
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,790
Pardon?

81
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,000
It's not normal for a freshman to get a solo,

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,320
but since your abilities are outstanding, don't you think it'd be okay to try? How about it?

83
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,090
Yes, I'll try my best!

The reason that I'm standing here is to explain misunderstandings surrounding Tiuzen.

It's to explain it from the perspective of an expert.

As for our PMS (Post-Marketing Surveillance) procedure, it is normal to follow 600 to 3000 case studies when a new medical product is introduced to the market.

But unlike other synthetic drugs, Tiuzen was limited in as a new drug used only in embryonic stem cells.

This is a common issue that a new medical product faces during its development.

It's a shortcoming that exists in our current regulations.

140
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,730
JK will submit a detailed explanatory document,

explaining the ways it has controlled its studies and followed legal regulations.

it's hard to believe JK's stance. On top of that, their growth was due to Tiuzen.

Events of the past are not related to the situation right now.

As an expert, I can assure you that there's no problem

Tiuzen is a newly developed pharmaceutical product that was developed before JK and Myeong Jeong shared their industry knowledge.

162
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,950
Aren't you proving the concerns of the civic groups that are talking about the marriage connection between a corporation and hospital?

163
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,100
- That...
- I'll ask you the question again.

164
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,610
CEO Myeong Mi Ri, if you don't get involved in the business management of JK after you get married,

165
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,790
that would justify your marriage. Why don't you make a promise here confidently?

166
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:49,370
Do I have to prove my feelings of love to you?

167
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,050
Well, that's because JK's past movements don't warrant a sense of trust.

168
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,150
Of course, I'm going to help them as much as I can.

169

If there are no further questions, we will conclude the press conference.

That's right. He accepted my mom because he wanted to use her like that.

172

Shi Hyun probably hasn't seen the news, right?

173

Are you worrying about Shi Hyun right now?

174

I'm going to leave my cello here.

Oh, I'm late. After I saw your magazine interview, I really wanted to come.

186
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,200
Oh, the magazine. The interview must've been released.

187
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,430
Gwi Yo, did you buy the magazine?

188
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,300
Professor, I'll bring it right away.

189
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,110
I have it, too. Could I ask for your autograph?

190
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,870
Since I'm here, I wanted to leave with something to remember it by.

191
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,440
I'm thankful for that. It's embarrassing that you want a autograph from me.

192
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,320
There's a page I already folded.

will obediently act the way you're thinking?

314
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,960
I don't plan to do that.

315
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,310
Then, are you thinking of having her work your business in your place?

316
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,730
Do you want to reign from behind the curtain?

317
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,090
If you're having those thoughts, teach Shi Hyun first.

318
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,560
Until Shi Hyun and Yeo Min inherit the business,

319
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,000
stand your ground and protect the company. That's your job.

320
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,800
Mother.

321
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,380
If your brother hadn't gone on that business trip instead of you,

322
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,300
and if you hadn't ran wild while trying to meet that woman again,

323
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:07,060
your brother, his wife, and Shi Hyun's mom wouldn't have died so meaninglessly!

324
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:18,520
If you're even a little sorry to Yeo Min and Shi Hyun, then take responsibility for all of it.

325
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,030
Are you done getting ready?

326
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,160
Of course.

327
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,590
Why do you have a toothbrush?

328
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,890
We might sleep there.

329
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,770
We're going to return before dinner, though.

330
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,090
We're going on the subway.

331
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,480
- What? The subway? Is it that close?
- Yeah.

332
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,120
It only takes an hour.

333
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,340
But, we should still go in a car. That way, it'll just be the two of us.

334
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,720
No, we can't.

335
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,610
What are you planning to do if the subway closes?

336
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,650
Like an animal.

337
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,640
Give me it. Since your hand was hurt, I'll hold all of your luggage.

338
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,190
Okay!

339
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,730
- Isn't it so nice?
- Yeah.

340
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,510
I knew you'd like it.

341
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:25,360
- You chose a spot that you wanted to show to me?
- Yeah.

342
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,520
I'm going to work on my homework now.

343
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,220
Okay, then what do I do?

344
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,490
Here, follow me.

345
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,800
♫ You're ♫

346
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,380
♫  especially pretty today ♫
♫ Your words, you pretend  ♫

347
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,480
♫  not to care sometimes ♫

348
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,620
♫ When I  ♫

349
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,910
♫  carefully start the conversation, you don't say anything ♫

350
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,200
♫  and smile ♫

351
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,060
♫ Why do you keep doing this?  ♫

352
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:13,000
♫ It's making me confused ♫

353
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,970
♫ I don't even know why, but I'm going to you ♫

354
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,300
♫ What do I do? ♫

355
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,220
♫  I think I like you ♫

356
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,950
♫ Shining like the stars in the night sky ♫

357
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,310
♫ Warmer than sunshine ♫

358
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:40,590
♫ I like you, I like you so much ♫

359
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,810
♫ Your gaze, ♫

360
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:47,540
♫ It gently  ♫

361
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,650
♫ melts my cold heart ♫

362
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:58,280
♫ Hug me with your soft embrace ♫

363
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,930
♫ I know your warm heart better than anyone ♫

364
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,430
♫ Come to me ♫

365
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,400
♫ Softly cover ♫

366
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,070
♫ My frozen heart  ♫

367
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,200
♫  with your breath ♫

368
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:23,230
♫ Hug me with your soft embrace ♫

369
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,750
The birthday constellation is found on the date of your birth.

370
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,700
It's the constellation that's in the place of the sun.

371
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,830
I knew for the first time.

372
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:39,060
That the constellations changed every season, and that the constellations weren't forever.

373
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,240
The cycle of the constellation is 26,000 years...

374
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,120
- For the first time, I regretted it. 
- So.

375
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,520
I regretted the fact that we hadn't met each other a bit earlier.

376
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,440
On my birthday...

377
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:56,490
The winter that I first saw you and the first spring we spent together were so precious.

378
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,340
I wanted to tell you that.

379
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,040
Anyway, you can't see the Aries constellation right now.

380
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,950
When you can see it in autumn, then I'll—

381
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,230
♫ To pour out my heart ♫

382
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,310
♫ In case I got farther away from her ♫

383
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:19,660
When winter comes again, will I be able to be next to you?

384
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:26,400
The huge lie within me... You'll realize it one day.

385
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,030
For the first time, I became afraid.

386
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:35,960
♫ I should've said I was in love with you ♫

387
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,420
♫ Now and like this ♫

388
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:45,760
♫  I wouldn't have regretted it  ♫

389
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,720
♫  I should've ♫

390
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,860

Episode 17 Preview

391
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,220
Don't you feel like something's not enough?

392
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,360
A situation like this doesn't happen everyday...

393
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,960
You're acting all cool by yourself and setting the mood all by yourself!

394
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,140
- Huh?!
- It hurts!

395
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,140
Do you not want to sleep with me?

396
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,630
Hey, I'm not going to eat you up. I won't even touch you!

397
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:20,220
I... really want to sleep with you.
