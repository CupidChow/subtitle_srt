[Last Episode]

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,320
Shi Hyun. I went to your house and brought the pillow that you use.

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,910
Do you remember that rainy day when I went to your house with my pillow?

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,700
It's been a while since I've gone to your house,

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,360
so as soon as I stepped in, I could smell your scent.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,040
I didn't notice it before, but I did today.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,030
It was also nice to see your drawings on the glass wall after a long time.

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,150
Hey. If I'm talking to you like this, you should listen to me.

9
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,630
You should make me some ramen while listening.

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,530
Or, do some cleaning and make me coffee when I'm working on my homework.

11
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,390
You should also scold me, telling me to go out and see the sun.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,500
You said you were my Snake Lady...

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,500
I'll stay by your side just like that night.

14
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,990
So then, you should open your eyes with me tomorrow.

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,970
You should wake up tomorrow to enjoy the spring weather

16
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,200
and you need to talk with me. Got it?

17
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,680
You made this to give to me, right?

18
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,460
Can I read it?

19
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,210
I was really sorry for

20
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,090
reading the paper airplane.

21
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,870
I also had a hard time because I thought you broke up with me for that reason.

22
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,920
Anyways, I'm going to read this.

23
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,210
To my hidden, great happiness, Tae Hee.

24
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,040
I'm not sure where and how to begin,

25
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,790
but I need to tell you the big mistake I've made towards you.

26
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,750
I'm going to make a long and hard confession to you.

27
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,390
While I was contemplating where to begin,

28
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,620
I started to slowly draw your face on every other page.

29
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,110
At first, I did it as an excuse to avoid confessing

30
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,370
and to get more time.

31
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,750
But I slowly started asking you in the drawings for forgiveness,

32
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,770
and they were actually comforting me instead.

33
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,330
I should've told you how much I love it when you smile.

34
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,140
I should've told you how much my heart fluttered whenever

35
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,930
I looked into your eyes, which showed your true heart.

36
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,560
I should've told you many, many times.

37
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,200
Whenever I saw you smile,

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,360
I would almost forget about all the things I did to you. But at some point,

39
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,980
I started to fear the day when all my wrongs would be revealed.

40
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,960
And each moment, everything else just passed on by.

41
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,250
It was the first time someone smiled so brightly at me.

42
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,020
If I could go back in time, instead of tempting you with lies,

43
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,660
treating you like a toy and hurting you,

44
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,290
or making you cry,

45
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,110
I would treat you with sincerity only.

46
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,050
Do you have anything you want to tell me, Shi Hyun?

47
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,440
Having the right to love you—
 I don't.

48
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,920
No...
Since when did you start liking me?

49
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,190
Even earning the right to keep these memories...

50
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,870
At some point, I ended up liking you so much

51
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,030
that I forgot about my guilt.

52
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,880
I convinced myself that I needed to tell you everything,

53
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,000
but here again, I'm drawing you today.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,260
The biggest punishment I could ever receive is

55
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,200
forgetting the memories of you.

56
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,140
The saddest punishment I could ever receive is

57
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,150
for you to remember me with hatred.

58
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,830
Even if that day does come, I hope that I can still remember your smiling face.

59
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,640
Even if you don't forgive me,

60
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,620
I hope that it will remain in my memory.

61
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,850
Now, that's my only wish. From Shi Hyun.

62
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:53,120
Shi Hyun... this isn't me.

63
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,030
It was the me that liked you.

64
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,790
The reason I was able to smile like that

65
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,940
was because you were by my side.

66
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,320
I smiled whenever I saw you.

67
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,580
So in order for me to smile again,

68
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,020
you need to wake up quickly.

69
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,060
Where are you, Sa Do Se Joo?

70
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,920
You should just follow me around. I'll show you some fun places.

71
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,270
You said that, even during snowy days and rainy days,

72
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,340
you would come and pick me up immediately

73
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,130
whenever I wanted to see you.

74
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,450
Ah, this is so hard for me. I have to come here alone now.

75
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,850
Wherever you are, you're doing well, right?

76
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,320
No matter where you are, don't be alone.

77
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,960
You should have someone by your side.

78
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,260
Let's go.

79
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,950
It's here, Doctor.

80
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,580
Call Kwon Shi Hyun's guardian immediately.

81
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,840
Will you go and take a look for me, Kyung Joo?

82
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,070
What? Oh, okay.

83
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,830
Kwon Shi Hyun? Kwon Shi Hyun? Can you hear me?

84
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,950
He just woke up.

85
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,900
It's been more than two weeks.

86
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,780
Tae Hee! He's awake.

87
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,090
Shi Hyun woke up.

88
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,020
Kwon Shi Hyun woke up?

89
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,020
He's awake now, right?

90
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,860
Please take a look at me.

91
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,620
Yes. That's good.

92
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,730
If you need anything, just hit the buzzer.

93
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,450
Tae Hee—

94
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,080
Are you really not going to see him before you leave?

95
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,420
- Yeah.
- Hey...

96
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,570
I think that, this isn't the right time for us to see each other.

97
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,800
Later on, when the both of us become really healthy,

98
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,650
until we can talk to each other without feeling hurt...

99
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,990
If I'm going to see him, I want to see him then.

100
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,910
Thanks... for crying with me.

101
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,670
Thanks for understanding my feelings.

102
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,830
Be well, my first love.

103
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,550
Tae Hee was by your side for a long time.

104
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,520
Talk about it with your mom.

105
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,060
Okay.

106
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,050
I'm sorry, Tae Hee.

107
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,380
It's okay, Mom.

108
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,410
I only just realized that liking someone doesn't go my way.

109
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,360
But I won't be shaken for too long.

110
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,360
I can't be shaken as long as you were.

111
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,290
Right. You are way stronger and better than me.

112
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,900
Anyway, I'm not leaving because I don't like you. I wish you well.

113
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,510
Happy birthday.

114
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,190
Kwon Shi Hyun.

115
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,170
You're doing well, right?

116
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,120
Kwon Shi Hyun. Choi Soo Ji.

117
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,990
Why is the youngest one always working late? Just go home already.

118
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,360
Oh...

119
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,420
I fell asleep again.

120
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,780
Sunbae.

121
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,470
When you finish all that, we need to organize the blueprints for Joo Sung.

122
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:28,640
No. I think we should take another look at the building in Paju that has an earthquake-proof blueprint. Then, after that, we need to make some adjustments.

123
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,060
No. Why is the Hang Yeong Industries suddenly making us finish this three days early?

124
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:39,690
We were in such a hurry that we ran around like crazy trying to get permission, but there isn't any word on the next payment.

125
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,030
Why are they all like that?

126
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,620
Tae Hee...

127
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:53,240
Someone who's more powerful than the creator is the landlord. Someone who's more powerful than the landlord is the building owner. Do you get it now?

128
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,060
Did I major in architecture just to be like this?

129
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,050
Oh, and Sunbae...

130
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:03,590
It's because they keep changing their mind multiples times, so it's making me all confused. The contractors are having a hard time because they keep redoing the floor.

131
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,570
You know, that isn't a simple task.

132
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,650
Aish... seriously. You workaholic. Go away!

133
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,170
What's wrong?

134
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,990
Go away...

135
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,940
Your face looks good.

136
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,040
Have you been well?

137
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,130
Your face seems worn out a bit.

138
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,110
Congratulations on your promotion.

139
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,390
How's work?

140
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,550
Well, so-so.

141
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,040
You can do well, since you're a skillful person.

142
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,280
Don't you think it's time to return to business?

143
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,310
No, Soo Ji has some time left until graduation.

144
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,910
Even though I confessed and paid for my crimes,

145
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,310
I can't help but feel uneasy about what I did.

146
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,960
Okay.

147
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,520
I like how it is right now

148
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,860
because I got the chance to figure out what was most precious to me.

149
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:30,460
Alright. It's nice to see how you're doing well. If you want to work again, just tell me. I'm sure the chairwoman will like it, too.

150
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,140
Thank you.

151
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:49,200
Why do we have so much to do just because the exhibition is big? Aigoo, you greedy person.

152
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,780
I wish they would all sell.

153
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,610
Aigoo, your daughter makes money now.

154
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,740
I'll have to marry her off.

155
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,880
Ah, seriously.

156
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,420
A bouquet of flowers has been delivered to you, ma'am.

157
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,910
Really?

158
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,980
Thanks!

159
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:23,450
No, yesterday, I finished up the terrace floor plan and confirmed the new blueprint for the rooftop. Then, I asked what kind of folding door would they like for their terrace and

160

if they can choose they color and style type, and even sent them some lighting recommendations,

161
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:35,550
but, why did they suddenly ask if the terrace is a good place to look at constellations?

162
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,730
Through an email at three in the morning, too.

163
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,810
Well, I guess the owner of the building and I have some connection or something.

164
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,850
There's communication, but why at three in the morning?

165
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,610
They are probably one of those lazy, rich people who stay up late at night to look at constellations and then wake up in the middle of the day.

166
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,980
They have to be an Aries.

167
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,610
Ah, seriously.

168
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:05,520
Yeah. They really have a connection with you. So make sure that you're the one that goes over there for the on-site survey. Alright?

Hello, Mr. Building Owner.

188
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:25,530
As you requested, your terrace is a great place to view constellations.

189
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:33,800
On the first floor, you can definitely hold an exhibition, as well as

By any chance, are you an Aries? Why, every night, do you—?

00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,880
Was that too casual?

193

I've been making the same wish each year.

You can't. It's very windy.
