3
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,639
How long more to go?

4
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:08,279
Official Fu,

5
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,279
Shang's Fort is still
half-day journey ahead.

6
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:12,719
Keep going.

7
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,599
Roger.

8
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,120
Brothers.

9
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,440
Hurry, keep going.

10
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:19,359
We must get to
Shang's Fort before it gets dark.

11
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,079
Isn't she just a normal girl?

12
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,399
It's high praise to her
that you like her.

13
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,160
If Ma Xingkong agrees to
marry his daughter to you,

14
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,959
I'll consider

15
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,920
forgetting the grudge.

16
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,440
Mother.

17
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,120
Are you serious?

18
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,160
Look at yourself.

19
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,359
It's a blessing, not a curse.

20
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,320
A curse can never be avoided.

21
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,600
Father.

22
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,799
What happened?

23
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,239
13 years ago,

24
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,120
I was cut

25
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:17,879
and hit.

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
I recovered
after half a year of recuperation.

27
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,960
Who was that person?

28
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,400
Bagua Knife, Shang Jianming.

29
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,439
Indeed.

30
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:29,600
Shang Jianming.

31
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,920
But weren't you defeated

32
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,040
in that battle?

33
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,799
In less than half a month,

34
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,879
Shang Jianming was dead.

35
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,879
Did you kill him?

36
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,880
Hu Yidao.

37
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,639
Hu Yidao.

38
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,650
(Hu Yidao)

39
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
The one on the dartboard?

40
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,040
That's simple.

41
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,519
Just clear it up

42
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,880
with Old Madam Shang.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,320
You didn't kill
Shang Jianming after all.

44
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,160
In less than five days,

45
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,519
Hu Yidao was also dead.

46
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,440
Who killed him?

47
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,440
It was Miao Renfeng.

48
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,799
Hero Ma.

49
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,679
My master invites you over.

50
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,239
Okay.

51
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,160
I'm coming.

52
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,160
Hero Ma.

53
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,959
Have your injuries recovered?

54
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,799
Thanks to your care,

55
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,959
I feel better now.

56
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,440
Where's Chunhua?

57
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:04,959
She has good character
and martial art skill.

58
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,920
I really like her.

59
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,480
You should have brought her here,

60
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,639
so we can get closer.

61
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,839
Young Lady Ma.

62
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,040
Young Master.

63
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,720
Young Lady Ma, do you know

64
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,600
why my mother wants to see your father?

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
In fact,

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,600
my mother is proposing
a marriage to you on my behalf.

67
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,000
Impossible.

68
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,760
They're talking about this right now.

69
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,679
If this marriage is approved,

70
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,280
we can be together forever.

71
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,399
Young Lady Ma.

72
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,559
Actually when I first saw you...

73
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,200
Young Master.

74
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:52,839
This is not a funny joke.

75
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,840
I'm not joking.

76
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:54,359
Look.

77
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
I've prepared a present.

78
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,999
I've brought these earrings
around for days now.

79
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:58,999
I wanted to give them to you.

80
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,439
Do you like them?

81
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,359
Take them.

82
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,879
Stop it.

83
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:08,920
Why are you touching her?

84
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,480
It's none of your business.

85
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,439
My mother and your master
are discussing our marriage.

86
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,280
Chunhua is marrying me.

87
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,720
Impossible.

88
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,239
I don't believe it.

89
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Neither do I.

90
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,040
I invited you here

91
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,840
to ask you about

92
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,679
a happy event.

93
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,439
What a coincidence.

94
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,640
I also have something

95
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,439
to talk to you about.

96
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,080
Oh.

97
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,520
Speak up, Hero Ma.

98
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,520
Listen up.

99
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,359
My daughter is getting older.

100
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,439
There's something

101
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,559
I would like to discuss with you.

102
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:51,920
Just speak up.

103
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,160
Don't be too polite.

104
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,040
Other than this daughter,

105
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,640
I only have one apprentice in my life.

106
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,199
Although

107
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:01,040
he's not talented

108
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,679
and behaves recklessly,

109
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,239
I always

110
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,559
treat him like my own son.

111
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,920
He and Chun get along well.

112
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,879
So I would like to borrow your fort

113
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,799
for their wedding.

114
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,720
This is annoying.

115
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,080
I don't want to marry him.

116
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,640
Chunhua.

117
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,559
What happened?

118
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,720
One is stubborn.

119
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:37,040
Another is childish.

120
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,840
I like neither of them.

121
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,679
If you don't like them,
don't get married.

122
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,559
Marriages are decided by parents.

123
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:43,640
You don't understand.

124
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,160
I don't understand indeed.

125
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,280
But I know how to make you happy.

126
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,280
Happy?

127
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,080
It's not as simple.

128
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,520
Ping Fei.

129
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,040
Chunhua, are you happy?

130
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm happy.

131
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,720
Higher.

132
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,879
Ping Fei.

133
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,319
Are you happy?

134
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,359
Higher!

135
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,720
Higher!

136
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,720
Higher!

137
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,960
(Military Marshal, Fu Kang'an)

138
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,640
Relax.

139
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,840
Chunhua.

140
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,040
Are you okay?

141
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,799
I'm fine.

142
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,359
Let's go.

143
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,439
Hurry.

144
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,439
Greetings, Official Fu.

145
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,920
When will Miao Renfeng be here?

146
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,479
I reckon he'll be here

147
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,360
within three days.

148
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,199
Let's go.

149
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,559
It was boring
to stay in the capital.

150
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,520
Why don't we

151
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,439
stay here for a few days?

152
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,199
I've prepared you accommodation.

153
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,799
You're welcome

154
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
to visit anytime.

155
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,559
Official Fu.

156
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,040
Old Madam Shang, please get up.

157
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,479
Please go back first.

158
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:17,479
Official Fu has duties to attend to.

159
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,199
We'll surely visit you someday.

160
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,640
Okay, I shall take my leave.

161
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,400
Fei.

162
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,559
Fei.

163
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,839
Fei.

164
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,439
Fourth Uncle.

165
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,599
I found Yan Ji's mountain fortress.

166
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,679
Great, Fourth Uncle.

167
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,640
Listen.

168
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,640
Whatever it takes,

169
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,599
we have to retrieve the saber manual

170
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:43,880
while he's injured.

171
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,479
Okay.

172
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:46,319
Let's go.

173
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:19,839
What's going on?

174
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,120
Do not enter.

175
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,000
Master.

176
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:29,880
Get out.

177
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,199
Take this.

178
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,199
If I don't get back

179
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:03,199
in 15 minutes,

180
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:03,920
escape.

181
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,719
Okay?

182
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,199
Fourth Uncle, it's better if I go.

183
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,959
Be good.

184
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,319
Fourth Uncle, be very careful.

185
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,720
(Chief of Medicine King Clan,
Master Yichen)

186
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,679
I've offended you just now,

187
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,520
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,839
Why are you here?

189
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,679
I want to know

190
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
what poison this is

191
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,799
and who did it.

192
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:31,400
Let's first talk about

193
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,880
where did this poison
on this handkerchief

194
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,959
come from?

195
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,240
13 years ago,

196
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,360
Hero of Guandong, Hu Yidao and I

197
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,520
had a martial art contest

198
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,760
at the peak of Cang Mountain.

199
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,199
It was supposed to be a pleasing fight,

200
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,319
yet it became my lifelong regret.

201
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:37,160
For 13 years,

202
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,679
I've looked around for poisoners.

203
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,479
I've finally found you.

204
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,199
Please help me.

205
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,479
I need to know

206
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,000
who poisoned Hero Hu's saber.

207
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,959
You want me to talk?

208
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,319
That's simple.

209
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,959
But I can't break my rules

210
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:01,599
because of you.

211
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,160
Tell me your rules.

212
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,679
If you're willing to
exchange your life for my words,

213
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,959
drink this.

214
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,040
I don't know

215
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,040
who poisoned it.

216
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,880
But in Medicine King Valley,

217
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,240
we never use
a poison that has no antidote.

218
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:03,959
If you don't believe me,

219
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,679
you may kill me.

220
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,400
Sorry for disturbing you.

221
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Aren't you afraid that

222
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,840
I might have poisoned the tea?

223
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,439
It's you.

224
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,519
Catch him!

225
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,239
Catch him!

226
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,959
Don't let him escape!

227
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,199
Stop.

228
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,560
Fourth Uncle, here. Hurry.

229
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,120
Rascal, why are you here?

230
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,759
Stop saying so much.

231
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,640
Run, Fourth Uncle.

232
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,360
Chase!

233
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,400
Fourth Uncle.

234
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,479
Fourth Uncle, let's go.

235
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,640
Search through the whole mountain

236
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,080
to find them.

237
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,360
Okay.

238
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,279
Okay, chase.

239
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,600
Slow down.

240
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,519
Slow down.

241
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:28,880
Fourth Uncle.

242
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,640
I can't go on.

243
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:40,160
Fourth Uncle.

244
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:43,039
Why didn't you let me
retrieve the saber manual?

245
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,439
Why did you lie to me?

246
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:49,600
You and...

247
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,679
You and...

248
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,160
You and the Saber Manual of Hu

249
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,840
are the lifeblood of Hu Family.

250
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:08,920
I...

251
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,239
I can't go on.

252
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:12,840
No, Fourth Uncle.

253
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,199
I can't let you die.

254
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,800
We'll find a way.

255
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:22,719
I'll drag you back
if that's the only way.

256
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:26,600
I have something to tell you.

257
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:29,640
In those days,

258
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:31,999
if it weren't for your father,

259
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:35,640
I would have been long dead.

260
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:37,560
Remember.

261
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:39,920
Practise your martial art.

262
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,039
When you grow up,

263
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,160
find Miao Renfeng

264
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,679
and avenge your father.

265
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,719
Be like your father,

266
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:55,719
be a forthright

267
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,800
hero.

268
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,959
Promise me.

269
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,160
Promise me.

270
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,039
Remember.

271
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Stay alive.

272
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,360
Only when you're alive...

273
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,679
alive...

274
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:17,360
can you avenge.

275
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:24,959
Fourth Uncle.

276
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,279
Fourth Uncle.

277
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:28,080
Fourth Uncle, get up.

278
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:29,279
Don't sleep.

279
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,640
Fourth Uncle.

280
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:33,759
Fourth Uncle, get up.

281
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,640
Fourth Uncle.

282
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,279
There are only
three paths down the mountain.

283
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,920
Going upwards leads to cliffs.

284
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,160
He's with an injured.

285
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,160
I don't think he can fly.

286
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,519
Split up and search.

287
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,080
Roger.

288
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:48,959
Fourth Uncle.

289
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,920
I'll surely be back.

290
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,080
Over there.

291
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:05,759
Chase!

292
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:06,719
Chase!

293
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,160
Stop!

294
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,039
Rascal!

295
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:14,160
Stop right there.

296
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,120
Stop!

297
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,199
Stop!

298
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,880
Stop right there!

299
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,759
Stop!

300
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,640
Stop right there!

301
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:27,679
Stop!

302
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:30,920
Stop right there!

303
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:42,519
Lad.

304
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,840
You can run.

305
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,640
Keep running.

306
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,719
Are you Hu Yidao's son?

307
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,039
You don't deserve
to mention my father's name.

308
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,279
Rascal.

309
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:54,679
You're lucky.

310
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Give me the saber manual.

311
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,439
Dream on.

312
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,120
Search down there.

313
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,239
I want to see him, alive or dead.

314
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,920
If he's not dead,

315
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,719
we won't live in peace.

316
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:41,880
-Okay.
-Yes.

317
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Let's go.

Madam Shang.

320
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,279
Long time no see.

321
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,519
Are you well?

322
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:04,719
I'm well.

323
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,279
Greetings, uncles.

324
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,880
You've grown up.

325
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,479
What a handsome young man.

326
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,560
A young hero indeed.

327
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,600
Here.

328
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,120
Let me introduce the seniors to you.

Greetings, Madam Shang.

You're too nice.

337

Here, this way.

As Official Fu has arrived today,

I have a favor to ask.

343
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,800
I hope you can help.

Old Madam Shang.

345
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,719
What's the matter?

346
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,880
Please take Zhen along

347
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,160
when you kill Miao Renfeng.

348
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:06,719
I want him to kill Miao Renfeng

349
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:07,880
to avenge his father.

350
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,039
Bring them up.

351
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:30,120
Just a small thought.

352
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:31,600
Please accept.

353
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,400
We shouldn't receive
any rewards without credits.

354
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:37,239
This is inappropriate.

355
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,800
This isn't from me,

356
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,039
it's from my late husband, Jianming.

357
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,400
It's you?

358
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,920
Your clothes are still wet.

359
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:43,479
Wear mine.

360
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,400
Miao Renfeng?

361
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:55,320
You're a disaster to me.

362
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,320
That rascal is with you.

363
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,640
This is bad.

364
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,400
We've been through life and death.

365
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
We aren't heartless.

366
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,160
But without Official Fu's permission,

367
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,199
we don't dare to take Zhen along

368
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,519
to arrest Miao Renfeng.

369
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:14,920
Zhen.

370
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,400
Kneel down.

371
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,560
Beg fellow seniors

372
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,080
to accept your father's thoughts.

373
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:25,479
Old Madam Shang.

374
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,199
What does this mean?

375
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,679
Miao Renfeng

376
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,600
will surely fight hard
to refuse the arrest.

377
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,279
Weapons are blind.

378
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,640
If he's killed by an accidental strike,

379
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,640
that wouldn't be disobedience.

380
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,120
Kowtow.

381
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,120
As long as they don't agree,

382
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,360
you have to keep kowtowing.

383
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:57,120
Why am I here?

384
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:59,320
I saved you from the water.

385
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,519
Look at how bad you're injured.

386
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,759
Your family will be worried.

387
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,239
Do you like to fight?

388
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:14,039
I've saved you after all.

389
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,519
Why are you so hostile to me?

390
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,320
Do you have many enemies?

391
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,759
Being in the martial art world,

392
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,519
you have few choices.

393
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,479
Old Madam Shang,

394
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,239
why are you doing this?

395
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,120
Here.

396
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:39,080
Zhen.

397
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,800
Get up.

398
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:49,640
Old Madam Shang.

399
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,320
Jianming and I are from the same school.

400
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:53,560
As brothers,

401
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,719
we'll surely

402
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,679
avenge him.

403
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:58,400
That's right, Old Madam Shang.

404
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,840
The two of us

405
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:02,199
have never forgotten this grudge.

406
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,400
I thank you

407
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,560
on behalf of my late husband.

408
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:13,360
Let's go to the side hall.

409
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:15,160
I've prepared some wine

410
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,519
to show my gratitude.

411
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:21,199
Thank you, Old Madam Shang.

412
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:22,999
It's chilly today.

413
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:24,679
Drink some.

414
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,279
Don't you dare?

415
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,679
Where did you learn the techniques

416
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,600
you used on me?

417
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,360
Your master isn't so great.

418
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,640
Anyway,

419
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,120
I didn't learn from you.

420
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:58,279
Do you want a new master?

421
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,439
I'll never

422
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:01,439
have you as my master.

423
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:03,800
Why?

424
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:05,239
Your martial art skill isn't so great.

425
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,080
What are you laughing about?

426
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,320
It's nothing.

427
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,279
You can think about it for a few days.

428
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,279
You don't have to answer now.

429
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:21,360
If you're really great,

430
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:23,360
you don't need to blow your own trumpet.

431
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:26,239
That's right.

432
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,080
Drink slowly.

433
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:38,999
Leader Chen, please stay.

434
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,920
Is there anything else?

435
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,280
My son has been fond of martial art

436
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,360
and he's smart.

437
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:51,039
He's greatly influenced by Bagua Knife.

438
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,999
My lifelong dream

439
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,639
is to have my son
follow his father's aspiration

440
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,880
to work for Official Fu.

441
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,079
Please put in some good words for him.

442
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,760
The offspring of
a previous subordinate is coming back.

443
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,920
Official Fu is certainly happy about it.

444
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,599
However...

445
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:12,519
Leave.

446
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,119
This is

447
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,039
all I have.

448
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,959
I'll try my best

449
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,599
to complete what you ask.

450
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,720
In fact,

451
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,519
what I can do is secondary.

452
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,959
If you can

453
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,880
do something for Official Fu,

454
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,999
it'll be easier for me to talk to him.

455
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:44,999
However,

456
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,079
Official Fu doesn't lack wealth.

457
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,320
I don't know what to do.

458
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,519
You drank it up.

459
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:26,360
I won't drink your wine for nothing.

460
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,880
Remember.

461
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,639
I'm not acknowledging you as my master.

462
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,760
A real man is upstanding and dauntless.

463
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,999
What are you doing?

464
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,639
You want to die?

465
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,320
Can you hit him for sure?

466
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,240
Boss, what should we do?

467
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,880
Did you see that horse?

468
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,159
It's a horse of Old Madam Shang.

469
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,320
Go back first.

470
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,240
I have an idea.

471
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,360
Young Lady Ma,
Old Madam Shang wants to see you.

472
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,039
Okay.

473
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,119
I'll kill you when I grow up.

474
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,720
I'll kill you.

475
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,559
Jianming.

476
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,959
I'm staunch,

477
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,920
but in order to avenge you

478
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,519
and for the sake of our son's future,

479
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,439
I...

480
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:55,760
I became so filthy.

481
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,039
Official.

482
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:19,039
Official.

483
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:21,720
Are you unhappy?

484
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:22,999
This mean

485
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,479
is too obscene.
