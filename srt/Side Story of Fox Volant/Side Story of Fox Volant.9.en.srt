00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,730
Hero Hu and young lady,

4
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,530
this is where I usually
pick medicinal herbs

5
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,500
and stop for a rest.

6
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,370
This is a secluded place
and is off the beaten track.

7
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,660
They won't find this place.

8
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,020
Thank you, Physician Xu.

9
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,250
The injury on
Hero Hu's leg is very serious.

10
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,730
It must be treated immediately.

11
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,690
I'll get

12
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,020
some herbs later.

13
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,210
Both of you shall stay in the house.

14
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,730
All right.

15
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,410
Press the third and pluck the fourth.

16
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,130
Press the third and pluck the fourth.

17
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,130
Press the fifth and pluck the sixth.

18
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,450
Press the fifth and pluck the sixth.

19
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,020
Press the fourth and pluck the fifth.

20
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,170
Press the fourth and pluck the fifth.

21
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,250
Press the second and pluck the fifth.

22
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,860
Master, I'll get another string.

23
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,890
No need.

24
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,090
Others overuse their hands
when learning the qin.

25
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,060
Leader Tian, you overuse
the strings when learning the qin.

26
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,220
My hands are used to holding weapons,
I can't control my strength.

27
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,060
Leader Tian, if you want to

28
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,450
show your talents in
the four arts to your friends,

29
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,060
I suggest that you
learn something easier.

Run.

36
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,140
Run, quick!

37
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,820
Run!

38
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,300
My legs...

39
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,020
I can't walk anymore.

40
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,420
Run, don't care about me.

41
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,820
I don't want to burden you.

42
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,650
Run.

43
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,610
If you had listened to my advice,

44
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,330
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

45
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,210
No! Run.

46
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,210
Stop!

47
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:01,820
Quick.

48
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,890
Stop!

49
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,490
Stop!

50
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,020
Kneel!

51
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,610
Young Master.

52
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,420
This old jerk is a friend
of the Zhong Family.

53
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,820
He has treated Mrs. Zhong before.

54
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,860
So it was you.

55
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,930
Well, no effort was required.

56
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,650
Take him away.

57
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,140
Young Master Feng!

58
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,730
I really don't know anything!

59
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,610
Young Master Feng!

60
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,700
You're awake.

61
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,850
Enough of the holding.

62
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,450
Was it you who saved me?

63
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,500
Who else could it be?

64
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,890
Thank god.

65
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,020
Fortunately, it was just a dream.

66
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,060
In my dream,

67
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,850
both of us were caught by them.

68
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,140
You don't know how worried I was.

69
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,090
After that?

70
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,700
Of course, I told you to run.

71
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,580
You can't be staying there

72
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,290
and letting others catch you.

73
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,770
Luckily, you weren't that silly.

74
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,020
You knew that you shouldn't
fall into other people's traps.

75
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,770
What a dream you had.

76
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,380
Everyone else was silly.

77
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,850
You kept the heroic
moments for yourself.

78
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,180
In your dream,

79
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,580
did you say you would cover me?

80
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,260
How did you know?

81
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,330
That... That wasn't a dream.

82
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,820
If I had known
that you're so conscienceless,

83
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,620
I would have left you alone.

84
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,700
Are you shocked?

85
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,820
It seems I have to follow you around

86
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,970
and be your bodyguard in the future.

87
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,530
Only when I save you

88
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,580
can I return the favour to you.

89
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,020
Who needs your protection?

90
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,650
I came to give you this.

91
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,970
Didn't you say that you
want to get even with me?

92
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,180
I have to treat your injury first,

93
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,090
then train you for years

94
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,890
before you can defeat me.

95
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,890
You don't have to.

96
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,820
Even if I had a stroke,

97
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,450
I would still be able to defeat you,

98
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,740
let alone have an injured leg.

99
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,020
Feng Yiming should have
cut your tongue as well

100
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,820
so that you couldn't
say things that upset others.

101
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,140
Bear with the pain.

102
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,820
I'm going to put the splints.

103
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:03,890
Don't worry.

104
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,890
If I shout...

105
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:06,700
I...

106
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,820
I didn't shout.

107
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,620
She hadn't been given
any food for three days.

108
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,740
Folks.

109
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,740
Did you see that?

110
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,970
This immoral physician's collusion

111
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,020
with the thief, Hu Fei

112
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,700
was discovered by me.

113
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,450
If any of you

114
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,380
know the whereabouts of the two mutts,

115
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,180
inform me

116
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,700
and you'll get a big reward.

117
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,140
However, if you fail
to report the truth,

118
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,090
you'll end up like this as well.

119
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,620
All of you in the Feng Family
take advantage

120
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,650
of your power and wealth
to bully others and cause great harm.

121
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,060
Everyone in Foshan

122
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,140
has been bullied by you.

123
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,210
God is never blind to your tears.

124
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,090
You'll get the retribution soon.

125
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,330
Old fella.

126
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,650
How dare you spit on me?

127
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,530
Aren't you looking for me?

128
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,930
I'm here.

129
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,020
Catch her!

130
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,690
Young Lady, you'd better leave!

131
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,050
Why did you leave for so long?

132
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,570
Who is this?

133
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,690
Did you forget?

134
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,930
He is Physician Xu, Zhong Asi's friend.

135
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,740
He has treated Mrs. Zhong before.

136
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,650
Physician Xu, why are you here?

137
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,930
All thanks to
this heroine for saving me.

138
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,290
My clinical skills are just mediocre.

139
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,810
I invited Physician Xu here

140
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,500
to treat you.

141
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,100
All right,
we should start the treatment.

142
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,810
Do you want to tell me?

143
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,770
Do you want to tell me?

144
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
Crazy woman.

145
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,650
Do you want to tell me?

146
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,340
Crazy woman.

147
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,570
Tell me, where are they hiding?

148
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,890
Young Master, please calm down.

149
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,020
She's crazy, what does she know?

150
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,930
We shall wait and see!

151
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,050
Father.

152
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,930
I'm useless.

153
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,980
The two of them escaped.

154
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,460
I told you already.

155
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,140
The two of them are no ordinary people.

156
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,100
The lady has appeared.

157
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,290
What does that mean?

158
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,930
It means they haven't
given up on Mrs. Zhong.

159
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,290
There's still a chance for us.

160
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,810
However...

161
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,290
Father,

162
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,620
the martial arts masters
that you found were useless.

163
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,690
She escaped right under

164
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,890
our eyes.

165
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,170
Take it easy.

166
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,770
Two Great Cavaliers
hadn't displayed their skills.

167
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,690
Otherwise, she would have died.

168
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,410
Well.

169
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,220
Tomorrow, we'll cut off one of her legs.

170
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,290
Cut another the day after tomorrow.

171
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,050
Then cut off her hands.

172
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,740
Make her a human swine.

173
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,650
Even if we couldn't catch that lady,

174
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,220
both of us could still show

175
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,220
our might in Foshan.

176
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,530
San.

177
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,930
Physician Xu,

178
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,620
thank you for taking the trouble.

179
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,980
Heroine, don't worry.

180
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,530
I'll surely send Hero Hu
to Weituo Sect.

181
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,650
Why are you making such requests?

182
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,740
Did I agree?

183
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,530
I didn't say that I want to go.

184
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,290
Hero Hu.

185
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,050
Didn't the heroine say just now?

186
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,170
The injury on your leg is too serious.

187
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,890
Our skills are limited.

188
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,770
Even if we could treat it,

189
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,050
we dare not guarantee that
there wouldn't be any side effects.

190
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,890
Therefore, we have to ask for help
from some greater masters.

191
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,220
It's nothing if I'm handicapped.

192
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,690
My arms are still fine anyway.

193
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,460
I could still use a blade.

194
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,930
It's wrong to say so.

195
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,890
As someone who practices martial arts,

196
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,980
being handicapped

197
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,890
will hold up your training progress.

198
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,410
Exactly.

199
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,690
Your Acrobatic Jumping is already weaker than me,

200
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,980
now that you're lame,

201
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,100
you won't be able to catch up with me.

202
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,100
Is my Acrobatic Jumping weak?

203
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,740
Wait for my leg to recover.

204
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,810
We shall have a match.

205
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
I don't want to bully you.

206
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,810
So, go to Weituo Sect
and treat your injured leg.

207
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
I'm here anytime.

208
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,140
The carriage and horse are ready.

209
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,380
You shall depart
when the sun rises tomorrow.

210
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,770
Hand this to them.

211
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,810
They will treat you
with the best medicine.

212
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,530
What about you?

213
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,930
Why aren't you going?

214
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,290
Are you scared to be alone?

215
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,290
I still have something to do.

216
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:24,980
Tell me.

217
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,020
Do you plan

218
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,140
to seek revenge from Feng?

219
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,170
The two scoundrels

220
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,410
are not worth my effort.

221
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,220
Tell me then, what do you plan to do?

222
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,140
Can't I return to Tian Mountain?

223
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,860
Don't ask about
the matters of other sects.

224
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,220
It's a taboo in the martial arts world.

225
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,530
You and I are just acquaintances.

226
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,180
Don't think that we are that close.

227
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,940
Zheng! Young Lady!

228
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,570
Don't talk so much on the way.

229
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,700
Listen to Physician Xu.

230
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,460
All right.

231
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,420
Take care.

232
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,770
I'm leaving.

233
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,260
Aren't you supporting me anymore?

234
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,330
Watch out.

235
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,460
You should at least

236
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,420
tell me your name.

237
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,130
After you recover and come back,

238
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,610
I'll tell you.

239
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,850
Physician Xu, thank you.

240
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,050
Don't worry, Young Lady.

241
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,460
I'll come back and meet you.

242
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,050
That young lady looks cool
but has a warm heart.

243
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,610
It's rare to see a kind person like her.

244
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,770
It's a pity though.

245
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,850
What do you mean?

246
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,460
No, you heard it wrongly.

247
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,260
I said next month is in two days.

248
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,660
I'm on a vegetarian diet
on the first day of every month.

249
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,740
Physician Xu,

250
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,260
I heard you talking
about the young lady just now.

251
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,220
What's the pity?

252
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,770
I know you're missing the heroine.

253
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,770
One's charity shall be rewarded.

254
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,130
There's a mantou stall.

255
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,260
I'll buy a few for us
to eat during the journey.

256
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,700
Wait for me here.

257
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,700
I'll buy some mantou.

258
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,740
Sir, what do you want?

259
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,090
I'll have five.

260
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:34,980
Sure.

261
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,610
Stop! Come back!

262
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,570
Come back!

263
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,740
Sir, you haven't paid!

264
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,900
Stop! Come back!

265
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,980
Come back!

266
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,810
Tell the father and son
in the Feng Family

267
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,420
to release Mrs. Zhong immediately.

268
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,290
Otherwise, I'll bring
a bloodbath in Foshan Town

269
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,420
to kill all of you,
the scum of the martial arts world!

270
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,220
Your Honor!

271
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,460
Your Honor!

272
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:04,700
Your Honor!

273
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,420
There's bad news.

274
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,290
What happened?

275
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,850
Someone is causing an uproar in Foshan.

276
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,740
Probably the two
maleficent people are here again.

277
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,700
Guards!

278
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,020
Your Honor, what do you need?

279
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,660
Close the main door!

280
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,370
Vile official!

281
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,500
Capture her!

282
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,740
Don't come here!

283
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,260
Go!

284
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,420
Bring that crazy lady to me!

285
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,980
Release Mrs. Zhong!

286
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,220
Otherwise, I'll kill this vile official!

287
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,180
You could have walked heaven's road

288
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,530
but you chose the hell's route.

289
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,610
I was worried that I couldn't find you

290
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,740
but you came here yourself.

291
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,850
Luck is on my side.

292
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,090
Feng.

293
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,130
Let's make an exchange.

294
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,330
One for one.

295
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,530
Young Master Feng.

296
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,260
Help!

297
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,370
You're still too immature.

298
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,660
Now it's hard for you to escape.

299
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,460
Why?

300
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,810
Do you plan to die together?

301
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,020
Young Master Feng!

302
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,770
You mustn't ignore this!

303
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,500
Give me the arrow!

304
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,740
Feng Yiming!

305
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,770
Don't do that!

306
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,530
Let me tell you.

307
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,180
I know all the bad deeds

308
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,260
you did in the past.

309
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,420
Since you are heartless,

310
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,700
don't blame me for my disloyalty!

311
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,330
Those are enough to kill
nine clans in your family!

312
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,660
Don't shoot!

313
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,700
Yiming, stop wasting time with him.

314
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,850
We can negotiate!

315
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,570
Shoot!

316
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,330
Five Heroes of the Cui Family
in Rocky Beach welcome you.

317
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,610
I thought you were someone powerful.

318
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,020
Apparently, you're just a young brat.

319
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,980
We have no enmity against each other.

320
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,130
I just want to
seek revenge on Feng Tiannan.

321
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,570
I don't want to harm the innocent.

322
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,530
You sound so arrogant.

323
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,260
Are you even able to hurt our men?

324
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,220
Don't waste time with him.

325
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,610
Bring him to Old Master Feng.

326
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,180
His head is worth 10000 taels of silver.

327
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,290
Kill him!

328
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,050
Do you

329
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,460
still have a hostage now?

330
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,290
Go!

331
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,810
Give way!

332
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:21,940
She's mine!

333
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,180
I didn't expect

334
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,180
that you have trained
Shenlong Whip to such a level.

335
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,220
Even the Two Great Cavaliers

336
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,090
are willing to be
the lackeys of the Feng Family.

337
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,850
What an eye-opener.

338
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,420
Ignorant brat.

339
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,940
You're too young to be my opponent.

340
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,500
Everyone! Kill her!

341
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,180
Old Master, something bad
happened on the street.

342
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,420
That young man also invaded here.

343
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
It's good that he came.

344
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,260
I was worrying that he wouldn't come.

345
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,980
Hero, please do not come any closer.

346
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,330
Hero, please have mercy.

347
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,530
Please!

348
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,660
Do not come any closer.

349
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,740
Hero, please go back!

350
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,570
Go back!

351
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,130
Hero, you'll bring us trouble.

352
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,610
Old Master Feng

353
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,460
said that he will burn our houses

354
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,660
and kill our families

355
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,940
if we let you pass.

356
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,570
Yes, Hero. Please leave!

357
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,370
Hero, please!

358
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:35,980
Leave.

359
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,420
You can leave for good,

360
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,770
but all our family members are here.

361
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,130
Please put yourself in our shoes.

362
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,980
Yes, Hero. Please leave!

363
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,500
Please!

364
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,090
We really have no choice.

365
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,850
Run!

366
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,500
Run.

367
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,090
(Run!)

368
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,810
(Run!)

369
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,810
(Father!)

370
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,020
How come this brat is still alive?

371
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,130
It seems he's in high spirits!

372
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,500
Why are you here?

373
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,020
Since you can come, why can't I?

374
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,770
Does your family own Foshan?

375
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,330
Didn't I ask you to go to Weituo Sect?

376
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,980
Don't you think you could
deceive me using such little tricks?

377
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,500
It's just that I don't want
to expose your lie.

378
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,330
What about your leg?

379
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,220
It recovered long ago.

380
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:24,900
Help me!

381
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,290
Are you all right?

382
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,610
Stop pretending.

383
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,740
Do you think you're a hero?

384
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,980
Are you shifting the blame?

385
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:42,980
You'll be handicapped.

386
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,420
I'll have to marry you then

387
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,420
to let you take care of me forever.

388
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,050
In your dreams.

389
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,660
You haven't told me your name.

390
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,570
I'll tell you if we survive.

391
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,770
If we have to die today,

392
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,700
I'll surely die before you.

393
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,420
Feng Tiannan.

394
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,940
Today, I'll seek revenge for
the four people in the Zhong Family.

395
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,050
I'd like to widen my knowledge.

396
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,210
Since you're so strong,

397
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,090
how many can you kill?

398
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:10,860
Come!

399
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,780
Bring those

400
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,460
lackeys here!

401
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:37,050
-Old Master Feng!
-Old Master Feng!

402
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:44,500
-Old Master Feng!
-Old Master Feng!

403
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,170
Mr. Hu, can you see that?

404
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,530
I don't even have to use my own hands.

405
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,610
I'm afraid they might get dirty.

406
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,900
If each of them spat on you,

407
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,570
you could be drowned.

408
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,940
If each of them threw a stone at you,

409
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,610
they could hit you to death.

410
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,090
Folks.

411
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,900
This Mr. Hu

412
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,210
is an outsider!

413
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,460
Ever since he came to Foshan,

414
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,570
we hadn't had peace since then!

415
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,940
Folks.

416
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:23,980
Beat him up!

417
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,940
If you give him a punch,
I'll reward you with ten taels.

418
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
If you beat him to death,

419
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,650
I'll reward you with ten thousand taels.
