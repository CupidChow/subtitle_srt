=Side Story Of Fox Volant=
(Adapted from Jin Yong's novel)

=Episode 20=

3
00:01:43,998 --> 00:01:45,277
If you continue steaming,

4
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:46,998
Xiaotie will be cooked.

5
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:49,037
This isn't working.

6
00:01:49,638 --> 00:01:50,718
It only eases the symptoms.

7
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:55,598
She blocked the exit
from the outside.

8
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:57,958
She is purging the sect.

9
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:01,238
Did you see our Master's will?

10
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:03,958
He expelled us.
We are no longer his disciples.

11
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:05,317
Alright.

12
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,438
The Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis is strong

13
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,597
but won't kill us.

14
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:11,397
Initially,

15
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:13,717
we built this underground shelter

16
00:02:15,798 --> 00:02:17,397
because poisonous smoke

17
00:02:17,397 --> 00:02:18,478
rises.

18
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,318
I have

19
00:02:20,677 --> 00:02:22,638
never seen poisonous smoke
that drifts downward.

20
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:28,117
This is their only vent
to the outside.

21
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:44,518
I have never

22
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:46,198
seen anything so amazing.

23
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:48,518
This vent is like a chimney

24
00:02:48,798 --> 00:02:50,758
but a chimney can't vent the fog

25
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:51,557
to the inside.

26
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:52,918
This is the first time

27
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:54,918
I see fog drifting downward.

28
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,638
Young Lady Ling,
you are remarkable.

29
00:02:57,638 --> 00:02:58,758
How did you do this?

30
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:00,358
Didn't you say I am remarkable?

31
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:01,958
This is my secret.

32
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:05,277
Please help me.

33
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:06,918
Alright.

34
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:29,117
Should I block the vent?

35
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:32,918
We can rely on our inner force

36
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:34,518
but what about Xiaotie?

37
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:45,958
Young Lady Ling,

38
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:47,557
do you and your seniors

39
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:49,358
have unresolved hatred?

40
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:51,038
No.

41
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:54,518
Did your late master order you

42
00:03:54,597 --> 00:03:55,918
to purge the sect?

43
00:03:56,677 --> 00:03:58,717
It isn't necessary at this point.

44
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:01,397
If,

45
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:02,997
I mean if,

46
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:04,798
if your seniors

47
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:06,597
did not commit any heinous crime,

48
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,078
will you

49
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:09,397
spare their lives

50
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:10,958
and let them start over?

51
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:13,877
Yes.

52
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:15,597
My master said the same.

53
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:17,277
You two would have a lot

54
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:19,638
to chat about had you met.

55
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:22,518
So, this fog

56
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:24,078
doesn't kill people. Right?

57
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:26,558
Hero Hu, do you

58
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,797
want to show them mercy?

59
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:30,558
I'm saving lives,

60
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:31,758
not hurting people.

61
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:35,597
Let the candle burn until here.

62
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:36,397
Watch the candle.

63
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:36,958
Alright.

64
00:04:37,998 --> 00:04:38,837
Let me do it.

65
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:40,797
You all rest.

66
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:42,717
Thank you, Brother Wang.

67
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:43,958
Appreciate it.

68
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:44,797
Alright.

69
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:48,758
Here.

70
00:05:03,357 --> 00:05:04,237
Young Lady Ling.

71
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:07,797
Who let his horse
trample your flowerbed?

72
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:10,878
The Second Eldest Senior's son,

73
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:11,878
Jiang Xiaotie.

74
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:13,878
Is he down there too?

75
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:14,758
Yes.

76
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:17,118
We're doing our best to save him.

77
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:18,998
My seniors will faint

78
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:20,717
and won't get in our way.

79
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:22,237
I understand.

80
00:05:22,878 --> 00:05:23,678
The couple

81
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:25,277
don't believe you'll save Xiaotie.

82
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:27,037
We have no other choice but

83
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:28,318
make them faint.

84
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:30,758
They have an enemy

85
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:32,118
who has been here for six months.

86
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:34,797
He tried but can't neutralise
the Blood Chinquapin poison

87
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:36,078
and can't charge in either.

88
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:38,717
The corpses you saw

89
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:39,998
were mostly the enemy's men.

90
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:42,438
The blue flowers I planted

91
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:43,797
can counter the Chinquapin poison.

92
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:44,917
They didn't know that

93
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:46,678
until you and Xiaomei

94
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:47,878
wore the blue flowers

95
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:49,438
and became immune to the poison.

96
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:50,518
They finally understood.

97
00:05:53,157 --> 00:05:54,558
Originally, the Blood Chinquapin poison

98
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,157
had no cure

99
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:00,118
but if you keep eating
the fruits on the ground,

100
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:02,237
the poison will not harm you.

101
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:03,438
Luckily,

102
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:06,198
the poison is powerful
but is easily identified.

103
00:06:06,477 --> 00:06:07,878
When the fruits grow,

104
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:09,037
no insect will go

105
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:11,078
within ten steps of them.

106
00:06:11,078 --> 00:06:11,958
You will notice them.

107
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:14,078
In hindsight,

108
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:15,237
I should thank you

109
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:17,078
for giving me the blue flowers.

110
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:19,558
My blue flowers

111
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,638
are an experimental new species.

112
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:22,837
I'm glad

113
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:25,157
that you didn't discard them
on the way here.

114
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,078
The brilliant blooms

115
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:29,318
are rather pretty.

116
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,237
Luckily, they're pretty.

117
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:33,597
If not,

118
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:35,758
you would have thrown them away.

119
00:06:36,157 --> 00:06:36,998
How could I?

120
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:39,878
Young Lady Cheng, it's done.

121
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:41,717
Brother Wang,

122
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:43,717
the Second Eldest Senior
won't faint so fast.

123
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:44,837
Wait a bit before going in.

124
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:46,917
Please open the door first.

125
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:47,597
Alright.

126
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:54,958
The Chaenomeles sinensis poison
is colourless and odourless.

127
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:56,397
Even in the house,

128
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:57,797
you won't notice it.

129
00:06:58,638 --> 00:06:59,438
If one of us

130
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:02,397
faint, it is here.

131
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:05,438
Don't worry.

132
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:08,318
We have enough food in here.

133
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:10,037
We can charge when we get a chance.

134
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:11,958
If Xiaotie dies,

135
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:13,198
I'll kill her.

136
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:14,157
Xue Que!

137
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,118
Xue Que!

138
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:20,357
Xue Que!

139
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:37,558
Young Lady Cheng.

140
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:38,597
It's opened.

141
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:40,237
Let's go.

142
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:40,878
Alright.

143
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:52,198
Brother Hu,

144
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:53,837
do you still have the blue flowers?

145
00:07:57,758 --> 00:07:58,518
Young Lady Ling,

146
00:07:58,518 --> 00:07:59,397
you have a sharp nose.

147
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:00,878
You can smell it in my clothes.

148
00:08:02,237 --> 00:08:03,277
You didn't lie

149
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:04,318
about cherishing them.

150
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:09,198
The people inside often eat
Blood Chinquapin.

151
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,518
The blue flowers counter it.

152
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:11,717
They might not tolerate them.

153
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:23,397
My seniors intend

154
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:24,998
to neutralise the poison in Xiaotie.

155
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:27,797
Without the Seven Pistil
Chaenomeles sinensis,

156
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:28,477
they can't do it fully.

157
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,717
Brother Hu, please get more firewood.

158
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:35,517
Alright.

159
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:25,997
Brother Wang, do it now

160
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:27,357
or it'll be too late for revenge.

161
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:28,837
Yes.

162
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:33,438
What are you doing?

163
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:34,038
Tieshan.

164
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:35,997
We need a favour from Lingsu.

165
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:37,798
Can't you take a few blows?

166
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:45,597
Alright.

167
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:47,117
Bring it on.

168
00:09:54,398 --> 00:09:55,837
You seized my land,

169
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:00,477
and forced me to build the Iron Nest.

170
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:02,798
I'll beat you to death.

171
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:05,038
I'll beat you to death.

172
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,637
You also beat me

173
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:08,558
and broke three of my ribs.

174
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:10,597
I was bedridden for half a year.

175
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:14,997
You get what you deserve.

176
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:16,398
I'll beat you to death.

177
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:20,198
You deserve this!

178
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:36,958
Xue Que,
return the land to Brother Wang.

179
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:38,798
On my behalf,

180
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,198
please don't seek revenge from him.

181
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:44,117
Fine.

182
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:46,318
We won't waste time on him.

183
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:47,198
Alright.

184
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:50,678
Brother Wang, please go up

185
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:52,198
and open the vent again.

186
00:10:53,357 --> 00:10:54,198
Right away.

187
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,038
Young Lady Ling, I'll help Brother Wang.

188
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:50,798
When you leave here,

189
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:52,597
your enemies will intercept
and pursue you.

190
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:57,837
These three Drunken Fragrance stalks
contain the Chaenomeles sinensi.

191
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,398
It will stop your enemies

192
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:01,477
but not kill them and add new revenge.

193
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:05,078
Thank you, Lingsu.

194
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,117
That is so thoughtful of you.

195
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:09,678
I saw your enemies

196
00:12:09,757 --> 00:12:11,477
died of the Ghost Bat poison.

197
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:14,278
Xiaotie, you are so cruel.

198
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:16,798
Our sect disapproves of
the use of deadly poisons.

199
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:19,997
Lingsu, Xiaotie made a big mistake.

200
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:21,318
For that,

201
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:22,477
I've punished him.

202
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:24,477
Look.

203
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:32,078
Let's go.

204
00:12:33,717 --> 00:12:35,038
Our sect excels in using poison

205
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,558
but other people despise us.

206
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:40,318
Therefore, disciples of this sect
must never harm others

207
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:42,798
with deadly poisons that have no cure.

208
00:12:42,877 --> 00:12:43,438
Yes.

209
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:45,278
Tieshan, Xue Que,

210
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,637
wherever you go,

211
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:49,597
remember the Master's teachings.

212
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:51,078
Till we meet again.

213
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:01,357
What's your last name?

214
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:03,278
Hu.

215
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:04,558
Master Hu,

216
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:05,517
please treat

217
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:07,597
Young Lady Cheng well your whole life.

218
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:11,877
Brother Wang,
I've known her for a day only.

219
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:12,877
One day?

220
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:14,237
You lied.

221
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:17,438
Why is she so nice to you
after only one day?

222
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:19,477
Even a fool can see that.

223
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:20,837
Wouldn't I notice that?

224
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:22,997
Brother Wang, you misunderstood.

225
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:26,757
She is smart and good-natured.

226
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:29,078
Moreover, she has skills.

227
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:31,078
She is sincere with you.

228
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:33,798
You should listen to her
for the rest of your life

229
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,078
and make her happy.

230
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:36,318
We...

231
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:38,158
Ready?

232
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:39,717
-Let's go.
-We're ready.

233
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:40,678
Alright.

234
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:42,117
Here.

235
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:43,158
Let's go.

236
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:02,438
Martial sister!

237
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:09,877
Lingsu!

238
00:14:10,038 --> 00:14:11,278
What is it, Tieshan?

239
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,757
Lingsu,
the three stalks of Drunken Fragrance

240
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:17,877
require three people of equal ability

241
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:20,237
to use together to defeat the enemies

242
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,318
but Xiaotie's capability is still weak.

243
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,517
I would like to ask you...

244
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:28,237
ask you...

245
00:14:28,237 --> 00:14:30,038
The Eldest Senior is in that basket.

246
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:32,517
The essential oil
of Chaenomeles sinensis

247
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:33,717
will neutralise his poison.

248
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:35,837
Second Eldest Senior,

249
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,517
why don't you take
the opportunity to reconcile with him?

250
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,717
He will help you beat the enemies.

251
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:43,318
Lingsu, you're so thoughtful

252
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:47,357
and considerate to my family.

253
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:48,637
Second Eldest Senior,

254
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:50,997
your head and face have been bloodied.

255
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,237
Consequently, the poison on you
has dissipated.

256
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:54,997
Don't blame me for being nasty.

257
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:57,357
Take care of Xiaotie.

258
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:02,877
Young Lady Cheng,

259
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,038
I'm leaving too.

260
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:16,438
Young Lady Ling,

261
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:18,357
the Second Eldest Senior

262
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:20,158
was beaten until he bled

263
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:21,837
but he is still grateful to you

264
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:23,038
mainly

265
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:24,877
because Brother Wang
got to vent his anger.

266
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,637
This is the best outcome.

267
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:27,837
Only you can come up with the idea.

268
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:45,958
She...

269
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:46,637
Don't worry.

270
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,637
She'll wake up in about 15 minutes.

271
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:05,997
Young Lady Ling.

272
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:07,798
How was Xiaotie poisoned by

273
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,318
the Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis?

274
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:11,237
I didn't notice anything in the dark.

275
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:14,038
I hit him with
the Penetrating Bone Nail.

276
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:16,558
The poison was on the nail.

277
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:19,318
I used a fake letter
from the Eldest Senior

278
00:16:19,398 --> 00:16:20,837
to ask them to meet
at the Black Tiger Forest.

279
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:24,438
That nail is the Eldest Senior's
unique hidden weapon.

280
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:25,798
They were not suspicious.

281
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,558
Where did you get

282
00:16:28,558 --> 00:16:29,517
the hidden weapon?

283
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:31,637
Make a guess.

284
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:34,678
I understand.

285
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:36,477
You captured him earlier

286
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:38,357
and put him in the basket.

287
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:39,997
He had his hidden weapons on him.

288
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:41,078
Correct.

289
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:43,837
He was suspicious of my blue flowers.

290
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:45,438
He followed you

291
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,678
when you asked him for directions.

292
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,158
That's why I didn't
make him faint in the house

293
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:50,877
but on the road.

294
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:53,237
That way he would blame

295
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:55,038
the Second Eldest Senior and his wife.

296
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:56,837
Young Lady Ling,

297
00:16:57,438 --> 00:16:59,318
you've completed
what your master entrusted you

298
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:01,198
and cleared up the old grudges between
your senior brothers and sister,

299
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:03,798
with careful thoughts and a kind heart.

300
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:06,517
I am very impressed.

301
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,077
Did you praise me

302
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:12,598
to get me to treat your friend?

303
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:15,077
Tell me.

304
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,037
What's his name?

305
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,918
Miao Renfeng.

306
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:23,237
Is he the invincible

307
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:24,398
Golden-face Buddha?

308
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:25,358
Do you know him?

309
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:27,997
We met five years ago.

310
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:30,598
His eyes are badly hurt

311
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:32,517
and he is being pursued by his enemies.

312
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:33,997
His eyes are hurt.

313
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:35,277
They are his weakest part.

314
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:37,158
The medicine must be chosen carefully

315
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:38,237
and he must be treated quickly.

316
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:39,517
Young Lady Ling,

317
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:41,477
will you treat him?

318
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,237
I'll go if you ask me

319
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:47,958
but you must make a promise.

320
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,477
Agree. What is it?

321
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:51,717
I haven't decided yet.

322
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,077
I'll tell you one day.

323
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:54,277
You promised.

324
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:56,398
Young Lady Ling,

325
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:57,797
if I break my promise,

326
00:17:57,797 --> 00:17:58,878
I am a wretch.

327
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:00,757
It's a deal.

328
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:01,757
Promise.

329
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:24,797
Brother Hu.

330
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:28,918
Brother Hu.

331
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:30,477
You're finally awake.

332
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:32,878
Did you drink wine the whole night?

333
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:34,678
How do you know?

334
00:18:35,237 --> 00:18:37,557
I dreamed I attended

335
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,918
the Heavenly Queen Mother's Peach Party,

336
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:42,358
drank wine
with the Barefoot Immortal,

337
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:43,958
and became his sworn sister.

338
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:46,838
The Heavenly Queen Mother
gave me the elixir of life.

339
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:48,517
The elixir of life?

340
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,678
I found the righteous master
who can treat

She...She?

00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:55,918
What means she?

344
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:57,037
You're being disrespectful.

345
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:58,317
She is Young Lady Ling.

346
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:00,878
She is the direct disciple
of the King of Poison.

347
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,477
She is getting ready

348

to go with us
to treat Hero Miao's eyes.

349

Young Lady Ling.

350
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,678
I didn't recognise you.

351
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:13,077
I'm sorry for offending you.

352
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:13,997
I...

353
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:14,838
Do that

354
00:19:15,077 --> 00:19:16,118
and I'll send you back to bed.

355
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:20,678
I'll get my things.

356
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:21,477
Thank you.

357
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:31,037
Alright, don't be afraid.

358
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:32,757
She won't hurt you.

359
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:34,797
At least

360
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:36,517
this is a fruitful trip.

361
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:38,118
You get half the credit.

362
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:39,997
Of course.

363
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:41,638
What will you do without me?

364
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:43,958
Hero Miao will be saved!

365
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:44,678
Great!

366
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:46,277
Yes.

367
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:25,037
You live among herbs

368
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:28,158

369
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:30,557

When you leave here,

you must remember

372
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:35,717
to bring along

373
00:20:35,757 --> 00:20:38,358

I am old and weak.

I will teach you
the Magic Power of King of Poison.

Mother, good morning.

391
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:45,958
Kang, you are in a happy mood today.

392
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:47,277
Did you receive some good news?

393
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:49,398
Sit down and tell me quickly.

394
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,517
His Majesty showed me favour.

395
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:55,557
He ordered the Imperial Household Department

396
00:22:55,878 --> 00:22:57,878
to give me silver taels
to make eight each

397
00:22:57,997 --> 00:23:00,118
of the jade, golden,
and silver dragon cups

398

for the martial arts tournament.

399
00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:03,517
People have grades and ranks.

400
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:06,077
So should martial sect leaders.

401
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:09,838
You were worried
that the peaches were not enough.

402
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:12,958
His Majesty has already
made plans for you.

403
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:14,878
Mother, you have a sharp

404
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:15,997
and penetrating mind.

405
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:18,358
Let me guess.

406
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:20,918
You have delivered the jade dragon cups

407
00:23:21,198 --> 00:23:23,158
long ago.

408
00:23:24,997 --> 00:23:27,358
Mother, you can predict things.

409
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:30,438
The top priority now is to win over

410
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,158
some major sects.

411
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:38,158
The martial sect leaders
who received the cups

412
00:23:38,557 --> 00:23:41,158
will be in the Imperial Court's
good graces.

413
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:43,918
If the gathering and tournament
are successful,

414
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:45,317
in future,

415
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:47,797
the martial arts world
will be in the Imperial Court

416
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:48,638
and

417
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:50,757
vice versa.

418
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:52,438
Eventually,

419
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,878
the Imperial Court will penetrate
the martial arts world.

420
00:23:56,638 --> 00:23:57,557
Understand?

421
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:02,477
Eventually, martial artists
will be loyal to the Imperial Court.

422

Mother, the capital

423

has started to build inns
for the sect leaders.

00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:14,398
Kang, when you're doing this task,

425
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:19,198
have you noticed that His Majesty
has guided you patiently

426
00:24:19,678 --> 00:24:23,198
like he was personally teaching you?

427

I understand.
Thank you for your guidance.

His Majesty only accorded you
this treatment.

Although he is stern,

431
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:39,878
in my opinion,

432
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:42,717
that is true imperial favour.

433

have been blinded by poison.

I want to eat it.

You came just in time.

510
00:28:40,757 --> 00:28:42,638
I want to get Ruolan some food.

511
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,557
Please babysit her.

512
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,398
Don't go.

513
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:46,757
Hero Miao.

514
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,477
It just rained and the road is slippery.

515
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:51,077
It is inconvenient for you to go.

516
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:52,118
I'll get the food.

517
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,198
Thank you.

518
00:28:59,717 --> 00:29:00,638
I'll be back soon.

519
00:29:33,477 --> 00:29:34,838
Is it delicious, Ruolan?

520
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:36,958
Here, open your mouth.

521
00:29:38,757 --> 00:29:39,757
Is it delicious, Ruolan?

522
00:29:44,037 --> 00:29:45,598
Ruolan can't talk yet.

523
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:46,997
Here.

524
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:48,517
One more mouthful.

525
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:52,598
Is there any more?

526
00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:53,797
Yes. Yes.

527
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,717
Give it to her.

528
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:56,678
Alright.

529
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:01,358
She didn't want any more.

530
00:30:01,358 --> 00:30:02,077
Really?

531
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:03,997
Yes. She is full.

532
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,358
Brother Sun.

533
00:30:10,918 --> 00:30:13,438
It's getting dark. Start the fire.

534
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,398
No, Hero Miao.

535
00:30:17,077 --> 00:30:18,358
The enemies will come anytime.

536
00:30:19,158 --> 00:30:20,598
The smoke from the fire

537
00:30:21,198 --> 00:30:22,517
might attract them.

538
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:23,757
This...

539
00:30:25,838 --> 00:30:26,958
The cave is cold.

540
00:30:28,037 --> 00:30:28,997
I'm afraid for Ruolan.

541
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:32,997
Make a fire.

542
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:36,077
Hero Miao.

543
00:30:36,557 --> 00:30:38,277
Be patient.

544
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,237
I can still handle

545
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:41,838
a few thieves.

546
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:44,037
Relax. Make a fire.

547
00:30:48,358 --> 00:30:48,997
Alright.

548
00:30:54,358 --> 00:30:56,317
We'll be warm in no time.

549
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:10,958
Brother Hu,

550
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:12,717
your chicken isn't cooked yet.

551
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,277
I'm starving.

552
00:31:14,277 --> 00:31:15,997
It'll be ready soon.

553
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:18,517
Xiaomei,

554
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,838
doesn't the flower make you sneeze?

555
00:31:21,317 --> 00:31:21,997
Brother Hu,

556
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:23,317
do you see me sneezing?

557
00:31:24,277 --> 00:31:25,958
Not as much as before.

558
00:31:26,158 --> 00:31:27,557
No, Brother Hu.

559
00:31:27,757 --> 00:31:28,757
It isn't that.

560
00:31:28,797 --> 00:31:30,037
I don't sneeze anymore.

561
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:31,757
In the future, I can pick

562
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:34,638
Azalea, winter jasmine, peony,

563
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:35,438
and other flowers.

564
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:36,838
I can be the flower goddess.

565
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:38,678
You heal naturally.

566
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:43,118
I have to thank Sister Cheng for it.

567
00:31:43,598 --> 00:31:46,237
She gave me a small pill.

568
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:47,198
After I take it,

569
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:49,557
my chronic problem is cured.

570
00:31:50,757 --> 00:31:51,997
You only sneeze

571
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,158
in this season.

572
00:31:53,158 --> 00:31:54,438
It isn't a chronic disease.

573
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:56,037
It's not that hard to heal.

574
00:31:56,277 --> 00:31:57,997
Sister Cheng,
perhaps you don't know this.

575
00:31:58,277 --> 00:32:00,077
To find a cure,

576
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:02,237
my parents spent a lot of money
for medical treatment,

577
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:03,277
but nothing worked.

578
00:32:03,678 --> 00:32:04,678
Had I known,

579
00:32:04,678 --> 00:32:06,317
I would give you the silver taels

580
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:07,757
we paid the quack doctors.

581
00:32:08,277 --> 00:32:10,237
You are not only a master of poison,

582
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:12,797
you are also a rare physician
who works wonders.

583
00:32:14,438 --> 00:32:15,237
Brother Sun,

584
00:32:16,918 --> 00:32:19,358
my daughter and I
have caused you trouble.

585
00:32:20,678 --> 00:32:22,717
Hero Miao, please don't say that.

586
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:25,918
I am a fool

587
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:28,198
and have disappointed Hero Zhao.

588
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:30,398
I caused you

589
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:32,598
and your daughter trouble.

590
00:32:41,277 --> 00:32:43,958
Hero Miao, I think Ruolan is sick.

591
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:45,438
If we don't treat her promptly,

592
00:32:45,678 --> 00:32:46,797
the illness will linger.

593
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:50,077
She only has a slight fever.

594
00:32:50,237 --> 00:32:51,118
I know.

595
00:32:51,557 --> 00:32:53,077
But my daughter is not so delicate.

596
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,598
Tomorrow morning,

597
00:32:55,678 --> 00:32:57,037
I'll buy medicine at the foothill.

598
00:33:00,717 --> 00:33:01,717
That's good.

599
00:33:02,517 --> 00:33:03,638
That's good.

600
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:05,118
By the way,

601
00:33:05,557 --> 00:33:08,118
the young man who
went to get me medicine,

602
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:10,277
he...

603
00:33:10,277 --> 00:33:11,678
He has a good heart

604
00:33:11,918 --> 00:33:12,797
and great martial skills.

605
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:14,638
He not only avenged my senior,

606
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:16,118
he also saved me.

607
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:18,438
He is worthy of being called
a young hero.

608
00:33:18,557 --> 00:33:19,878
He will be able to get

609
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:20,918
the King of Poison here.

610
00:33:21,678 --> 00:33:23,557
Since ancient times,
we have young heroes.

611
00:33:25,358 --> 00:33:26,118
That's good.

612
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,158
Brother Hu,

613
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:52,077
may I use your bag as my pillow?

614
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:53,638
Alright.

615
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:54,598
Be careful.

616
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:55,878
Don't crush what's inside.

617
00:33:56,997 --> 00:33:58,517
Is it precious?

618
00:33:58,678 --> 00:34:00,757
Is there anything valuable in there?

619
00:34:01,878 --> 00:34:02,878
Let me peep.

620
00:34:15,157 --> 00:34:15,798
This...

621
00:34:16,197 --> 00:34:18,157
Isn't this the blue flower
from Sister Cheng?

622
00:34:18,677 --> 00:34:20,838
Brother Hu, you still have it.

623
00:34:21,318 --> 00:34:22,918
Yes. It's your gift.

624
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:23,878
It is also useful.

625
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:24,918
Of course, I must keep it.

626
00:34:28,477 --> 00:34:29,438
This one.

627
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:30,477
I know this.

628
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:32,557
Uncle Zhao gave you this, right?

629
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:36,477
What is this?

630
00:34:38,597 --> 00:34:39,358
This?

631
00:34:39,718 --> 00:34:42,758
It's the Fist Fighting and Saber Manual
passed down by the Hu ancestors.

632
00:34:45,997 --> 00:34:48,318
Brother Hu, what are you holding?

633
00:34:48,557 --> 00:34:49,197
Let me see.

634
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:51,838
It's just an ordinary comb

635
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:52,798
but

636
00:34:53,438 --> 00:34:54,398
I can't give it to you.

637
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:56,438
Not for me

638
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:57,958
and not for you either.

639
00:34:58,278 --> 00:34:59,438
You're a man

640
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:01,238
and can't use a girl's comb.

641
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:04,838
I know.

642
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:07,718
Did a girl give you this?

643
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:10,157
I...

644
00:35:11,037 --> 00:35:12,398
I purchased it for someone.

645
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:14,477
Brother Hu.

646
00:35:14,918 --> 00:35:16,997
You have a sweetheart!

647
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:18,477
What does she look like?

648
00:35:18,798 --> 00:35:19,997
Is she as pretty as Sister Cheng?

649
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:24,758
Brother Hu,

650
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:26,597
where did you meet her?

651
00:35:27,637 --> 00:35:28,438
Xiaomei.

652
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:29,557
It's late.

653
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:30,997
If you stay up late,

654
00:35:31,438 --> 00:35:32,758
your medicine won't work.

655
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:35,517
It won't?

656
00:35:35,997 --> 00:35:37,358
Will I cough again?

657
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:39,157
No way.

658
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:40,517
I'll sleep now.

659
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:41,798
Both of you should sleep early.

660
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:43,197
Alright.

661
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:55,838
Sect leader,

662
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,557
I watched Miao Renfeng's house
for two days and nights

663
00:36:57,557 --> 00:36:58,238
without moving an inch

664
00:36:58,238 --> 00:36:59,077
but it was empty.

665
00:37:02,718 --> 00:37:03,438
Sect leader,

666
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:05,278
I watched the exits of the villa

667
00:37:05,438 --> 00:37:06,958
but there was no trace of Miao Renfeng.

668
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:10,677
Continue what you do.
Check and report again.

669
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:11,637
-Yes.
-Yes.

670
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:23,238
Leader Tian.

671
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:26,117
Miao Renfeng has a toddler.

672
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:27,637
He can't be too far
from his home.

673
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:30,517
I will take the lead

674
00:37:30,758 --> 00:37:32,157
and set up an ambush at his house.

675
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:33,557
When he appears,

676
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,318
we'll trap him.

677
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:39,438
If I am

678
00:37:40,398 --> 00:37:41,758
itching to do something,
