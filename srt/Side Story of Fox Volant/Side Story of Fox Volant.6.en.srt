Please count them.

Six dogs cost 6000 taels.

What about the pawnbroker?

9
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,570
The pawnbroker of Heroes Pawn Shop

10
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,140
must be worth more than these dogs.

11
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,730
You cost

Okay.

Sir.

19
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,050
I was blind.

I've failed to recognize a hero.

Please have mercy.

22
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,220
Weren't you talking about rules?

23
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,620
Follow your rules

is as reasonable as the two of you,

102

the imperial court
will have less to worry about.

Don't worry, Young Master Feng.

When we're back in the capital,

108
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,940
we'll surely recommend

109

you and your father to Official Fu.

110
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,260

It can't wait.

116
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,140
If we wait any longer,
all our property will be destroyed.

We need a bigger board.

126
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,450
If this goes on,

127
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,850
we won't have
enough space for our taels.

128
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,450
That's unnecessary.

129
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,140
Perhaps the casino is already ours.

130
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,850
Thank you, Old Master Feng.

131
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,260
Then we shall accept it with respect.

I'll roll them.

If they keep playing,

137
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,140
the casino will have nothing left.

138
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,580
Even the entire casino

139
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,850
will not be enough for them.

There are so many of us,

149

yet we couldn't do anything.

150

The girl is also formidable.

151
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,210
I remember that

Have you thought this through?

161
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,020
I'm willing to accept defeat.

It's really even.

167
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,330
They won. It's even.

168
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,330
You cheated!

169
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,410
Do you think I don't know?

170
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,410
How dare you?

171

The two of you

172

dare behave atrociously in my territory.

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,380
What is this?

174
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,970
Is the Heroes Club repudiating debts?

175
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,060
You may do that,

176
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,090
but you should
call yourself Cowards Club

177
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
instead of Heroes Club.

178
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,210
You want money?

179
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,820
That's not hard.

180
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,580
However,

181
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,260
you should show me your tricks.

182
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,650
Show you?

183
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,690
Get your father.

184
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,170
Or else no one can coax you

185
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,340
when you cry about your defeat.

186
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,020
Lad.

187
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,810
Do you dare to gamble?

188
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,500
If you dare,

189
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,980
I'll give you an opportunity.

190
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,100
So you don't say that I'm bullying you.

191
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,740
What do you want to play?

192
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,050
Big and small.

193
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,770
Only one round.

194
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,020
Are you betting on big or small?

195
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,770
Up to you.

196
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,340
Nice.

197
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,260
Let's bet on small.

198
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,890
Small yet not small enough. You lose.

199
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,170
We haven't rolled the dice yet.

200
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,340
Can you get it smaller?

201
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,410
You're an ace indeed.

202
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,020
Not bad.

203
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,140
I've learned something.

204
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,980
What are you doing?

205
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,740
Fight!

206
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,100
You want to repudiate
the debts when you lose.

207
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,290
Is this a tradition of Feng Family?

208
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,290
Return my Phoenix Meat.

209
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,050
How dare you hit me?

210
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,410
Fellow gentlemen,

211
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,930
I came all the way to Foshan

212
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,530
to buy a piece of
Phoenix Meat from Zhong Asi.

213
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,380
But it was stolen by this fellow.

214
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,460
Do you think he deserves to be hit?

215
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,100
I don't care about your Phoenix Meat.

216
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,620
Let me go now.

217
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,460
Or else I'll have
my father kill your entire family.

218
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,650
Good sir.

219
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,530
Good sir.

220
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,620
Please have mercy.

221
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,770
This is...

222
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,980
This is the only son of Old Master Feng.

223
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,650
He's as important
as Old Master Feng's own life.

224
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,860
Good sir.

225
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,860
If you want money, just tell us.

226
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,860
Please...

227
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,620
Please let our young master go.

228
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,260
Well, he stole our Phoenix Meat.

229
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,740
Just because he's
Old Master Feng's only son,

230
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,980
does it mean
he can eat other's food as he likes?

231
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,860
You must be joking.

232
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,220
There's no such thing

233
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,740
as Phoenix Meat in this world.

234
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,020
Even if there is,

235
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,170
our young master

236
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,770
wouldn't steal yours.

237
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,620
Phoenix Meat is
a priceless and nutritious treasure.

238
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,740
Your face blushes as soon as you eat it.

239
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:14,810
Look at his face.

240
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,690
His face is so red,
he has surely eaten it.

241
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,890
Good sir, you're the one

242
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,690
who hit his face until it turned red.

243
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,860
This...

244
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,930
This has nothing
to do with Phoenix Meat.

245
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,860
Zheng, this is bad.

246
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,340
I said that he ate it.

247
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,620
But he refused.

248
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,890
We insist on our points respectively.

249
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
What should we do?

250
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,770
I have a way.

251
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,980
Let's go to Pak Tai Temple

252
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,980
and ask God Pak Tai to be our judge.

253
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,980
Zheng, you're right.

254
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,050
Please don't.

255
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,530
Good sir, you're right.

256
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,260
It's our fault.

257
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,050
Tell us

258
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,020
how we should compensate you

259
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,860
and we'll do it.

260
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,570
How to compensate?

261
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,220
Compensate like Zhong Family.

262
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,020
Old Master.

263
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,140
Something bad happened.

264
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,260
Young Master is kidnapped.

265
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,770
Today, in front of God Pak Tai

266
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,260
and the folks of Foshan,

267
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,890
spit out the Phoenix Meat you ate.

268
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,020
Curse you!

269
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,620
You rotten.

270
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,220
Today I shall turn the two of you

271
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,500
into ash and pieces.

272
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,980
Keep being stubborn.

273
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,530
Today we shall take
Feng Family down a peg.

274
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,530
That's Young Master Feng.

275
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,930
Young Master Feng?

276
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,770
Someone dares hit Young Master Feng?

277
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,050
Am I seeing this right?

278
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,810
What's going on today?

279
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,140
Did the sun rise from the west?

280
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,050
Or is God Pak Tai showing his power?

281
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,770
They're bearding the lion in his den.

282
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,290
Make way.

283
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,100
How dare you?

284
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,620
How dare you

285
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,220
stand against me in Foshan Town?

286
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,650
Feng Qi.

287
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,890
What nonsense?

288
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,100
Kill the two of them.

289
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,740
Save Young Master.

290
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,140
Kill them!

291
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,570
Get up!

292
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,620
Get up!

293
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,650
Fight!

294
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,290
Rubbish.

295
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,930
A bunch of rubbish.

296
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,890
Attack!

297
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,050
Make way!

298
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,410
Young Master.

299
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,410
Young Master.

300
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,380
I thought your father

301
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,500
is the leading figure in Foshan.

302
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,980
I didn't expect him
to neglect his son's life.

303
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,650
The two of you aren't useful after all.

304
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,810
Just slaughter them.

305
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,100
Fellow heroes,

306
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,170
please have mercy.

307
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,050
I was just confused.

308
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,170
I've failed to recognize the heroes.

309
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,050
Fellow heroes, please have mercy

310
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,690
and spare my life.

311
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,050
Shut up, you slave!

312
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,340
You're embarrassing

313
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,810
Feng Family.

314
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:58,980
Young Master.

315
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,810
A great man knows when to yield.

316
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,170
We can't be stubborn.

317
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,380
If not, our head...

318
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,290
will be cut off.

319
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,410
Fellow heroes.

320
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,650
We're all people

321
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
of the martial art world.

322
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,140
A great man isn't bothered
by a small man's mistakes.

323
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,260
You're not part
of the martial art world.

324
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,410
You bully the kind and the weak.

325
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,770
The martial art world is defiled by you.

326
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,220
I'm shameless.

327
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,290
I'm filthy.

328
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,100
I'm crooked.

329
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,620
As long as you forgive our young master,

330
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,140
I'll have him apologize
to Zhong Asi immediately.

331
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,100
Apologize?

332
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,690
That's too late.

333
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,740
Hero, stop!

334
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,410
Old Master.

335
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,220
Father.

336
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,690
-Old Master.
-Father.

337
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,890
Father.

338
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,460
Old Master.

339
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,530
Father, you're finally here.

340
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,140
Old Master.

341
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,460
They're the scoundrels

342
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,770
who hit me so badly.

343
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,860
Kill them.

344
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Young Master.

345
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,170
You scoundrel!

346
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,020
Young Master, are you okay?

347
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,050
Fellow heroes,

348
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm Feng Tiannan of Foshan.

349
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:11,980
Greetings.

350
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,570
Turns out you're Feng Tiannan.

351
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,140
Yes.

352
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,380
(Chief of Five Tigers Sect, Feng Tiannan)
We've been looking forward to meeting you.

353
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,890
You hoodwink the public
and act disorderly

354
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,890
in Foshan.

355
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,260
How powerful.

356
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,100
Fellow heroes.

357
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,740
I just found out about this.

358
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,170
God forbid!

359
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,740
I'm very heartbroken.

360
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,860
Fellow heroes.

361
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,980
It was very unfortunate that

362
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,770
I have such an unfilial son.

363
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,020
Everything

364
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,500
is my fault.

365
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,530
If you want to punish someone,

366
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,460
fellow heroes,

367
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,420
do it to me.

368
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,130
Father.

369
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:52,740
Father.

370
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,330
What happened to you today?

371
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,020
This is Foshan.

372
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,090
Since when do we

373
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,050
have to be aggrieved like this?

374
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,290
Get more people.

375
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,770
I don't believe that

376
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,900
you can rule Foshan.

377
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,700
Curse you!

378
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,290
Young Master.

379
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,610
You scoundrel!

380
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,810
You used my name

381
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,020
to act absurdly in Foshan.

382
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,900
Just because I shut
myself away from the world?

383
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,980
Father.

384
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,850
Why did you do such things?

385
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,810
How do you want me

386
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,740
to face the folks of Foshan

387
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,570
and the friends
of the martial art world?

388
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,570
I'll beat you to death.

389
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,180
Old Master.

390
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,090
Stop it,

391
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,260
if not Young Master may die.

392
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,220
You slave! I...

393
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,740
Old Master, that's enough.

394
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,900
Old Master.

395
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,610
Old Master.

396
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,940
You slave!

397
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,530
Old Master.

398
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,370
You condoned his behavior

399
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,660
that was lawless

400
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,900
and caused deaths.

401
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,530
Are there rules?

402
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,050
Are there ethics and morals?

403
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,330
I...

404
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,610
What a nice show

405
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,660
to clear your name.

406
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,130
Feng Tiannan.

407
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,660
Dare you say
that you don't know anything

408
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,130
about Zhong Asi's family?

409
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,700
Hero,

410
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,260
I really had no idea.

411
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,660
These lads

412
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,460
have really confused me.

413
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,900
Where's the family of Zhong Asi?

414
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,850
Where are they?

415
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,660
Where are the people of Zhong?

416
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,460
Zhong Asi is in prison.

417
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,770
We're looking for Mrs. Zhong and Er.

418
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,090
You thief!

419
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,700
Be honest!

420
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,050
Sir!

421
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,260
Sir!

422
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,090
What's going on?

423
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,740
Sir.

424
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,660
Something big happened.

425
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,050
Feng Family is challenged.

426
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,290
Who is so bold?

427
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,570
Did I hear it right?

428
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,530
It's true.

429
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,770
I saw it with my own eyes.

430
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,260
How many are they?

431
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,370
Two.

432
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,940
Two?

433
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,500
There're two people in the open.

434
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,570
I don't know

435
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,740
how many there are in secret.

436
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,660
Sir.

437
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,020
Sir.

438
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,530
Sir.

439
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,290
My old master wants me
to bring you a message.

440
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,980
He wants Zhong Asi.

441
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,700
Do you need more people?

442
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,810
Take all the guards
in the magistrate along.

443
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,460
No.

444
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,370
My old master said

445
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,980
he only needs Zhong Asi.

446
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,090
Hurry up.

447
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,330
Stop.

448
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,090
Here.

449
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,180
Brother Zhong.

450
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,220
I didn't educate my child well.

451
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,370
I'm here to apologize to you.

452
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,570
What a pity.

453
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,610
His dead child can
never be brought back to life.

454
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,370
That's right.

455
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,290
San...

456
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,260
San...

457
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,290
San.

458
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:04,940
Brother Zhong.

459
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,850
San!

460
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,810
Brother Zhong.

461
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,530
San!

462
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,460
Brother Zhong.

463
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,570
San!

464
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,500
Brother Zhong.

465
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,330
Brother Zhong. Someone...

466
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,810
Get a physician.

467
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,460
Hurry, take him.

468
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,090
Hurry.

469
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,940
Stop.

470
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:29,900
You want to escape?

471
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,810
The matter isn't settled yet.

472
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:32,940
This...

473
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,700
Young Lady.

474
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,260
Old Master Feng has apologized

475
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,700
and compensated.

476
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,530
As the saying goes,
never overdo anything.

477
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,500
Be lenient wherever it's possible.

478
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,130
Well said.

479
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,290
Why didn't they say that
when they caused the death

480
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,330
of Zhong's child?

481
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,130
I know you're rich.

482
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,660
These taels are

483
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,810
just a drop in the bucket for you.

484
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,220
But he was just a child.

485
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,740
He was only four.

486
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,130
You're right.

487
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,460
No matter how many taels there are,

488
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,610
a person's life can't be bought.

489
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,050
But these taels

490
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,770
are the funeral expenses
for Zhong Family.

491
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,810
As the saying goes,

492
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,220
a life for a life,
all debts must be paid.

493
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,420
Today,

494
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,260
I'll avenge Zhong Family

495
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,460
and return justice to Foshan.

496
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,660
Speak up.

497
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,850
Who was the one

498
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,530
who caused the child's death?

499
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,330
Feng Qi. It was Feng Qi.

500
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,850
It was him.

501
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,740
Old Master.

502
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,220
I was just...

503
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,810
He indeed killed him.

504
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,770
He killed him for real.

505
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,570
He killed him.

506
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,900
Well done.

507
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,460
Unfilial son!

508
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,940
Today I shall put
Feng Family back in order.

509
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,220
Father.

510
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,290
Old Master Feng.

511
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,460
You can't kill anyone anymore.

512
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,900
Two lives are sacrificed today.

513
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,180
Let go.

514
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,290
Old Master Feng.

515
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,330
Have you lost your mind?

516
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,290
We have rules here.

517
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,740
Even if Young Master Feng deserves to die,

518
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,330
he should go through
trials by the local authority.

519
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,850
You can't punish him illegally.

520
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,290
As a citizen,

521
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,940
you've always been obeying rules.

522
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,850
How can you do such a thing

523
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,900
that disregards the law?

524
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,050
You're right.

525
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,220
Imprison this lad.

526
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,570
He's at the disposal
of the local authority.

527
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,050
Decapitate him

528
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,370
or banish him.

529
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,660
Okay.

530
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,130
Imprison Feng Yiming.

531
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:13,770
Roger.

532
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,050
Take him.

533
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,500
Father.

534
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,770
I don't want to go, Father.

535
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,500
I don't want to go.

536
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,460
-Take him.
-Be gentle.

537
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,370
Father.

538
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,330
I won't do it anymore, Father.

539
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,090
Imprison him.

540
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,660
Guard him closely.

541
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,220
I don't want to be imprisoned, Father.

542
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,740
Father, let me go.

543
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,130
Father, I won't do it again.

544
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,090
Let's go. The fun is over.

545
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,850
Are we leaving just like that?

546
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,050
How else?

547
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,420
A life for a life.

548
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,050
We can't have the entire Feng Family

549
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,900
killed, right?

550
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,050
I think something isn't right.

551
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,570
Something isn't right?

552
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:54,900
Let's go.

553
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,500
As the saying goes,

554
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,900
don't leave your name after a good deed.

555
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,740
Are you staying here

556
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,740
to be thanked?

557
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,660
A knave thinks of others
in his own desires.

558
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,500
Fellow heroes, please stay.

559
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,980
It's my fortune

560
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,330
to meet you.

561
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,850
Can I invite you to my residence?

562
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,570
No need.

563
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,090
Helping those in need is the duty
of the people of the martial art world.

564
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,020
Please forgive us

565
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,660
for being offensive.

566
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,660
You two are

567
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,610
people of high morality.

568
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,500
I'm also part of the martial art world.

569
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,020
I love to make friends.

570
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,130
I invite you over sincerely.

571
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,420
Here, this way.

572
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,530
Let's go.

573
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,460
Let's go.

574
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,260
Perhaps next time.

575
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:43,940
Okay.

576
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,850
Fellow heroes.

577
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,570
Why should I give him face?

578
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,330
Better to get rid of
an enmity than keep it alive.

579
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,570
This chapter is closed.

580
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,500
If you don't move on,
it'll be your fault.

581
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,420
Do I know you?

582
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,330
What I do is none of your business.

583
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,940
Did he offend you?

584
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,220
Did I offend you?

585
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,050
Yes.

586
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,050
You're calling him Old Master Feng

587
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,460
as if you know him very well.

588
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,740
Do you still want to work for him

589
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,530
and be his guard?

590
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,810
Don't follow me.

591
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,420
You should at least

592
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,460
tell me your name.

593
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,570
Are you really called Zheng Fengzhua?

594
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,330
This is a new recipe.

595
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,180
Be quiet.

596
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,130
She's asleep.

597
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,900
Here, eat it while it's hot.

598
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:35,740
Too salty?

599
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,610
It's my fault.

600
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,700
I'll cook it again.

601
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:41,810
No.

602
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,290
The ingredients are expensive,

603
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,260
don't waste them.

604
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,980
Ruolan.

605
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,530
Your father has improved.

606
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,530
He can cook rice now.

607
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,740
Brother Miao.

608
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,610
Where is this?

609
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,220
The people I respect
the most are buried here.

610
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,180
They're all famous heroes
of the martial art world.

611
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,700
They had big hearts.

612
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,980
In the martial art world,
there are always killings.

613
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,420
This is the only place
where I can be in peace.

614
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,180
Today,
in front of my brothers and sisters,

615
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,130
I want to thank you for saving my life.

616
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,740
Brother Miao.

617
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,260
You're the one who saved me first.

618
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,660
I have nothing to repay you.

619
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,810
If you have nowhere to go

620
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,020
and don't mind being with me,

621
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,500
I'll treasure

622
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,260
and protect you forever.

623
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,570
Such a cute one.

624
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,500
Brother.

625
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:56,900
Sister-in-law.

626
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,090
There's news about the Poison Master

627
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,260
from Miaojiang.

628
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,570
I looked for him for so long.

629
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,740
I hope I can finally find him this time.

630
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,180
It's been 18 years.

631
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,130
(The memorial tablet of my blood brother)
I still haven't unraveled

632
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,530
(Hu Yidao, and his wife)
the secret on the snow mountain.

633
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,420
I haven't found your child either.

634
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,050
Do you have to go this time?

635
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,810
I know you must fulfill your promise.

636
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,050
I also know that
your promise is as good as gold.

637
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,220
I know all these.

638
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,290
But I don't want you to go.

639
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,330
I'll be back soon.

640
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,770
Can you make an exception?

641
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,370
Just this time, okay?

642
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,180
I...

643
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,850
Brother Miao.

644
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:26,770
Here.

645
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,370
Slow down. Don't be so rough.

646
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,290
It's precious.

647
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,940
They're here.

648
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,980
(The memorial tablet of my
blood brother, Hu Yidao, and his wife)

649
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,810
Brother Miao.

650
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,660
Brother Tian.

651
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,460
What is this about?

652
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,370
Ruolan is a hundred days old.

653
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,610
As her uncle,

654
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,090
I'm happier than anyone.

655
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,770
She's still young,

656
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,900
she doesn't need these.

657
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,770
These are just small gifts.
Don't mention it.

658
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,290
Some of these things aren't needed yet.

659
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,460
As parents,

660
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,530
you can keep them for her first.

661
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,610
Nan Lan, let me tell you.

662
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,220
This brother of mine

663
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,810
is very self-contained.

664
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,980
Look at him.

665
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,370
It's usually very hard

666
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,660
to gift him anything.

667
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:23,940
This time,

668
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,420
thank Ruolan,

669
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,700
I can finally gift him something.

670
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,460
Thank you, Leader Tian.

671
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,180
You're too polite.

672
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,460
Don't call me leader.

673
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,810
Everyone in this world knows

674
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,260
that Miao Renfeng and I are
brothers through thick and thin.

675
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,770
Even when I have a rank or title,

676
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,460
you

677
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,940
will still be the brother
who I respect the most.

678
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,220
Let's talk inside.

679
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,330
Okay.

680
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,940
Here, bring them in.

681
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,090
To tell you the truth,

682
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,700
it took a lot of effort

683
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,180
for me to complete this patchwork quilt.

684
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,500
I went to the temple

685
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,850
and asked a monk
to carry out a ritual on it

686
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:04,610
to bless the child

687
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,570
with longevity

688
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,330
and safety.

689
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,220
She's sleeping.

690
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,530
Look at me.

691
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,180
Her eyebrows are like a crescent.

692
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,810
Her eyes are like stars.

693
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,740
Her facial features are like Nan Lan's.

694
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,700
She'll grow up to be a beauty.

695
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,610
But between her eyebrows

696
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,020
is full of heroic spirit,

697
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,260
just like Brother Miao.

698
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,370
Really?

699
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,460
Yes, heroic spirit.

700
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,020
She doesn't need a heroic spirit.

701
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,460
Ruolan is a girl.

702
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,020
She shouldn't be like her father

703
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,700
who only cares
about fighting and killing.

704
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,130
I just want her to be happy and safe.

705
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,860
She's only a hundred days old,

706
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,900
yet you're leaving for Miaojiang.

707
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,050
There's a wine shop out there.

708
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,090
Let's talk while we drink.

709
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,980
I brought wine along.

710
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,730
It's your favorite, nu'erhong.

711
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,090
Let's stay home.

712
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:06,860
This way.

713
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:07,650
Okay.

714
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,780
Do you have

715
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,170
a clear destination this time?

716
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,210
Brother Miao.

717
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,610
It's hard to tell if the rumor is true.

718
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,500
Because of a rumor,

719
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,500
you depart alone
and leave your family behind,

720
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,340
that isn't quite...

721
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,130
appropriate.

722
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,050
Okay.

723
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,300
If he's really in Miaojiang,

724
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,570
but Miaojiang

725
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,690
is full of dense forest
and rugged roads.

726
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,690
In a big crowd,

727
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,050
how can you find

728
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,210
a stranger?

729
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,020
Even if I'm looking for
a needle in a haystack,

730
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,530
I must still go.
