=Side Story Of Fox Volant=
(Adapted from Jin Yong's novel)

2
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,300
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,679
Miao.

4
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,080
It's hard to tell
whether the rumor is true or not.

5
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,959
Are you really going to leave
your family behind

6
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,959
just because of this rumor?

7
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,800
That's not a good idea,

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,599
right?

9
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,520
Fine.

10
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,759
Even if he's really at Miaojiang,

11
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,040
Miaojiang is covered in woods,

12
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,159
and the way there is
full of twists and turns.

13
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,159
How do you find a stranger

14
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:05,520
out of such a huge crowd?

15
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,680
That's basically impossible.

16
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,480
Even if it's
looking for a needle in a haystack,

17
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,999
I need to be there myself.

18
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:15,399
Miao.

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,359
I really admire

20
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:19,639
how you put justice before everything.

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,679
This one is for you.

22
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:32,240
Miao.

23
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
Why don't you let me help you?

24
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,760
I can send my men from Tianlong Sect

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,039
to Miaojiang
and scout around beforehand.

26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,240
Once they find out more
about the Poison Master,

27
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:42,200
you can head over there yourself.
What about that?

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
I'd been stuck for 18 years,

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,680
not being able to find any clues.

30
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,400
The opportunity is
right before my very eyes.

31
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:51,719
I have to go there myself.

32
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,279
But...

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,560
I've made up my mind.

34
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,079
There's no need to keep convincing me.

35
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,719
However,

36
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,279
I still have a concern.

37
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,480
Your wife and your child?

38
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,480
Once I leave,

39
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,920
I'll be away for at least three to six months.

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,239
Ruolan is still a baby.

41
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,200
I can't bear to leave her behind.

42
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
You're right.

43
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,120
If you don't mind,

44
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,960
and if your wife doesn't mind too,

45
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,840
they can stay at Tianlong Sect
temporarily.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Although we don't own
a luxurious mansion,

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
we have a few rooms to spare too.

48
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:49,880
We can provide them with transportation,

49
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,160
food, clothes,

50
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,559
and even maidservants.

51
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:53,399
I guess we're more than capable

52
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:56,079
of taking care of your wife and kid.

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,000
It's fine.

54
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,559
Just help me hire two helpers.

55
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,959
Miao,

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,639
let me be honest with you.

57
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,639
I'm sorry if this upsets you,

58
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,519
but you've made a name for yourself
and have plenty of enemies.

59
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,239
What if...

60
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,519
Did you forget what happened

61
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,440
when Shang Jianming ambushed you
at your place?

62
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,280
At Tianlong Sect,

63
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:27,200
at least, we can keep
your wife and your daughter safe,

64
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,559
provided that you trust me.

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,720
Young Hero Hu.

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,320
Why don't you take a short break?

67
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,720
You've been working all day.

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,399
You can use this to wipe your sweat.

69
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,040
Have some tea over there.

70
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,600
I'm not tired.

71
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,519
I grew up in poverty too.

72
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,880
I've done all these before.

73
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,359
Young Hero Hu.

74
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,600
Words aren't enough
to express my gratitude.

75
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,200
Not only did you seek justice
on my behalf,

76
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,679
but you also helped us a lot.

77
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,160
I must have done a lot of good deeds

78
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,760
in my past life.

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,679
It could also be God Pak Tai
who showed me mercy

80
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,200
and decided to send a savior

81
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,920
to help needy people like me.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,399
I guess it's fate.

83
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,160
My parents died when I was still a kid.

84
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,000
My adoptive father brought me up.

85
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,200
His name is Ping Si,
and he hails from Guangdong as well.

86
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,280
Seeing you

87
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,600
immediately reminds me of Uncle Ping Si.

88
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,639
Why don't you be my Fourth Uncle too?

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,519
Then,

90
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,399
I can officially call you

91
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,679
my brother in the future.

92
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,519
Don't be rude.

93
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,319
You should still call him Hero Hu.

94
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:55,840
Look, Brother Hu.

95
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,879
My father sent me to the town

96
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,759
to buy some roast meats.

97
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,640
It's from the most famous
roast meat shop in town.

98
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:05,080
It seems like you're the one
who craves them,

99
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,920
and you owe this to Brother Hu.

100
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,480
Don't forget

101
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:09,920
to share them with your mother later.

102
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,640
I passed by
Physician Xu's drug store just now,

103
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,600
and I've sent my mother some.

104
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,239
She took her medicine
and fell fast asleep.

105
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,720
Good boy.

106
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,040
If Er's mother isn't sick,

107
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,239
I'd like you
to taste the food she cooks.

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,439
It's such a pity.

109
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,160
The family was supposed
to stay together.

110
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,080
Fourth Uncle,

111
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,720
please don't worry.

112
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,119
Mrs. Zhong was just under the weather.

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,600
She's now being taken care
by the physician,

114
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,439
and I'm sure she will recover very soon.

115
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,840
Miao.

116
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,840
Have a safe trip.

117
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,920
Do you have a death wish?

118
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,840
How dare you serve me
this disgusting food?

119
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,119
Rascal.

120
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,920
Release me now.

121
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,480
Once I get out of here,

122
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,679
I'll definitely skin you alive.

123
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,759
Let me go now.

124
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:05,799
Young Master Feng.

125
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,400
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

126
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,199
This is an order from Old Master Feng.

127
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,840
Please just put up with this
for a few more days.

128
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,319
How long more do I have to stay here?
Tell me now!

129
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,040
Old Master also said...

130
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,999
What did he say?

131
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:17,640
He told us to treat you
just like any other prisoners.

132
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,239
We're not allowed to take care of you.

133
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,600
I think Old Master is only doing this
to fool the public.

134
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,600
Rubbish.

135
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:25,319
How long more are you going
to keep me here?

136
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,160
Release me now,

137
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,999
or I'm going to die of boredom in here.

138
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,319
Open the door now!

139
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,520
That's enough.

140
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:33,080
Father.

141
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,559
You're finally here.

142
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,239
Release me, Father.

143
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,359
Old Master Feng.

144
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
You can go now.

145
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,439
Sure.

146
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,040
Father.

147
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,759
How long more do you want
to keep me here?

148
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,080
Why are you doing this to me?

149
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,759
I only keep you here

150
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:48,439
for your own good.

151
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,920
You made a huge mistake.

152
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,439
A huge mistake?

153
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:56,799
Father.

154
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:58,319
It's not that bad, right?

155
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,879
They are just two gangsters,

156
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,960
and we're at Foshan.

157
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:03,239
Let me out now.

158
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:04,199
I'm going to kill them both.

159
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:05,040
Shut up.

160
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:06,960
You're not only unhelpful,
but also incompetent.

161
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,799
If it weren't for you,

162
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,119
I wouldn't have gotten
into this trouble.

163
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,799
You're an adult.

164
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,040
Why can't you take things seriously?

165
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,080
How can I pass

166
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,280
our family business to you

167
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,799
if you keep acting like this?

168
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,480
Father, I...

169
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,119
People always say

170
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
that we should defeat
the smart ones with intelligence,

171
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,759
and catch the weak ones with violence.

172
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:40,080
What do you think I did

173
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,199
to establish

174
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,559
our family business?

175
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,600
I know my enemy and myself inside out,

176
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,840
so that I could stay invincible.

177
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:51,239
Do you understand?

178
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:52,960
Father,

179
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,999
does it mean

180
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,920
that you've already come up
with a solution?

181
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,359
I'll tell you about it

182
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,840
when the right time comes.

183
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,319
I'll release you

184
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,120
when the right time comes.

185
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,079
Stay in here and reflect upon it.

186
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,040
I got it.

187
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,040
I used to herd cows with my brother.

188
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:29,679
Now that my brother is gone,

189
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,439
can you teach me martial arts,
Brother Hu?

190
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,799
What do you want to learn?

191
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,799
I want to learn something
I can use to protect my parents,

192
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,559
no matter what skill it is.

193
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,559
Sure.

194
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,760
Hero!

195
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,120
Hero!

196
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:52,160
I'm right here.

197
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,679
Hero.

198
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,599
Our Old Master wishes to invite you over
for a meal.

199
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,319
We've invited Old Master Zhong

200
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,360
and his family as well.

201
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:00,160
Hero.

202
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:02,679
Please just do us a favor.

203
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,839
By doing this, you'll be able
to help two families.

204
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,360
After this meal,

205
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,719
my Old Master
and Old Master Zhong's family

206
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,640
will be able to bury the hatchet.

207
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,679
It'll bring peace to the village too.

208
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,360
Isn't that a good idea?

Old Master, our guests have arrived.

You can go.

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,160
Master.

221
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,920
I'm not very well-versed

222
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,400
with this Stars-and-moon-chasing Technique yet.

223
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,880
No.

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,319
You are not calm enough.

225
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,040
When you're anxious,
you act like running water.

226
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:57,920
When you're calm,
you act like a strong mountain.

227
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:00,280
You memorized this verse

228
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,679
when you were only seven years old.

229
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:03,920
How could you forget it

230
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:05,199
after you went down the mountain
behind my back?

231
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,280
Master.

232
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,640
You've heard of what happened here?

233
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,120
I'm very glad to see

234
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,240
that you care for the weak
and help the poor.

235
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,280
However, you should understand

236
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:18,079
that a wise man always knows his limit.

237
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,199
Leave some room for yourself.

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,880
Didn't you say

239
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,839
that we should always
stand up for justice?

240
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,599
It seems like you want to kill him after all.

241
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,520
Master.

242
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,160
You have no idea who he is.

243
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,760
But I know who you are.

244
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,000
Do you think I'm trying to save him?

245
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,160
Silly girl.

246
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,640
I'm trying to save you.

247
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:38,439
If you really kill him,

248
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,040
you'll never be able to get over this.

249
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,479
Although it's atrocious,
fate still brought you together.

250
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,079
Don't forget the fact

251
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:49,799
that you have his blood in you.

252
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,040
Living in this world

253
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:55,160
is as if living in dangerous woods.

254
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,479
If you stay calm, you won't act rashly.

255
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,760
If you don't act, you won't get hurt.

256
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,079
Think about it.

257
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,199
Don't go back to Tian Mountain
before you figure this out.

258
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,079
Asi.

259
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,000
Young Hero Hu.

260
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,679
If you two didn't tell me,

261
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,400
I would have no idea

262
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,559
how bad the Feng family's reputation is
in Foshan.

263
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,880
If you didn't tell me,

264
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,799
I wouldn't have known

265
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,479
that Feng Qi has occupied
hundreds of acres of land

266
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,719
out there.

267
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,360
I was too ignorant.

268
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:48,760
Please have a seat.

269
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,120
This way, please.

270
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,079
Young Hero Hu.

271
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,319
Take the seat.

272
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:00,240
Let's dig in.

273
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,160
The kid is hungry.

274
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:03,160
Just eat.

275
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,599
Yiming's mother passed away

276
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,719
at a young age.

277
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,640
That's why

278
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,280
I always coddle and spoil him.

279
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,079
Back then,

280
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,799
he had fun drinking, gambling,

281
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,079
and spending his time
with all the women.

282
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,880
But never did I expect

283
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,959
that he would do

284
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,559
something so horrible.

285
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:27,120
Here.

286
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:38,959
Asi.

287
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,679
Let me propose a toast for you.

288
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,920
Please have a seat.

289
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,240
Asi, I'm sure
you're a very forgiving man,

290
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,079
and you'll be able
to leave the past behind.

291
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:49,760
I'm really ashamed of what happened.

292
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:21,559
Asi,

293
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
I understand what it's like

294
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,280
losing a child.

295
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,920
This is the title deed

296
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:32,920
of a few nice fields of my house.

297
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,719
Please accept it, Asi.

298
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,799
Asi,

299
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,199
please just accept it.

300
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,400
I'll never be at peace with myself

301

if you don't accept this.

302

Just accept it, please.

303
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,319
Otherwise,

304
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,040
I'll be a disgrace to my ancestors

305
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,360
even if I die.

306
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:55,959
Brother.

307
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,120
Just accept it, Fourth Uncle.

308
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,479
It's what you deserve.

309
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,079
Accept it, please.

310

Here. Let me arrange it for you.

311

312
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,679
It's yours now.

313

Young Hero Hu,

314
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,160
as long as I'm still alive,

315
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:35,280
I won't allow anyone

316
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,199
to hurt Asi.

317
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:39,199
From now on,

318
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,599
I'll always have Asi's back.

319

How dare you seduce my Old Master?

Kick her out.

Never allow her to step foot

I'm flattered, Old Master Feng.

The man you mentioned

was truly the best martial artist.

I'm nowhere as good as him.

But with Ruolan always crying,

449

I can't really eat too.

You can take a rest.

00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,560
and 49 mountain fortresses
at Miaojiang.

504
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,479
He's searched half of them.

505
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:43,880
I think he's still worried

506
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,800
about his wife and his kid.

507
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,719
He wants to find the man and come home
as soon as possible.

508
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,640
Have you found anything
about the Poison Master?

509
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,519
I haven't.

510
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
I found nothing at all.

511
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,360
In my opinion,

512
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,199
his trip to Miaojiang

513
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,479
would come to naught.

514
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,479
You said

515
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,719
that he was worried
about his wife and his kid,

516
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,920
but I don't agree.

517
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,279
He doesn't care about his family.

518
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,080
All he wants is to find the truth
and take his revenge.

519
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,320
Tell you what.

520
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,600
Miao Renfeng has always been like this

521
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:20,039
since he was little.

522
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:24,239
He always refuses to repent
until he tastes failure.

523
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,759
He won't give up

524
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:29,679
unless he fails.

525
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,060
(The Magistrate of Foshan)

526
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,400
That's really bold of you.

527
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,080
You trespassed on the residence
and hurt two lives.

528
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,160
Come clean now.

529
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Nonsense.

530
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,120
What a stubborn man.

531
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,160
We have all the evidence now.

532
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,759
You have to admit it now.

533
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:04,039
Bring in the witness.

534
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,439
Your Honor, the witness is here.

535
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,800
Your Honor.

536
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,600
Two of you.

537
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,279
Tell me honestly

538
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
what you saw and heard.

539
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,759
Your Honor,

540
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,800
when I passed by

541
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,199
the Zhong's residence that morning,

542
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,120
I overheard them arguing.

543
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,120
Who were there?

544
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,400
One of them was Zhong Asi.

545
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,199
We've been neighbors for years.

546
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,519
I'm very familiar with his voice.

547
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,479
What about the other guy?

548
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,600
The other guy sounded like a foreigner.

549
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,320
I have no idea who that was.

550
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Was it him?

551
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,039
Exactly.

552
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:40,800
It was him.

553
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,560
It was definitely him.

554
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,039
He was the one who was arguing
with Zhong Asi that morning.

555
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,640
What were they fighting for?

556
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,439
I think...

557
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:50,959
It was about silvers.

558
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,959
Zhong Asi was asking for 70%,

559
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,239
but the other guy

560
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,279
said they had to split it evenly.

561
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,360
Don't worry.

562
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,719
We are all bound by laws.

563
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:03,320
Keep talking.

564
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:04,800
Later,

565
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,519
Xiang came from the front yard too.

566
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,920
He heard it all too.

567
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,279
Right, Xiang?

568
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,800
Say.

569
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,039
Zhong Asi said,

570
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,120
"I sacrificed my son.

571
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:16,959
Don't I deserve more silvers?"

572
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,800
The guy then replied,

573
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,800
"We agreed to split it evenly."

574
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,759
Bastard.

575
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:22,279
You...

576
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:22,959
That's nonsense.

577
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:23,719
"If you break our deal,

578
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,679
I'll kill your entire family."

579
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,439
That's not true.

580
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,120
That's not true.

581
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,880
Silence.

582
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,640
What are they fighting for?

583
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,679
How many silvers were there?

584
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,840
I guess about 3000 taels.

585
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,239
Yes. I heard it too.

586
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,400
3300 taels.

587
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,880
All right. You're dismissed.

588
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,239
Thanks, Your Honor.

589
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,800
Old Master Feng,

590
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,400
do you remember

591
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,800
how many silvers

592
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:59,279
you gave Zhong Asi?

593
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,439
Of course, I do.

594
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,160
3300 taels.

595
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,160
Did you hear that?

596
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,600
Did all of you hear that?

597
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:10,920
Did you hear that?

598
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,959
3300 taels.

599
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,439
The truth has unfolded.

600
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,400
Hu Fei.

601
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:22,199
It's clear that you colluded
with Zhong Asi and his family

602
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:25,320
to swindle the Feng Family
out of their money.

603
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,920
Then, you hurt each other because
you didn't manage to divide the spoils.

604
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,239
We have evidence and witnesses.

605
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,959
We have all the proofs now.

606
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,479
The case is closed.

607
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,920
Stupid officer.

608
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,400
Stupid officer.

609
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,080
Hu Fei.

610
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,320
Stop shouting.

611
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,800
People really can't judge a book
by its cover.

612
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:56,800
I was too blind.

613
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,880
I actually believed that
you were a good guy.

614
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,999
I even called you a friend.

615
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,640
But look at what you did.

616
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,519
You killed lives

617
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,400
and stole money.

618
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,239
Hu Fei.

619
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,800
I can't help you anymore.

620
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:19,640
Hu Fei.

621
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,759
You didn't expect

622
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
this day to come so soon, right?

623
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,880
I thought you were a great man.

624
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,120
If I let you

625
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,880
die a quick death today,

626
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:36,920
I'll take your last name.

627
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,719
Stop glaring at me.

628
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,759
You wanted to sabotage me, right?

629
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,759
Let's see who'll win today.

630
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,679
Give it to me.

631
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:53,120
I'll break your leg.

632
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,519
Sit down.

633
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,400
Stop moving around.

634
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,039
You're annoying me.

635
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:17,959
Father.

636
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,239
Why did you spare the rascal's life?

637
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,479
Do you think he hasn't caused
enough trouble for us?

638
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,439
We finally got him.

639
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:27,479
I think we should just kill him

640
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,080
to revenge ourselves.

641
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,959
You're too reckless

642
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,360
to be trusted with important duties.

643
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,279
Killing him

644
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,600
is just like wasting a good talent.

645
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,759
Father.

646
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,560
We're not wasting anything.

647
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,599
He won't be of any help
to the Feng Family.

648
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,720
Look at how stubborn he is.

649
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,720
You should figure out something else.

650
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:51,800
What I mean is

651
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:54,320
he made it into a huge issue,

652
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
and he embarrassed me

653
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,959
in front of all the people of the town.

654
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,439
I need to make him pay for this.

655
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,800
That would set an example for the rest.

656
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,360
I want them to watch it, remember it,
and reflect upon themselves.

657
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,680
Who is the real master

658
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,240
of Foshan?

659
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,999
However great the martial artist is,

660
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:17,599
they'll all die

661
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,880
when they come our way.

662
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,680
I got it.

663
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:26,200
We can bring him on a shame parade

664
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,439
and behead him in the busy town.

665
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,039
Then, we'll leave his body there
for three days,

666
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,599
and hang that rascal's head

667
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,639
on the city gate.

668
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:37,439
That is to show the people of the town

669
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:38,920
the consequences

670
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,840
of going against the Feng Family.

671
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,400
Two of them started the commotion,

672
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,519
right?

673
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:46,240
The lady

674
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,159
had her saber right above our heads,

675
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:51,079
threatening to kill us.

676
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,360
That's why we can use this brat as a bait

677
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,400
to get the lady.

678
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,280
After all, we have run into

679
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,639
real experts this time.

680
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,280
You do have great insight.

681
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,159
Post a notice and tell everyone

682
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:12,439
that Hu Fei has been arrested.

683
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
He'll be beheaded in a few days.

684
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,920
Then, we'll set up traps everywhere,

685
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,800
and have our men stand sentinels.

686
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,680
We'll definitely get her.

687
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,599
I got it.
