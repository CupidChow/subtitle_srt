=Episode 31=

3
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,560
Lingsu. Treat her now.

4
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,240
Did you see the person

5
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,079
in this portrait?

6
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,039
Commander.

7
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,200
I didn't see him.
He looks like a stranger to me.

8
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,160
You saw him!

9
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,239
Tang Pei.

10
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,400
How should I reprimand you?

11
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:49,439
Aren't you known as
the Blessing of Seven Provinces?

12
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,799
In the past,

13
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,600
you sent so much information
to the imperial court.

14
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:57,680
Your achievements just kept on coming.

15
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:58,840
What now?

16
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,719
When I'm finally the commander,

17
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,439
you can't even recognise
a brat who trespassed

18
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,519
my residence.

19
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,879
Do you really not know him

20
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,480
or are you purposely
trying to cause trouble for me?

21
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:13,999
Commander.

22
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,320
Saying that will kill me.

23
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,279
I am always loyal

24
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:23,600
to the imperial court
and you, Commander.

25
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,960
The universe can
become witness to my loyalty.

26
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,480
Commander, don't get angry.

27
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
I will send someone to investigate.

28
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,239
If I can't find this brat...

29
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,040
Then...

30
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,840
I'm willing to accept
your punishment, Commander.

31
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,280
Senior Ji.

32
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,239
This is the arrest warrant
from the local authority.

33
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,239
They want the disciples of
Huaquan Sect to look out for Hu Fei.

34
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,079
Report to them immediately
if there's any news about him.

35
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:56,079
I understand.

36
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,639
Why did you come here?

37
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm here to send a message.

38
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:10,559
An arrest warrant has been sent

39
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,480
to ask all sects to look for a criminal.

40
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,040
(Wanted)

41
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,040
I will inform the sect leader.

42
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,480
You should return to your room
to recuperate if you have nothing to do

43
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,359
so the poison won't strike again.

44
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,920
When will you give me today's antidote?

45
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:32,079
That depends on your performance.

46
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,320
If you are obedient,

47
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,399
I'll give you one pill
to suppress the poison.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,679
If you are not,

49
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,559
you'll have to suffer
until your skin and flesh are rotten!

50
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,799
Lingsu.

51
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,600
After removing poison
with the golden needle for a night,

52
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,399
the black blood on the cotton
has already reduced

53
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,239
and red blood can be seen.

54
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,160
The poison in her body

55
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,880
should be fully removed in two hours.

56
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,839
But the poison has been in her body
for a long time and harmed her vitality.

57
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,359
As the sect leader,

58
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,119
you should be cautious about this.

59
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,760
In the next 24 hours,

60
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,880
no one should come
and disturb Young Lady Ma.

61
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,399
She isn't allowed to speak as well.

62
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,160
Otherwise, the treatment
will be for nothing

63
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,920
once the inner energy breaks out.

64
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,119
Take turns with Xiaomei to guard her.

65
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
I'm going out to get medicine for her.

66
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,280
Sure.

67
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,320
Cheng Linghu,
Sect Leader of Huaquan Sect of Xiyue

68
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,679
will obey Grand Sect Leader Cheng Lingsu's orders

69
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,480
and dare not disobey any instructions.

70
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,359
How can I be your Grand Sect Leader?

71
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,519
Of course.

72
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,559
You even came up with the name.

73
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,960
Sister Cheng.

74
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,550
(Wanted)

75
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,600
The guards at the Commander's Residence
might be useless

76
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,600
but their portrait artist is remarkable.

77
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,640
Your portrait was drawn perfectly.

78
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,160
It's true.

79
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,640
Sister Cheng.

80
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,600
You need to give Brother Hu
a good disguise

81
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,280
and not let others find out.

82
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:17,759
That's not difficult.

83
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,679
But he is now Ji Xiaofeng's senior.

84
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,400
His disguise needs to look older.

85
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,799
Yes. I'm the sect leader now.

86
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,559
It's time to meet
the disciples of Huaquan Sect.

87
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,799
Sister Cheng.

88
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,359
You should give Brother Hu more scars

89
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,559
to instil fear in them.

90
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,559
Especially Ji Xiaofeng.

91
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,799
I think he is still dissatisfied.

92
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,879
Oh, since you mentioned him,

93
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,119
I do have a question.

94
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,400
Why did he help me yesterday night?

95
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,759
You have Sister Cheng to thank for that.

96
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,999
Ji Xiaofeng wouldn't
have obeyed obediently

97
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,960
if Sister Cheng
didn't threaten him with poison.

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,280
Lingsu, you used poison on him?

99
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:56,040
Medicine King Sect never
uses a poison with no antidote.

100
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,679
Besides, I have no grudge against him.

101
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:58,920
I won't harm him with poison.

102
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
So, the pill you asked me to give him

103
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,559
wasn't an antidote?

104
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,999
What pill?

105
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,960
You tapped his acupuncture points

106
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,879
and he wanted to break them
with his inner energy forcefully.

107
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,840
However, he was too impatient

108
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,999
which caused his energy to break out.

109
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,640
I averted his crisis
by using acupuncture.

110
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,319
When I saw you
almost getting exposed on the stage,

111
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,439
I lied to him saying I had poisoned him

112
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,759
and forced him to help you.

113
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,480
You have been poisoned.

114
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,119
Help my brother right now

115
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,199
to obtain the sect leader position.

116
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,640
Otherwise, you'll die from poison

117
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,160
in seven days.

118
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:37,160
I see.

119
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,319
I was afraid he would break his promise

120
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:41,126
so I asked Xiaomei to give him pills
and deceive him.

121
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,679
I want him to be obedient every day

122
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,319
so he can get the antidote every day.

123
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,840
Sister Cheng's idea was really good.

124
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:48,879
When Ji Xiaofeng saw the antidote,

125
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,999
he was just staring and became obedient.

126
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,720
He did everything I asked.

127
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:53,920
Brother Hu.

128
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,480
Don't let him know about this.

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,759
Kid. You don't practice

130
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,600
your martial arts

131
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,960
but you are interested
in deceiving people.

132
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,999
How is that deceiving?

133
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,799
This is called being witty
and helping you overcome a crisis.

134
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,559
Fine.

135
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,119
I'll leave the responsibility
of taking care of Chunhua to you.

136
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,600
We'll take turns guarding her

137
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,280
so Lingsu can go out
and get medicine for her.

138
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,600
Fei, I'm leaving.

139
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:16,999
Guard her.

140
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,040
Yes.

141
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,559
Father, we spent so much effort

142
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:27,960
yet we still couldn't
get rid of that brat.

143
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,199
He offended the official.

144
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,920
I'll see how long
can he still act arrogantly.

145
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,480
Uncle Tang.

146
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,999
Send someone to capture him!

147
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,799
My nephew.

148
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,600
Calm down.

149
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,119
This issue

150
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,400
is not as easy as it seems.

151
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:47,350
Chief Tang.

152
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,160
What are your concerns?

153
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,080
Chief Feng.

154
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
To settle the grudge between you two,

155
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,040
we've spent so much effort

156
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,520
and given him so many benefits.

157
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
It's not difficult to capture him.

158
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,799
I'm afraid when we capture him,

159
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,080
he will tell everything

160
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,480
to the official.

161
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,520
How would he think of us then?

162
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,520
If we get accused
of being his accomplice,

163
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,239
our heads will roll.

164
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,559
Wouldn't it be over if we capture him

165
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,759
and kill him?

166
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,759
Chief Tang.

167
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,280
What do you think about this?

168
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:31,199
Right now, we must investigate

169
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,720
to see who is behind Hu Fei.

170
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,720
Chief Feng.

171
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,840
The imperial court
hates Red Flower Club the most.

172
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,520
If we can relate this brat

173
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,359
with Red Flower Club,

174
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,439
we will be achieving a great feat.

175
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,081
Chief Tang, your idea is good.

176
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:01,119
Also, with the ambiguous relationship
between Hu Fei and

177
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,520
the Nun's female disciple,

178
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,640
we can set a big trap

179
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,240
and catch some of the big shots.

180
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,760
What kind of officers are you?

181
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:20,679
You can't even capture a culprit.

182
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,479
I've already drawn a portrait
and put it up across the whole city.

183
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:27,719
I will have more men today
to pursue this culprit.

184
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,040
(Blessing and Virtue)

185
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,640
(Blessing and Virtue)
If you send everyone outside,

186
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,000
(Blessing and Virtue)
who will guard the king's residence?

187
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,240
I've made a mistake.

188
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,799
I will increase
the residence's security immediately.

189
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,820
(May You Be Blessed With Beauty Forever)

190
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,559
Tell me. What's wrong?

191
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,920
Mother.

192
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,360
I heard the culprit is still on the loose.

193
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,400
I couldn't sleep well yesterday night.

194
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,319
They won't

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,959
return and get revenge, right?

196
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,559
What?

197
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,799
Are you afraid now?

198
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,799
Who was the one who cried and begged me?

199
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:23,040
I didn't expect this to happen.

200
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:24,839
I dare not do this again.

201
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:25,760
Again?

202
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,360
Do you wish for it to happen again?

203
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,400
Let me tell you.

204
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,079
You should just be obedient
and take good care of the children.

205
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,760
If you dare cause trouble again,

206
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:38,679
I'll be the first to punish you.

207
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:40,880
Yes.

208
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:09,479
Mother.

209
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,120
You saw everything, right?

210
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,559
If she hadn't come from
the martial arts world,

211
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,079
all these troubles would never happen.

212
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,400
Don't worry, Mother.

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,240
The guards are taking turns

214
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,079
to patrol the residence.

215
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,599
The culprit will never enter again.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,079
Are you sure it is perfectly safe?

217
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,760
I also hired many guards
who are experts.

218
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,839
The guards can only
guard the external residence at most.

219
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:45,599
The inner court has many female members
so it might still be inconvenient.

220
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,199
Besides, I heard this brat
is very good at martial arts.

221
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:58,280
He is better than
many of the sect leaders.

222
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,719
and invite the All-knowing Abbess here.

223
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,079
and invite the All-knowing Abbess here.

224
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,000
Mother is thorough.

225
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,400
I will get it done immediately.

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,640
Go.

227
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:34,240
He is really a martial arts genius.

228
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,920
In seven to eight minutes,

229
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,079
he learned Huaquan

230
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,760
and became the sect leader.

231
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,240
In that case,

232
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,959
he has taken over Huaquan Sect?

233
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,160
That's right.

234
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,199
Master.

235
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,240
I think we can use Hu Fei.

236
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
He is good at martial arts and smart.

237
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,799
If he can help us...

238
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,040
If he is useful,

239
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,240
why do I still need you for?

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,240
I think you're trying
to slack off again.

241
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,959
I dare not.

242
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,439
This Hu Fei

243
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,959
is young and arrogant.

244
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:04,400
He is too stubborn.

245
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:08,240
How would he bear the humiliation
and serve the rich and powerful?

246
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:11,479
He promised your senior

247
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,199
but in the end, he broke his promise.

248
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,400
You are right, Master.

249
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,120
Hu Fei is very good

250
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,280
but he is extremely stubborn.

251
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,439
No one can change his mind.

252
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,280
That's enough.

253
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,319
Don't mention him again.

254
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,000
Especially in front of your senior.

255
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,160
Master, Official Fu is here.

256
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,160
Amitabha.

257
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,959
Father.

258
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,599
What did you find?

259
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:09,632
Why did Official Fu
come to the courtyard?

260
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
The King's Residence was under attack.

261
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,199
He came here

262
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,439
to find a martial arts expert
to guard his residence.

263
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,599
Father.

264
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,760
Should we volunteer?

265
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:19,599
No.

266
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,280
Chief Tang went out to welcome him

267
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,000
earnestly.

268
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,799
But Official Fu

269
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,760
brushed him off

270
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,240
and wanted him to stay outside.

271
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,400
If he was treated that way,

272
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,040
why should we volunteer

273
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,360
and humiliate ourselves?

274
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,079
You are right.

275
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,599
Although Uncle Tang has
the Jade Dragon Cup,

276
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,679
Official Fu still
prioritises the All-knowing Nun.

277
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,079
If things continue like this,

278
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,120
the All-knowing Nun

279
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,360
will be superior to Uncle Tang.

280
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:52,079
That is why our current priority
is to help Chief  Tang.

281
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,040
How, Father?

282
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
I'm getting more and more suspicious

283
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,959
about Tianshan Sect.

284
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,799
We'll do this...

285
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,679
Master.

286
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:25,240
Master, it's time to eat.

287
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,079
Master. Here.

288
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,319
Master. Since I'm not learning the
Brigitte silkworm poison technique,

289
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,479
I don't have to eat them, right?

290
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,880
Eating this is good for you.

291
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,439
If you eat more,

292
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:01,319
your bruise will heal faster.

293
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,559
Since both of you
are my sect's disciples,

294
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,760
I can't be biased.

295
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,679
I asked you

296
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,839
to find Cheng Lingsu's whereabouts
in the last few days.

297
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,439
Did you find her?

298
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,360
Master.

299
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,280
We have been looking hard

300
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,520
but the capital is too large.

301
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,079
Besides, Lingsu
is good at disguises.

302
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:36,966
It's hard to find her.

303
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,120
Yes, Master.

304
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,120
Since she is a physician,

305
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,599
she will be getting medicine often.

306
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:50,319
She will have to get medicine
from the drug shop one day.

307
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:52,920
Tongren Hall is the only drug store

308
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,559
with the most types of herbs
in the capital.

309
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Go and wait for her there.

310
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,079
You will meet her sooner or later.

311
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,799
Yes, Master.

312
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,319
It's done?

313
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,559
Lingsu.

314
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,760
Your disguise skill is amazing.

315
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,799
Do you think my father,
the Legend of Liaodong

316
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,160
looked like this as well?

317
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,880
I wanted to give you a few scars

318
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,160
to add to your life experiences

319
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,400
but if other people see them,

320
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,040
they will ask you
where you get the scars from.

321
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,280
You are blunt

322
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,400
and can't tell a lie

323
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,240
so I gave up on that idea.

324
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,640
You are so considerate.

325
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:34,000
You know me best.

326
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,240
I can leave this place at ease now.

327
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,920
Fei, wait.

328
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,640
I have to remind you.

329
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,800
Ji Xiaofeng saw your face

330
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,759
so you don't need to hide from him.

331
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,679
But you still need to be careful

332
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:45,959
because of
the large number of disciples.

333
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,840
Thankfully, we just need to
hold out for 24 hours.

334
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,320
When Sister Ma recovers,

335
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,039
we'll leave this place forever.

336
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,199
I think we should be fine.

337
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,999
Go on.

338
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:55,959
I need to leave to purchase medicine.

339
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:56,759
Sure.

340
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,160
Who is it?

341
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,759
Ji.

342
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,120
I'm here to apologise to you.

343
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:49,199
I can't accept your apology.

344
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,239
Sect Leader.
If you have no instructions for me,

345
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,679
please return.

346
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,840
Ji.

347
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,039
I know you are still angry.

348
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:07,120
But there's one thing

349
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,759
I need to explain to you.

350
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,640
I have no intention
to become your sect's sect leader.

351
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,640
I only wanted to rescue people

352
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,039
and spoiled your ambition.

353
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,679
I will leave immediately
when my closed one has recovered.

354
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:19,160
If I break my promise,

355
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
I will die from
a flurry of sword strikes

356
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,439
before I hand over
the position of sect leader to you.

357
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,519
I will also be scolded

358
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,080
by the men of the martial arts world
for a thousand years.

359
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:28,120
Are you serious?

360
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:28,959
Yes.

361
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,759
Forget it.

362
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,719
I don't need you to
give me the position.

363
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,479
I know you are ten times better than me

364
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,439
at martial arts.

365
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,759
But you being the sect leader

366
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:40,800
when you're not the sect's disciple

367
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,039
is what annoyed me.

368
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,439
Yesterday night,

369
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,160
the seniors at the sect already saw
something strange with your skills.

370
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,320
If they realise something else,

371
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,199
it will definitely cause another scene.

372
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:56,279
Although you are not afraid
because you are strong,

373
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,999
the number of disciples here
will suppress you.

374
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:03,679
When Huaquan Sect of Xiyue
has a problem,

375
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,199
we are famous for being stubborn

376
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,679
and being on your heels.

377
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,320
Especially the martial uncles.

378
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:12,959
They won't let you go.

379
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:14,880
In your opinion,

380
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
what should I do?

381
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,999
The Sect Leaders' Gathering
will happen in autumn.

382
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,439
If you can help Huaquan Sect of Xiyue

383
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:26,840
gain a huge achievement

384
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,439
and make amends for what you did,

385
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,320
I'm sure the seniors will forgive you.

386
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:33,920
In that case,

387
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,840
I'm willing to do my best.

388
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,160
Unfortunately, I am poisoned.

389
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,999
I dare not use any energy.

390
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,199
Otherwise, I can show you

391
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,479
some of our sect's fist techniques.

392
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,959
You can remember it

393
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:50,759
so your secret will not be exposed.

394
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:57,600
I apologise to you

395
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,880
in my sister's place.

396
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:03,080
Ji, where is your wound?

397
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,840
This area is totally paralysed.

398
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,320
I can't feel anything.

399
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:22,920
Ji.

400
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
This poison is fake.

401
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,679
What do you mean?

402
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,039
My sister has never met you before.

403
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:33,800
How would she poison you?

404
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:36,199
She was only joking with you

405
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,719
and used some harmless medicine.

406
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,519
Please forgive her.

407
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,640
Cheng,

408
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,880
you're telling me the truth.

409
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,560
Aren't you afraid

410
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,920
that I won't listen
to your orders anymore?

411
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,400
Honesty is important

412
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,999
when making friends among men.

413
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,360
Since you are so righteous,

414
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,999
I won't let you worry
for a few more days for nothing.

415
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,279
Great.

416
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,719
We'll be friends
from today onwards.

417
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:11,679
If you offend the emperor
and commit a crime

418
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,999
in the future,

419
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,519
I will also help you.

420
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:21,199
You are a bold man.

421
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:24,519
I'm sure you already know my identity.

422
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,719
It's not that I don't want to be honest.

423
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,039
I'm just afraid of involving your sect

424
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,800
and causing it more trouble.

425
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,840
Since we are already brothers,

426
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:36,160
there's no need to say more.

427
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,759
I will definitely help you
in the future.

428
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,239
Thank you, Ji.

429
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,120
Please wait.

430
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,759
Physician!

431
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:04,120
Physician!

432
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,199
You have to save my child.

433
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,400
Tongren Hall is the best drug store
in the capital.

434
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,999
You can definitely cure my child.

435
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,080
I beg you.

436
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,479
There's no rush. Tell me slowly.

437
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:13,999
What illness did your child suffer from?

438
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,199
Physician, I beg you.

439
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,320
Hurry and save my child.

440
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,600
Senior, why are you here?

441
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,279
Lingsu.

442
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,600
Wonderful, Lingsu.

443
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:23,719
Go and save Xiaotie.

444
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,560
He's dying soon.

445
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,439
Let's go. Hurry.

446
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,239
He's dying soon.

447
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,039
Young Lady, your herbs.

448
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:29,400
Thank you.

449
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,840
What's wrong with Xiaotie?

450
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,279
Didn't I already give him the antidote?

451
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:33,479
Don't mention it.

452
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,600
Medicine King Manor
is no longer peaceful after you left.

453
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,880
Many enemies came.

454
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,719
We came to the capital
to escape from trouble and get medicine.

455
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,719
How did your face heal?

456
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,800
It was Eldest Senior.

457
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,999
Didn't you help us reconcile?

458
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,039
He cured my face.

459
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:46,600
Let's go. We'll be there soon.

460
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,600
Senior.

461
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,439
Where are you taking me?

462
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,199
Hand over the
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles Sinensis.

463
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,080
Senior.

464
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,039
You don't know its poison well.

465
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,479
If you don't use it carefully,

466
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:09,600
Xiaotie will die.

467
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,999
Don't be obsessed with treating Xiaotie.

468
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,519
He's already dead.

469
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:19,160
Jiang Tieshan is dead as well.

470
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:23,679
It's you two?

471
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,479
That's right.

472
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,360
I'm telling you

473
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,759
because I want you to consider it.

474
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,279
If you don't hand over the
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles Sinensis today,

475
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,560
you have to die too.

476
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,039
Lingsu.

477
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,959
Hand it over.

478
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,800
Don't force Eldest Senior to attack you.

479
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,640
This Nine Times Vitality Restoring Pill
is made by Master for you.

480
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,880
Without it,
you won't have a long time to live.

481
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,640
Why don't we make a trade?

482
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,880
I'm afraid
you still won't let me leave alive

483
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,920
even if I hand over
the Seven Pistil Chaenomeles Sinensis.

484
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,039
No.

485
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,640
If you're worried about Eldest Senior,

486
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,759
I'll make the trade with you.

487
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,959
Master taught you
the Magic Power of King of Poison?

488
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:28,080
That's right.

489
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,679
Master was wise.

490
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,600
He saw you harming each other

491
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,479
and didn't teach you this technique.

492
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,719
I'll let you leave alive

493
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,880
since we are from the same sect.

494
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:37,279
I won't forgive you

495
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,560
if you cause trouble again.

496
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,160
Let's go.

497
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,199
Sister Cheng.

498
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,759
Sister Cheng, what's wrong?

499
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,800
I'm fine. Boil the medicine

500
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,840
and give it to Sister Ma.

501
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,999
But I'm worried about you.

502
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,920
I'm going to find Brother Hu.

503
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:19,199
No.

504
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,800
He has important things to do.

505
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,759
Don't distract him.

506
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,120
I'll be fine after taking a break.

507
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,920
Let me accompany you inside.

508
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,880
Xiaomei, go and take care of Sister Ma.

509
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,519
Remember to call me when she wakes up.

510
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,640
Sure. Rest well.

511
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,519
Medicine King Sect is unlucky.

512
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,719
Its disciples are killing each other.

513
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,959
You are the only one
who obeys the sect's laws.

514
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,800
You can inherit the sect.

515
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,999
Unfortunately, you have a weak body.

516
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:29,199
You can only live with the help of
Nine Times Vitality Restoring Pills.

517
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,560
When I die,

518
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,160
no one can protect you anymore.

519
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,560
It is difficult to make
the Nine Times Vitality Restoring Pills.

520
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,640
If you stay in Medicine King Valley,

521
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,719
there's no need to take it

522
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,519
with the medicinal aura around.

523
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,360
You will be safe for life.

524
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,519
Remember.

525
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,479
If you leave Medicine King Valley,

526
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,880
you need to bring enough pills.

527
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:08,719
Once you stop taking them,

528
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,800
you will die.

529
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,320
Master, spare me!

530
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,479
I will do it all over again

531
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,560
and add another 2.5 hours.

532
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:49,400
That's enough.

533
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,719
You will still fail

534
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,640
even if you add 25 hours.

535
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,479
I admit my mistake.

536
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,999
What's the use of
admitting your mistake?

537
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,039
Both of you

538
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:03,160
can't even capture a young lady.

539
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:04,439
How useless!

540
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,759
Master, calm down.

541
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
We are not useless.

542
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:09,880
We really didn't know

543
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,920
Master taught her
the Magic Power of King of Poison.

544
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,840
What did you say?

545
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,360
Who did you just call Master?

546
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,080
No!

547
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,679
I made a mistake!

548
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,479
I only have you as my master.

549
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,719
Magic Power of King of Poison
is nothing.

550
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,400
When I learn the
Brigitte silkworm poison technique,

551
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,039
I'll be the one
who leads the Medicine King Sect!

552
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,759
Master.

553
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,439
When will you learn this technique?

554
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:41,999
Both of you.

555
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,719
Find new tombs
and dig up new bodies immediately.

556
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,959
Bury it in the coffin

557
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,199
and raise it with the dead body's blood.

558
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,279
Hurry!

559
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,800
What is this?

560
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,039
This is

561
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,640
one of the three poisonous items
of the Medicine King Sect.

562
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,959
Brigitte silkworm poison voodoo.

563
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,840
Take off your clothes.

564
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,039
How old are you? Why are you still shy?

565
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:58,400
Does it hurt?

566
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,160
I can't say it hurts

567
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,239
to protect you, Sister Ma.

568
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,759
What a sweet talker.

569
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:08,120
Sister Ma.

570
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,959
I can walk on my own.

571
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,439
Stop acting tough.

572
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:11,999
Come.

573
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,439
One, two, three.

574
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,080
Let's go.

575
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:23,519
Pingping.

576
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,600
An'an.

577
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:28,199
Sister Ma.

578
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,999
Sister Ma.

579
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,719
Don't say anything.

580
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:33,959
Take care of your health.

581
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Fei.

582
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:38,679
It's me.

583
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:43,199
Where are my children?

584
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,039
Where are my children?

585
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
I want to see them.

586
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:57,519
They...

587
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
What happened to them?

588
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,120
Did something happen?

589
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,320
Sister Ma.

590
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,400
Xiaomei!

591
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,560
What's wrong?

592
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Call Lingsu here.

593
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,479
Hurry!

594
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:23,999
Sister Ma.

595
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,920
Lie down.

596
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:29,439
How can I be at ease
when I don't see my children?

597
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,519
Sister Ma, don't worry.

598
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:35,160
I'll bring your children to see you.

599
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,519
Really?

600
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:38,800
Yes.

601
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,360
Sister Cheng is here.

602
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,719
Lingsu. Take a look at her.

603
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,439
Lingsu.

604
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,320
Didn't you remove the poison

605
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,080
inside Sister Ma's body?

606
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,640
Why did she still cough out black blood?

607
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,120
Her anxiousness struck her heart
and depression accumulates.

608
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,640
Now, she's unconscious.

609
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:23,439
Calling her children
because of her worries

610
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,199
reversed the poison flow
and put her in a critical situation.

611
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,719
I can only do my best right now.

612
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:50,920
Madam.

613
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:04,279
I heard a culprit come to the
Sect Leaders' Courtyard previously.

614
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,560
The members of Tianshan Sect
immediately defended the place.

615
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,920
You do look capable

616
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:10,800
now that I've seen you.

617
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,999
Tonight, we'll be
depending on both of you

618
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,080
to guard the inner courtyard.

619
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,199
That's too much praise, Your Highness.

620
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,800
Madam has the Buddha's protection.

621
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,999
I'm just here to pray

622
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
and stay for a few days.

623
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,719
You are right.

624
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,759
Mother has
the All-knowing Nun to accompany you.

625
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,120
I also want
the disciple of Tianshan Sect

626
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,320
to tell me more about Buddhism.

627
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,479
When did you start
getting an interest in Buddhism?

628
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:38,320
I've been serving Mother

629
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,600
so I was influenced
to study about it as well.

630
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,479
With the disciple with me,

631
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,081
I'm sure I can do it without worries.

632
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,999
Hailan is
taking care of the children now.

633
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,079
She needs someone to guide her indeed.

634
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,880
Thank you, Venerable.

635
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,200
Amitabha.

636
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,999
It is my disciple's fortune
to be able to serve

637
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,320
Madam and His Highness.

638
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,039
Ziyi, show your gratitude.

639
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:08,999
Thank you, Madam.

640
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,439
Come in.

641
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:28,959
Fei, Sister Ma is already asleep.

642
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,039
Don't worry too much.

643
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,800
Where are you going?

644
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,479
I promised Sister Ma

645
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:36,519
to rescue her children
from the King's Residence.

646
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,959
You'll be dead
if you return to that place.

647
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,200
The security will be tight
after you went there yesterday night.

648
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,400
I know it's dangerous.

649
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,920
Yet you still insist on going?

650
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:49,639
Lingsu.

651
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,559
A man keeps his promise.

652
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,159
Besides, I'm in Sister Ma's debt.

653
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,999
If I don't rescue

654
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:55,840
her children today,

655
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,639
she won't be calm.

656
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,599
If she wakes up
and calls for them again,

657
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,519
the poison will attack her again.

658
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm sure you don't want
to see her die because of that.

659
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,840
All right.

660
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,240
Let me ask you.

661
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,559
Have I broken any of my promises?

662
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,639
Of course, not.

663
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,479
I have something to tell you

664
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,639
so listen well.

665
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:22,639
If you go to the King's Residence
to rescue Young Lady Ma's children,

666
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,439
you should
find another physician to treat her.

667
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,360
I will pack up and return
to Medicine King Valley immediately.

668
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,639
Lingsu.

669
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,039
Lingsu.

670
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,079
Lingsu.

671
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:35,760
Lingsu.

672
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,200
Can you listen to me?

673
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,280
Lingsu.

674
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:43,760
Lingsu.

675
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,360
I know you said that
because you are worried about me.

676
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Can you open the door

677
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,880
and let's talk about this?

678
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:49,680
All right?

679
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,039
No.

680
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,280
If you're going to keep your promise,
I'll do what I said as well.

681
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,280
If you go, I'll leave immediately.

682
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,280
Lingsu!

683
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,200
Lingsu!

684
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,079
Can you open the door?
