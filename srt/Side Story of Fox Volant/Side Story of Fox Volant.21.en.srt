=Episode 21=

3
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,479
It was indeed you.

4
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,599
Sun, where is Miao Renfeng?

5
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,719
You should be ashamed of yourself.

6
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,400
If you want to find Hero Miao,
you'll have to go through me.

7
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,159
How arrogant.

8
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,479
Let me, the Hades of the South Sea,
send you to hell.

9
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,520
That's good.

10
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,840
I'm going to avenge Hero Miao

11
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,400
for his injured eyes.

12
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,560
Hero Miao, leave!

13
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,599
I wonder what's the progress

14
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,960
of the Silver-Hair Monster
and the others.

15
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,479
You.

16
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Go and check on them.

17
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,680
Yes, Chief.

18
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,080
Come with me.

19
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,040
Hero Miao, someone
from the Medicine King Valley has come.

20
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,120
Thank you, young man.

21
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,240
Useless.

22
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,839
Useless!

23
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,320
Chief.

24
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,519
At first, I didn't want
to go head-to-head with him.

25
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,559
But since

26
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,799
this is our destiny,

27
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,080
I'm going to kill him myself.

28
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,279
Let's go!

29
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,039
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

30
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,080
Sister Cheng, come with me.

31
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:19,960
Okay.

32
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,879
Sister Cheng.

33
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,159
Hero Miao can't fight anymore.

34
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,000
Sister Cheng, what is this?

35
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,600
You'll know later.

36
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,399
Xiaomei.

37
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:09,759
Stand back.

38
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,960
Stay away from the smoke.

39
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,679
Okay.

40
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,120
Hero Miao.

41
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,639
Hold your breath.

42
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,399
Why?

43
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,559
The person from the Medicine King Valley
has activated the poison.

44
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,039
Brother Hu.

45
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,600
-Young Lady Ling.
-Brother Hu.

46
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,360
Hero Miao.

47
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,960
She is a disciple of the King of Poison,

48
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,840
Cheng Lingsu, Young Lady Cheng.

49
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
Young Lady Cheng.

50
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,320
Ruolan!

51
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,559
I'm here to bring you back.

52
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,879
Hero Miao.

53
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,600
This is a grudge between me and him.

54
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,360
Hero Miao.

55
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,679
Take care of the kid.

56
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,799
Leave him to me.

57
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,080
Young man.

58
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,679
The Hidden Sabre.
It's a Hu's Sabre Technique.

59
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,799
Uncle Sun.

60
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,679
Xiaomei.

61
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,440
Are you okay?

62
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,600
Young man,
don't counter force with force.

63
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,879
Don't counter force with force.

64
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,879
Embrace the moon.

65
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,000
Close the steel fan.

66
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,320
Bow to Buddha.

67
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,360
Turn like a hawk.

68
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,039
Guan Ping's Offering.

69
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,840
Explore the sea.

70
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,480
This is weird.

71
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,679
Although that young man

72
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,440
is being guided by Hero Miao,

73
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,440
he's always one step ahead of him.

74
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,000
Take away the weapon.

75
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,120
Turn the blade.

76
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,000
The return of the prodigal!

77
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,480
-Chief!
-Chief!

78
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,879
Who are you?

79
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,480
Why do you want to harm me?

80
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,639
I...

81
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,879
Why do I want to harm you?

82
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,519
What about the time when you harmed me?

83
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,039
My child

84
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,519
is gone

85
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:05,799
because of you.

86
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,960
Your child?

87
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,279
Do you still remember

88
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,919
the time when Nan Lan went to find you?

89
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,360
She just wanted to see her child

90
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,480
because she missed the child too much.

91
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,519
But you chased her away heartlessly.

92
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,679
Back then,
she was pregnant with my child.

93
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,879
Me, Tian Guinong's child.

94
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,519
When she went back,
Nan Lan was depressed.

95
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,679
A few days after that,

96
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,720
my child was gone. Dead.

97
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,840
It was your fault.

98
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,759
My child. I'm useless.

99
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,360
I can't avenge you.

100
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,919
Fine!

101
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,960
Fine.

102
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,759
Come.

103
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,480
Hero Miao.

104
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,879
Pierce me

105
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,039
with your sword.

106
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,399
Kill me.

107
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,080
Send me to where my child is now.

108
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,600
Hero Miao.

109
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,879
Tian Guinong.

110
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,159
From now onward,

111
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,720
it's even between us.

112
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,080
Leave.

113
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,600
Stay away as far as possible.

114
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,000
Miao Renfeng, kill me if you are a man.

115
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,200
Don't go!

116
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,960
Come back!

117
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,240
Come back!

118
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:52,930
(Rear into the clouds)

119
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,320
Chief.

120
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,080
Are you okay?

121
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,000
Tao,

122
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,480
where are we now?

123
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,360
We'll reach Tianlong Sect soon.

124
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,679
No.

125
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,440
I don't want to go back
to Tianlong Sect.

126
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,480
I can't go back to Tianlong Sect.

127
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,039
Look at me right now.

128
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,080
Besides, I've made a promise to Lan.

129
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,240
I can't go back empty-handed.

130
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,360
I'm ashamed to see her.

131
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,279
Chief, it's normal to lose a fight.

132
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,399
No. I don't want
to go back to Tianlong Sect.

133
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,480
We don't have to go back
to Tianlong Sect first.

134
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,159
We can go to the capital.

135
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,320
The capital?

136
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,639
Chief, have your forgotten?

137
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,519
Miao Renfeng's weakness is in our grasp.

138
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,840
Are you talking about...

139
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,519
The secret letter
from the Red Flower Club.

140
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:10,880
Good.

141
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,119
Let's go to the capital at once.

142
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:13,960
Yes, Chief.

143
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,839
Brother Hu, close the door for me.

144
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,319
Hero Miao's eyes
can't be exposed to strong light.

145
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,079
Sister Cheng.

146
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,000
What is wrong with Hero Miao's eyes?

147
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,880
My palms are all sweaty now.

148
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,519
When I was poisoned,

149
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,559
I knew that the poison was very potent.

150
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,440
Now, a few days have passed.

151
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,559
Young lady.

152
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,079
You can be frank with me.

153
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,920
The poison that attacked
Hero Miao was indeed rare

154
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,880
and extremely poisonous.

155
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,319
If I didn't have
the Seven Pistil Chaenomeles Sinensis,

156
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,000
I wouldn't dare to guarantee
that I could cure you.

157
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,240
I knew it.

158
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,680
You are the most capable person
in the Medicine King Valley.

159
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,079
There is no poison you can't cure.

160
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,640
Brother Hu, Xiaomei.

161
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,440
Please give me a hand
with the treatment.

162
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,839
Although the Seven Pistil
Chaenomeles Sinensis is venomous,

163
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,480
it depends on how you use it.

164
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,400
If you use it to harm someone,

165
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,119
it can become a deadly poison
that has no cure.

166
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,799
If you use it to save someone,

167
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,200
it'll become
an unparalleled miracle cure.

168
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,440
Young lady.

169
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,559
Who is Reverend Yi Chen
from the Medicine King Valley

170
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,640
to you?

171
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Sister Cheng is the disciple
of the King of Poison.

172
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,640
Hero Miao,
Reverend Yi Chen was my master.

173
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,759
Was?

174
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,400
Mr. Yi Chen is...

175
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,079
Yes. He has passed away.

176
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:42,519
Young lady.

177
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,599
I'm grateful

178
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,519
that you are kind enough to treat me.

179
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,680
But your master and I
did not see eye to eye.

180
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,359
If you are not sent here by him,

181
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,319
I don't want to take advantage of that.

182
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,640
Sorry for wasting your time.

183
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,200
You can go back now, Young lady.

184
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
You are a fair and honest man.

185
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,559
You deserve the title of a hero.

186
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
But do you know

187
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,480
that my master no longer named himself
Yi Chen a long time ago?

188
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,000
Three years ago,
he changed his name to Wu Chen.

189
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,319
He had already reached
true enlightenment

190
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,039
until the day he passed away.

191
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,519
No resentments, no regrets.

192
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,079
He would've forgotten

193
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,799
about the grudge.

194
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,519
I understand now.

195
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,279
If the King of Poison was still alive,

196
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,079
he would ask Sister Cheng to save you.

197
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,119
Things have changed.

198
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,559
And the dead is forever gone.

199
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,799
Then, I'll graciously accept your help.

200
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,599
Thank you, Young lady.

201
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,160
Madam, you haven't slept in two days.

202
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,119
Take a rest.

203
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,440
Guinong will be back soon.

204
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,920
The child will be back too.

205
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,440
I have to finish sewing these clothes.

206
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,839
We haven't heard from him at all.

207
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,319
Did something happen to him?

208
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,119
Stop this nonsense at once!

209
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,319
Our master is a powerful man.

210
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,279
He'll be fine.

211
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,200
Madam, do you hear that?

212
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,559
Is the master back?

213
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,880
(Tianlong)

214
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,920
Madam.

215
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,039
Where's the baby?

216
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,799
We couldn't defeat Miao Renfeng.

217
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,720
Most of us are dead or injured.

218
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,279
We are the only ones left.

219
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,839
When the Seven Pistil Chaenomeles
sinensis is in contact with your skin,

220
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,000
you'll be in extreme pain.

221
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,839
Normal people can't even endure it.

222
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,200
After three days, the pain will be gone.

223
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,400
And your eyes will feel itchy and numb.

224
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,480
It'll be hard to endure.

225
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,839
After that, your eyes will recover.

226
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,559
Xiaomei, help Hero Miao get some rest.

227
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,000
Go now.

228
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,960
Thank you, Young lady.

229
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,359
Hero Miao, leave the kid to me.

230
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,559
Don't worry about the kid.

231
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,200
Fei, you still haven't killed him.

232
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,680
Are you going to let him live?

233
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:53,799
No.

234
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,039
He's blind now.

235
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,039
I just want to kill him fair and square

236
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,000
when his eyes have recovered.

237
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,519
But have you considered the issue

238
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,319
whereby he is way more powerful
than you?

239
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,200
When his eyes have recovered,

240
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,359
will you be able to kill him?

241
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,960
I will kill him.

242
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,880
I will.

243
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,480
Brother Hu Fei, what are you thinking?

244
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,799
Sister Cheng has already cured
Hero Miao's eyes.

245
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,680
Why aren't you happy at all?

246
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,400
He's so weird.

247
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,480
Let me ask you.

248
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,200
Where does this letter

249
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,720
come from?

250
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,070
(To: Miao. Forgive me
for sending you this letter abruptly.)

251
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,079
(The Imperial Court will hold the Sect Leaders Gathering.)
Your Majesty.

252
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,640
It's intercepted by my subordinates
in the martial arts world.

253
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,200
The Red Flower Club
is still as traitorous as ever.

254
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,960
Back then, you were kind and magnanimous
towards them.

255
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,640
You forgave them out of benevolence

256
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,160
because you hoped
that they would repent of their sins.

257
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,799
I never thought

258
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,000
that they would rebuild
an army in Xinjiang.

259
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,799
Their evil

260
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,400
knows no bound.

261
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,599
Back then, the leader of the rebels,
Chen Jialuo, and his gang

262
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,079
attacked the capital.

263
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,000
I didn't kill them all.

264
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,960
Not because I couldn't
but because I felt bad to do so.

265
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,000
I hoped that they would repent

266
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,039
and serve the country well in return.

267
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,000
It would be a blessing to the country
as well as the society.

268
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,559
I never thought that they would
refuse to come to their senses.

269
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,279
Now, they've become worse.

270
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,599
It's not that I can't forgive them.

271
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,079
But this nation and this society
can no longer tolerate them!

272
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,240
You are right.

273
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,440
According to the letter,

274
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,279
They are going to revolt

275
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,519
during the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

276
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,640
Your Majesty, I have a plan.

277
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,960
Since they are going to revolt

278
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,920
during the World's Sect Leaders Gathering,

279
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,440
I'm sure they'll send someone
to sneak into the crowd beforehand.

280
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,160
In my opinion,

281
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,160
we should remain quiet for now.

282
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,680
Let's use their plan against them.

283
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,400
On the day of the gathering,

284
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,200
we'll arrest all of them
once and for all

285
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,480
to nip off any future trouble.

286
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,599
Make sure that you don't fail.

287
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,400
I'll do my best.

288
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,759
You may rise now.

289
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,279
Yes, Your Majesty.

290
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,440
You've served me diligently

291
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,200
and you've contributed a lot
to this nation.

292
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,799
I know that.

293
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,680
It's my honour

294
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,279
to be able to share your burdens.

295
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,519
I feel gratified

296
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,079
to have someone as loyal as you.

297
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
I know

298
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,640
that you have a team
of martial arts fighters.

299
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,039
It'll be easier for you
to get things done with your work.

300
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,480
But let me remind you.

301
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,920
Outsiders will never be loyal to us.

302
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,359
They can act loyal and righteous
all they want.

303
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,079
But they will always be violent.

304
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,079
Be smart.

305
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,640
A loyal subject

306
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,000
will be rewarded.

307
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,920
A disloyal subject

308
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,319
will be killed.

309
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,079
I'll remember your advice.

310
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,039
You can have my sword.

311
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,200
It'll make it easier for you
to get things done.

312

(Memorial Tablet
of Sworn Brother Hu Yidao and His Wife)

313
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,400
Young man,
don't counter force with force.

314

Embrace the moon.

315

Take away the weapon.

Turn the blade.

I don't have any good food
for all of you.

318
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,000
Sorry for that.

320
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,799
I can go to the market later

321

to get us some meat

to repay Hu and Young Lady Cheng.

323

Uncle Sun, I want to go with you too.

Come with us, Sister Cheng.

Don't disturb her.

Hero Miao, leave Ruolan to me.

328

I'll take good care of her.

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,519
Even I

334
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,000
have been rewarded.

335
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
-Congratulations, Your Honour.
-Congratulations, Your Honour.

336
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,960
Leader Tian.

337
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,880
You are indeed a capable man.

338
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,480
You shall be rewarded.

339
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,880
What do you want?

340
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,640
It's my honour

341
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,240
to serve His Majesty

342
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,200
and share your burdens.

343
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,559
I don't want anything.

344
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,319
As long as His Majesty and you
are happy,

345
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,680
I'll be happy too.

346
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:25,359
This jade ring is a gift
from His Majesty.

347
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,720
I'll give it to you now.

348
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,000
Thank you, Your Honour.

349
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,559
Leader Tian, you may rise.

350
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,279
Do you know

351
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:57,480
that His Majesty

352
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,720
had a Dragon Cup specially made

353
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,799
for the World's Sect Leaders Gathering?

354
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,119
It represents the supremacy
of all the sects.

355
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,279
At first, he wanted to present it during
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

356
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,559
But since you've made a contribution,

357
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,240
the Jade Dragon Cup will be given
to Tianlong Sect first.

358
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:19,559
Thank you, Your Honour.

359
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,160
Thank you, Your Honour.

360
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,519
There are so many sects in this world.

361
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,519
It's not easy to get the Gold Dragon Cup
and the Silver Dragon Cup.

362
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,400
And this Jade Dragon Cup
is the creme de la creme.

363
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,200
You've brought pride to Tianlong Sect.

364
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,519
But through that letter,

365
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,519
we can only know
that they'll revolt

366
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,359
during the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

367
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,680
And for the when,

368
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,200
how,

369
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,440
and who,

370
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,880
we have no idea at all.

371
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,400
Leader Tian.

372
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,960
Investigate this matter

373
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,000
and find out about the details.

374
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,200
Don't worry, Your Honour.

375
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,680
I will do my best.

376
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,119
Taking down the Red Flower Club

377
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,000
is not Leader Tian's
responsibility alone.

378
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,519
This is a national matter.

379
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,639
Now,

380
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,000
Leader Tian has found a trail.

381
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,559
Please help him as much as you can.

382
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,920
When it's time for rewards,

383
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,840
all of you here

384
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,639
will be rewarded handsomely.

385
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,639
Leader Tian and all of us
serve under you.

386
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,000
We will go through
thick and thin together.

387
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,320
Moreover, Leader Tian is a capable man.

388
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,239
He managed to gain the upper hand

389
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,599
against the Red Flower Club.

390
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,199
We admire him

391
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,760
for his capability.

392
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,079
You are too kind.

393
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,880
We are all under your command,

394
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,199
Your Honour.

395
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,639
Brother Hu,

396
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,519
is something bothering you?

397
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,639
No.

398
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,239
Brother Hu, you went through so much to find me

399
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,719
because you wanted me
to cure Hero Miao's eyes.

400
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,280
Now that his eyes are getting better,

401
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,440
it seems like you are getting
more and more unhappy about it.

402
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,159
Young Lady Ling, you are mistaken.

403
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,559
When we were
at the Medicine King Valley,

404
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,400
although we didn't know each other,

405
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,320
you didn't lie to me.

406
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,920
But

407
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,320
why are you lying to me today?

408
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,039
I'm not lying.

409
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,559
You are hiding something from me.

410
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,239
But everyone has their own issues.

411
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,760
If you refuse to tell me,

412
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:17,840
I won't force you.

413
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,079
But

414
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,960
don't lie to me again.

415
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,039
Hero Miao, from today onwards,

416
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,559
I will have to keep
your blood circulation flowing every day

417
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,519
through acupuncture.

418
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,000
Young Lady Cheng.

419
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,599
I'm really grateful to you

420
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,760
for your treatment.

421
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,800
How can I repay you?

422
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,960
You are being too kind.

423
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,440
I can do it myself.

424
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,400
Thank you.

425
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,760
Young man.

426
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,480
Thank you to you too.

427
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:19,440
You are too kind, Hero Miao.

428
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,519
After chatting with you
in the past few days,

429
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,800
you had talked about a lot of places.

430
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,639
I never thought
that you would be so knowledgeable

431
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,719
at such a young age.

432
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,960
It's just because

433
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:34,239
I live the life of a nomad.

434
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,599
Six years ago,

435
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,960
had you been

436
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,280
