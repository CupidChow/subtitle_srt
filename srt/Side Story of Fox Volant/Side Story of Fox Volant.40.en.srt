3
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,340
Commander Hai.

4
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,690
We don't know
whether Official Fu is dead or alive.

5
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,210
You can't fire the cannon.

6
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,460
You don't know?

7
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,660
If he is still alive,

8
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,460
these traitors

9
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,340
will use him as a hostage

10
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,730
to exchange for their freedom.

11
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,980
Since he has yet to appear,

12
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,460
it means he's already dead.

13
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,530
We need to fight to the end

14
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,850
and fire the cannon at the island.

15
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,130
Leave no one alive

16
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,490
to avenge Official Fu

17
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,300
and build the Qing Empire's pride.

18
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,860
Commander Hai!

19
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:18,730
Tiejiao.

20
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,300
Looking at how impatient Hailan Bi is,

21
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,770
I think he is
trying to gain an achievement.

22
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,580
Yes, Tiejiao.

23
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,050
Even if Official Fu isn't dead,

24
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,770
he will be blasted to death
by the cannon.

25
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,220
Cannoneers, get to your positions!

26
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,450
We owe Official Fu a favour.

27
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,770
We must not let him get his way.

28
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,620
Follow me.

29
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,450
Listen to my instructions!

30
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,690
Commander Hai!

31
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,170
Do you have His Majesty's edict?

32
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,260
If you don't,

33
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,220
you can't simply fire the cannon.

34
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,020
Although His Majesty is decisive

35
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,970
and cannot be threatened,

36
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,940
His Majesty's love

37
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,300
towards Official Fu

38
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,530
is like a father towards his child.

39
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,330
His Majesty's intention
is hard to predict.

40
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,730
If he loses Official Fu
and gets angry at you,

41
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,790
wouldn't it be too late
to regret your actions?

42
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,860
Enough.

43
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,250
I met His Majesty.

44
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,450
He would never let the traitors escape.

45
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,220
Listen to me!

46
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,660
Commander Hai!

47
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,970
Prepare to fire!

48
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:05,730
Commander Hai!

49
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,370
Commander Hai!

50
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,660
His Majesty's edict!

51
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,250
His Majesty's edict!

52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,970
Commander Hai, hurry.

53
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,870
(Keep the peace)

54
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,210
Come with me.

55
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,580
- No, I don't go with you.
- No, I don't go with you.

56
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,930
I want to be with Uncle Hu.

57
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,210
Since they want to follow you,

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,380
I won't force them.

59
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,820
I will let them

60
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,650
choose the paths

61
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,730
they want to walk in the future.

62
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,980
This is the edict

63
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,330
written by His Majesty.

64
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,170
Keep it well.

65
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,050
No matter where you go,

66
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,300
it will help you escape death.

67
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,650
There's no need.

68
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,930
The people of the martial arts world

69
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,820
keep their promises,

70
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,730
act righteously

71
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,820
and cherish their reputations.

72
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,700
If His Majesty keeps his promise,

73
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,860
I won't be needing this paper.

74
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,170
It's Official Fu!

75
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,380
Hurry!

76
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,300
Let's go.

77
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,650
Your Honour.

78
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,770
Everyone, listen to my command!

79
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,580
Prepare to fire!

80
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,260
Stop!

81
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,650
Your Honour.

82
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,380
Official Hai.

83
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,540
Official Fu has a deal over there.

84
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,820
He can't break his promise.

85
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,330
We will be setting them free again.

86
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,330
Your Honour, we can't
let this opportunity go.

87
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,700
This is the best chance
to wipe out Red Flower Club.

88
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,300
Everyone, listen to my command!

89
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,140
How dare you!

90
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,890
His Majesty's edict is here!

91
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,300
Are you trying
to defy His Majesty's will?

92
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,420
I

93
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,610
dare not.

94
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,170
Pass on my command.

95
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,650
Retreat immediately.

96
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,140
Now that the tournament has ended,

97
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,890
everything is over.

98
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,850
What do you plan to do, Sister Yuan?

99
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,740
Everything has been decided.

100
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,940
I have to return to Tianshan

101
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,450
with Master.

102
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,380
You are leaving?

103
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,850
I thought

104
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,530
you will be coming with us.

105
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,380
Since I'm already a nun,

106
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,090
we are already strangers.

107
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,090
You can still secularise.

108
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,410
You went through tonsure

109
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,740
because Fu Kang'an...

110
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,210
Amitabha.

111
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,020
I am

112
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,330
already a follower of Buddhism.

113
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,740
Having secular thoughts

114
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,410
will be breaking the vow.

115
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,380
Although the time

116
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,180
we knew each other was short,

117
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,700
we were close.

118
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,140
We can't become sisters in this life.

119
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,580
I hope we can keep our relationship
in the next life.

120
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,410
I am already a nun

121
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,970
and have nothing with me.

122
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,700
I will give the Epiphyllum Dew Token

123
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,970
to you as a gift.

124
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,770
I hope it can protect you.

125
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,890
Don't reject it

126
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,940
and miss out on a good relationship.

127
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,580
Amitabha.

128
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,820
Destiny will always come to an end.

129
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,850
When it comes to an end,
a new destiny is born.

130
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,450
From now on,

131
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,970
it's like a year ago.

132
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,060
You know nothing about me

133
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,060
and I know nothing about you.

134
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,940
I wish

135
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,140
you well.

136
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,850
I hope so.

137
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,620
I wish Master Yuan Xing

138
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,970

If you don't marry someone,
are you going to be a nun?

164
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,700
Seriously.

165
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,180

you will also be a pretty nun.

we have experienced

After I got injured,

you also cared for me meticulously.

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,890
It's something I've never felt before.

173
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,140
So, I'm really afraid

174
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,570
that you'll leave me one day.

175
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,170
You are being unreasonable!

176
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,890
That's right.

177
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,140
That's who I am.

178
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,810
You've seen my true colours now.

179
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,340
I know!

180
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,340
I was wrong yesterday night!

181
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,020
I shouldn't do that.

182
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,690
Come back, all right?

183
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,020
Do you still remember
the small wooden comb

184
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,170
I wanted to give you
at the Guanyin Temple?

185
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,410
Are you going to

186
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,690
accept it now?

187
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,620
Every meeting

188
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,980
is not permanent
and won't be long-lasting.

189
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,570
There are many fears in our lives.

190
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,500
Life is short like the morning dew.

191
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,050
Love creates worries.

192
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,620
Love creates fear.

193
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,050
Those who stay away from love

194
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,020
will have neither worry nor fear.

00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,890
I've been wanting to ask you a question.

216
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,810
How did you grow the
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis?

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,380
Why did Shi Wanchen fail to do that

for life?

219
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,620
Actually, I had no idea.

220
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,860
But after Master passed away,

when I was offering joss sticks

223
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,690
I found a pot of
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis

224
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,980
under the table

225
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,460
that bloomed because wine dripped on it.

226
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,980
I see.

227
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,530
Every coincidence

228
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,620
is fate.

229
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:20,860
Lingsu.

230
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,100
Can you

231
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,050
use your master's recipe to make
Nine Times Vitality Restoring Pill

232
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,220
with this?

233
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,690
I thought

234
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,650
you can only find condensation grass

235
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,980
on Mount Yuquan in the capital.

236
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:32,930
It should be precious.

237
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,690
I didn't expect to find it
in Medicine King Valley.

238
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,410
Medicine King Valley
is such a nice place.

239
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,860
Of course.

240
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,340
Master chose this place

241
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,740
because of this reason.

242
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,770
It's quite nice
to live in Medicine King Valley

243
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,100
for life.

244
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,170
Fei, do you still
have something on your mind?

245
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,930
Are you talking about Shi Wanchen?

246
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,290
If he intends to hide,

247
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,650
finding him will be
like finding a needle in a haystack.

248
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,770
But an evil person like him

249
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,620
will be punished by the heavens

250
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,890
even if I don't kill him.

251
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,460
There's no need to worry.

252
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,810
How can a man change his ambition,

253
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,290
I will still accompany you

254
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,340
even if you're going a thousand li away
to hunt him down.

255
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,980
I can't let you disgrace
the name of the Hu Family.

256
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,260
Don't worry.

257
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,930
You don't need to worry about my health.

258
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,220
This time.

259
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,770
I will make
100 Nine Times Vitality Restoring Pills.

260
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,530
All right.

261
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,140
With that many pills,

262
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,810
you will live a long life.

263
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,380
If you want me to live a long life,

264
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,410
the most important thing is you

265
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,460
instead of the pills.

266
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,410
Me?

267
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,410
The best way

268
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,770
is not to let me worry about you.

269
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,770
That is how I can live a long life.

270
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,930
In that case,

271
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,410
I'm more amazing than the pills.

272
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,050
Chinese medicine always talks about
different herbs helping each other.

273
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,460
You are one of the herbs.

274
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,690
I heal the people of the world
while you heal me.

275
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,460
Of course, you are amazing.

276
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,220
But this medicine

277
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,500
looks a bit ugly.

278
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,890
I think

279
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,460
it's similar to you.

280
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,340
It might be ugly,

281
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,620
but it's a precious treasure

282
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,530
to me.

283
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,100
Brother Wang.

284
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,380
Brother Wang.

285
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,460
Brother Wang!

286
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,340
Don't touch him.

287
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,620
Fei.

288
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,570
Fei.

289
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,140
Control your breathing.

290
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,810
Remember the three promises.

291
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,810
You just won't stop following us.

292
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,290
Lingsu.

293
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,460
You should bow down
and apologise immediately.

294
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,690
Otherwise, you will die a horrible death

295
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,330
if he gets angry.

296
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,940
That's right.

297
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,980
If you hand over
the Verse of King of Poison

298
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,980
and Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis,

299
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,050
you will be able to save him.

300
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,850
With the
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis,

301
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,220
do you think I can't cure

302
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,180
the poison of heartbreak grass?

303
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,260
Girl.

304
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,850
Do you think

305
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,090
you will have time to save him

306
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,570
when the three of us
are fighting against you?

307
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Let's make a deal.

308
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,610
I will give you
the Verse of King of Poison.

309
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Get out of Medicine King Valley

310
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,420
and never disturb me again.

311
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,420
Take it out first.

312
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,180
It is on Master's memorial tablet.

313
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,090
Go and take it yourself.

314
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,090
Hold it!

315
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,090
No one knows how many types of poison

316
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,090
are on his memorial tablet.

317
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,330
You are wise.

318
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,020
You would have died

319
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,090
if you offended Master.

320
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,980
I want you to hand it over
with your own hands.

321
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,960
(The Verse of King of Poison)

322
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,260
Show some sincerity

323
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,260
if you want to make a deal.

324
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,930
First, prove that

325
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,810
this is the real
Verse of King of Poison.

326
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,850
I can recite the whole book.

327
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,260
It is etched in my brain.

328
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,130
Proving it will be easy.

329
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,570
How?

330
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,530
The Brigitte silkworm poison technique
you are good at

331
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,740
is recorded in Master's book.

332
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Master wrote

333
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,050
that the poison is one of the three
types of poison of the Miaojiang people.

334
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,500
It is a colourless and odourless
powder that is hard to detect

335
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,290
when applied to any object.

336
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,610
However, the poison isn't strong

337
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,700
and can be cured

338
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,770
when it doesn't
come in contact with the body.

339
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,900
But when it comes in contact
with the body,

340
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
it will be fatal.

341
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,770
However, nothing is perfect.

342
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,180
When the powder
is applied to the human body,

343
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,220
a slight green colour will appear.

344
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
In the book, Master mentioned

345
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,500
it's not hard to apply the powder
to a human body

346
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,130
yet not show its colour.

347
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,460
Nonsense.

348
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,370
Even the Miaojiang people

349
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,260
who are the ancestors of using poison
have no such method.

350
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,570
Your master knew nothing
since he had never been

351
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,570
to Miaojiang.

352
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,260
Of course, he went to Miaojiang before.

353
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,290
He rescued me from Miaojiang.

354
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Master's book does mention this.

355
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,180
Do you want to know about it?

356
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,900
Interesting.

357
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,530
Tell me what the method is.

358
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,090
I'm sure you won't believe me.

359
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,850
You just need to try it.

360
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,290
How do I try it?

361
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,330
Apply Brigitte silkworm poison powder

362
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,290
on someone.

363
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,660
I will mix it with medicine

364
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,850
and see if the green colour appears.

365
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,940
You.

366
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,610
Come here.

367
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,020
Master.

368
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,770
Don't be fooled by her.

369
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,980
Give me your hand.

370
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,770
I...

371
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,050
Master, I beg you.

372
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,050
You dare defy me?

373
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,530
I will kill you right now.

374
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,290
No.

375
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,370
Master.

376
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,500
I dare not disobey you.

377
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,810
But this girl is tricky.

378
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,700
I'm sure she is up to no good.

379
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,810
There's no need to be fooled.

380
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,850
You are really incredible.

381
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,260
You defied Master's orders

382
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,660
and still act the same

383
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,460
after following a new master.

384
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,290
Shut up!

385
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,810
Master.

386
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,570
Master.

387
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,090
Master!

388
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,020
Now, it's all up to you.

389
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,220
What method will you use

390
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,810
to hide the green colour

391
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,940
on his palm?

392
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,420
If you lie to me...

393
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,050
Senior Shi.

394
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,220
I'm sure you have Arsenic
and Peacock's Gallbladder with you.

395
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,180
Do you know that these two medicine

396
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,770
clashes and complements each other

397
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,850
when mixed with
Brigitte silkworm poison powder?

398
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,290
Mixing Peacock's Gallbladder,
Arsenic and Brigitte silkworm egg

399
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,180
will create a slow-working
colourless and odourless poison.

400
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,290
Indeed.

401
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,900
Lingsu!

402
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,660
I beg you.

403
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,850
Give me the antidote.

404
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,020
(Verse of King of Poison)
In Master's book, it is said

405
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,330
(Verse of King of Poison)
that when the Brigitte silkworm poison,

406
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,290
(Verse of King of Poison)
Peacock's Gallbladder

407
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,420
(Verse of King of Poison)
and Arsenic are mixed,

408
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,700
the poison will strike the heart
and it's incurable.

409
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,020
I'm in pain!

410
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,500
Save me!

411
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,460
I know

412
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,500
Master will have a way

413
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,220
of curing this poison when he left it.

414
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,220
Save me.

415
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,130
Your evil deeds
make even the Gods angry.

416
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,090
I'm punishing you for the sect.

417
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,740
Lingsu.

418
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,020
I was wrong.

419
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,900
Xiaotie is dead.

420
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:23,980
I only have

421
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,460
your Eldest Senior left in this world.

422
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,610
I beg you.

423
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,570
Since we are from the same sect,

424
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,340
please save Eldest Senior.

425
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,980
I'll kowtow to you.

426
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,020
I beg you.

427
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,740
I beg you.

428
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,700
You'll die if you move.

429
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,220
Master.

430
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,130
I've helped you retrieve
the Verse of King of Poison.

431
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,370
Master.

432
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,090
Put these three types of poison

433
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,460
on her palm

434
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,570
and see if she can cure herself.

435
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:21,500
This method is smart.

436
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,770
Fei!

437
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,260
Are you not going to listen to me?

438
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,980
You don't even keep your promises

439
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,570
in an urgent situation.

440
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,570
I was too impatient.

441
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,220
I didn't keep our promise.

442
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,370
But how can I see them hurting you

443
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,940
without doing anything?

444
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,700
Brigitte silkworm poison.

445
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,420
Heartbreak grass.

446
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Arsenic.

447
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,940
All of them can be cured.

448
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,370
But when they are used together...

449
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,570
Lingsu.

450
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,220
Is this poison incurable?

451
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,610
Don't move.

452
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,420
Here.

453
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,850
You shouldn't be too sad.

454
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,530
Our deaths are fated.

455
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,810
However,

456
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,290
you will be alone from now on.

457
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,810
I can no longer accompany you.

458
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,050
Actually,

459
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,290
being with you

460
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,570
in Medicine King Valley

461
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,220
has been the happiest times

462
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,370
of my life.

463
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,220
Lingsu.

464
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,220
I...

465
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,260
I want to...

466
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,020
Fei.

467
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,460
I know.

468
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,940
You have been thinking about
the Epiphyllum.

469
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,420
But you don't know

470
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,500
how much I wanted
to become the Epiphyllum.

471
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,370
I finally understand now

472
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,850
what it means

473
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,900
to have the flower bloom

474
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,370
and wilt in a moment.

475
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,220
For that moment,

476
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,460
everything will be worth it.

477
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,700
Fei,

478
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,290
when I'm not around,

479
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,610
the Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis
will accompany you in your place.

480
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,610
I just fed you

481
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,420
a paralysis medicine.

482
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,500
If I didn't do that,

483
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,610
you wouldn't allow me
to suck the poison out for you.

484
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,420
Don't feel sad for me.

485
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,220
Actually,

486
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,090
I was already poisoned.

487
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,090
Just like
the Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis,

488
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,740
the thing you love the most

489
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,660
is also the most poisonous.

490
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,740
I don't regret it.

491
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,570
Since you helped me sincerely,

492
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,370
I can't let you waste your energy
for nothing.

493
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,940
I'll give you two flowers.

494
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,610
Why are you dressing like a bride?

495
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,810
Look at yourself.

496
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,420
You look like a groom too.

497
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,850
I, Cheng Lingsu.

498
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,050
I, Hu Fei.

499
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,420
Will become sworn siblings today.

500
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,370
From today onwards,

501
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,500
we share our blessings
and misfortune together.

502
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,260
Anyone who breaks the promise
will be punished.

503
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,300

Why do you always carry it?

581
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,020
An Epiphyllum is carved on it.

582
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,340
Have you heard about

583
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,500
the story of the
Epiphyllum blooming just for Veda?

584
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,900
Legend has it that
the Epiphyllum was the flower goddess.

585
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,570
It bloomed every day

586
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,340
and it was pretty
during all four seasons.

587
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,300
Until she fell in love

588
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,650
with a young man that always weeded for her.

589
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,860
When the Jade Emperor found out,

590
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,730
he was angry
and broke up their relationship.

591
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,730
He demoted the flower goddess

592
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,780
to a flower
that could only bloom once a year

593
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,980
to stop her from meeting her lover.

594
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,460
He also got the young man

595
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,780
to become a monk at Vulture Peak.

596
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,020
He was given the name Veda

597
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,300
so he could forget the past

598
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,900
and the flower goddess.

599
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,170
But the flower goddess

600
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,650
couldn't forget the young man.

601
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,090
She knew Veda would hike up the peak
to gather flower dew

602
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,570
during late spring every year.

603
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,530
So, she chose to bloom at that moment.

604
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,250
The flower goddess
gathered her beauty for a whole year

605
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,940
and chose to bloom at that moment

606
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,050
because she wanted

607
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,820
to make Veda remember some of his past.

608
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,900
The Epiphyllum is so pitiful.

609
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:47,940
I hope both of them

610
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,530
don't miss out on each other again.
