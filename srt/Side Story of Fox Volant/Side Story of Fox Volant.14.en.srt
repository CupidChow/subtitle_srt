=Episode 14=

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,200
Lady,

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,880
come in, please.

5
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,240
We have fine silk.

6
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,839
Sir,

7
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,839
come in, please.

8
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:48,279
We shipped our fine silk

9
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,320
from Hangzhou.

10
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,119
The lady is skillful in martial arts.

11
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,799
If she finds out,

12
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,599
Official Cui will be in danger.

13
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,040
Brother Cui is able to

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,999
inflict injuries without leaving marks.

15
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,639
Without leaving marks?

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,079
If he wants to hurt someone,

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,599
he'll get close to him,

18
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,760
release scorpions
from a bamboo tube secretly,

19
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,999
and command them from a distance.

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,319
The scorpions will sting

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,160
whoever he wants.

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,480
Just

23
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,200
wait for the show to start.

24
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,599
Are you two together?

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,079
You're buying for yourself or...

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,079
Sorry. Sorry.

27
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,120
So,

28
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,520
you can't talk.

29
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,560
Sir,

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,719
come in, please.

31
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,239
We have fine silk.

32
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,040
Thank you, sir.

33
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,760
Sir, come in, please.

34
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,040
Sir.

35
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,799
Is there anything you like?

36
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,239
Ziyi!

37
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,400
Are you alright?

38
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,439
I'm fine.

39
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,920
Where did they come from?

40
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,159
I don't know.

41
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,639
Shopboy! Come here!

42
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,040
Is this a silk store
or a scorpion's nest?

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,999
It's full of scorpions!

44
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:27,320
Scorpions?

45
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,719
These...

46
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,279
scorpions...

47
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,760
Someone's targeting us.

48
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,120
It's not my fault.

49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,840
Where is he?

50
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,040
Tell you later.

51
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:41,760
Alright.

52
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,920
Thanks to my inner force,

53
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm alright.

54
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,320
Must you grab the scorpion

55
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,000
with your hand?

56
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,519
Ziyi.

57
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,320
A bit later

58
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,160
and the scorpion

59
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,679
would have stung your neck.

60
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,160
Alright.

61
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:35,519
I'm grateful.

62
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,320
Thank you.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,720
Here.

64
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,480
Let me apply the ointment on
Young Hero Hu, who caught the scorpion

65
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,200
barehanded.

66
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,399
That's more like it.

67
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,320
Ziyi,

68
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:55,480
didn't you say

69
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,079
that you saw the assassin?

70
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,399
When you were stung,

71
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:01,600
I saw a man with a bamboo tube

72
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,280
by the doorway.

73
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,519
He looked suspicious.

74
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:04,920
Moreover,

75
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,600
I noticed that the scorpions

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,760
were bigger than those in the wild.

77
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,639
They must have been bred.

78
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,280
Who

79
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:14,959
is targeting us?

80
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,639
Is it Feng Tiannan?

81
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
He is our only nemesis

82
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,760
and an overlord in Foshan

83
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,320
who has dealings with crooks.

84
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,639
This is to be expected.

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,160
I can find out

86
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,399
who it was.

87
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,280
Some people are lucky

88
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,639
and are always injured.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,119
I have to do

90
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,720
all the hard work.

91
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,320
I'll go with you.

92
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,519
What for?

93
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:49,639
Has your leg

94
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,440
healed?

95
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,280
I...

96
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:54,759
No.

97
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,480
So, why should you go?

98
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,960
You don't even master the Acrobatic Jumping.

99
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,840
Just rest here.

100
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,559
That brat thinks he is great.

101
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,040
He grabbed the scorpion with his hand.

102
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,799
Had he known that the toxin

103
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,439
was 100 times stronger
than normal,

104
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,119
he won't be so reckless.

105
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,359
Of course.

106
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,040
Without

107
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,720
internal force cultivation
of 30 to 50 years,

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,559
he won't be able to purge the toxin.

109
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,799
I'll count on you tonight, Official Cui,

110
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,160
to poison that lady

111
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,199
and get our job done.

112
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,999
Right now,

113
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,720
she should be purging the toxin.

114
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,439
Around midnight,

115
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,759
when they are exhausted,

116
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I'll avenge you two
with hallucinogenic incense.

117
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:35,239
Why did you drag me down here?

118
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,040
What are you up to?

119
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,640
Kill them.

120
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,400
Feng Tiannan's men are crooks.

121
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:44,359
They are not Feng Tiannan's men.

122
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,160
Who are they?

123
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,799
I told you before,

124
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:50,879
two official messengers delivered
an invitation to Weituo Sect.

125
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,199
In that case,

126
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:54,280
they hated you

127
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,759
because they didn't get

128
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,920
Weituo Sect's treasure.

129
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,319
It's possible

130
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,679
but

131
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,920
I've never seen the guy
with the bamboo tube.

132
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,759
The masked man

133
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,239
looked familiar.

134
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,520
I've seen him somewhere

135
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,199
but I can't remember.

136
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,160
What should we do?

137
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,520
How will you deal with them?

138
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,280
Tit

139
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,199
for tat.

140
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:26,040
Be careful of fire hazard
in dry weather.

141
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,160
Be careful of fire hazard
in dry weather.

142
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:38,080
Be careful of fire hazard
in dry weather.

143
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:04,280
Almost time.

144
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,160
Run!

145
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,319
You're asking for trouble.

146
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,520
You set us up again and again.

147
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,920
Given my old temper,

148
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,400
I would've killed you already.

149
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Fortunately, she sets a rule for me.

150
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,879
I can only kill one man a day.

151
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,360
You're in luck.

152
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,599
Who should I kill first?

153
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,280
You?

154
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,120
With your sharp mouth,

155
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,280
you hurled profanities at her.

156
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,360
I will do Lord Yama a favour

157
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,479
and send you to hell first.

158
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,079
Sir, sir,

159
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,040
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,240
Did I ask you to talk?

161
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:28,040
Ziyi.

162
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,839
What do you propose?

163
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:32,760
They are unforgivable.

164
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:34,959
If you kill one,

165
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,679
there's no justice for the other.

166
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,199
How about this?

167
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:39,880
They both

168
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,360
have unique skills.

169
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,040
Let them have mortal combat.

170
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,640
May the best fighter

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,360
live.

172
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,439
Great idea.

173
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,799
Start.

174
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:54,920
We are Commander Fu's men.

175
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,000
You can't do this.

176
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,959
Are you

177
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,679
threatening us
with your status?

178
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,479
Hurry up, you two,

179
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,199
or I'll break her rule

180
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,479
and kill both of you.

181
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,240
Never mind.

182
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Don't put them on the spot.

183
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,079
It's almost midnight.

184
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,280
You can kill one before midnight

185
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,040
and the other after midnight

186
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
without breaking the rule.

187
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,760
Yes.

188
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:18,719
That way I won't break the rule

189
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,799
and can take revenge.

190
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,959
Not bad.

191
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,319
Good idea.

192
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,240
I'll vent my hatred.

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,799
Will you fight?

194
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,520
-Yes.
-Yes.

195
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,000
Who could it be

196
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,799
but the First Young Master
of Shang's Fort.

197
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,120
Well,

198
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:36,400
do you want to fight?

199
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:37,679
Alright.

200
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,319
Let's see how much
your martial skills have progressed

201
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,439
over these years.

202
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:42,079
Wait.

203
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,079
You fought just now.

204
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,319
Now it's my turn
to stretch my joints and muscles.

205
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,319
Ziyi, be careful.

206
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,880
He knows the techniques
of Shang Fort's Bagua Knife

207
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,439
and hidden weapons.

208
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:55,679
I know by heart

209
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,319
all the martial arts on earth.

210
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,839
You two are cocky.

211
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
I'd like to see

212
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
how amazing you are, witless girl!

213
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,160
First Young Master of Shang,

214
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,040
back then, because your mother
was resentful,

215
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,839
she was burned to death.

216
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,360
You have also become a narrow-minded man

217
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,479
who seeks revenge for a small grievance.

218
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,520
I'll let you go today

219
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,439
but you better watch out.

220
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
Who are you?

221
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,839
How do you know so much?

222
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,880
Ziyi.

223
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,280
We are

224
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,959
the best partners.

225
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,959
I was dumbfounded by the idea

226
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,280
of killing one person a day.

227
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,439
What about you?

228
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,799
Kill one before midnight

229
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,120
and another after midnight.

230
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:41,160
Both of them were scared.

231
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,599
Stop.

232
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,640
Oh dear.

233
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,439
Where is my thing?

234
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,240
Did I drop it?

235
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Isn't your leg fine?

236
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,439
You lied to me. Stop!

237
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,679
(Don't chase me! Don't chase me!)

238
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,760
(Don't chase me! Don't chase me!)

(Go away!)

242

Old Master Feng,

243
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,400
did you have a nightmare?

244
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:34,360
Old Master Feng.

245
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:36,880

Father, what's the matter?

00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,079
Father, are you crazy?

What's wrong?

255
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,599
Let's get out of here.

256
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,959
Let's go.

257
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:31,679
Old Master Feng.

258
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,160
You...

259
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,799
Liu,

260
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,479
we've known each other for years.

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,160
How do I treat you?

262
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:43,360
Old Master Feng,
you are the best.

263
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,799
Great.

264
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,360
Leave with me.

265
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,000
If you stay here,

266
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:52,920
you won't make it through.

267
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,679
When something happens,
it'll be too late for regrets.

268
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,920
Follow me

269
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:00,760
and you will

270
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,959
enjoy endless glory and wealth.

271
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,839
Well?

272
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Don't you believe me?

273
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,439
Alright.

274
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,839
I'll do as you say.

275
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,719
Can I exchange my vegetables

276
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,199
for your meat?

277
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,000
No, sir.

278
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,120
Ask someone else.

279
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,319
Hi.

280
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,959
Can I exchange my vegetables

281
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,319
for a chicken?

282
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:45,199
No.

283
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,160
I have a lot.

284
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,520
I don't want your vegetables.

285
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,479
Go away.

286
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,479
Alright.

287
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,520
Don't cry. Don't cry.

288
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,959
This little girl
is like carved jade.

289
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,559
She is so pretty.

290
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,760
You shouldn't feed her a dry bun.

291
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,439
I can't sell my vegetables.

292
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,839
She has to eat that.

293
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,199
I'll buy

294
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,559
all your vegetables.

295
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,240
My house is here.

296
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,959
I want to make pickled vegetables.

297
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:18,719
Come.

298
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:19,599

Reverend, you have the eyes of a seer.

310

When I received the news,

311
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,279
I was overjoyed.

312
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,039
I immediately came
to offer thanks to Buddha.

313

This is a mother-and-child
jade buckle blessed

with chantings by eminent monks.

315
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:41,039
It will protect your wife and baby.

316
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,199
This is a great gift.

317
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,759
I will hold it dear.

318

I am surprised by your sincerity.

319
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:58,880
I have a personal belonging
to give you.

320

321
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,719

I have prepared the vegetables

333

Such a nice baby.

346
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,039
She is so adorable.

347
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,959
Her little face is so pink

348
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,039
and beautiful.

349
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,239
Madam, he left.

350
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,959
Alright. Don't cry anymore.

351
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,840
Ruolan!

352
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:07,959
Ruolan!

353
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,840
Hey,

354
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,759
what are you doing?

355
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,439
Granny, she is my daughter.

356
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,120
What?

357
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,080
Ruolan.

358
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,759
Granny.

359
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,360
This is our madam's daughter.

360
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,600
-How can it be?
-Ruolan.

361
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,239
Let mummy hug you.

362
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:20,920
Let me hug you.

363
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,600
Granny,

364
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,600
take this.

365
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:24,759
No.

366
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,080
Granny, just take it.

367
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,759
I'll tell you more later.

368
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,160
I want to ask you a favour.

369
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,239
You must promise me.

370
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,519
What is it?

371
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,560
Leader Tian,

372
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
we've gotten

373
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
everything on the list.

374
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,880
You are about to have a precious son.

375
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:41,320
Tianlong Sect will have a successor.

376
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,959
What a great joy!

377
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:43,880
Yes.

378
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:44,679
Tao,

379
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,959
I've made a living away from home
for half my life.

380
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,120
I'll finally have a child of my own.

381
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,360
Ask the servants

382
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,160
to get some toys.

383
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,479
Don't worry about money.

384
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:56,199
Buy anything you can think of.

385
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,239
Yes.

386
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,320
I'll tell them.

387
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,199
Leader Tian,

388
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,600
we have to hurry up and do

389
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,199
what Official Fu asked us to do.

390
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:06,120
What do you think?

391
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,360
I think

392
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,320
Miao Renfeng and you
are only outwardly friendly,

393
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,800
like fire and water.

394
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,840
You must clear the misunderstanding

395
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,880
and quell Miao Renfeng's anger

396
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,800
to overcome this.

397
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:23,560
Since childhood, Miao Renfeng
has been better than me

398
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,120
and he is more famous than me
after we grow up.

399
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,120
If I recruit him

400
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,640
for Official Fu,

401
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,959
he will repress me forever.

402
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:35,519
However, Official Fu...

403
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,560
Official Fu couldn't recruit him.

404
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,479
Why should I get into trouble?

405
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:42,360
If he doesn't want to serve Official Fu,

406
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,160
I'll prevent him from serving others.

407
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,560
That'll shut Official Fu up.

408
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,479
Yes.

409
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:50,959
I'll go off on my own.

410
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:52,479
Stay there.

411
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,959
Your roof seems to be leaking.

412
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,239
I'll fix it for you next time I come.

413
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:00,880
That's great.

414
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,519
Thank you.

415
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:03,439
You're welcome.

416
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:04,719
In future,

417
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,120
when you come to town,

418
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,519
come to my house first

419
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,479
and leave the baby girl here.

420
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,439
You can run your errands.

421
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,039
When you're done,

422
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,320
you can take her back.

423
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,120
Sorry for bothering you.

424
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,840
No problem.

425
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,959
The little girl will be my company.

426
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,880
I won't be bored.

427
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,039
Moreover,

428
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,039
she

429
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,920
will have a hot meal for lunch.

430
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,320
Thank you, Granny.

431
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,920
You are welcome.

432
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,840
She's such a lovely child.

433
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,279
We'll leave now.

434
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,360
Bye.

435
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,479
Madam.

436
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,640
Madam, don't cry.

437
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:50,999
Didn't granny tell him?

438
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,679
When he comes back to town,

439
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,360
we can see Young Lady again.

440
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,679
Yes, Madam.

441
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,719
Don't be sad.

442
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,360
You should take care.

443
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,800
When the old master went out,
he repeatedly told us

444
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,039
to take good care of you.

445
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,640
If something happens to you,

446
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,360
we'll be held responsible.

447
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,479
Ziyi!

448
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,759
Wait for me, Ziyi!

449
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,759
Wait for me, Ziyi!

450
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,400
Ziyi! Ziyi!

451
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,400
Wait for me, Ziyi!

452
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,840
(Nine Dragons Sect)

453
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:34,180
(Observing laws and decrees)

454
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,020
Open.

455
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:03,719
Lady, your bean curd.

456
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:04,320
Enjoy it.

457
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,600
Lady,

458
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,080
you left in such a hurry.

459
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,560
You might have left something behind.

460
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,759
You left behind a living man. Me!

461
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:22,479
I followed your fragrant scent

462
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,640
and found you, luckily.

463
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,999
Why don't you eat something?

464
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,360
This sweet wine glutinous rice cake
is soft and nice.

465
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,560
This stinky tofu

466
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,920
smells awful

467
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,519
but tastes great.

468
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,759
Ziyi.

469
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,479
It's my fault.

470
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,039
I shouldn't pretend to be hurt

471
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,959
and made you suffer.

472
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,479
You know

473
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,039
that I grew up with Fourth Uncle
since childhood.

474
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,479
I had no friends.

475
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,320
After we met,

476
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,679
we went through a lot together.

477
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,199
When I was hurt,

478
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,959
you took good care of me.

479
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,560
I've never felt that before.

480
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,800
I'm scared

481
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,160
that one day you will suddenly leave me.

482
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:25,439
I didn't know how to

483
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,560
make you stay

484
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,519
and pretended to be hurt.

485
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,439
When you left without saying goodbye today,

486
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,199
I was desperate.

487
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,199
Thank goodness

488
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,679
I found you again.

489
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,920
You...

490
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,360
Something's weighing heavily
on your mind.

491
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,719
Do you feel sad

492
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,719
leaving me behind?

493
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:05,600
Ziyi.

494
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,320
Stop.

495
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,560
You finally paid attention to me.

496
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,519
Stand here for two hours.

497
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,239
Don't move.

498
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:14,999
I...

499
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:15,840
You promised me.

500
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,400
Ziyi.

501
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,600
Young man,

502
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,519
did you make your wife mad?

503
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,120
None of your business.

504
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,160
Listen.

505
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,519
To coax her,

506
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,439
give her something
that makes a girl happy.

507
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,239
Look.

508
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,959
These are things that girls like.

509
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,880
Pick one for her.

510
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,039
She'll be happy.

511
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,279
Really?

512
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,800
I learn more from you than from books.

513
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,360
That's right.

514
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,239
I'll take this.

515
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,999
When we travel tomorrow,

516
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,719
what else should we pay attention to?

517
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,120
Please let me know.

518
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,959
Master Yi was born
with the water element

519
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,160
and should travel on a ship.

520
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,640
Water and fire are incompatible.

521
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,880
On the departure date,

522
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,840
everyone in Yijiawan should not
use fireworks

523
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,199
to avoid clashes of the elements.

524
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,560
The trip to the capital

525
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,600
will take one far away from one's roots.

526
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,479
If 10,000 people see Master Yi off

527
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:30,120
and accumulate qi and blessings,

528
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,560
this trip will be like a rising sun.

529
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,400
You're right.

530
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,279
In addition,

531
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,479
before Master Yi's voyage,

532
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:46,160
other ships must not weigh anchors

533
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,679
so as not to disturb the luck.

534
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:56,840
Tell the men

535
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,959
to inform the people of Yijiawan

536
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,279
that they cannot use fireworks wantonly,

537
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,880
and other vessels cannot weigh anchors.

538
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,800
-Yes.
-Yes.

539
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,640
Ruolan, I'm your mother. Your mother.

540
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,959
Ruolan.

541
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,479
Forgive me.

542
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:28,840
Come.

543
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,479
Don't be too sad.

544
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,320
After all,

545
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,479
you are pregnant.

546
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,840
After you left,

547
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:46,199
I thought

548
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,039
about what you said.

549
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,519
It was sinful.

550
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:52,999
How could a couple

551
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,080
quarrel to this extent?

552
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Ever since I found out
that I'm pregnant again,

553
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,039
I miss Ruolan even more.

554
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Yes.

555
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,360
Now,

556
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,999
you are the wife of a rich man.

557
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,479
The little girl's father

558
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,600
is an uncivilised man.

559
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,679
You're worried

560
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,999
that she will suffer with her father.

561
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,239
Granny,

562
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:31,039
these days,

563
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,759
I felt sad thinking about it.

564
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,360
The baby in my belly will be born

565
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
with a silver spoon.

566
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,959
Although Ruolan's father
will give her food and clothing,

567
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,519
she

568
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,679
will have to suffer in the cold.

569
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:52,360
I understand.

570
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,800
All mothers in the world

571
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,439
care about their children.

572
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,039
Pity the little girl.

573
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:08,800
After childbirth,

574
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,400
I won't be able

575
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,880
to take good care of Ruolan.

576
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,400
Her father is an uncultured man.

577
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,759
Granny, when I think of this,

578
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,320
I feel sad.

579
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:23,999
Let me

580
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:25,999
talk to him,

581
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:29,560
and you two can clarify things up
face to face.

582
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,320
Granny,

583
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,239
don't tell him.

584
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,039
You don't know his temper.

585
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,279
If he finds out,

586
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,800
I may never see Ruolan again.

587
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:42,320
Yes. Granny.

588
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:43,400
You don't know

589
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,439
how awesome he is.

590
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,880
He is a famous hero
in the martial arts world.

591
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:49,479
What can we do then?

592
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,279
Madam,

593
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,840
Hero Miao is back.

594
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,999
Granny.

595
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:09,120
You're back.

596
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,759
Yes.

597
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:10,719
Thank you.

598
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,840
It's fine.

599
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:14,120
Is she asleep?

600
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,719
Yes.

601
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,640
Her clothes...

602
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,519
They belonged to my granddaughter.

603
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,679
Two days ago,

604
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,080
I found them.

605
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,679
If you don't mind,

606
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,600
let her wear them.

607
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,279
I don't mind.

608
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,920
What's wrong?

609
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:50,479
I miss my granddaughter.

610
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,800
An old person

611
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,360
tends to cry.

612
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,959
I'll go in and see her.

613
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:01,920
Alright.

614
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,079
Stop following me!

615
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,880
I'm not.

616
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,920
I'm going the same way.

617
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,519
I rented a boat.

618
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,479
I'll go by the waterway.

619
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,840
(Li Shipping)
What a coincidence!

620
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:04,039
(Li Shipping)
Me too.

621
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:04,200
(Li Shipping)

622
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,439
(Li Shipping)
We're destined to be.

623
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:07,439
(Li Shipping)
I can't wait.

624
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:08,800
You must wait, regardless.

625
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,479
Boss.

626
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,639
-Boss.
-Don't leave.

627
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,280
Lady,

628
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,320
(Li Shipping)

629
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,159
(Li Shipping)
your boat

630
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,159
(Li Shipping)
is ready.

631
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:17,519
But no one dares to pilot it.

632
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,200
By the way,

633
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,880
this is a refund

634
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:21,760
for your deposit.

635
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,320
Why?

636
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,639
The Nine Dragons Sect leader bans

637
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,959
all ships from sailing

638
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,800
before his ship.

639
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,999
Hurry up.

640
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:31,760
Look.

641
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,680
Hurry up.

642
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,840
He also makes everyone in the town see him off.

643
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:35,680
Faster. Faster.

644
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,680
This is absurd.

645
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,400
You two, be patient.

646
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,720
(Li Shipping)
Don't crush a snake in its old haunt.

647
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,039
The Nine Dragons Sect

648
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,200
has the final say

649
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,559
in Yijiawan.

650
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,840
No ship can set sail.

651
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,360
This is based on a fortune telling
by a sage

652
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,400
to bless Old Master Yi's trip

653
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,280
to the capital.

654
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,999
We don't dare

655
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:57,880
and can't intervene.

656
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,240
Is there a need to involve
so many people?

657
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:01,840
He imposed so many prohibitions.

658
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,400
Isn't he another Feng Tiannan?

659
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,959
Young hero, keep your voice down.

660
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,599
The leader has the final say
in the whole Yijiawan.

661
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
Just be patient.

662
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,479
Ziyi,

663
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,639
what do you propose?

664
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,880
I don't like what the Nine Dragons Sect

665
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,639
does.

666
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,840
It can do what others

667
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,800
cannot.

668
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,840
It's a bully.

669
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,280
What do you want to do?

670
