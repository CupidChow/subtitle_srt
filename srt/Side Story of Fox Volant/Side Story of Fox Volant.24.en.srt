=Episode 24=

3
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:53,257
Sister-in-law,

4
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:54,696
what did Mother say?

5
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:58,416
Mother said

6
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,257
she will be getting you a side consort

7
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,737
of noble standing.

8
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:09,416
Looks like

9
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:12,217
I, Fu Kang'an, am destined

10
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:14,977
to be sonless.

11
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,016
Kang'an, don't blame Mother.

12
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:20,937
She's doing it for your sake.

13
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:22,736
You hold a distinctive status.

14
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:24,136
Those girls

15
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:25,616
are not worthy of you.

16
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
Previously, His Majesty

17
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:30,136
inquired me about begetting a son.

18
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,257
His Majesty said

19
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:35,977
how could I,
the Minister of War of the Qing,

20
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,576
fail to handle family affairs well?

21
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:42,296
Wasn't I making a fool of myself?

22
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:44,416
I didn't mean to reproach you.

23
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,497
But did you father any child out there?

24
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:55,777
Based on the current situation,

25
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,856
you have to do one thing
under cover of another.

26
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:01,616
Whether she's an artisan

27
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:03,296
or a commoner,

28
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:06,176
the most important thing
is they can bear your child.

29
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,937
When what is done cannot be undone,

30
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:11,377
Mother and Madam Hailan
will be hands tied.

31
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:14,937
You have a point.

32
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:17,616
I'll wait for your good news then.

33
00:03:19,057 --> 00:03:19,777
Official.

34
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:20,856
What's the matter?

35
00:03:21,257 --> 00:03:23,057
Official Shang is waiting
at the entrance

36
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:24,856
and would like to pay you his respect.

37
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:26,016
I won't see him.

38
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:27,057
Yes, Official Fu.

39
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:34,497
Please leave.

40
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:35,377
Official Fu has no time for you.

41
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:38,257
Hey, Li.

42
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:39,456
Didn't we have a deal?

43
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:40,416
Did we? Get off.

44
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:00,497
Looking down on me?

45
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:09,016
Kang'an was born
with a silver spoon in his mouth.

46
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:12,136
Why is he still sonless at this age?

47
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:16,777
Please speed up.

48
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:18,256
His Majesty is waiting for me.

49
00:04:18,496 --> 00:04:19,017
Yes, Your Highness.

50
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:24,376
Depart!

51
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,296
You deserve it.

52
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:47,977
Sir,

53
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:49,017
come over.

54
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:50,217
Sir, come over.

55
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:52,217
Bring one home.

56
00:04:52,856 --> 00:04:53,856
It can speak the human language.

57
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:55,176
Speak the human language?

58
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:55,816
That's right.

59
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:58,176
It knows "Wishing you
prosperity and wealth!"

60
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:02,577
Wishing you prosperity and wealth!

61
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,496
I didn't deceive you, right?

62
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:05,217
Official Shang!

63
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:07,897
Official Shang!

64
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:10,856
Sir, please come again soon!

65
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:11,537
Official Shang!

66
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:14,097
Stop, Official Shang!

67
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:17,296
Official Shang!

68
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:19,217
I've been waiting for you.

69
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:20,056
Well,

70
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:21,337
shouldn't you

71
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:22,496
repay your debts?

72
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:26,296
Give me a few more days.

73
00:05:26,856 --> 00:05:27,856
A few more days.

74
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:29,097
Well, Official Shang.

75
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:29,977
Official Shang,

76
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:31,496
you can't get away today.

77
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:36,816
It hurts.

78
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:37,856
Looking for a fight?

79
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:38,856
No, I dare not.

80
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:41,097
You deserve it.

81
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:42,097
Well...

82
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:43,616
Well, Official Shang.

83
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,457
You're a military official after all.

84
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:47,256
Don't bully us businessmen.

85
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:49,416
It has been about three years
since you owed us money.

86
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:50,217
This is

87
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:51,657
unjustifiable.

88
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:52,616
That's right, Official Shang.

89
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:53,977
It's only a dozen taels.

90
00:05:55,777 --> 00:05:57,736
Go and strengthen your physique.

91
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:00,816
One day when I become successful,

92
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:02,097
I'll suppress you with my wealth.

93
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:08,736
Look carefully.

94
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:10,777
This is an authentic suet white jade.

95
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:11,337
Well...

96
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:14,017
It's more than enough
to cover the interests.

97
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:15,256
Take the balance

98
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:16,977
to buy a cup of tea for yourself.

99
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:22,777
Letting him off just like that?

100
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:24,217
What can we do?

101
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,416
He's so strong.

102
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:26,457
We can't beat him.

103
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:29,017
At least we have this now.

104
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:30,537
Let's report to our boss.

105
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,376
Let's go.

106
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:34,457
Come on!

107
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:35,736
Come on! Take your card!

108
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:36,376
Take your card!

109
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:37,537
I don't believe it.

110
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:40,176
Come on. Place your bet now.

111
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:41,577
Hurry up.

112
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:45,777
I'll win

113
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:46,376
this round.

114
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,657
Come on!

115
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:50,217
Come on! Place your bet now!

116
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:50,777
Take your card!

117
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:52,337
Come on!

118
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:54,256
Come on!

119
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:56,176
Come on! Hurry up!

120
00:06:58,457 --> 00:06:59,496
My fellow officials,

121
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:00,697
playing a game?

122
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,736
Aren't you Official Shang?

123
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,457
You've become rich?

124
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,056
Wearing new clothes?

125
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:09,296
Official Shang,
you have money for gambling now?

126
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:11,416
When will you repay the debts
you owed to my brothers?

127
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:14,457
Let's speak amicably,

128
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:15,496
all right?

129
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:17,176
When I win this round,

130
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:19,017
I'll repay all my debts,
including the interests.

131
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:22,337
You have bad luck in gambling.
Just forget it.

132
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,897
Didn't you hear what Brother Li said?

133
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:25,856
Third Brother,

134
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:27,657
we're all court officials.

135
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:29,176
We'll bump into each other frequently.

136
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,777
Don't make it difficult for him.

137
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:31,816
Come on.

138
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:34,137
Get him a chair

139
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:35,416
so he can play to his heart's content.

140
00:07:36,176 --> 00:07:37,376
Go on. My eldest brother
allows you to play.

141
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:38,657
Let's see if you win or lose.

142
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:42,616
Come on. Let's play now.

143
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:44,097
Come on. Deal the cards.

144
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,697
All right. Hands off once decided.

145
00:07:45,977 --> 00:07:46,777
Come on. Take your card.

146
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:11,777
I'm not playing now.

147
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:14,097
What is this?

148
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:15,936
Official Shang,

149
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,416
how could you walk away
after the game has started?

150
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,217
Are you fooling us now?

151
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:21,897
Well, Official Shang,

152
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:24,056
you chickened out in a gambling game.

153
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,056
Aren't you afraid
of becoming a laughingstock?

154
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:26,816
That's right.

155
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:29,376
Official Shang, are you having

156
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,097
bad luck in gambling?

157
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,697
Why don't we give way

158
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:33,577
and let him play first?

159
00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:35,136
Didn't we already
give way a few rounds?

160
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:37,817
Official Wang, I disagree with you.

161
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:38,896
In my opinion,

162
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:39,656
Official Shang,

163
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:40,496
look at him.

164
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:42,417
You're a man.

165
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:43,937
If I were you,

166
00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:45,896
I'd rather sell off this outfit

167
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,297
and play a complete round.

168
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:48,016
That's right.

169
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:48,656
Am I right?

170
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:49,376
Yes.

171
00:08:52,057 --> 00:08:55,776
Official Li, I've never offended you.

172
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:57,736
Why are you pressuring me?

173
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:00,297
Official Shang, how could you say so?

174
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:01,896
I dare not pressure you.

175
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:04,016
Your creditors are your juniors.

176
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:05,496
Who amongst us

177
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:07,337
didn't treat you as our senior?

178
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:10,057
I'm just afraid
that no one wants to follow him

179
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,656
despite having many juniors.

180
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:15,937
Calm down.

181
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:16,977
Cool down.

182
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,896
Look, we're just fooling around.

183
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,177
Come on.

184
00:09:21,496 --> 00:09:22,417
Let me take a look.

185
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:23,097
Come on.

186
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:23,697
Let me take a look.

187
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,136
My fellow officials,

188
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:30,977
this outfit is worth at least 100 taels.

189
00:09:31,177 --> 00:09:32,656
It's worth it.

190
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,177
This mask...

191
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:51,337
He's agitated.

192
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:52,536
He's agitated.

193
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:08,417
Official Shang, why do you walk away?

194
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:10,697
If I were to live

195
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:12,177
in such a cramped place,

196
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,297
I would feel ashamed!

197
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:17,297
Right?

198
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:19,016
Come on.

199
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:21,417
Just wait and see.

200
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:34,977
Wait for me!

201
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:36,817
Pingping! An'an!

202
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:38,297
Watch your step! Don't slip!

203
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:39,937
Stop running!

204
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,417
Greetings, Old Madam, Young Master.

205
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:51,856
Mother, I want to eat candied hawthorn.

206
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:54,097
So do I.

207
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:57,817
Let's get the medicines
for your father first.

208
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,016
We'll come back later, okay?

209
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:06,536
Have a look.

210
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:09,177
Young Lady, why don't you buy
two sticks for your kids?

211
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:41,337
Lingsu, eat something.

212
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,256
I know you're not feeling well.

213
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:45,016
So I specially
bought you something light.

214
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:46,136
Hope it will fit your appetite.

215
00:11:46,776 --> 00:11:47,577
Thank you, Eldest Brother.

216
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:50,536
Since I'm your Eldest Brother,

217
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:51,896
I must take care of you.

218
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:53,217
Don't stand on ceremony again.

219
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:55,896
You have some too.

220
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:04,496
I saw two men

221
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:05,457
on the street

222
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:06,856
inquiring about me with my portrait.

223
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:08,577
Fortunately, I dodged them quickly.

224
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:11,417
Otherwise, I guess
there would be a sumptuous meal

225
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:12,616
awaiting me in the mansion.

226
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:16,136
Don't you want to be
a rich landowner again?

227
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,736
Stop making fun of me.

228
00:12:18,256 --> 00:12:19,577
I've been a vagrant since I was a kid.

229
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:20,937
I don't have such luck.

230
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:23,937
You're carefree

231
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:24,697
and unrestrained.

232
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:25,977
You're much happier

233
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:27,536
than those rich landowners.

234
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:28,937
That's for sure.

235
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,256
It will take us some time

236
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:32,536
before we reach the capital.

237
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:33,856
They recognize me.

238
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:34,896
They will eventually find me.

239
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:40,496
There are ways to dodge them.

240
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:24,136
Father.

241
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:24,937
My sons.

242
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:26,977
My sons,

243
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,337
have you been obedient at home?

244
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:31,977
Guess what I've brought you.

245
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,656
I'm not guessing. Tell us, Father.

246
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:37,417
Candied hawthorn!

247
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:38,376
One each.

248
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:40,656
Go on and play.

249
00:13:41,297 --> 00:13:42,016
Go on.

250
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:44,656
Candied hawthorn!

251
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:45,536
Look at these brats.

252
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:47,177
You should have saved
the money for your medicines.

253
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:50,057
(May Spring Fill Up The Entire Garden)
As long as they are happy,

254
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:50,856
(May Spring Fill Up The Entire Garden)

255
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,057
(May Spring Fill Up The Entire Garden)
I'm halfway to my full recovery.

256
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,710
(May Spring Fill Up The Entire Garden)

257
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,016
This is

258
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:56,856
way more efficient than any medicine.

259
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,057
How did the negotiation go?

260
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:20,496
After the Shang's Fort incident,

261
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:22,776
our Feima Escort Agency's reputation

262
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:24,656
has been greatly damaged.

263
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:27,136
Forget about sealing an escort deal.

264
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:29,337
Even if I apply to be
the head of another escort agency,

265
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,937
they will hesitate to hire me.

266
00:14:36,097 --> 00:14:38,736
Where there is life, there is hope.

267
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:41,217
You haven't fully recovered
from your old injury.

268
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:42,697
Naturally, they are hesitant.

269
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:46,337
Although we have dissolved
Feima Escort Agency

270
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:47,896
and have little savings,

271
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:50,496
we won't go hungry still.

272
00:14:51,376 --> 00:14:52,736
Don't be anxious, Senior.

273
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,217
How can I not feel so?

274
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:01,297
We have to consider the kids.

275
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:14,217
Who are you?

276
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:17,337
Kids, how old are you?

277
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:18,817
I'm not telling you.

278
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:21,177
But I still know it.

279
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:23,097
Both of you are six years old.

280
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:24,577
Your parents are escorts.

281
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:26,057
How did you know?

282
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:28,856
I also know

283
00:15:29,457 --> 00:15:31,297
that your mother's surname is Ma.

284
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:34,177
Pingping, stop talking to him.

285
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:37,496
Or else he would know
our father is called Xu Zheng.

286
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:42,256
Pingping! An'an!

287
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:44,337
-Mother.
-Mother.

288
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:54,376
Who are you talking to?

289
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:56,057
We're talking to an uncle.

290
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:57,776
An uncle?

291
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:06,457
Come on. Let's get inside.

292
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:09,417
Come on.

293
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:26,656
Lingsu,

294
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,817
what an intricate skill you have.

295
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:31,136
You've given me a makeover.

296
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:34,536
I made you look like a middle-aged man.

297
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,016
You look 20 years older now.

298
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:37,097
You should thank me instead.

299
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:38,417
As long as they don't recognize me,

300
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:39,577
anything will do.

301
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:42,016
I believe that with your skills,

302
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:43,457
you can easily make me look

303
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:44,217
like a young lady.

304
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,656
That's rather difficult.

305
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:48,097
But turning you into
an old woman is an easy job.

306
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:49,977
That sounds good too.

307
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,217
I'll disguise as an old woman,

308
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:53,817
and you as an old man.

309
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,536
And we'll hit the road together.

310
00:16:55,577 --> 00:16:56,177
I don't think

311
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:57,977
they can make us rich landowners.

312
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:02,496
(I'm afraid I don't have the luck)

(to grow old with you.)

314
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:10,576
Lvliu Villa's Manager Zhang
has seen me before.

315
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:11,897
If they can't find you,

316
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:13,776
they will definitely
draw a portrait of me.

317
00:17:14,496 --> 00:17:15,816
I must do a makeover too.

318
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:16,857
Lingsu,

319
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,977
are you really going
to disguise yourself as an old man?

320
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:26,857
Official Fu.

321
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:28,217
Official Fu.

Official Fu.

323

It's you again?

324
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:31,617
Official Fu has no time for you.

325
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,256
Get off.

326
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:33,217
Get off.

327
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,776
Official, I have
something important to report.

328
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:39,977
It's related to your future.

329

Official,

330
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,217
those are the kids.

331

These two young masters
look extraordinary.

332
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:04,816
One can tell at a glance
that they're your sons.

333
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:07,816
Their brows

334
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:12,177
do resemble mine.

335
00:18:19,336 --> 00:18:20,576
Why are you so careless?

336
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:21,217
Get up.

That's enough. Stop messing around.

339
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:53,857
Official,

340
00:18:54,776 --> 00:18:55,776
about the two kids...

341
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:58,496
Let's talk about it at my residence.

342
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:42,590
(Dexing Restaurant)

343
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:51,617
Boss, two suites, please.

344
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:57,256
I'm so sorry.

345
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,256
Our suites are fully booked.

346
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:04,377
Second Brother,

347
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,977
you have to make do
with an ordinary room then.

348
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:07,776
Don't you know

349
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:09,256
that I like the ordinary room?

350
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:10,016
It makes me feel carefree.

351
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:11,857
Two ordinary rooms then.

352
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:13,096
Okay.

353
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:15,056
Waiter,

354
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:17,377
bring these two guests to their rooms.

355
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:19,056
Okay. This way, please.

356
00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:35,576
You all have been working for me
for the past few years.

357
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:37,697
You all did a good job.

358
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:39,217
Today,

359
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:42,217
I have a crucial matter on hand.

360
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,417
Besides you all,

361
00:20:44,897 --> 00:20:46,056
no one else can handle it well.

362
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,296
It's thanks to you
that we can enjoy prestige

363
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:51,937
and wealth today.

364
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:53,857
Official, please give us

365
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,377
the command.

366
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:57,377
I'm not in a hurry

367
00:20:58,496 --> 00:20:59,736
to elaborate on it.

368
00:21:01,857 --> 00:21:02,857
As the saying goes,

369
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:05,417
the boat is led by the boatman.

370
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,816
The soldiers are led by the general.

371
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:13,096
Although all of you are well-known

372
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:14,377
in the martial arts world,

373
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:16,617
this task

374
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:19,296
needs to be led by a leader.

375
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:21,217
Official Fu, I agree with you.

376
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:24,096
Since Chief Zhou Tiejiao

377
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:26,417
is well-respected
and adept at martial arts,

378
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:29,536
he's the best candidate
for the leadership position.

379
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,217
Li, you flatter me.

380
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:32,736
You flatter me.

381
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:37,697
Both Official He and Official Cui
are also well-known.

382
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,377
I think we can elect

383
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:42,977
one of them as our leader.

384
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:44,977
How could I flaunt

385
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:47,377
before an expert like Chief Zhou?

386
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:49,897
You're the only one who can lead us.

387
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:54,177
I know you all cherish each other

388
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:55,697
and are bound to give in.

389
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,617
But

390
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,776
I've decided who will be the leader.

391
00:22:05,096 --> 00:22:05,776
Please come out.

392
00:22:17,617 --> 00:22:18,617
Official, please give me the command.

393
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:22,217
Shang Baozhen, please take the command.

394
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:25,417
You've eased my worries

395
00:22:25,816 --> 00:22:26,857
and made a great contribution.

396
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:30,377
You're now promoted
to Vice Commander-General

397
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:32,657
and continue to work for me.

398
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:35,496
I'm willing to sacrifice my life

399
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:37,096
and give my best.

400
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:39,056
Please rise.

401
00:22:41,296 --> 00:22:42,657
I've shared the details

402
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:45,016
with Vice Commander-General Shang.

403
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:47,816
Please obey his command

404
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:49,296
and act accordingly.

405
00:22:50,657 --> 00:22:52,256
-Yes, Official Fu!
-Yes, Official Fu!

406
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:53,857
Then, I will

407
00:22:54,177 --> 00:22:57,256
wait for your good news
in the capital.

408
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:58,056
-Yes, Official Fu.
-Yes, Official Fu.

409
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:03,137
Mother, where are we going?

410
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:05,457
Of course we're going on an escort trip.

411
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:06,096
What a fool.

412
00:23:07,056 --> 00:23:08,417
We're not going on an escort trip.

413
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,016
I'm bringing you back to our hometown.

414
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,417
Father told us we can
earn money from escort services

415
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:14,816
to buy us candied hawthorn.

416
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:17,697
When we arrive at our hometown,

417
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:20,137
I will weave and plow the field.

418
00:23:20,336 --> 00:23:21,536
Your father will hunt in the mountain.

419
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:23,417
We can still have candied hawthorn.

420
00:23:24,177 --> 00:23:25,256
We can eat candied hawthorn!

421
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:26,336
Chunhua.

422
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:29,576
Father.

423
00:23:31,137 --> 00:23:31,937
My sons,

424
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:33,657
have you been naughty today?

425
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:34,417
No.

426
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:36,016
Really?

427
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:36,937
Yes.

428
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:38,937
Go on and play.

429
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:40,857
I'll get to work.

430
00:23:40,857 --> 00:23:41,736
I'm almost done with the packing.

431
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:44,377
Chunhua,

432
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:45,657
I have big news.

433
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:47,536
Money has fallen from the sky.

434
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:50,897
A big client is looking
for an escort agency to deliver taels.

435
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,417
They've paid 9000 taels.

436
00:23:52,776 --> 00:23:54,336
We can bring our luggage along.

437
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,457
9000 taels?

438
00:23:58,657 --> 00:23:59,736
It isn't much,

439
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:02,177
but there are many issues
to take care of.

440
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:05,816
I think we should give it a pass.

441
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:09,617
It might not be much,

442
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:11,137
but we can earn some money.

443
00:24:11,937 --> 00:24:13,056
When we reach our hometown,

444
00:24:13,256 --> 00:24:15,096
we can use the money
to renovate the old house

445
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:17,336
so you and the kids
can live more comfortably.

446
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:20,336
Okay then.

447
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:32,417
Greetings, Official Fu.

448
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:34,897
Be at ease.

449
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,137
How did it go?

450
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:41,617
It's all arranged.

451
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:43,417
I assure you
that there won't be a single flaw,

452
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:44,937
and words won't leak out.

453
00:24:45,256 --> 00:24:46,016
Just

454
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:47,617
bring them back.

455
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:49,697
Don't hurt anyone.

456
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:50,857
Avoid it wherever possible.

457
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:53,217
It's not easy for Hua

458
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:55,256
to raise two kids

459
00:24:55,857 --> 00:24:57,056
all these years.

460
00:25:00,256 --> 00:25:01,457
Official, you're benevolent.

461
00:25:01,657 --> 00:25:02,776
You'll be blessed.

462
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:04,857
When the two young masters arrive here,

463
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,377
you can nurture them personally.

464
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,496
They will become
high-ranking officials in the future.

465
00:25:09,736 --> 00:25:10,736
It can be achieved easily.

466
00:25:11,736 --> 00:25:12,457
Come over.

467
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:19,977
Take this with you.

468
00:25:20,776 --> 00:25:21,897
Use it in case of emergency.

469
00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:23,256
Remember,

470
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:25,056
you must be cautious.

471
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:27,177
Yes, Official Fu.

472
00:25:42,536 --> 00:25:43,496
Back then,

473
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:45,736
Master was known as Invincible Fist.

474
00:25:45,937 --> 00:25:47,217
Feima Escort Agency was well-known

475
00:25:47,217 --> 00:25:48,177
in the martial arts world.

476
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,217
Now, it's getting worst day by day.

477
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:53,697
We can't even raise

478
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:55,657
our escort flag now.

479
00:25:56,576 --> 00:25:58,217
Which escort agency
doesn't make a secret trip, right?

480
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:00,137
Isn't it more peaceful

481
00:26:00,137 --> 00:26:01,177
to go unnoticed?

482
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:04,296
Why do you care about superficial fame?

483
00:26:07,137 --> 00:26:09,217
My father might be well-known,

484
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:11,217
but he had many enemies.

485
00:26:12,857 --> 00:26:15,296
Otherwise, he wouldn't have fallen
into Old Madam Shang's trap

486
00:26:16,496 --> 00:26:17,617
and lost his life.

487
00:26:19,736 --> 00:26:21,096
I'm so useless.

488
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:23,657
I can't give you all a comfortable life.

489
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:26,177
Senior, stop saying so.

490
00:26:26,857 --> 00:26:28,857
You've been taking good care of us.

491
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,776
Living in peace

492
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:34,576
matters most.

493
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,930
(Chaoyang Gate)

494
00:26:59,937 --> 00:27:00,776
Vice Commander-General Shang,

495
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:02,457
they've reached the Hebei border

496
00:27:03,096 --> 00:27:04,096
ten miles ahead.

497
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:07,657
Continue to scout around.

498
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:08,417
Yes, Official Shang.

499
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:13,576
He's only a low-ranking official.

500
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:14,977
Yet, he's acting like a king.

501
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:17,496
What a vile person.

502
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:19,736
He must have forgotten his poor days

503
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:21,377
at Juying Restaurant.

504
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:23,296
Unfortunately,

505
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:25,377
Commander didn't tell us
what the task is about.

506
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:28,177
Otherwise, we'd have joined forces
and gotten it done quickly.

507
00:27:28,177 --> 00:27:30,016
We wouldn't have
to suffer indignity like now.

508
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:08,617
Lingsu,

509
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:10,217
what's going on?

510
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:11,576
Why are you taking the medicines?

511
00:28:12,296 --> 00:28:13,177
I'm fine.

512
00:28:13,177 --> 00:28:14,457
I caught a cold.

513
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:16,857
It's my fault.

514
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:18,096
I've been anxious to arrive

515
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:19,736
and forgotten about
your weak body.

516
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:20,776
Wait here.

517
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:22,137
I'll get the physician.

518
00:28:22,496 --> 00:28:23,137
Eldest Brother,

519
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:24,496
have you forgotten

520
00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:25,977
that I'm a physician?

521
00:28:27,217 --> 00:28:27,816
Oh, yes.

522
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:29,016
Look at my memory.

523
00:28:29,697 --> 00:28:31,417
Do you need to hunt for medicinal herbs?

524
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:32,417
I can do it now.

525
00:28:33,617 --> 00:28:34,776
I will recover after taking a pill.

526
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:37,417
I have a weak body
since I was a kid.

527
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:40,816
Master specially made
these medicinal pills for me.

528
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:42,736
It can strengthen my body.

529
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:44,857
Whenever I have a headache or fever,

530
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:46,137
I'll recover after taking a pill.

531
00:28:47,177 --> 00:28:48,096
I'll be fine, Eldest Brother.

532
00:28:48,217 --> 00:28:49,457
I'll recover after a good night's rest.

533
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:51,177
We can continue our journey tomorrow.

534
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:53,496
Take good care of your health first.

535
00:28:53,776 --> 00:28:54,617
Leave the journey

536
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:56,177
to the time when you've fully recovered.

537
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:35,536
Vice Commander-General Shang,

538
00:29:36,457 --> 00:29:38,296
we're out of the capital now.

539
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:39,296
May I ask

540
00:29:39,897 --> 00:29:42,016
what kind of task it is?

541
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:43,937
How should we proceed?

542
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,417
Official Zhou seems to have forgotten.

543
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:50,536
Before our departure,

544
00:29:50,536 --> 00:29:51,816
Official Fu commanded you all

545
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:54,296
to obey my command.

546
00:29:54,977 --> 00:29:56,336
And you inquired about it
right after we left

547
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,296
the capital.

548
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,897
Are you planning
to disobey Commander Fu's command?

549
00:30:02,977 --> 00:30:03,776
Vice Commander-General Shang,

550
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:05,937
how could you say so?

551
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:07,857
We can only act accordingly

552
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:11,016
after the command is given.

553
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:11,977
That's why

554
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:15,177
I inquired about it.

555
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:16,897
Since you're aware of it,

556
00:30:17,736 --> 00:30:19,377
just wait in peace.

557
00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:21,177
At the right time,

558
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:23,697
I'll naturally give you the command.

559
00:30:25,937 --> 00:30:27,457
We're all equal.

560
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,657
Why are you putting on an act here?

561
00:30:29,776 --> 00:30:31,177
Commander Fu wants us
to obey your command

562
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:32,137
in executing the task.

563
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:33,377
We're not here for leisure

564
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:34,217
and to watch you flaunt.

565
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,857
Stop treating feathers as arrows.

566
00:30:35,857 --> 00:30:36,496
I'm telling you now.

567
00:30:36,857 --> 00:30:37,977
If you are capable,

568
00:30:38,177 --> 00:30:39,296
please repay your debts.

569
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:42,576
The clamor before the battle
can distract the army.

570
00:30:42,937 --> 00:30:44,096
Do you pledge guilty?

571
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:45,857
Official Li.

572
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,056
Official Li.

573
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:48,137
Vice Commander-General Shang,

574
00:30:48,617 --> 00:30:50,016
we're all court officials.

575
00:30:50,657 --> 00:30:52,177
Why make things difficult for everyone?

576
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:55,816
That's enough.

577
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:58,576
Vice Commander-General Shang
was commanded by Commander Fu

578
00:30:58,736 --> 00:31:00,096
to lead us.

579
00:31:00,536 --> 00:31:02,217
Why did you all

580
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:04,056
fob off with excuses?

581
00:31:04,937 --> 00:31:07,016
Commander Fu has specially instructed

582
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:09,937
to keep it confidential.

583
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:12,697
Since you're asking for a command,

584
00:31:13,857 --> 00:31:14,736
I will

585
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:17,137
give you command now.

586
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,056
Come in.

587
00:31:23,536 --> 00:31:24,217
Lingsu,

588
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:26,536
why aren't you taking a rest on the bed?

589
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:29,217
Eldest Brother, I've packed up.

590
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:30,496
Let's continue our journey.

591
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:33,697
Your condition has just turned better.

592
00:31:33,697 --> 00:31:35,177
Stop thinking about the journey.

593
00:31:35,177 --> 00:31:36,137
Take a few days of rest.

594
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:37,816
I'm fine now.

595
00:31:38,377 --> 00:31:39,137
Look at you.

596
00:31:40,096 --> 00:31:40,937
Let's have our meal first.

597
00:31:43,897 --> 00:31:45,137
You made these?

598
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:46,137
Yes.

599
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:47,937
In the Medicine King Valley back then,

600
00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:49,977
you made me plain porridge
and some dishes.

601
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:51,137
They were delicious.

602
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:52,977
I tried several times but to no avail.

603
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,096
Please make do with these.

604
00:31:54,816 --> 00:31:56,657
In the Medicine King Valley,
I took care of Master

605
00:31:56,977 --> 00:31:58,296
and cooked for him every day.

606
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,657
That's how I grasped some skills.

607
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:00,977
You don't cook often.

608
00:32:01,056 --> 00:32:02,576
These dishes
are considered good already.

609
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:05,417
That's why I said
you're most considerate.

610
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:06,496
You're different from me.

611
00:32:06,496 --> 00:32:07,377
I keep dragging you down.

612
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:08,816
That's not true.

613
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:10,056
When it comes to obtaining
the horse carriage

614
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:11,217
and rations,

615
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:13,096
I'm far less adept than you.

616
00:32:13,457 --> 00:32:14,256
Speaking of rations,

617
00:32:14,256 --> 00:32:15,016
I recall something.

618
00:32:15,217 --> 00:32:15,977
Wait for me.

619
00:32:18,256 --> 00:32:19,056
Eldest Brother.

620
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:33,536
What?

621
00:32:33,937 --> 00:32:34,857
You want us to play bandits?

622
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:36,937
Vice Commander-General Shang,

623
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:38,897
everyone here

624
00:32:38,897 --> 00:32:40,937
is well-known in the martial arts world.

625
00:32:41,457 --> 00:32:43,776
Reputation is more important
than wealth and life.

626
00:32:44,137 --> 00:32:46,536
How could we play bandits?

627
00:32:50,056 --> 00:32:51,296
Well-known figures?

628
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,377
Official Qin, you made me
recall something.

629
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:57,177
At Shang's Fort back then,

630
00:32:57,857 --> 00:32:59,256
you beat the heck out of Miao Renfeng

631
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:02,457
with your blind punches.

632
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:03,096
You...

633
00:33:04,736 --> 00:33:05,697
I can't stand it anymore.

634
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:08,536
Hey, Shang.

635
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:10,897
Stop frightening us
with Commander Fu's name.

636
00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:13,457
I'll ask Commander now

637
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:14,776
and see if he indeed
wants us to play bandits.

638
00:33:16,217 --> 00:33:17,296
Li,

639
00:33:18,137 --> 00:33:20,056
I'm only asking you to play bandits.

640
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:21,377
I'm not asking you to become a bandit.

641
00:33:21,377 --> 00:33:23,256
Why are you so agitated here?

642
00:33:25,576 --> 00:33:26,377
Could it be

643
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,816
that you're hiding something?

644
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,496
Look at my memory.

645
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:36,576
How could I have forgotten about it?

646
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:39,697
Before you became a court official,

647
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:43,096
you killed and robbed.

648
00:33:43,776 --> 00:33:46,016
No wonder Commander Fu
doesn't think highly of you.

649
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:50,137
It turns out that you were sinful.

650
00:33:51,177 --> 00:33:52,377
A hero's origin doesn't matter.

651
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,816
Once a bandit, always a bandit.

652
00:33:55,177 --> 00:33:57,296
It's impossible for you

653
00:33:57,657 --> 00:33:58,977
to turnaround.

654
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:01,016
Hey, Shang.

655
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:02,816
Do you think you're a good man?

656
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:04,217
I'll spit on you whenever I see

657
00:34:04,736 --> 00:34:05,857
that scar on your face.

658
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:07,137
Bring it on!

659
00:34:07,457 --> 00:34:09,337
Show me your Bagua Knife.

660
00:34:11,056 --> 00:34:12,857
It doesn't fit

661
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:14,377
your nobody status.

662
00:34:15,457 --> 00:34:16,897
That's too much!

663
00:34:54,737 --> 00:34:55,857
You all saw it.

664
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,457
Be my witnesses.

665
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:01,056
Li

666
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:03,216
was arrogant

667
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:04,257
and tried

668
00:35:04,257 --> 00:35:05,417
to assassinate me.

669
00:35:05,496 --> 00:35:06,417
He was beheaded according to the law.

670
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:08,937
But considering our friendship,

671
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:13,337
I'll report that he died
in the line of duty

672
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:15,136
and has made a great contribution.

673
00:35:15,857 --> 00:35:16,737
Everyone,

674
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:19,176
what do you think?

675
00:35:20,377 --> 00:35:21,016
Listen.

676
00:35:21,337 --> 00:35:22,016
Listen.

677
00:35:22,457 --> 00:35:24,257
Official Shang is magnanimous.

678
00:35:25,176 --> 00:35:26,016
Everyone,

679
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:27,777
what else to say?

680
00:35:28,817 --> 00:35:29,937
My fellow brothers,

681
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:32,496
we're working for Commander Fu.

682
00:35:32,737 --> 00:35:35,576
We're willing to sacrifice our lives.

683
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:37,817
Playing bandits is something trivial.

684
00:35:38,216 --> 00:35:39,096
It's nothing.

685
00:35:40,216 --> 00:35:41,857
My brothers, follow me.

686
00:35:43,297 --> 00:35:43,937
Let's go.

687
00:36:02,056 --> 00:36:02,737
Sir.

688
00:36:19,817 --> 00:36:20,457
Stop for a moment.

689
00:36:22,536 --> 00:36:23,616
Would you like to get some buns

690
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:24,857
for the kids?

691
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:26,297
Let's eat at the inn instead.

692
00:36:27,216 --> 00:36:28,136
Okay. Let's go.

693
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:06,937
Come out, my sons.

694
00:37:08,737 --> 00:37:09,417
Come on.

695
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,297
Come on.

696
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,897
Come on.

697
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:17,737
Come on.

698
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:21,176
(Dexing Restaurant)
Watch your step.

699
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:24,800
(Dexing Restaurant)

700
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:29,377
Sir, you need a room?

701
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:30,857
Boss, give us a suite.

702
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:32,417
Let's take the ordinary room.

703
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,616
We're only staying for one night.

704
00:37:33,737 --> 00:37:34,777
I think a suite is better.

705
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:36,496
You and the kids can live comfortably.

706
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:37,377
I'll make the call.

707
00:37:37,897 --> 00:37:38,536
Sir,

708
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:39,457
I'm so sorry.

709
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,457
The suites are unavailable.

710
00:37:40,897 --> 00:37:43,297
We have one ordinary room left.

711
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:52,377
Let's go.

712
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,096
Lingsu,

713
00:38:02,696 --> 00:38:03,377
what's wrong?

714
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:06,136
I think I left my medicine bottle
at the restaurant.

715
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:08,056
Don't worry.

716
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:09,016
We've only gone a short distance.

717
00:38:09,016 --> 00:38:10,417
If we return now,
you should be able to find it.

718
00:38:13,616 --> 00:38:14,496
Thank you, sirs.

719
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:33,136
Boss,

720
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:34,977
my second brother

721
00:38:34,977 --> 00:38:36,457
left his medicine bottle in the room.

722
00:38:36,457 --> 00:38:37,656
He needs to look for it in the room.

723
00:38:41,297 --> 00:38:42,777
You came late.

724
00:38:42,897 --> 00:38:44,377
The room

725
00:38:45,096 --> 00:38:46,696
is occupied now.

726
00:38:47,337 --> 00:38:49,176
The guests may not agree

727
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,417
with the sudden disturbance.

728
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:52,897
Boss,

729
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,457
this medicine bottle means a lot
to my second brother.

730
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:57,457
Please help us.

731
00:38:57,897 --> 00:38:59,737
He'll leave once he finds the bottle.

732
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:03,016
I can't give you any assurance.

733
00:39:03,536 --> 00:39:06,977
I'll try to talk to the guests.

734
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:08,777
Thank you.

735
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:10,257
Come with me.

736
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:26,817
Sorry for disturbing you, sir.

737
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:28,337
They left

738
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,576
something in this room yesterday.

739
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:32,377
Can you let them in

740
00:39:32,377 --> 00:39:33,136
to look for it?

741
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:34,817
Sorry for disturbing you.

742
00:39:36,616 --> 00:39:37,377
Sir,

743
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:40,056
my second brother left

744
00:39:40,056 --> 00:39:41,417
his medicine bottle in the room.

745
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:43,176
This medicine bottle means a lot to him.

746
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:44,417
Can he go in and look for it?

747
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:45,377
He'll make it quick.

748
00:39:45,937 --> 00:39:47,016
He can only come in alone.

749
00:39:50,536 --> 00:39:51,377
Thank you, sir.

750
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:03,656
Give it to me, An'an!

751
00:40:05,496 --> 00:40:06,216
Give it to me!

752
00:40:06,977 --> 00:40:08,417
Give it to me, An'an!

753
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:12,136
Mother, he snatched my things.

754
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:13,056
What is this?

755
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,777
Let me have a look.

756
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:16,576
I took it from the room.
