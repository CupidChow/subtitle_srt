=Episode 11=

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,130
(Weituo Sect)

4
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,420
(Weituo Sect)
Since Master Wuxiang

5
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,100
(Weituo Sect)
founded Shaolin Weituo Sect,

6
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,340
Weituo Sect has always
been a famous sect

7
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,100
in the martial world.

8
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,050
But if the sect leader is chosen among

9
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,820
you three unfilial people,

10
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,570
it'll ruin the reputation
of Master Wuxiang

11
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,500
and the ancestors.

12
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,940
Young Lady, who exactly are you?

13
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,850
I'm Yuan Ziyi.

14
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,620
Speaking of origin,

15
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,820
I'm also a direct disciple of Sect Leader Wan.

16
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,540
Nonsense!

17
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,810
When did Master

18
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,050
have a female disciple like you?

19
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,340
How come we've never heard?

20
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,810
Master had a heroic legacy.

21
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,170
He accepted countless disciples.

22
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,540
He wandered the world for a decade.

23
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,090
I was accepted as a disciple

24
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,580
at that time.

25
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,660
Talking about specifics,

26
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,580
I'm considered your senior.

27
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,900
Enough of your crap.

28
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,090
Alright.

29
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,410
Lady Yuan.

30
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,340
Even if you're not bluffing,

31
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,220
who else can prove it?

32
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,540
Master taught me his best moves.

33
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,060
Isn't that good enough proof?

34
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,810
Junior.

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,020
When Senior Sun used
the Guan Ping's Offering,

36
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,330
you could've used the Phoenix Vortex
even if you couldn't use

37
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,020
the Gold Lock Befall

38
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,450
to avoid it in time.

39
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,610
Cut the crap.

40
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,940
Just show me what you've got.

41
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:00,940
Come on.

42
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,780
Young Lady, brace yourself.

43
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,170
Guan Ping's Offering.

44
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
Phoenix Vortex.

45
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,140
Here's your Offering back.

46
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,060
Guan Ping's Offering

47
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,580
is not a static killer move.

48
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,330
You need to be able to use

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,890
any of the Liuhe Sword moves
at the opportune moment.

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,300
Only then can you say
you've mastered it.

51
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,260
Well?

52
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,050
My moves

53
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,820
are of the authentic
Weituo style, right?

54
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,700
From your moves,

55
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,890
it is indeed the Liuhe Sword Technique.

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,450
We're just unsure why you're here.

57
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,650
Isn't that obvious?

58
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,980
Since you're having
a tournament to choose the sect leader,

59
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,020
I can't pass up the opportunity.

60
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,140
Lady.

61
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,380
You think you're invincible just because
you know the Liuhe Sword Technique?

62
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,170
Don't get ahead of yourself.

63
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,020
I'm not here to play games with you.

64
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,700
If you're upset, then just beat me.

65
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,020
Alright.

66
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,330
Spear!

67
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,100
Okay.

68
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,170
I'll show you

69
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,100
the real Liuhe Spear Technique.

70
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,930
Martial Uncle.

71
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,700
Martial Uncle.

72
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,300
Just tell me the truth.

73
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,450
Did Master

74
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,580
really take this lady as his disciple?

75
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,140
Her moves are ours.

76
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,490
But her inner technique
is something else.

77
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,650
Martial Uncle, I think you should act now.

78
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,860
The lady is not to be underestimated.

79
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,020
She has very good control.

80
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,100
To be able to master
the technique to this level

81
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,300
is indeed cause for concern.

82
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,050
Beauty's Needlepoint.

83
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,730
Minor Obeisance.

84
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,170
Master.

85
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,580
The eldest and third masters
have been beaten.

86
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,730
It's all up to you.

87
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,330
The sword and spear
are out of the question.

88
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,140
We'll have to compete on Chikao Fists.

89
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,620
Chikao Fists

90
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,450
is Weituo Sect's
foundational training.

91
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,970
It's all about close combat.

92
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,580
It's the first basic fist technique

93
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,140
we learned as bare-bottomed kids.

94
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,580
Enough chattering.

95
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,500
You're the last one.

96
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,700
Lady Yuan

97
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,060
is a delicate beauty.

98
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,090
Brandishing spears and swords

99
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,140
might cause accidents.

100
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,620
I wouldn't want that.

101
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,650
Sounds like you're going
to use your limbs instead.

102
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,650
Indeed.

103
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,260
I'd like to test
your level of Chikao Fists.

104
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:30,770
Okay.

105
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,060
Ready.

106
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,180
Cheap move.

107
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,700
How shameful.

108
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,210
You're shameless.

109
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,850
How did Weituo Sect

110
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,060
breed a shameless disciple like you?

111
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,060
Chikao Fists

112
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,580
is supposed to be a close-combat,

113
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,850
grappling style of martial arts.

114
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,210
What's shameful about it?

115
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,820
If you think it's inappropriate,

116
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,140
you could just bow out.

117
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,620
You have no shame.

118
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,020
On behalf of Master,

119
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,380
I'll teach you a lesson.

120
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,970
The lady brought a sick person with her.

121
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,140
Do you submit?

122
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,850
Who else wants to challenge me?

123
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,820
Me.

124
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,060
Who are you?

125
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,330
Surname is Liu.

126
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,850
Liu Hezhen.

127
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,850
Haven't you heard

128
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,330
of Weituo's Twin Cranes?

129
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,500
No?

130
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,820
I get it. I'm known to be a slacker.

131
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,650
I'm too lazy to teach

132
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,260
or go out to see the world.

133
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,260
In the martial world,

134
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,500
no one really knows much about me.

135
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,850
But, if even you didn't know

136
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,380
that Wan and I were called
the Twin Cranes of Weituo,

137
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,290
then how could you be Wan's disciple?

138
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,140
Whether I am or not

139
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,410
is not up to you to decide.

140
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,060
Everyone here has seen it.

141
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,530
What I used were
Weituo Sect's techniques.

142
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,770
That's irrefutable.

143
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,060
As for you,

144
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,450
coming forward at this point.

145
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,940
Are you

146
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,290
after the position of sect leader too?

147
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,410
What a joke.

148
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,330
If I wished to be the sect leader,

149
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,090
I would've done so 30 years ago.

150
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,970
Why bother with it now?

151
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,060
But you showed up

152
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,410
here today pretending to be a disciple

153
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,850
and ridiculing Weituo Sect,

154
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,580
injuring its disciples.

155
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,140
No matter how much I try
to stay out of trouble,

156
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,940
this requires my support.

157
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,260
Enough nonsense.

158
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,850
Pick any one
of Weituo Sect's techniques.

159
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,260
Even if you choose Chikao Fists again,

160
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,650
I will keep you company to the end.

161
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,820
I'll let you experience for yourself

162
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,850
the consequence of having no shame.

163
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,290
Lady.

164
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,580
If I have to choose,
it has to be our signature technique.

165
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,770
But you might not know it.

166
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,770
The Sect has many techniques.

167
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,940
Mastering any one of them

168
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,530
is enough to blaze a path
in the martial world.

169
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,380
Then tell me.

170
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,210
What is the Sect's
signature technique?

171
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,940
The Sect's techniques
are vast and profound.

172
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,060
If you can master it,

173
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,290
even if it's just one
of the normal skills,

174
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,740
you could still devastate the world.

175
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,340
Be it the Liuhe Sword

176
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,100
or Liuhe Spear.

177
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,100
Which one of them
isn't considered signature?

178
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,020
You sure have the gift of the gab.

179
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,650
I won't argue with you.

180
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,170
I'll tell you.

181
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,100
The Sect's signature technique

182
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,980
is the Tiangang Plum Blossom Steps.

183
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,690
Do you know it?

184
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,860
In martial arts,

185
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,410
the more plain,

186
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,740
the more useful they are.

187
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,690
Things like Plum Blossom Steps
or blade tip array

188
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,290
are just cheap tricks
to confuse others.

189
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,980
However,

190
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,980
if I don't spar with you,

191
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,500
I doubt you'd be convinced.

192
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,100
Where's the Plum Blossom Steps?

193
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,980
Good.

194
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,530
You've got guts.

195
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,140
Men.

196
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,930
Bring me the bowls.

197
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,530
The one who touches the ground

198
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,530
or underneath whom the bowls crack first

199
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,740
loses.

200
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,770
Bring it on.

201
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,860
Looks like

202
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,290
the lady doesn't know
the Tiangang Plum Blossom Steps.

203
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,740
Master Liu is breezing across on top.

204
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,380
With every attack,

205
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,810
the lady checks the bowls
under her feet.

206
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,170
Based on that alone,

207
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,380
she's already lost.

208
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,690
See that?

209
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,930
She's only able to keep up
with Master Liu

210
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,380
because of her strong Acrobatic Jumping.

211
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,460
It won't take much longer

212
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,570
before she's forced into a corner.

213
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,050
Once she touches the ground,

214
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,260
she'll lose.

215
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,410
It will be down to inner strength.

216
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,020
No matter how strong
her Acrobatic Jumping is,

217
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,620
her inner technique

218
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,100
is no match for Master Liu's.

219
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,290
Who exactly are you?

220
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,410
What is your motive?

221
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,100
If you don't come clean,

222
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,100
then don't blame me
for going hard on you.

223
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,860
Why do you have to go this far?

224
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,050
I really am Master's disciple.

225
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,260
Master gave me this token.

226
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,050
(Weituo)

227
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,740
Sorry, Master.

228
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,380
Master Liu!

229
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,170
She's no disciple of the Sect.

230
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,220
Don't fall for her trickery.

231
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,340
Yes, Master.

232
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,460
She's here to seek treatment
for the boy.

233
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,050
How could she possibly be
a disciple of Weituo?

234
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,740
She was begging us

235
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,220
to let her in just now.

236
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,170
Master Liu.

237
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,260
She is after the Sect's treasure,

238
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,500
the Epiphyllum Dew Cream.

239
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,020
You must not let her get her way.

240
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,860
She is here to take over the Sect.

241
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,380
Martial Uncle...

242
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:01,810
Men!

243
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,290
Give up now.

244
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,650
Or else I'll kill your friend.

245
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:11,930
Hold it.

246
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,410
Lady Yuan.

247
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,340
Pardon my ignorance.

248
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,140
Your techniques are indeed the Sect's.

249
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,570
Looks like you were
really taught by Master Wan.

250
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,890
Back then,
when Wan returned from his travels,

251
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,140
he told me.

252
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,740
While he was at Tianshan,

253
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,980
he accepted a talented female student.

254
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,570
He even gave her the Epiphyllum token.

255
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,260
That lady

256
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,860
must be you.

257
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,020
Alright.

258
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,410
The new overthrow the old.

259
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,290
For Weituo Sect

260
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,890
to have a successor like you

261
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,140
is reason for me to celebrate.

262
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,690
I'm sure Wan would feel reassured

263
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,170
from the nether world.

264
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,860
Martial Uncle, what are you saying?

265
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,410
Martial Uncle!

266
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,290
Hush!

267
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,380
You lot have been beaten.

268
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,140
Not only did you lose the fight,
you also ruined your integrity.

269
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,220
Now, follow my lead and pay respects
to our new leader.

270
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,260
Liu Hezhen of Weituo Sect

271
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,930
greets the sect leader.

272
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,620
Senior Liu, don't...

273
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,100
Listen to me.

274
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,890
I'll explain it later.

275
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,770
Liu Hezhen of Weituo Sect

276
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,020
greets the new sect leader.

277
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Greetings to the new sect leader!

278
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,770
Greetings to the new sect leader!

279

(In Remembrance)

280
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,660
My lords, please have tea.

281
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,900
Please go and get your new leader.

282
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,050
Official He wants to pass
the invitation to her personally.

283
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,460
Please wait, sirs.

284
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,940
A go-getter appeared out of nowhere.

285
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,370
Now what?

286
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,180
It doesn't change anything.

287
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,850
We'll ask whoever is the new leader

288
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,130
for the Epiphyllum Dew Cream.

289
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,130
No one would dare
to disrespect you, sir.

290
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:53,940
Sect Leader Yuan.

291
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,260
Congratulations.

292
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,610
Congratulations.

293
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,020
This is the Hero Invitation
to the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

294
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,220
We hope to see you there.

295
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,850
Weituo Sect

296
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,090
is just a small faction
in the mountains.

297
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,130
We don't usually get involved
with the government.

298
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,610
This shenanigan?

299
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,420
We'll pass.

300
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,420
Senior Liu.

301
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
Official He

302
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,700
is speaking to Chief Yuan.

303
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,980
Please don't interrupt.

304
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,530
I'm afraid I can't simply accept

305
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,740
the invitation.

306
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,290
You're looking to exchange it
for the Epiphyllum Dew Cream, right?

307
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,090
What do you mean, Chief Yuan?

308
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,260
A greedy heart knows no bounds.

309
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,090
You two already have the Agarwood Bead
and King Kong's Pestle,

310
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,900
but are still not content.

311
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,020
You still want the Epiphyllum Dew Cream.

312
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,810
Aren't you taking too much advantage

313
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,900
from this official task of yours?

314
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,050
Hand them over.

315
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,810
Shall I take it myself?

316
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,260
The Sect's treasures
must not be taken away.

317
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,900
Please see your way out, sirs.

318
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,570
Chief Yuan.

319
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,770
See you again.

320
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,620
(Imperial Study)

321
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,020
There are quite
a number of schools and sects.

322
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,810
(World's Sect Leaders Gathering invitees)
But they're just dispensable nobodies.

323
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,570
Meanwhile, established names
are few and far between.

324
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,490
(World's Sect Leaders Gathering invitees)

325

Shaolin, Wudang,

326
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,050
Kongtong, Qingcheng.

327
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,660
We've sent them the invitations.

328
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,850
But some of them

329
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,900
have reservations

330
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,330
about possible collusion
with the Red Flower Club in the past.

331
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,610
So they dare not come.

332
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,020
Is that really the reason?

333
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,610
Or they can't be bothered
with the imperial court?

334

Did you think
those martial arts practitioners

335
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,660
only care about training
and getting stronger?

336
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,050
Elites who could start
their own sects

337
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,220
more or less have stature
and connections.

338
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,810
Before long,

339
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,810
local forces, big or small, will pop up.

340
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,020
With a little spark,

341
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,330
a calamity could befall
the imperial court.

342
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,420
Otherwise, Emperor Wu of Han

343
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,810
wouldn't have issued a migration order.

344
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,090
Your Majesty is right.

345
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,130
I asked you to organize
the sect leaders gathering

346
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,770
so that you could recruit these elites

347
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,050
to work for you.

348
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,500
Martial arts practitioners

349
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,050
always want to best one another.

350
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,220
No matter where,

351
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,220
they want to determine who's on top.

352
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,850
So set a rule.

353
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,610
Get a loyal servant

354
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,660
to become the sect leader.

355
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,810
Get them to control the troublemakers
on your behalf.

356
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,460
Your Majesty is perceptive.

357
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,530
I will get it done.

358
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,770
Do not disappoint me.

359
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,180
Lan is becoming more adorable.

360
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,940
Go to sleep.

361
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,330
Good girl.

362
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,220
Have some food.

363
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,570
She's looking more like you.

364
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,260
You went to Miaojiang

365
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,290
but didn't find the  Poison Master.

366
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,770
Did you find any other leads?

367
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,370
No.

368
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,530
You were away for some time.

369
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,660
I got a message.

370
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,610
It said you were harmed.

371
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,220
I'm fine.

372
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,260
But after you came back,

373
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,810
you've become even more reserved.

374
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,530
Renfeng.

375
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,020
Have you ever thought

376
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,020
about how cruel
and unpredictable the world is?

377
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,420
It's been 18 years.

378
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,290
Perhaps those people

379
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,850
are already dead.

380
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,330
There's no way to find out anymore.

381
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,770
There will be someone
who knows the truth.

382
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,020
So you're still going
to continue investigating?

383
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,700
So long as I don't find the culprit,

384
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,420
I won't be able to rest.

385
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,090
If you leave again,

386
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,290
then what will happen

387
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,900
to me and Lan?

388
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,740
We're out of firewood.

389
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,460
I'll go get some.

390
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,630
(Weituo Sect)

391
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,980
Luckily you got him here in time.

392
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,420
If it was a few days later,

393
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,570
even the gods can't save him.

394
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,370
I will go

395
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,180
and get the Epiphyllum Dew Cream.

396
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,050
Thank you, Sir.

397
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,420
Lady Yuan.

398
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,020
What is wrong with your leg?

399
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,180
It's nothing.

400
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,770
It's just a little scratch.

401
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,260
A little ointment will fix it.

402
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,290
You are the All-knowing Nun's disciple.

403
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,050
We're both from the Buddhist faction.

404
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,330
In terms of seniority,

405
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,090
you can just call me "senior".

406
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,900
Thank you, senior.

407
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,770
I know

408
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,130
the Epiphyllum Dew Cream
is the Sect's treasure.

409
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,660
I will never forget

410
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,460
your good deed.

411
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,050
No need to thank me.

412
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,700
You are now the sect leader.

413
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,610
It's up to you who you want

414
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,900
to give the Epiphyllum Dew Cream to.

415
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,330
Senior.

416
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,220
I'd like to apologize to you.

417
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,180
I just need the Epiphyllum Dew Cream

418
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,530
to heal his leg.

419
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,530
I have no intention
of becoming the sect leader.

420
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,020
No need to explain.

421
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,220
I believe you.

422
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,900
But the position of sect leader

423
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,020
is yours.

424
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,020
You saw it for yourself.

425
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,980
My three disciples
are quite the embarrassment.

426
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,530
The third one is not a bad person,

427
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,180
but his skills are left wanting.

428
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,770
You and my junior

429
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,090
have a long history.

430
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,130
If not for his sake,

431
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,740
do this as a favor for Weituo Sect.

432
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,980
Be the acting sect leader.

433
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,460
Once the third matures,

434
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,050
you can then hand over the baton.

435
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,980
Thank you for your trust.

436
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,290
Alright.

437
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,090
Leader Tian.

438
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:19,940
Is it safe to say

439
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,090
this is the end

440
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,770
of your brotherhood with Miao Renfeng?

441
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,530
Are we going to get out alive

442
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,940
from Miao's villa?

443
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,180
You're one to talk.

444
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,290
If you hadn't jumped to conclusions

445
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,500
and spread false news,

446
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,570
would we be in this predicament?

447
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,260
It was stupid of me.

448
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,420
But,

449
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,130
if Miao Renfeng dies,

450
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,180
you'd be able to have the woman.

451
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,810
I thought

452
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,330
if I spread the word that he had died,

453
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,810
you and Nan Lan could be together.

454
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:48,810
I don't know...

455
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,770
I don't even know how she's doing now.

456
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,050
Leader Tian.

457
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,940
Why don't you just give it up?

458
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,090
What do you know?

459
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,180
A refined lady like Mrs. Miao

460
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,980
wouldn't be seduced so easily.

461
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,770
Once she falls for someone,

462
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,570
she will not simply change her mind.

463
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,020
Leader Tian.

464
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,700
Are you sure
you're not talking about yourself?

465
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,050
Don't be ridiculous.

466
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,740
Don't cry, Lan.

467
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,660
What's wrong, Lan?

468
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,130
Ruolan, it's okay.

469
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,940
It's okay, Lan.

470
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,810
It's okay.

471
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,700
Be good.

472
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,850
It's you.

473
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,020
What's wrong with Lan?

474
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,940
She has a fever. She's burning.

475
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,260
Go and get a doctor.

476
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:52,810
Yes, sir.

477
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,700
Miao... Isn't Renfeng in?

478
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,130
Be good.

479
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,050
Come, give Lan to me.

480
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,660
Lan, be good.

481
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,220
Don't cry.

482
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,530
Come, it's okay.

483
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,050
Uncle Tian is here.

484
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,530
Good girl, it's okay.

485
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,180
These are your things

486
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:19,850
from Tianlong Sect.

487
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,370
Be good, my dear.

488
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,260
You left in a hurry

489
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,090
and forgot them.

490
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,290
I worried you might need them.

491
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,740
Thank you.

492
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,610
What would I do

493
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,330
if you hadn't come?

494
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:26,980
Don't say that.

495
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,660
Don't worry.

496
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,180
Lan is a blessed girl.

497
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,500
She will be taken care of all her life.

498
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,180
Surely

499
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,020
she will get through this obstacle.

500
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,330
So don't worry.

501
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,290
I'll do it.

502
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,900
No, let me.
