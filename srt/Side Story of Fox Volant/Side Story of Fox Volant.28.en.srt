3
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:01,520
The unique Eagle Claw Technique

4
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,799
is indeed remarkable.

5
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,439
Official Zhou, you rarely display
your over ten years

6
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,479
of masterly skills simply.

7
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,399
It's an eye-opener for us today.

8
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Official Zhou, you have
a powerful internal force.

9
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,440
You got a five and a six.

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,560
It's a bit small.

11
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,560
My apology, Brother Zhou.

12
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,719
I'm going to win you.

13
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,079
Brother Hu, you also grasp the skill

14
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,039
that took Official Zhou
ten years to master?

15
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,440
Not bad.

16
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,399
Brother Hu, you have
gambling luck and good cards.

17
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,800
Your internal force
is even more remarkable.

18
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,560
Brother Hu,

19
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,359
you have good cards today.

20
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,480
Not only that,

21
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,799
but you also possess remarkable skills.

22
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:49,799
We admit our defeat.

23
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,600
Yes, we admit our defeat.

24
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,560
This is

25
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,079
a mansion I bought
in the capital today.

26
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,200
It's not big. It's about four mu.

27
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,480
Brother Hu,

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,279
it's yours now.

29
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,320
This mansion is worth
at least ten thousand taels.

30
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,320
Brother Hu,

31
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,519
God of Gambling is with you.

32
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:15,879
Brother Zhou, I can't accept it.

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,879
Brother Hu,

34
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,879
you're looking down on me

35
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,120
if you don't accept it.

36
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,960
Brother Hu, please accept
this little token

37
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,239
from my brother.

38
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:32,920
In this case,

39
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,560
I can only accept
to show my respect then.

40
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:36,879
After I've tidied up the mansion,

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,359
I'll invite all of you over
for a gambling game.

42
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,320
Great.

43
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,320
Thank you for your hospitality.

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,960
Yes.

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,600
You're easygoing.

46
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:45,959
Move your hands higher!

47
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,239
Stop!

48
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,799
Show me how you pay your respect.

49
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,679
Bend down!

50
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,679
Place your hands correctly!

51
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,639
Straighten your knees!

52
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,679
Bend your legs!

53
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,600
Straighten your back!

54
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,519
Head up!

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,239
Higher!

56
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,679
Head up!

57
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,079
Higher!

58
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,280
Going against me?

59
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Slap her mouth!

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,000
Slap her!

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,559
That's enough!

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,679
Your Highness,

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,799
Mother asked me to teach her the rules.

64
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,760
That's too much.

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,799
Come on.

66
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:01,839
Hua,

67
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,799
don't bother yourself
arguing with the likes of her.

68
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,160
You now know

69
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,799
what my days have been like
in this residence

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,799
all these years.

71
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,239
But it has turned better now.

72
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,079
With you around,

73
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,119
I have someone to talk to.

74
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:33,760
I don't feel so depressed anymore.

75
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,559
It's suffocating

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,760
living in this place.

77
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,040
Hua,

78
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,920
please endure it

79
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,080
for my sake.

80
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,439
I've told Mother

81
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,679
I'll take you

82
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,799
to greet her in a few days.

83
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,720
Once she accepts you,

84
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,559
I'll bestow you a status immediately.

85
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,119
Then,

86
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:10,679
you can live here rightfully.

87
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,999
No one will dare
to treat you poorly again.

88
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,520
Wait a moment.

89
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,600
Hua,

90
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
look at what this is.

91
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,879
I haven't played it in a long time.

92
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:41,559
I'm not sure

93
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,040
whether you still like it or not.

94
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,040
Mother.

95
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,840
Mother.

96
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,600
Crying won't help you.

97
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,759
Mother, you must stand up for me.

98
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,879
You picked and brought me
here back then.

99
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,920
I hoped to take good care of you too.

100
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,359
But now,

101
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:28,080
I can't even survive for a day,

102
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,960
Mother.

103
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,480
You must remember

104
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:43,400
that you're the young lady
of the Hailan Family.

105
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,640
You were betrothed
to Fu Kang'an by His Majesty himself.

106
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:52,080
You're the rightful first wife.

107
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,080
No one can take

108
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,040
your honor and status away from you.

109
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,480
How inappropriate it is
for you to cry all day.

110
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,199
Don't disgrace your identity.

111
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,920
Mother.

112
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,679
Mother.

113
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:20,880
Mother.

114
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,640
Don't be impatient.

115
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,559
To achieve success,
you must keep your composure.

116
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,719
We did it.

117
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:43,679
We've lost our residence
and money to him.

118
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,199
We've succeeded in our first step.

119
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
We spent so much money
in just one night.

120
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,319
Let's hope nothing goes wrong again.

121
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,760
My nephew,

122
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,880
where there is life, there is hope.

123
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,599
We can earn back the money.

124
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,959
Chief Tang, I agree with you.

125
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:06,079
Nun, welcome
to stay in Tianzi's best room.

126
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,920
Official Fu has specially ordered us

127
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,959
to turn the room into a meditation room

128
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,760
so you can rest well and meditate.

129
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:23,120
This way, please.

130
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,640
The All-knowing Nun?

131
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:34,920
Who is she?

132
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,280
Even Uncle Tang yourself
can't step into that room.

133
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,040
She is somebody.

134
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,000
She's the sect leader
of the Tianshan Sect.

135
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,360
Father, what's the matter?

136
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,640
It's nothing.

137
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,439
Nun.

138
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,360
Nun, please rest early.

139
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,280
Just let me know if you need anything.

140
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,640
Thank you.

141
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,319
You saw Feng Tiannan just now, right?

142
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,280
I already said

143
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,040
what I should.

144
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,199
You must not let Feng Tiannan

145
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,319
affect our big plan.

146
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,920
I'll keep this in mind.

147
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,719
My ancestors,

148
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,799
I know karma and samsara exist.

149
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,839
What goes around comes around.

150
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,880
I, Tian Guinong,

151
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,880
have performed all these sins alone.

152
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,040
Please punish me alone if you must.

153
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,240
I beg you all to let Lan go.

154
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,679
She's innocent.

155
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,240
Chief,

156
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,479
Madam hired a horse carriage secretly

157
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,240
and left.

158
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:17,959
Fly up in the sky.

159
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,719
Look. You're not crying now, right?

160
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,780
♪Let youth blow at your long hair♪

161
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,079
♪Let it lead you in your dreams♪

162
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:39,090
Our kid is gone.
♪Let it lead you in your dreams♪

163
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,079
Our kid is gone.

164
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:42,839
I've let you down.

165
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,280
I failed to protect you and our kid.

166
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,040
It's taken a toll on her body.

167
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:50,760
I'm afraid she can't
conceive another child.

168
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,040
Lan!

169
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:58,360
Lan!

170
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,079

338
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,519
may keep him by my side

339
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,279
but not his heart.

340
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,560
Don't bring up such a matter again.

341
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,519
When Brother Hu
asked you about Hero Miao,

342
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,239
you seemed to be hiding something.

343
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
You must not keep anything

344
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,199
about Hero Miao from Brother Hu.

345
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,880
Hero Miao is indeed living a good life.

346
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:05,279
His eyes

347
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,880
have almost recovered.

348
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,759
He even taught me martial arts.

349
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,920
How great it is to have Hero Miao

350
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,120
to teach you martial arts.

351
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,479
But I disagree

352
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,199
with what you all said.

353
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,360
Although Hero Miao
is adept at martial arts,

354
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,279
he treats others as beasts

355
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,880
when he practices.

356
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,400
My tiny body

357
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:24,759
was almost crippled by him.

358
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,679
I've thought it through.

359
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,360
Learning from you

360
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,479
suits me better.

361
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,759
You only use your brain.

362
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,920
It's not straining.

363
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,920
So you secretly came to the capital

364
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,080
to learn medicine from me?

365
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,840
Whether it's poison or medicine,

366
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,080
I just want to learn your skills.

367
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,600
Just like previously.

368
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,759
After you applied
some medicinal powder on my fist,

369
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,759
I could beat them up.

370
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,759
I don't have to be afraid of anyone

371
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,239
in the martial arts world.

372
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,999
Xiaomei, you're so simple-minded.

373
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,199
Aren't you there to teach me?

374
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,880
My dear good Sister Cheng,

375
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:01,679
considering I've traveled all the way

376
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,959
to the capital,

377
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,279
please accept me as your disciple.

378
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,199
A smart girl like me

379
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:07,999
won't disgrace you.

380
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,439
Fei,

381
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,840
how come you came out alone?

382
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,959
Brother Zhou is checking on the items.

383
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:18,840
I know nothing.

384
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,239
I'll only get in his way in there.

385
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:23,320
You must have disapproved

386
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,479
of the luxurious items.

387
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:26,719
Master Hu,

388
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,719
Official Zeng sent you
some calligraphy works

389
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:29,920
and a few jars of superior nv'erhong

390
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,840
to congratulate you
on moving into a new house.

391
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,360
That's very kind of Official Zeng.

392
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,800
Get someone to invite them here

393
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,959
to celebrate together.

394
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:40,959
Yes, my lord.

395
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Brother Hu, have a seat.

396
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,239
It's said one only knows his low
rank after coming to the capital.

397
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,800
Do you acquit with these officials

398
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,999
so as to seek a future
for yourself in the capital?

399
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,959
For me,

400
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,640
I'm used to living a carefree
and unrestrained life.

401
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm not destined
to enjoy fame and wealth.

402
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:01,320
You might be clueless.

403
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,199
Those military officials

404
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,880
lost this mansion to Brother Hu.

405
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,120
The God of Gambling
has given us a mansion.

406
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:10,279
But I didn't ask for these
calligraphy works and porcelain.

407
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,320
Something must be amiss.

408
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,640
I'll gamble with them again today.

409
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,519
I'll find a way to lose
this mansion to them

410
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,320
and see what they will say.

411
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,199
(May The Brilliant Sun Shine On You)
Officials, this way, please.

412
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,120
This way.

413
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,560
Officials, this way, please.

414
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:36,759
My brothers.

415
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:37,479
-Brother Hu.
-Brother Hu.

416
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,080
Brother Hu.

417
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:42,320
I brought two friends along.

418
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,039
Come on.

419
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,360
Brother Hu.

420
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,239
Brother Wang.

421
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,160
Brother Hu.

422
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,360
I've embarrassed myself
before you the day before yesterday.

423
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:55,560
I specially came
to have some wine boldly.

424
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,920
It's my honor to have you here.

425
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,519
Come on, my brothers.

426
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,479
Let's take a seat.

427
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,759
Okay. After you.

428
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:02,880
After you.

429
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,039
Sister Cheng,

430
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,880
who are they?

431
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,959
Xiaomei, the losers have come.

432
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,800
Let's play it by ear.

433
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,160
We'll try our best to lose all the money

434
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,840
to each of them.

435
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,880
I guess it's easier to lose than win.

436
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,039
Don't worry.

437
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:17,840
Brother Hu,

438
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,199
I've walked around.

439
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,840
The scenery in the courtyard
matches those in Jiangnan.

440
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,439
It's such beautiful scenery.

441
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:27,439
You indeed struck it lucky
for the first time in the capital.

442
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:30,199
It's all thanks to Brother Zhou.

443
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,600
You flatter me.

444
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,759
Not only Brother Hu
struck it lucky in gambling

445
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,360
but also skilled in martial arts.

446
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:38,160
When you showed us your skills that day,

447
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,199
the three of us dared not fight you.

448
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,439
My brothers,

449
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,719
I was ignorant before this.

450
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,959
But our friendship grows from conflicts.

451
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,999
Let me

452
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,840
make a toast to all of you first.

453
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,479
Come on.

454
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,400
-Come on.
-Cheers.

455
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,320
-Cheers.
-Bottom-up.

456
00:26:57,999 --> 00:26:59,800
Well,

457
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,400
it was the scoundrel
Shang Baozhen who played a trick

458
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,039
and also damaged our friendship.

459
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,479
Fortunately, you're adept
at martial arts

460
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,360
and didn't fall into his trap.

461
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,800
You even saved us all

462
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:16,519
from this trial.

463
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:17,519
That's right.

464
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,239
Brother Hu, I'd like
to make a toast to you.

465
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:21,239
Come on.

466
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,479
Look at how they flatter

467
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
and brown-nose.

468
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,999
One who is unaccountably
solicitous is hiding evil intentions.

469
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,640
All men are brothers.

470
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,759
We must not drive
someone into the corner.

471
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:38,320
We must forgive wherever possible.

472
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,600
Brother Zhou,

473
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,679
you don't have
to mention this to Brother Hu.

474
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,439
If he were clueless about this,

475
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:45,199
how would he keep a foothold
in the martial arts world?

476
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,239
Brother Zhou,

477
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,640
what do you mean?

478
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,880
What he means

479
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,360
is he got to know you only now.

480
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,759
He wanted to say
that dignity matters most

481
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,759
in this vast world.

482
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,800
Yes.

483
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,800
Well, Brother Zhou.

484
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,479
You've given me more than enough dignity.

485
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,679
Brother Hu is a young hero.

486
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,959
All of us admire you.

487
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,279
Brother Zhou has gone all out this week

488
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,400
in order to introduce a friend to you.

489
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:17,600
That's right.

490
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,239
Why go all out

491
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,600
if that's the only reason?

492
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,039
Brother Zhou,

493
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,479
your friend is mine too.

494
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,360
Why didn't I tell you earlier?

495
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:35,959
I was afraid you would
tarnish my dignity.

496
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,199
It doesn't matter if I lose my head.

497
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,479
But in the martial arts world,

498
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,039
one mustn't lose his dignity.

499
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:42,640
That's right.

500
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,719
That's right.

501
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,160
Brother Zhou, you must be kidding me.

502
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,039
Given our relationship,

503
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,920
how would I tarnish your dignity, right?

504
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:55,479
Then, I'll get this friend over
and introduce him to you.

505
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,800
Okay.

506
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,880
Okay. I'll get going then.

507
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,320
Sister Cheng,

508
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,400
who are they talking about?

509
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,160
My brothers,

510
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,519
let's gamble to our heart's content
after the meal.

511
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,479
-Great.
-Great.

512
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,239
Since you've already planned it,

513
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,360
we'll play to the end.

514
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,640
Cheers.

515
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,600
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

516
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,920
Please enjoy your meal.

517
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,199
I'll get everything ready now.

518
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,160
-Okay.
-Okay.

519
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,400
-Come on.
-Come on.

520
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,479
More, please.

521
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,759
Fei,

522
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,279
who wants to meet you?

523
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,479
I have no idea too.

524
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
It doesn't matter.

525
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,120
Let's see.

526
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,279
Brother Hu,

527
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:45,160
as the saying goes, "When one is polite
to you, one must have some request."

528
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,199
What if they set up another trap

529
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,239
to harm you?

530
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,439
What to do then?

531
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,479
Xiaomei,

532
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,199
even if they play tricks,

533
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,959
they can't beat him still.

534
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,800
Since he's so confident,

535
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,080
we'll watch the show with him.

536
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,279
Brother Hu,

537
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:03,880
you're running out of luck today.

538
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,400
Yes, indeed.

539
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,279
One more round.

540
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,519
Come on.

541
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,999
Brother Hu, he's here.

542
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:11,679
Brother Zhou,

543
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,279
invite him to play one round then.

544
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,320
One more round.

545
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,679
-Come on.
-Come on.

546
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,400
Let me tell you.

547
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:20,479
Brother Hu has forgiven you.

548
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,880
Hurry up and apologize to him.

549
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:23,719
Okay.

550
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,239
Your friendship indeed
grows from conflicts.

551
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Hero Hu,

552
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,160
I'm sorry for being
too ignorant to recognize you.

553
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,360
So sorry if I have offended you.

554
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,279
Feng Tiannan.

555
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:40,360
He's the big villain
Fei has been looking for.

556
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,719
So this is the act
you all are putting on.

557
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:54,120
Hero Hu,

558
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,360
I really had no idea

559
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,239
you were protecting their whole family.

560
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,279
But today,

561
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,120
before these heroes,

562
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
I swear to heaven

563
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,439
that from now on,

564
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,360
I'll help you
to the best of my abilities

565
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,920
for any requests you ask of me.

566
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,320
I won't refuse them.

567
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,519
Yes.

568
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,400
Chief Feng is begging you for mercy.

569
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,679
He couldn't be more sincere than this.

570
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,840
I'll be honest with you.

571
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:27,519
It was Chief Feng who bought you

572
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:30,759
the fields and lands in Yitang Town.

573
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,719
He bought this mansion and furniture

574
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,640
for you as well.

575
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:39,279
To compensate you,

576
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,959
Chief Feng has done everything he could.

577
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:43,120
You are a man.

578
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,199
Take it easy.

579
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,719
Let the bygone

580
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:49,519
be bygone.

581
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,080
Hero Hu.

582
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:53,999
Although I, Hu Fei, am not a big hero,

583
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,880
I stand upright
and have a clear conscience.

584
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,039
All of you practice martial arts.

585
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,999
I'd like to ask you all then.

586
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:04,880
Can absolute right and wrong

587
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,039
in this world

588
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,519
be exchangeable with money?

589
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,279
Brother Zhou,

590
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,959
I'm returning

591
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,160
this land title to you.

592
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,759
Hey, Hu.

593
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,400
What on earth do you want?

594
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,080
What do I want?

595
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,920
Zhong Asi and his whole family

596
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,600
died tragically in your hands.

597
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,239
Using your wealth and power,

598
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,679
you killed his entire family

599
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,479
for a piece of land.

600
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:42,999
Was it just and ethical?

601
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:47,039
I've sworn back then

602
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,160
that if I did not take your life,

603
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,320
I'm not a man.

604
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,279
Hey, Hu.

605
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,320
We must not drive
someone into the corner.

606
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
We must forgive wherever possible.

607
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,679
I'm a sect leader after all.

608
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,479
Zhong Asi and his family

609
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,400
were only lowly lives.

610
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,920
Due to this matter,

611
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,279
I'm bankrupt now and wandering.

612
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,759
What else do you expect of me?

613
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:11,160
Your life is important.

614
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,600
Weren't the lives of Zhong Asi
and his family as important too?

615
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:18,199
Brat,

616
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,400
everyone here

617
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,039
is a martial arts expert
in the capital.

618
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,239
Are you asking for trouble here?

619
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:31,920
A gentleman practices
benevolence and justice.

620
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,840
So what if the capital
is an important place,

621
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,920
and you have
a supportive crowd and power?

622
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,439
Today, even if I have to risk my life,

623
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,679
I will fight you Feng Tiannan
to the end.

624
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,719
Brother Hu,

625
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,840
you're being too disrespectful.

626
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:53,600
Sister Cheng,

627
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,759
most of them are martial arts experts.

628
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,679
Can Brother Hu beat them all alone?

629
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,679
My brothers,

630
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:03,519
you all have nothing
to do with this matter.

631
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:04,920
Please stay out of the way.

632
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,679
Watch out!

633
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,519
Come on!

634
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,360
Everyone, should we give a chase?

635
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:47,840
We've been entrusted by Chief Tang.

636
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,039
We've only been entrusted

637
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,439
to mediate a dispute.

638
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,160
Now that they've started to fight,

639
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,360
we can't assure that he will win.

640
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Moreover,

641
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:02,199
everyone knows the relationship

642
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,840
between Brother Hu and Young Lady Ma.

643
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,959
As court officials,

644
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,999
we know well

645
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,840
who we can afford to offend

646
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,360
and whom we can't.

647
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,119
Show yourself, Feng Tiannan!

648
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,760
Show yourself now, Feng Tiannan!

649
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,240
Come out and face your death!

650
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,119
Who is behaving atrociously there?

651
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:13,200
(What a powerful internal force.)

652
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,880
(He has such a powerful internal force)

653
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,479
(at such a young age.)

654
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,360
Madam,

655
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:18,760
did a man just...

656
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,400
Insolent!

657
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,200
This is the pure land of Buddhism.

658
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,999
You're prohibited
from talking nonsense here.

659
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,200
Please calm down, Madam.

660
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,119
I indeed saw

661
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,720
a wicked villain sneaked in just now.

662
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,999
How dare you be insolent?

663
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:45,959
Master, leave it to me.

664
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,720
Ziyi?

665
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:20,720
What on earth do you want?

666
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:21,840
Let's talk outside.

667
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,920
Can you tell me now?

668
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,720
Is Feng Tiannan hiding in there?

669
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,280
Do you know what kind of place it is?

670
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,119
How dare you sneaked in?

671
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,479
I don't care at all.

672
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,920
I'm only aware

673
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,360
that you keep stopping me

674
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
from killing Feng Tiannan.

675
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:55,880
Fei.

676
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:58,920
Fei, are you okay?

677
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,280
I'm fine.

678
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,280
Did Zhou Tiejiao hurt you?

679
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,039
No.

680
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:06,439
That courtyard belongs
to the sect leaders.

681
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,200
Next to it is the king's residence.

682
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,840
If you recognize it,
please leave quickly.

683
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,200
Do you think it's possible?

684
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,680
I've been hunting for Feng Tiannan
till the capital.

685
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,280
I finally found him today.

686
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,639
I won't leave.

687
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,200
Do you think you can still
take a shot today?

688
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,680
I've sworn to Zhong Asi and his family

689
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,280
that I'll avenge them

690
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,479
even if I'm crushed to death.

691
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,760
I can contest with the sect leaders

692
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,680
before the Sect Leaders Gathering.

693
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,760
Fei, Young Lady Yuan is right.

694
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,200
This place is heavily guarded.

695
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,680
If it gets the attention of others,

696
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,039
it will be hard to wind this matter up.

697
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,360
Why don't we head back first

698
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:43,519
and make a plan?

699
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,760
You may not care for your life.

700
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:49,039
But what about the lives
of these two young ladies?

701
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,920
Okay.

702
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,800
I can promise you.

703
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,360
But can you tell me

704
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,959
why did you keep stopping me
from killing him?

705
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,079
It is

706
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,519
a long story.

707
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,400
Do you remember you'd promised

708
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,840
to listen to me in everything?

709
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,240
Yes.

710
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,760
Then, please leave now.

711
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:27,439
Let's go then.
