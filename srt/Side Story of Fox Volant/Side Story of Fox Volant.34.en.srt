=Side Story Of Fox Volant=
(Adapted from Jin Yong's novel)

2
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,520
=Episode 34=

3
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,850
Thank you for saving

4
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,690
both my sons, Venerable.

5
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,250
They were rescued

6
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,050
by my disciples.

7
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,890
They are obviously
the ones who abducted the two princes.

8
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,850
Your Honor. I heard it myself.

9
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,820
She even called her senior.

10
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,300
The All-knowing Nun.

11
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,300
I'm sure you dare not admit

12
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,050
the fact that she is your disciple.

13
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,690
Venerable, is that the case?

14
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,690
Official Fu.

15
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,050
It's indeed as they say.

16
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,130
She is my disciple, Sang Feihong indeed.

17
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,620
Venerable.

18
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,690
You planted someone
in Official Fu's residence

19
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,220
and you also have
someone else on the outside

20
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,540
to abduct Official Fu's sons.

21
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,260
What ulterior motive do you have?

22
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,220
Exactly.

23
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,260
They caused Yiming's death.

24
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,300
Your Honor, you must
help set things straight for me!

25
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,250
Feihong.

26
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,420
Explain it yourself.

27
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,090
We need to split up
after entering the capital.

28
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,940
You need to be careful

29
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,580
since you're alone outside.

30
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,060
If you get captured,

31
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,580
do you know what you should do?

32
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,420
Please instruct me, Master.

33
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,170
I came here

34
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,330
to the capital on Master's orders
to bring medicine for Old Madam.

35
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,370
I was supposed to return
to Tianshan

36
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,970
after I brought the medicine

37
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,860
but Master insisted me to stay.

38
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,060
She said Official Fu organised
a Sect Leaders' Gathering

39
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,660
to reorganise
the martial arts sects' status

40
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,860
in the martial arts world

41
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,530
which is a good thing
for the martial arts world.

42
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,730
But Official Fu's action

43
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,330
will affect some people's benefits.

44
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,290
The residence hasn't been safe recently.

45
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,860
Master thought
something fishy was going on

46
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,530
so she suspected the problem originated
from the Commander's Residence.

47
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,660
However, she needed

48
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,170
to protect Old Madam

49
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,730
and couldn't investigate it

50
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,660
so she sent me to investigate in secret

51
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,370
because I was a stranger here

52
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,170
and wouldn't attract attention.

53
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,380
When I was
investigating yesterday night,

54
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,100
I realised someone abducting
the two princes in the residence.

55
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,170
Senior was pursuing them

56
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,540
but a young man rushed out
from the Commander's Residence

57
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,610
to intercept Senior

58
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,540
so I went to help her.

59
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,610
After that, when I went
with Senior to pursue the culprits,

60
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,100
she told me

61
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,930
the people who got abducted

62
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,490
were Official Fu's sons.

63
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,890
You are lying!

64
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,100
All of you abducted little princes

65
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,330
so my son Yiming
went to chase after you!

66
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,420
Let her finish.

67
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,420
This is their conspiracy, Your Honor.

68
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,770
After that, Senior and I

69
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,540
finally caught up
to the people who abducted little princes

70
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,170
and fought with them.

71
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,580
They have prestigious statuses.

72
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,170
After we got them back,

73
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,300
Senior took them away.

74
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,930
I was not strong enough.

75
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,300
I lost to them

76
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,890
and got captured.

77
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,700
Master.

78
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,580
I have embarrassed you.

79
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,540
Your Honor.

80
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,610
They were the ones
who abducted the Princes.

81
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,820
They are trying to shift the blame away.

82
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,860
Yes!

83
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,890
They knew they were going to be exposed

84
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,050
so they blamed us.

85
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,260
Nonsense!

86
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,420
It was all of you who did it.

87
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,580
Besides,

88
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,420
why do I need to abduct
the little princes?

89
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,420
Why?

90
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,380
You...

91
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,890
You abducted them
to threaten Official Fu.

92
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,770
My master is responsible
for Old Madam's safety.

93
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,050
Isn't it better to threaten Official Fu

94
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,020
with Old Madam?

95
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,700
Why should we do this?

96
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,330
The Tianshan Sect and
Red Flower Club are working together.

97
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,410
You abducted little princes
to give Red Flower Club.

98
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,610
I don't know

99
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,170
why both of you need
to abduct the two princes.

100
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,730
My disciple, Sang Feihong,

101
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,330
also didn't know

102
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,610
what happened here.

103
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,380
But I found out

104
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,890
you have a deep relationship

105
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,300
with the fugitive, Hu Fei.

106
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,300
You spent a lot of money
to get him on your side

107
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,420
and invited him to a banquet.

108
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,730
You even gave him a residence.

109
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,930
A fugitive can enter the residence
as easily as entering an empty space.

110
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,450
I'm sure all of you are behind this.

111
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,140
In that case,

112
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Hu Fei is definitely related
to Red Flower Club.

113
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,290
I remember now!

114
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,090
Two days ago,

115
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,700
I saw them reading a letter

116
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,500
when I was patrolling
the Sect Leaders' Courtyard at night.

117
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,210
They were discussing something
when they read the letter.

118
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,650
I remember vaguely

119
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,940
there was a red picture
on the envelope.

120
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,530
I didn't see clearly

121
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,580
because I was too far.

122
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,620
What are you talking about?

123
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,820
Zhou Tiejiao.

124
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,620
Yes!

125
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,740
Take someone and search Tang Pei's room.

126
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,650
Yes.

127
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:25,890
Your Honor.

128
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,260
You must not believe their words.

129
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,260
Your Honor.

130
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,260
Even if you find the letter,

131
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,850
I'm sure they planted it there.

132
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,140
Why are you so nervous?

133
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,650
It's just a search in your room.

134
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,820
Does your room

135
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,330
really have something you can't show me?

136
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,450
Your Honor, no!

137
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,850
Definitely not!

138
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,700
Your Honor,
if you're going to search my room,

139
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,410
I must follow them.

140
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,740
This old nun has been
in the residence for many days.

141
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,530
What if she bribed everyone?

142
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,500
Also,

143
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,090
her room needs to be searched too.

144
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,740
Perhaps we can find something strange.

145
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,450
Sure.

146
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,890
Hailan Bi.

147
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,330
Go with them.

148
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,770
Yes, Your Honor.

149
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,060
Ziyi.

150
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,850
Go with them as well.

151
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,410
Let them search thoroughly.

152
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,330
Yes.

153
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,580
Suit yourself.

154
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,450
Official Tang.

155
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,500
What else can be searched

156
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,180
in the Nun's room?

157
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,700
Official Hai.

158
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,770
You still need to search it nonetheless.

159
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,380
Young Lady Yuan.

160
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,060
It's inconvenient
for us to search the Nun's room.

161
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,330
Sorry to trouble you.

162
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,820
Besides Master's clothing,

163
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,020
the Ruyi and jade beads

164
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,450
were given to her by Old Madam.

165
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,330
The western clock
was given by Official Fu.

166
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,090
There's nothing else.

167
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,530
You can search around.

168
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,700
Official Hai.

169
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,530
There's nothing else

170
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,770
in the Nun's room

171
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,020
apart from this bundle
that Young Lady Yuan opened.

172
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,450
Let's go.

173
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,020
Official Hai.

174
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,410
Take a look.

175
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,330
Take a look.

176
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,940
What can be hidden in my room?

177
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,180
That's right.

178
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,740
This is the drawing Official Fu gave me.

179
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,970
Why don't you take a look?

180
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,820
Chief Tang.

181
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,260
You shouldn't do this.

182
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,820
According to what you said,

183
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,380
the three of us

184
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,330
might be bribed by the Nun.

185
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,740
To avoid any arousing suspicions,

186
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,700
we can't

187
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,260
search your room.

188
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,140
Official Hai.

189
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,740
Sorry to trouble you.

190
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,180
We will be waiting outside.

191
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,850
Yes!

192
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,570
Chief Tang.

193
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,050
(Wangwu Sect, Wuliang Sword Sect)
What is this?

194
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,460
I don't know.

195
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,690
Great, Chief Tang.

196
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,570
The Sect Leaders' Gathering
has yet to start

197
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,140
and you are already working together

198
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,020
with all sect leaders in private.

199
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,140
You even arranged everything

200
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,810
from the result

201
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,930
until the cup everyone will hold.

202
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,100
I...

203
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,340
Official Hai.

204
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,770
Official Hai.

205
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,380
The Jade Dragon Cup...

206
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,740
What?

207
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,460
Besides the Golden Dragon Cup
and the Silver Dragon Cup,

208
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,690
are you even trying to

209
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,530
manipulate the Jade Dragon Cup?

210
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,770
Official Hai, the Jade Dragon Cup...

211
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,740
You are really daring.

212
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,380
Have you manipulated something

213
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,340
that Official Fu can't even decide?

214
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,770
How much money did you receive?

215
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,860
Official Hai.

216
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,170
I also did it
because I thought about Official Fu.

217
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,620
It won't be nice
if they were to fight for real.

218
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,140
I want to make some money

219
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,690
but everyone involved
will get a cut as well.

220
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,570
Official Hai.

221
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,170
You know how loyal I am to Official Fu.

222
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,050
For so many years,

223
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,690
I...

224
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,020
I have no other intentions.

225
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,380
How is it possible for me

226
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,690
to get involved with Red Flower Club?

227
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,460
How dare you!

228
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,620
Since you made a decision
behind Commander's back,

229
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,530
you probably dare to do more than that.

230
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,690
Search thoroughly!

231
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,460
Yes!

232
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,500
Official Hai.

233
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,620
Chief Tang.

234
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,220
What is this?

235
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,100
An incense burner.

236
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,690
Is it used to burn paper?

237
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,890
Take it back and examine it thoroughly.

238
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,860
Yes.

239
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,100
All right. Let's go.

240
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,930
Yes.

241
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,770
Official Tang.

242
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,690
You are already guilty of a crime

243
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,530
with this ledger alone.

244
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,290

Tang Pei.

248
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,170
How do you explain yourself this time?

249
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,980
What was written on that letter?

250
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,260
Your Honor.

251
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,140
I'm wronged!

252
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,530
I don't know.

I really don't know.

Your Honor.

255
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,050
This nun must have planted this

256
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,770
to frame me.

257
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,140
Your Honor, I...

258
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,170
Chief Tang.

259
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,770
The evidence is here.

260
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,290
Are you still not going to admit it?

261
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,340
The two princes know.

262
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,530
Yes.

263
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,770
Your Honor.

264
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,620
The two princes

265
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,620
must know who abducted them.

266
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,860
They can prove my innocence.

267

Your Honor, it's already late.

268
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,290
Both princes were terrified.

269
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,410
I'm afraid...

270
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,100
Bring both of them here.

271

Tonight,

272
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,020
I want to find out the truth tonight.

Yes.

Come here.

Tell me.

280
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,690
Is the person who abducted you

281
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,810
among these people?

282
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,500
Little prince.

283
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,770
Tell your father

who abducted you two.

285
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,050
Tell me. Who was it?

286

I will get revenge for you.

My son, Yiming, got himself killed

to rescue both of them.

293
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,650
Who is it?

Who is trying to frame me?

Capture them!

No!

I said it.

Even if I go to the end of the earth,

I can't believe

314

there are so many ways to make money

315
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,660
using the Sect Leaders' Gathering.

316

In terms of making money,

Tang Pei is

318

really smarter than anyone else.

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,570
Yes.

320
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,850
Even if I crack my brain,

321
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,900
I can't even come up with
half as many ideas as them.

322
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,460
Let's go.

323
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,290
Go and report to Official Fu.

324
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,460
Yes.

You must help me.

How would I

329
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,530
collude with Red Flower Club?

330
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,130

All of us believe you.

But Official Fu...

333

they won't give up easily.

339

341
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,530
If you make the necessary preparations,

342
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,740
you'll be able
to achieve something great.

343
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,020
Then,

344
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,500
I will be proven innocent
regarding my relationship

345
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,740
with Red Flower Club.

346
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,700
Official Tang.

347
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,130
Your analysis is reasonable.

348
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,810
Well,

349
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,610
we will try our best
to persuade Official Fu

350
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,660
not to handle your case immediately.

351
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,090
We'll leave everything until
the Sect Leaders' Gathering is over.

352
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,050
What do you think?

353
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,370
Thank you!

354
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,020
Once the Sect Leaders' Gathering is over,

355
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,370
the truth will finally come to light.

356
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,020
Official Tang, calm down.

357
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,740
Official Fu would have killed you

358
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,700
if he wanted you dead.

359
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,460
Since he locked you up,

360
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,050
there must still be a chance.

361
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,090
We will definitely help you.

362
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,020
Thank you!

363
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,130
That's enough, Official Tang.

364
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,610
Go inside.

365
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,660
Go inside.

366
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,810
Everyone, you must help me!

367
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,180
Tiejiao.

368
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,220
I think Tang Pei is right.

369
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,770
Red Flower Club

370
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,420
will definitely cause trouble
during the Sect Leaders' Gathering.

371
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,980
If we help him,

372
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,940
we will reap the rewards.

373
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,900
Yes, Tiejiao.

374
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,330
I heard Tang Pei

375
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,370
has many assets outside.

376
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,570
Both of you are too greedy.

377
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,610
Even if Tang Pei
is not related to Red Flower Club,

378
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,810
what about Hu Fei?

379
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,050
Since Hu Fei

380
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,530
has been exposed today,

381
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,610
Official Fu will surely investigate it.

382
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,980
Right now,

383
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,290
it seems the relationship
between Hu Fei and Red Flower Club

384
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,810
is confirmed.

385
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,660
But Tang Pei

386
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,020
is supposed to know everything.

387
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,660
Why did he still lie to us

388
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,530
and want us to win over Hu Fei?

389
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,980
He is setting us up.

390
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,570
Once the Sect Leaders' Gathering is over

391
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,500
and Tang Pei is proven innocent,

392
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,130
he will push the blame

393
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,810
of Hu Fei's incident to us.

394
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,130
Then, we'll

395
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,020
be in deep trouble.

396
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,700
With Official Fu's personality,

397
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,770
do you think
we can still live a good life?

398
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,980
Tiejiao, what should we do?

399
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,740
The culprits of winning over Hu Fei

400
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,260
are Tang Pei and Feng Tiannan.

401
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,770
When both of them are dead,

402
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,260
we can

403
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,850
tell the Commander

404
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,770
that we were lied to

405
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,050
and let them take

406
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,980
all the responsibilities.

407
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,260
This jerk

408
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,810
still dares to threaten us now?

409
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,330
He really doesn't know his place.

410
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,770
Prepare a feast for him.

411
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,330
No matter what,

412
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,900
we were still comrades in the past.

413
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,500
Understood.

414
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,980
Did you ask him?

415
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,770
What is Tang Pei's relationship

416
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,610
with Red Flower Club?

417
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,130
He wouldn't admit anything.

418
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,770
He shifted all the blame

419
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,980
to Feng Tiannan.

420
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,530
In the past few years,

421
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,700
Tang Pei has been good.

422
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,660
He might not be very loyal

423
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,130
but he fulfilled his responsibilities.

424
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,770
If he is really working

425
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,290
with Red Flower Club,

426
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,130
what is your opinion about that?
Official Hai.

427
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,740
Official Fu.

428
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,290
I'm not close to Tang Pei.

429
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,660
But after the search yesterday,

430
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,810
I think he is a greedy person.

431
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,050
He dared to do so many things

432
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,460
behind your back

433
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,980
for his own benefit.

434
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,770
I'm sure he dares to do something worse.

435
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,940
You are close to Tang Pei.

436
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,370
Even if you are not involved

437
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,500
in what he was doing behind my back,

438
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,130
you should also know about it.

439
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,330
I want you to be honest.

440
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,810
Forgive me, Your Honor.

441
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,660
We might be used by Tang Pei.

442
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,090
Tell me!

443
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,740
After Feng Tiannan arrived
at the capital,

444
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,700
Tang Pei wanted us to win over Hu Fei.

445
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,290
He told us Hu Fei
had a grudge against Feng Tiannan

446
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,940
and Feng Tiannan
wanted to become friends with him

447
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,940
so he asked us
to organise a banquet for Hu Fei

448
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,220
and gave him a residence.

449
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,090
Your Honor, we really don't know

450
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,530
Hu Fei is a member of Red Flower Club.

451
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,740
Please investigate thoroughly.

452
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,740
Official Fu, since Tang Pei

453
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,770
is involved with Red Flower Club,

454
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,460
he should be killed.

455
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,850
Stand.

456
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,500
I got some results from my investigation

457
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,050
regarding Hu Fei's involvement
with Red Flower Club.

458
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,050
The true culprits

459
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,530
are indeed Tang Pei and Feng Tiannan.

460
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,220
Since you mentioned it yourself,

461
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,700
I will believe

462
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,740
the fact that you were being lied to.

463
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:38,810
Thank you, Your Honor.

464
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,020
Thank you, Your Honor!

465
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:24,810
You...

466
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,460
Don't worry.

467
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,370
It's not time to kill you yet.

468
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,660
You poisoned me?

469
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,660
I don't have to poison you

470
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,770
if I want to kill you.

471
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,700
These jerks!

472
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,530
I came to find you

473
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,050
because of injustice
from many years ago.

474
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,940
Do you still remember Yuan Yingu?

475
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,260
13 years ago,

476
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,530
a pitiful woman

477
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,900
brought her daughter

478
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,330
out of Foshan

479
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,660
and begged along her way.

480
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,810
When she was almost dying of hunger,

481
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,500
she was saved by
the Blessing of Seven Provinces

482
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,260
who gave her porridge.

483
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,770
To repay you,

484
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,660
she went to work in your residence.

485
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,500
When she settled down

486
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,500
and thought

487
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,090
her life would be getting better,

488
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,220
she saw her old enemy

489
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,570
at your residence.

490
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,020
The bully of Foshan, Feng Tiannan.

491
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,700
That was when she found out

492
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,850
both of you have been colluding

493
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,700
to do many evil things.

494
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,500
Who would have thought

495
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,180
the respectable person
in the martial arts world,

496
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,330
Young Hero Tang,

497
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,900
who was also known as
the Blessing of Seven Provinces

498
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,740
had another secret identity?

499
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,770
You committed so many crimes

500
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,740
that it was hard to list them out.

501
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,660
Unfortunately,

502
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,420
you discovered Yuan Yingu
who was hiding outside the window.

503
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,090
You were afraid
that she might expose you

504
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,700
and hurt your reputation
in the martial arts world

505
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,180
so you killed my mother.

506
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,460
After my mother died,

507
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,520
you wouldn't even spare my life
when I was only seven years old.

508
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,940
You sold me to a human trader

509
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,090
and wanted me to become a prostitute.

510
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,980
You always appear in public looking kind

511
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,370
but you don't know

512
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,130
what goes around comes around.

513
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,900
If I knew this would happen,

514
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,570
I should have

515
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,130
killed you as well back then.

516
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,420
You ended up like this

517
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,980
because of all the evil things
you did in the past.

518
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,660
You...

519
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,130
Darn it!

520
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,810
Even Tang Pei
was bribed by Red Flower Club.

521
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,700
I was also shocked

522
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,290
when I found out about this.

523
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,570
Red Flower Club

524
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,900
is everywhere

525
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,810
around us.

526
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,180
Seems like the manipulated sect leader
and Jade Dragon Cup

527
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,940
should be given to one of our own.

528
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,700
Your Majesty, do you have
a sect leader in your mind?

529
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,980
Hailan Bi.

530
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,740
Yes.

531
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,770
You are from Liaodong.

532
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,610
I'll grant you the position of
sect leader of Heilong Sect of Liaodong.

533
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,610
Thank you, Your Majesty.

534
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,770
Your Majesty is wise.

535
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,570
With Official Hai,

536
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,050
I believe

537
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,180
the Sect Leaders' Gathering

538
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,940
will progress smoothly.

539
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,900
All of you may leave.

540
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,220
Yes.

541
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,530
We'll be leaving.

542
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,120
(Tianlong Sect)

543
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,500
Who is

544
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,020
this Manager Sai?

545
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,740
Why did he come here without notice?

546
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,850
Apparently, he was under Official Hai
from the Firearm Brigade.

547
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,980
He was appointed by the Commander
as the tournament's manager.

548
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:01,850
Your Honor, enjoy.

549
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,220
I'm sorry for being late

550
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,980
in welcoming Manager Sai's arrival.

551
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,740
Please forgive me, Your Honor.

552
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,500
Please forgive me, Your Honor.

553
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,850
Isn't this Chief Tian?

554
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,050
I came here to visit

555
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,020
because of Commander's orders.

556
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,460
One who does not know isn't guilty.

557
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,570
You are too polite, Chief Tian.

558
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,530
I wonder what orders
the Commander has for me.

559
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,020
I will do my best to cooperate with him.

560
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,130
I'm relieved

561
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,610
to hear that.

562
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,500
I came here to talk to Chief Tian

563
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,700
about the Jade Dragon Cup.

564
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,290
I'm sure you know about

565
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,290
Tang Pei's public execution

566
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,850
because of his rebellion.

567
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,370
Yes.

568
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,700
Tang Pei was supposed to be

569
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,570
the one who manipulated
the eight great sect leaders.

570
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,530
After what happened,

571
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,220
the Commander is fearful

572
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,330
of everyone's loyalty.

573
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,420
Hence,

574
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,610
he cancelled
the manipulated qualification

575
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,850
and changed it to fair competition

576
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,460
through martial arts sparring.

577
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,980
So,

578
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,860
Chief Tian's Jade Dragon Cup

579
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,690
has to be won with your abilities.

580
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,780
Of course.

581
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,420
As compensation,

582
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,610
Chief Tian can skip the preliminaries

583
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,530
and enter the finals directly

584
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,210
to fight for the Jade Dragon Cup.

585
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,420
I believe

586
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,500
Chief Tian's martial arts

587
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,460
are good enough to win

588
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,210
the Jade Dragon Cup.

589
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,530
Yes.

590
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,250
Official Zeng.

591
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,980
What do you think?

592
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,610
Official Sai is right.

593
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,610
Tianlong Sect's martial arts are strong

594
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,900
and Tianlong Sect has a 100-year-old history.

595
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,250
Your sect will surely perform
and surpass everyone else

596
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,460
during the tournament.

597
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,170
All right.

598
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,650
I've done the things

599
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,050
Commander ordered me.

600
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,860
I need to return to the capital

601
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,860
and prepare for the tournament

602
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,460
so I will be leaving.

603
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,570
Let's meet again

604
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,020
when Chief Tian is in the capital.

605
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,730
Farewell.

606
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,610
Farewell, Your Honor.
