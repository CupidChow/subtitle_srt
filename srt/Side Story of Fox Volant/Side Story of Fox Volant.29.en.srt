3
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,439
Chief Feng.

4
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,400
Sit.

5
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:52,400
What is going on?

6
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,040
Let's not talk about it.

7
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,200
I am only alive now

8
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,319
because of my ancestors' good karma.

9
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:03,840
Not even the military officers
could stop that brat?

10
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,360
That brat

11
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,920
insisted on taking my life.

12
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,719
He was in the courtyard room
where the chiefs stayed!

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,079
If it weren't for the Nun,

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,319
I would have

15
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:17,800
died a horrible death.

16
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,599
Uncle Tang.

17
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,440
We entrusted our lives

18
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,200
to you.

19
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,959
None of your plans worked!

20
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,920
Look at us now.

21
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,679
We used up the money,

22
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,760
but we are still in grave danger.

23
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,520
And more importantly, Hu Fei now knows

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,679
where we live!

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,079
What if he charges in here

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,999
and beheads both of us!

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,399
What is that supposed to mean?

28
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,800
Now is our chance.

29
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,760
Uncle Tang, did you come up

30
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,439
with yet another unreliable plan?

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,960
My plans have always been reliable.

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,040
Do you know

33
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,999
why the All-Knowing Nun

34
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:53,719
was in room one of Tianzi?

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,760
Rumor has it,

36
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,159
her medicine cured the Old Madam

37
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,639
of her sickness.

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,239
Not at all.

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,519
Not only does she know medicine,

40
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,400
our of all the chiefs there,

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,560
the All-Knowing Nun
is the strongest warrior.

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,439
Not to mention
she has Official Fu's trust.

43
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,040
Chief Feng.

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,279
With the Nun's protection,

45
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,639
that brat is not a threat to you.

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,680
Chief Tang.

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,159
With that brought up,

48
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,760
something came to mind.

49
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,760
The Nun's disciple saved my life once.

50
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,279
Do you know the true reason

51
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:35,120
why the Imperial Court
is holding this gathering?

52
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:41,439
A great catastrophe will soon
befall the martial arts world.

53
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,079
The Tianshan Sect is part of that world,

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,799
and we are followers of Buddhism.

55
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,559
We have a duty to stop that catastrophe.

56
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,639
It's a critical time for all of us.

57
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,920
I advise you

58
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,760
to not get distracted.

59
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,200
If your romance gets in
the way of the greater good,

60
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,000
if innocent lives are lost

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,519
and bloodshed comes to past,

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
how will you answer to the sect?

63
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:05,239
How will you face your own conscience?

64
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,720
I will keep your advice

65
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,600
in mind.

66
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,399
I need not your promise,

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,679
say it to the Buddha instead.

68
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,000
Reverend,

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,920
Chief Feng and Chief Tang
request an audience.

70
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,320
Get up.

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,559
Chief Feng.

72
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,480
Please accept my salutation.

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,799
Thank you for saving my life.

74
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,480
Your gratitude is not needed.

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,280
It wasn't my intention to save you.

76
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,119
I merely taught the brazen thug
that bothered me a lesson.

77
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,679
Whichever the case is...

78
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,639
It's time for my meditation.

79
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,559
Please leave.

80
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:06,359
Take your gifts with you.

81
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,600
A monastic has no worldly desires.

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,720
I do not need your wealth.

83
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,359
I shall not interrupt your meditation.

84
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:17,799
But your disciple saved my life once.

85
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:20,959
I'd like to thank her in person.

86
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,839
Is that true?

87
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,359
Yes, it is.

88
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:29,399
My silly disciple always
gets herself in trouble.

89
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,119
Please leave.

90
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:34,320
I must give her a proper lecture.

91
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:59,280
What was wrong with that old nun?

92
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:02,319
She wouldn't accept my gifts.

93
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,040
She wouldn't even listen

94
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,999
to a word I said.

95
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,879
What is it that she wants?

96
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,960
This is outrageous!

97
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,999
We were all prestigious guests here.

98
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,400
Who put her above us?

99
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:16,999
Calm down, my nephew.

100
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,920
Do not be flustered.

101
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,080
Something must be amiss here.

102
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,999
Uncle Tang.

103
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:26,559
The truth is right before our eyes.

104
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,920
What could be amiss?

105
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:34,960
The All-Knowing Nun
is from the Tianshan Sect.

106
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:38,879
Tianshan is located
in the land of Xinjiang.

107
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,119
That is where the Red Flower Club is.

108
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,879
The Red Flower Club?

109
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:44,960
What is it?

110
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,199
Perhaps you haven't heard.

111
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,319
The Red Flower Club is
brazen and bold beyond anyone.

112
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,160
They attacked Official Fu.

113
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,679
Even the current emperor

114
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,999
was once captured by these people.

115
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,359
If that were true,

116
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,640
why would they come to the capital?

117
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,840
Official Fu might arrest them.

118
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:10,359
Fortune favors the brave.

119
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,439
It must be their plan
to work on both sides.

120
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,920
Fei, your inner force is strong.

121
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,400
You've recovered
from the palm strikes.

122
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I've thought it through.

123
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:38,999
I know why Ziyi did it.

124
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,359
She called the old nun

125
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,199
"Master."

126
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,439
Her master was invited by Fu Kang'an

127
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,520
just as the other chiefs.

128
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,720
It's likely she is after fame and money.

129
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,559
Maybe she is like
those military officers

130
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,239
who were bought off by Fu Kang'an.

131
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,600
And Ziyi had an order from her master.

132
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,199
That's why she stopped me.

133
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,199
Lingsu, what do you think?

134
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,160
You think of her as a nice person,

135
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,679
therefore she wouldn't do bad things.

136
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,559
Is that what you think too?

137
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,280
How should I know
what's on Young Lady Yuan's mind?

138
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,999
You need to rest and recover.

139
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:10,960
Yes.

140
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,119
Don't worry about me.

If we both die in the end,

145
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,480
at least we can greet each other

146
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,679
in the other afterlife.

147

I am Zheng Fengzhua.

See? I told you so.

There is no limit to the bets here.

00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,880
She seemed rude to me.

171
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,920
She spoke in riddles,

172
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,719
and she was mean to Brother Hu.

173
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,520
Unlike you, you're brilliant

174
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,599
and kind.

175
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,959
Each poison has its antidote.

176
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,079
Perhaps she is

177
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,520
the one that has Brother Hu's love.

178
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,000
Sister Cheng, don't give up.

179
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:31,360
I think you're great.

180
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,240
You're kind and gentle,

181
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,319
and you're compassionate.

182
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,120
You put others before yourself.

183
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,599
I put others before myself,

184
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
and that is why it's been so exhausting.

185
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,120
Lingsu, can I come in?

186
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,079
Fei?

187
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,000
Lingsu.

188
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,079
You and Xiaomei must
start packing tonight.

189
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,479
We are leaving tomorrow at first light.

190
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,319
Where are we going?

191
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,640
An inn, perhaps.

192
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,240
Or we can rent a house.

193
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,160
This is Feng Tiannan's territory.

194
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:08,599
I don't want to be here.

195
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,439
We'll follow your decision.

196
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,520
My lord, Official Nie is here.

197
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
He has matters to discuss.

198
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,599
Yes, I'll be there.

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,719
Brother Nie.

200
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,319
Brother Hu.

201
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,920
I am terribly sorry.

202
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,439
It was total chaos earlier.

203
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,640
They were fighting allies.

204
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,280
You didn't know the cause,

205
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:34,240
hence I don't blame you.

206
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:37,240
My hands are tied, given my position.

207
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,240
I hope you understand.

208
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,199
I came at this hour on order.

209
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,319
An old friend wishes to see you.

210
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,719
An old friend?

211
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,839
Who could it be?

212
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,559
You'll know when you're there.

213
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,240
Follow me.

214
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,920
Sure.

215
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,160
You need not worry.

216
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:57,079
My men are on their way.

217
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,520
They will arrive within 15 minutes.

218
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,439
Thank you, Official Zhou.

219
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:04,000
You took great care of us

220
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,959
after we came to the capital.

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,799
I serve Official Fu.

222
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
This is part of my duty.

223
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:13,799
Sorry for the long wait.

224
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:17,120
I shall take my leave now.

225
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:36,719
Madam, the ginseng soup is ready.

226
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:37,959
Yes.

227
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,959
Dismissed.

228
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,839
Of all the influential consorts
in the palace,

229
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,160
did any of them

230
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,360
earn His Majesty's favor
by crying like a child?

231
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,959
Mother, I didn't want to trouble you,

232
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,799
but they have crossed the line.

233
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,120
Ever since she came here,

234
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,760
they flute in the room every night!

235
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,160
This is the prince's residence.

236
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,599
We are not a singing troupe.

237
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,959
Mind your tongue.

238
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,199
Don't forget your status.

239
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,640
If Kang'an heard this,

240
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:21,559
wouldn't he be upset?

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,120
She is just another woman
from the martial arts world.

242
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,360
She holds blades and
staves with her hands.

243
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:34,360
And now, look at what you've done.

244
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,959
If you made him desperate,

245
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,199
it wouldn't end well for you.

246
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,400
Remember,

247
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,799
no matter how many
affairs he has out there,

248
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,920
you are still his official wife.

249
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:54,000
Show your capacity.

250
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,719
There are things

251
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,240
you should ignore

252
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:02,679
and overlook.

253
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,799
Chamberlain Nie.

254
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,559
Open up.

255
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,120
Brother Nie.

256
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,079
Who owns this huge mansion?

257
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,559
No more questions,

258
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,679
we'll be there soon.

259
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,319
Please, go inside.

260
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,520
I'll wait here.

261
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,719
Why didn't you tell me you've arrived?

262
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,160
I had to hear about you

263
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,360
from official Zhou.

264
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,280
I'd just arrived not long ago.

265
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,040
I've never seen you in this appearance.

266
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:10,479
I almost didn't recognize you.

267
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,199
Let's talk inside.

268
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,520
Yes.

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,520
So, this is the prince's manor.

270
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,839
Sister Ma.

271
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,599
Should I address you

272
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,400
as a consort?

273
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,559
Do you think

274
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,120
I'm after his wealth?

275
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:47,319
To the outsiders,

276
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:50,040
I gave Kang'an two sons.

277
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,280
They must think I'd be set for life.

278
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:55,719
But none of them knows that

279
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,160
I have no kin in the capital.

280
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,640
I don't even have
a title in this family.

281
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm always treading on thin ice.

282
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,599
The slightest mistake

283
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,679
could cost me my life.

284
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,040
Sister Ma,

285
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,240
have you been mistreated here?

286
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,640
The people treat
my sons and me with care.

287
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,199
The manor may be great,

288
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,360
but the freedom I had
in the outside world

289
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,120
was much better.

290
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,640
My sons are young.

291
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,280
It's a blessing they can be raised

292
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,360
in this manor.

293
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,240
As their mother,

294
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,479
I'd do anything for them.

295
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,319
Indeed.

296
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,520
As long as you and your children

297
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,120
are safe and sound,

298
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,719
I believe Hero Ma

299
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:51,240
and Brother Xu

300
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,760
would be glad.

301
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,199
- Mother!
- Mother!

302
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,719
- Uncle Hu!
- Uncle Hu!

303
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,679
Pingping, An'an.

304
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,559
Did you miss me?

305
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,360
- Yes!
- We've missed you so much.

306
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,000
Fei.

307
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,319
I invited you because I have

308
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,000
a favor to ask.

309
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,599
What favor?

310
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,839
My sons always talk about you.

311
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,240
They think of you as a hero.

312
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,920
I'd like you to be their master.

313
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,959
With a great master
come great disciples.

314
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,280
With your guidance,

315
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:24,880
they will grow up
to be great men.

316
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,120
Sister Ma,

317
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,599
you think too highly of me.

318
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,520
There are plenty of heroes around.

319
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,559
Any one of them can be a great master,

320
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,160
why must it be me?

321
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,520
Besides,

322
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:38,479
Pingping and An'an
have status and wealth.

323
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:40,199
No one would mess with them.

324
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,999
There is no need to train them.

325
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,560
Do you take me for a fool?

326
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,640
Official Fu has many
great fighters serving him,

327
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:50,880
but all of them seek power and money.

328
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,400
They are fighting to rise in the ranks.

329
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,759
No one would truly
care about training my sons.

330
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,600
You're different.

331
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,800
You've always had a sense of justice.

332
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,360
You'd risk your life
just to save another.

333
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,120
I'll be relieved knowing

334
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,800
they are in your care.

335
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,999
Uncle Hu, teach me how to throw a punch.

336
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,999
Uncle Hu, I want to learn swordplay.

337
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,679
Tell me,

338
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,600
why do you want to learn martial arts?

339
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,080
To protect our mother.

340
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,439
I want to be a hero.

341
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Silly boys.

342
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,600
It's not easy being a hero.

343
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:32,800
Wait here.

344
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,920
Everyone is here already.

345
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,759
Greetings, Madam.

346
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:44,199
Greetings, my ladies.

347
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:45,800
Welcome, Eunuch Li.

348
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,120
Congratulations.

349
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:53,640
Congratulations on reuniting with
two precious grandsons.

350
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,400
Thank you.

351
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,600
I wanted Kang'an to pick a date

352
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,080
to inform His Majesty.

353
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,679
But His Majesty had
already learned about it.

354
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Indeed.

355
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,719
His Majesty has always been concerned

356
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,880
about what goes on in your family.

357
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,279
Today,

358
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,320
I came on His Majesty's order.

359
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,080
His Majesty is busy
with national affairs.

360
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,560
He sent me

361
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,199
to check on the children.

362
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,400
His Majesty also promised

363
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,959
he'd summon them to the palace

364
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:31,800
as soon as he had the time to meet them.

365
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,320
Despite all the work he has,

366
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,920
His Majesty still cares
about my family affairs.

367
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:41,080
I am grateful for that.

368
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,320
That's because

369
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:46,120
he values Commander Fu's service.

370
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,840
Could we bring out

371
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:52,400
the two children now?

372
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,560
Let me have a look
on His Majesty's behalf.

373
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,800
Yes.

374
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:02,080
Bring the boys here.

375
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,800
Yes.

376
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,519
Hua.

377
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,239
Kang.

378
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:12,999
Greetings, Official Fu.

379
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,080
Who might you be?

380
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,279
This is Fei,

381
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,999
I often talk about him.

382
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
His full name is Hu Fei.

383
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,360
He may be young,

384
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,840
but he's a martial art master.

385
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:31,880
You sent an escort

386
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,600
to fetch my sons and I,

387
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,199
Fei helped us a great deal.

388
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,679
You should thank him.

389
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:39,439
I see.

390
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:40,519
I should thank you.

391
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,360
You should be rewarded.

392
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,320
Come to me.

393
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,160
Official Fu,

394
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,640
Eunuch Li from the palace is here.

395
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,439
He claimed His Majesty ordered him

396
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:55,880
to check on the children.

397
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,320
The Old Madam wants you
to bring the boys there now.

398
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,999
Very well.

399
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,759
Yes.

400
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,320
Sister Ma, since you have
other things to see to,

401
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,519
I should take my leave now.

402
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,039
Very well.

403
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,039
Brother Hu.

404
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,239
Hua and her sons owe their lives to you.

405
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,880
I will see to it that you are rewarded.

406
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,719
Let us see you off.

407
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,279
Come.

408
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,959
Let's say goodbye to Uncle Fei.

409
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:26,880
Go on.

410
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,719
Sister Ma, I can show myself out.

411
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:50,719
Hua.

412
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,920
This meeting with Eunuch Li is serious.

413
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,479
You and the boys should get ready.

414
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:56,479
Yes.

415
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:57,959
Let's go.

416
00:22:58,719 --> 00:22:59,439
Go on.

417
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,640
Yes.

418
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,039
How is the preparation?

419
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,120
We'll be ready soon.

420
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,840
Young Masters, come with me.

421
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,199
Hua.

422
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,719
Words travel fast in the house.

423
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:15,840
Do not simply invite
strange men to your room.

424
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:16,959
Otherwise,

425
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,279
you'll find yourself caught up
in baseless gossip.

426
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,160
Fei and I had known each other
since we were children.

427
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:27,400
When Shang Baozhen
tried to hurt my sons and me,

428
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,199
it was Fei who saved me.

429
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,400
To me, he is nothing more
than a little brother.

430
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,600
I have no family in the capital.

431
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,719
When I finally found Fei,

432
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,320
would you stop me from seeing him?

433
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,600
I know you feel insecure.

434
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,640
Don't worry.

435
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:52,800
His Majesty has learned that
you've given me two wonderful sons.

436
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,920
When His Majesty meets the children,

437
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,199
he will be happy,

438
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,999
and he will reward you handsomely.

439
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,360
Then,

440
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:02,800
I'll hold a grand wedding

441
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,320
and marry you.

442
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,560
I'm but a peasant.

443
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,320
I wouldn't dare ask for a marriage.

444
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,239
But you will have to listen to my flute

445
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,800
for the rest of your life.

446
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,719
Young Lady Ma has
earned Official Fu's favor.

447
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:30,160
Glorious days await you, Brother Hu.

448
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,479
You're powerful and honorable.

449
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:34,199
I'd love to be

450
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,600
your follower.

451
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,640
Brother Nie, you flatter me.

452
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:46,080
Hold on, Master Hu.

453
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:49,999
Young Lady Ma ordered me

454
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,039
to send you this gift.

455
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,640
Please accept it.

456
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,080
Tell her

457
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,800
I won't receive gifts
for no good reasons.

458
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,279
I appreciate the gesture.

459
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,920
Brother Nie.

460
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,719
Please, help us out.

461
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,479
I am only doing my job.

462
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,039
Yeah.

463
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:06,880
Don't make it hard for us.

464
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Brother Hu, he is telling the truth.

465
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,640
If Young Lady Ma holds him accountable

466
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,679
and informs Official Fu,

467
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,640
this man will lose his job.

468
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:16,999
Master Hu,

469
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,039
unless you accept this gift,

470
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,239
Young Lady Ma will think
we have failed her.

471
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,080
Yeah.

472
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,439
Brother Hu, just accept it.

473
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,239
Brother Nie!

474
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:35,959
Brother Nie!

475
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,640
What is the meaning of this?

476
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,400
Commander Fu ordered us

477
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,479
to take down Hu Fei!

478
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,840
Please, have mercy on me!

479
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,679
Why does Fu Kang'an want me dead?

480
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:02,920
The Commander thinks

481
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:05,120
you have a relationship
with Young Lady Ma because

482
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,400
you visited her at night.

483
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,640
He wants to interrogate you.

484
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:09,959
And after that?

485
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,519
After that...

486
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,959
He will then kill you.

487
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,439
And if Young Lady Ma asks,

488
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:18,920
we're to tell her
you received 3,000 taels of silver

489
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,840
and went home.

490
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:25,600
Tell Fu Kang'an

491
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,320
that I killed Nie Yue.

492
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,519
If Nie Yue's family

493
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,679
is harmed,

494
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,400
I'll hunt him and his family

495
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,479
to the edge of the world.

496
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,600
Brother Nie.

497
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,600
I didn't think
Fu Kang'an would be so vile.

498
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Because of some baseless speculations,

499
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,719
he tried to take my life.

500
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,519
I've brought this upon you.

501
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,400
Brother Nie.

502
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,560
May you find peace.

503
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,880
I will avenge your death.

504
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,199
This way.

505
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,479
Now, do as I do.

506
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,920
Kneel.

507
00:28:59,039 --> 00:28:59,679
Kneel.

508
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:03,199
Bow and say, "Greetings, Your Majesty."

509
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,999
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

510
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:05,840
Yeah.

511
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,039
Next, you say,

512
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:09,920
"Fortune and prosperity
to Your Majesty."

513
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,719
- Fortune and prosperity to Your Majesty.
- Fortune and prosperity to Your Majesty.

514
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:16,320
Now, "Long live the Emperor."

515
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,160
- Long live the Emperor.
- Long live the Emperor.

516
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,560
Well done.

517
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,039
You got it right.

518
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,880
Stop kneeling,

519
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,279
get up.

520
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,400
Don't tire yourselves.

521
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,800
They look exactly

522
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,719
like Official Fu when he was little.

523
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,920
It really takes me back

524
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:38,600
to decades ago when I was

525
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,519
still serving Commander Fu.

526
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,160
How nice.

527
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,400
Very nice indeed.

528
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,439
I've met the children.

529
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,439
It's time I went back

530
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,880
and reported to His Majesty.

531
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,239
Eunuch Li,

532
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,600
we count on you to take care

533
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,120
of Kang'an's precious sons.

534
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,279
Your Highness, you flatter me.

535
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,080
These boys

536
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,479
were born with the royal blessing.

537
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,400
Perhaps I might

538
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,360
need them to
take care of me in the future.

539
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:20,999
Eunuch Li.

540
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:22,840
Thank you for coming.

541
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,519
Is this...

542
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,400
I mustn't take this.

543
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,199
But...

544
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,640
You deserve it.

545
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:29,560
Well...

546
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,239
I am grateful for the generous reward.

547
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,640
I didn't come here

548
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,800
only to check on the children.

549
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:48,719
According to His Majesty,

550
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,039
you have been sick lately, Old Madam.

551
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,199
He wonders

552
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,880
if you're feeling well.

553
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,640
I thank His Majesty.

554
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:06,759
I'm grateful for His Majesty's concern.

555
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:11,439
I take my leave now.

556
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:12,920
Don't get up.

557
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:13,759
Goodbye.

558
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:14,400
Don't get up.

559
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:19,880
Let's go.

560
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,880
How are Pingping and An'an?

561
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,120
Don't worry.

562
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,519
Official Fu will take good care

563
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,039
of the boys.

564
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,800
Good boys.

565
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,920
You've brought honor to our family.

566
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,039
Well done, my grandsons.

567
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,840
We miss our mother.

568
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,360
It's getting too late.

569
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,199
Hailan.

570
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,199
Take the boys

571
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,120
to my room to have a rest.

572
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,519
Yes, Mother.

573
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:04,479
Come, boys.

574
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,080
Go with her.

575
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,479
-Rest well.
-Mind the steps.

576
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,800
Come on, Pingping and An'an.

577
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:14,080
Mother.

578
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,600
I should go now.

579
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:25,800
Mother.

580
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,560
You could have just asked the servant

581
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:29,959
to escort the boys.

582
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,160
They've never left their mother's side.

583
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,959
They might not sleep well.

584
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,320
It seems the rules of our ancestors

585
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:39,199
are very wise indeed.

586
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,439
Children from the royal family

587
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:44,759
are never raised by their mother.

588
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,360
First,

589
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,479
the mother will have enough time

590
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:50,320
to serve her husband.

591
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:51,999
Secondly,

592
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,640
should the children

593
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,199
find success in life,

594
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,840
they bring honor to their mother.

595
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:01,600
The mother must never intervene

596
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,279
with the children's duties and affairs.

597
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,439
What do you have in mind?

598
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,160
What is your plan for the children?

599
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,479
Mother.

600
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,679
The children are asleep.

601
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,080
Hailan,

602
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,479
do me a favor

603
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,519
and bring Young Lady Ma
the ginseng soup.

604
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:29,920
Tell her

605
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,719
she did great.

606
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,120
She needs the nourishment.

607
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,719
I assure you, Mother,

608
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,320
I will see to it personally.

609
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:52,479
Your Highness.

610
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,719
I know you care about Young Lady Ma.

611
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,239
Don't worry.

612
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,479
I will take good care of her.

613
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,999
(Sister Ma was right.)

614
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,479
(The people here do treat her well.)

615
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,080
Where are the boys?

616
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,160
You need not worry.

617
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,959
Mother was glad to see her grandsons.

618
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,640
Since it was already late,

619
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,999
she let the boys sleep in her room.

620
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,160
I'm here to inform you.

621
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,279
Aren't you going
to invite me into the house?

622
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,120
Welcome in.

623
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,039
Dismissed.

624
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:03,400
I want to talk to my sister in private.

625
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,239
Yes.

626
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,279
Sit down, Chunhua.

627
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,199
Are you still mad at me?

628
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,519
I know I was wrong the other day.

629
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,600
Mother has lectured me for it.

630
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,800
She asked me to make
you some ginseng soup

631
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,120
as an apology.

632
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:37,039
Chunhua.

633
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,640
You are a woman just like me.

634
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,999
You should understand my circumstances.

635
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,479
It's been years since I was married.

636
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:47,159
I've failed to bear any children.

637
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,439
The whole family is worried about me.

638
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,760
Chunhua.

639
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,720
You've brought great news to our family.

640
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:02,200
We'll be one family soon.

641
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,800
If I had done anything that wronged you,

642
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,959
please don't take it to heart.

643
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,800
Of course.

644
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,039
Finish the ginseng soup.

645
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,639
I made it myself.

646
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,360
I was in the wrong.

647
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,479
Finish the soup,

648
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,680
consider it my sincere apology.

649
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,400
If you're not willing
to finish the soup,

650
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,200
it means you won't forgive me.

651
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,079
How will I explain to Mother?

652
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:56,760
Stop right there!

653
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,999
Where are you going?

654
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,559
Mother.

655
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:08,760
You want Hailan to raise the boys?

656
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,079
Hua will never agree with this.

657
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:13,159
Why won't you accept her?

658
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,999
Insolence!

659
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,760
Ask yourself.

660
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:19,400
Ever since she came here,

661
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,439
you've played flute every night!

662
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,079
It's not just the others,

663
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,599
even I am concerned!

664
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,680
Would you live like
those debauched young men?

665
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,400
Absurd!

666
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:32,559
Would you want to be

667
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,119
a disappointment to His Majesty?

668
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,559
You are right.

669
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,880
I will behave myself from now on.

670
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,519
However...

671
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,280
What?

672
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:45,959
Remember,

673
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,200
that woman

674
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,439
came from a peasant family.

675
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,159
She meddles with blades and sticks.

676
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,880
Whether it's her intention or not,

677
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,639
it's bad for us all

678
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,320
if she hurts someone.

679
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,720
Besides, the Princess,

680
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,079
who is your sister-in-law,
lives with us.

681
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,999
If she is hurt,

682
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,039
how will you explain to His Majesty?

683
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,119
Have you thought about that?

684
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,320
Don't forget,

685
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,519
over a decade ago,

686
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:20,119
His Majesty went through a great ordeal.

687
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:23,840
The cause was but a woman.

688
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,159
But thanks to the blessing
from our ancestors,

689
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,720
the great Empire of Qing

690
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,840
would have fallen.

691
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,400
Mother.

692
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,920
We could send her to the frontier.

693
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,519
We'll never see her again.

694
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:40,840
That should

695
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,280
be enough to tie up the loose end.

696
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,360
Don't be such a fool.

697
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,479
You are a trusted
officer of His Majesty!

698
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:52,559
Haven't you heard?

699
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,599
A loose end must be cut off.

700
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,559
As long as the boys are here,

701
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,639
she can stir up trouble for us

702
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,720
if she wills it.

703
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:07,280
And if she allies herself

704
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,559
with outsiders

705
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,800
and raids the manor,

706
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,439
how will you deal with her?

707
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,039
Kang.

708
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,200
I know this decision pains you.

709
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,720
We should focus on raising the boys.

710
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,639
We'll grant them titles and ranks.

711
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:51,479
Their mother would be glad
to see her sons find success.

712
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,639
Alright, move on.

713
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,400
After all,

714
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,320
she gave birth to your sons.

715
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,639
She deserves some credits.

716
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,039
You have my word

717
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
she'll get a proper burial.

718
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:18,840
Sister Ma!

719
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,119
