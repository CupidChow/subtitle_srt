=Episode 33=

3
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,180
(Huaquan Sect)

4
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,620
It seems

5
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,850
she's been cleansed of the poison.

6
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,130
That is great.

7
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,290
Sister Ma is going to get well soon,

8
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:00,930
am I right?

9
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,260
Don't celebrate too soon.

10
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,290
The poison is gone,

11
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,020
but her heart meridian was damaged.

12
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,050
We need you to channel your qi to her

13
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,220
and help her recover vitality.

14
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,450
That's easy.

15
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,780
I can do it now.

16
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,500
That can wait.

17
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,660
Xiaomei, prepare the medicine.

18
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,290
Yes.

19
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,890
You can channel your qi to her

20
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,890
after she's taken medicine.

21
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,060
Old Master.

22
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,290
Is the wedding gown ready?

23
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,260
Has she tried it on?

24
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,570
Guinong.

25
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,570
I've been thinking.

26
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,410
I'm still concerned.

27
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,220
Am I lacking something?

28
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,890
Tell me.

29
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,380
I'll make it up to you.

30
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,450
But promise me

31
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,570
you're never leaving me again.

32
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,690
I know you love me.

33
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,540
I appreciate your thoughtfulness.

34
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,730
Since we are going to marry each other,

35
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,260
could you promise me one thing?

36
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,010
Have I ever said no to you?

37
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,890
As you know,

38
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,290
I've hated the conflicts and
fighting in the martial arts world.

39
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,010
My father

40
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,290
once had the Cold Moon Saber forged

41
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,890
to help him rise to power.

42
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,380
But he was ambushed

43
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,850
and died in a foreign land.

44
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,780
I met Miao Renfeng
because of this blade

45
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,450
and married him.

46
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,060
Thankfully, the blade has
been hidden in a snow cave.

47
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,820
Otherwise, there would
be yet another bloodshed.

48
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,290
But I get it now.

49
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,220
As long as you're
in the martial arts world,

50
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,690
conflicts are inevitable.

51
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,220
After we are married,

52
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,340
I want both of us to leave
that life behind and lead a quiet life,

53
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,380
never to get involved again.

54
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,570
Guinong?

55
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,850
When you wanted me to come back,

56
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,220
you said you'd give up anything for me.

57
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,580
Do you not remember that?

58
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,700
I didn't think

59
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,410
your wish

60
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,290
was the same as my late father's.

61
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,540
Do you know how I got my name?

62
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,250
My father spent his
entire life in bloodshed.

63
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,340
He grew tired of the life

64
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,660
of blades and killings.

65
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,730
He used his entire life

66
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,490
to establish
the foundation for our family.

67
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,370
He wanted our future generation

68
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,810
to retreat to a peaceful farming life.

69
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,410
Does that mean

70
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,700
you agree?

71
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,810
I agree.

72
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,540
I'll go to the capital

73
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,580
and take part in the World's
Sect Leaders Gathering.

74
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,020
After that, I'll leave that life behind.

75
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,730
It can't be helped.

76
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,850
If I didn't attend it after
getting the Jade Dragon Cup,

77
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,460
the Imperial Court

78
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,930
will hold the entire
Tianlong Sect accountable.

79
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,930
I understand.

80
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,340
After your business there is done,

81
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,370
we'll get married.

82
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,900
And after we get married,

83
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,250
I'll take you to wherever you want.

84
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,020
Let me have a good look at you.

85
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,220
You look gorgeous in it.

86
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,700
Gorgeous.

87
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,490
Fei,

88
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,460
this is your second time
breaking into the manor.

89
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,340
You're a wanted fugitive in the city.

90
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,020
I only ask that you stop being so rash.

91
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,810
Yes.

92
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,540
I'll do as you say.

93
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,980
No more rash decisions.

94
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,580
You agree without hesitation,

95
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,460
but you always break
your promise in the end.

96
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,610
Well, let's do a pinky swear.

97
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,980
If I ever get too reckless

98
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,930
or too rash,

99
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,810
show your pinky finger.

100
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,780
That will remind me.

101
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,580
Very well, we'll do just that.

102
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,810
Deal.

103
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,220
Deal.

104
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,050
By the way, Lingsu.

105
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,810
There is something
I must discuss with you.

106
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,020
Fu Kang'an sent an officer

107
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,020
to confirm the headcount
for the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

108
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,580
I want you and
Ji Xiaofeng to come with me.

109
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,140
Must you attend that gathering?

110
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,170
I promised Ji Xiaofeng

111
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,140
I'd win

112
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,140
a cup for the Huaquan Sect

113
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,220
to redeem their honor.

114
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,700
Besides,

115
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,250
Feng Tiannan will
certainly show up there.

116
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,100
I can settle the score with him there.

117
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,410
But you're a wanted fugitive.

118
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,730
If you go there again,

119
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
you might not make it out.

120
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,410
I have you, a master of disguise.

121
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,780
They won't notice it.

122
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,050
Besides,

123
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,700
don't you want to learn more

124
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,140
about the heartbreak grass?

125
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,370
This is a gathering
of heroes and warriors.

126
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,220
You will find some
new information there.

127
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,020
Are these

128
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,980
your only reasons
to attend the gathering?

129
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,730
What do you mean?

130
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,610
Young Lady Yuan will be there as well,

131
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,700
right?

132
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,730
Ziyi?

133
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,610
Probably.

134
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,780
Don't you want to get some answers

135
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,900
and clear your doubts?

136
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,290
I...

137
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,580
Of course I'd want that.

138
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,780
Actually, I managed to rescue the boys

139
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,460
because Ziyi helped out.

140
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:31,930
Really?

141
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,290
How did she help?

142
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,810
She was on guard duty
at the consort's house.

143
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,140
She recognized me,

144
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,250
but she didn't expose me.

145
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,170
I ran into Princess Hejia

146
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:41,980
in the garden.

147
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,610
She was quick and smart enough
to cause a distraction.

148
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,340
That was how I got away.

149
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,540
If she'd go that far for you,

150
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,980
it means she still cares about you.

151
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,340
Ziyi is...

152
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,170
Anyway,

153
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,930
she doesn't open up to me as you do.

154
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,100
Lingsu, what's wrong?

155
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,810
It's nothing. I just need some rest.

156
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,730
Brother Hu.

157
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,930
Sister Ma finished her medicine.

158
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,100
Fei, you should check on her.

159
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,290
I'll tend to her now.

160
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,250
I'll be right back.

161
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,170
Yes.

162
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,490
(He's been so honest with me.)

163
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,890
(He doesn't keep any secrets from me.)

164
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,370
(Should I tell him my condition)

165
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,650
(to truly open up to him?)

166
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,010
Master.

167
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,100
The capital is a large city.

168
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,700
Where do I find him?

169
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,490
I know where he is.

170
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,100
Feihong has done her investigation.

171
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,490
Hu Fei now leads the Huaquan Sect.

172
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,820
He is their new leader.

173
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,010
Go at night in disguise.

174
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,490
Find a way to bring the boys back.

175
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,440
(Huaquan Sect)

176
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,610
What are you doing here?

177
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,010
There is a girl outside

178
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,220
who wants to see the chief.

179
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,340
What girl?

180
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,460
No idea.

181
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,890
She said she knew the chief.

182
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,730
Her surname is Yuan.

183
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,940
Keep watch outside the room.

184
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,610
I'll talk with her.

185
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,460
Go.

186
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,060
How did you find us here?

187
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,490
You must be Xiaomei.

188
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,700
We're not that close.

189
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,580
So, what do you want this time?

190
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Who else is here with you?

191
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,420
I came alone.

192
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,610
I'm here for an important matter.

193
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,010
If there's anything, talk to me.

194
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,980
Brother Hu is busy.

195
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,650
Xiaomei, don't be rude.

196
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,530
Sister Cheng.

197
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,650
Who knows how she finds us?

198
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,980
She must have come

199
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,650
with ill intentions.

200
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,580
What if she sees Brother Hu...

201
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,650
Gentlemen, you may
return to your room now.

202
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,220
Alright, I know what to do.

203
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,460
Keep watch outside the room.

204
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,850
Keep your eyes on Brother Hu.

205
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,460
Young Lady Yuan.

206
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,460
My brother is treating
a patient with his qi.

207
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,770
Please wait in my room.

208
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,340
Red candles moved,
peach tree leaves danced.

209
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,490
Violet dress waved,
berry tree branches reached.

210
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,180
Bai Juyi's poem

211
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,420
seems to reflect our circumstances.

212
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,420
Please have a seat.

213
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,420
To your health.

214
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,980
Thank you for
your assistance last night.

215
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,940
Assistance?

216
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,700
There is no need to hide.

217
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,820
You provided cover
for our carriage

218
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,010
and used hidden weapons

219
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,250
to stop the soldiers.

220
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,770
Did you come up with that plan?

221
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,580
Hu Fei is rash and imprudent,

222
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,220
he rarely thinks about the consequences.

223
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,580
You seem to know him very well.

224
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,610
Compared to you,

225
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,420
he and I are only acquaintances.

226
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,610
You are too humble.

227
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,850
To save my brother,

228
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,700
you climbed up the ten thousand of stairs

229
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,370
to get the medicine from Weituo Sect.

230
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,770
He often talks

231
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,100
and feels grateful about it.

232
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,940
The bond you share with him

233
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,610
is much deeper than just

234
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,490
mere acquaintances.

235
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,300
It seems...

236
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,610
he's told you

237
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,940
everything about me.

238
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,730
Indeed.

239
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,370
He is honest and candid.

240
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,890
He tells me everything.

241
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,460
But to him,

242
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,610
you're the one he cannot forget.

243
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,850
He remembers every bit of kindness.

244
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,850
When he's shown kindness,

245
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,940
he'll want to repay them tenfold.

246
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,130
But he's not a good judge of character

247
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,060
and is too sentimental

248
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,820
to tell the good from evil.

249
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,940
Indeed.

250
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,250
But fortunately,

251
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,100
he has a brilliant mind like you

252
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,580
by his side all the time.

253
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,490
He will make it through any danger.

254
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,010
I'm flattered.

255
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,700
I'm not as brilliant as you think.

256
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,340
Otherwise,

257
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,250
I could have given him answers

258
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,980
and learned what had happened
at the Guanyin temple.

259
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,130
Do you want to know why?

260
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,730
Very well.

261
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,370
I'll tell you everything.

262
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:32,770
That means...

263
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,250
Feng Tiannan is your...

264
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,890
Indeed.

265
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,060
But I will never accept it.

266
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,610
Hu Fei has hated him for months,

267
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,130
but I've hated him my entire life.

268
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,980
You should tell him about your past.

269
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,180
That will clear all the doubts.

270
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,650
But it doesn't change the fact

271
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,180
I am the daughter of that scoundrel.

272
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,940
I despise who I am.

273
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,180
I hate that
Feng Tiannan's blood flows in me.

274
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,490
So promise,

275
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,380
keep this secret for me.

276
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,420
Tell no one.

277
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,460
But it's too sad

278
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,290
for you two to part way

279
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,090
because of this.

280
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,940
It's our fate.

281
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,050
He and I

282
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,220
are not meant to be.

283
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,380
I'm more grateful for my upbringing.

284
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,090
I was raised by my master.

285
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,810
I took an oath

286
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,860
to follow her and practice
Buddhist teachings

287
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,700
to repay her kindness.

288
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,900
I am a member of the Tianshan Sect.

289
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,250
I must not get involved with him again.

290
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,330
I went to the Weituo Sect for him

291
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,770
to return the favor.

292
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,140
I'm not as selfless as you.

293
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,570
Young Lady Cheng.

294
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,770
You are kind and smart.

295
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,730
You put him before everything.

296
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,090
I can tell

297
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,700
your love for him is true.

298
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,220
From what I've seen,

299
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,530
you and Hu Fei

300
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,530
are a match made in heaven.

301
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,730
May you stay happy
and grow old together.

302
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,460
What's wrong?

303
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,660
Do not be concerned.

304
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,570
It's an old ailment.

305
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,940
You wished we could
grow old together,

306
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,460
but I doubt

307
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,940
I'll live that long.

308
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,900
As I told you,

309
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,900
Hu Fei tells me everything.

310
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
He never keeps secrets.

311
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,810
But I've been keeping a secret.

312
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,570
(I was born in Miaojiang.)

(to formulate the Nine Times
Vitality Restoring Pill.)

324
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,810
Brother Hu's love for you aside,

325
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,530
I couldn't answer his love

326
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,290
even if I wanted to.

327
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,570
It's hard to make the pills I need.

328
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,620
The stock is running low.

329
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,810
I used to live among herbs
in the Medicine King Valley.

330
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,660
I didn't need many pills,
for my life was peaceful.

331
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,700
I only needed them after I left.

332
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,770
I thought I'd never leave the valley,

333
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,090
but who knows?

334
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,980
It's been months since I left.

335
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,980
You're running low on pills.

336
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,380
How will you cope with it?

337
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,730
Sister Ma will be well

338
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,050
after a day or two.

339
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,700
After she's recovered,

340
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,660
I shall return.

341
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,220
What still worries me is my brother.

342
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,140
He's always seen me as his sister,

343
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,940
and not his lover.

344
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,380
Besides,

345
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,220
I'm sick

346
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,810
and will die soon.

347
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,140
Love is a luxury to me.

348
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,620
I know how deeply he loves you.

349
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,460
Please, reconsider.

350
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,620
Your master cares about you.

351
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,250
She will be considerate

352
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,900
and give you her blessing.

353
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,490
Enough about that.

354
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,420
Back to business.

355
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,380
I didn't come here for Hu Fei.

356
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,050
I'm here for the boys.

357
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,140
I'm from the Red Flower Club.

358
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,980
President Chen learned
the Imperial Court would hold

359
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,380
Sect Leaders Gathering in the capital

360
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,530
and the conspiracy around it.

361
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,140
It's our plan to sabotage it.

362
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,860
But the top executives
of the Red Flower Club

363
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,770
are all wanted by the Imperial Court.

364
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,180
It's impossible for them
to come and go to the city.

365
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,530
They wrote Hero Miao a letter
to request his help.

366
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,090
But something unexpected happened.

367
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,860
My master was ordered

368
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,290
to come here,

369
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,380
and went through great effort

370
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,180
to earn Official Fu's trust.

371
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,180
But my mistake cost them the boys.

372
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,900
Right now,

373
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,380
I must bring the boys back

374
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,770
to regain their trust.

375
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,010
Why didn't the Red Flower Club
ask Brother Hu for help?

376
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,530
This mission

377
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,980
is full of great risks.

378
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,570
One must endure

379
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,860
for the greater good.

380
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,180
Hu Fei is too candid

381
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,660
and never bows to evil.

382
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,490
Perhaps

383
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,460
this isn't a job for him.

384
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,460
Sister Yuan.

385
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,050
I apologize to you.

386
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,770
I didn't know

387
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,900
the matter was so complicated.

388
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,380
I was wrong about you.

389
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,620
I thought you were irrational,

390
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,770
that you came with an ill intention.

391
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,700
I lit poison candles as a precaution.

392
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,460
Given all the doubts have been cleared,

393
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,770
I must give you the antidote

394
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,730
as apology.

395
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,810
As expected from
the Medicine King Sect.

396
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,330
Your poisons come in all forms.

397
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,250
I've finally seen it

398
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,860
with my eyes.

399
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,250
My request for you

400
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,010
was indeed inappropriate.

401
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,180
If I'm to be poisoned,

402
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,730
I'll gladly accept it.

403
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,530
However,

404
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,380
how do I convince Hu Fei?

405
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,770
You need not worry.

406
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:02,860
I'll help.

407
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,700
Sister Cheng.

408
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,570
Where are you taking the boys?

409
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,660
Xiaomei, step aside.

410
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,700
Why?

411
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,420
Keep it down.

412
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,900
Do not let Brother Hu hear you.

413
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,490
No.

414
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,530
That woman is working for Fu Kang'an.

415
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,290
That's not true.

416
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,940
So what is the truth?

417
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,860
Explain yourself.

418
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,180
What if Sister Ma asks for her children?

419
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,220
How will you explain this to Brother Hu?

420
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,530
Ziyi?

421
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,490
What are you doing here?

422
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:02,900
Brother Hu.

423
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,330
She is taking the kids.

424
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,940
Why?

425
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,140
Fei,

426
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,860
let Young Lady Yuan take the boys.

427
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,660
She will bring them
back after the gathering.

428
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,770
No.

429
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,420
Give me the boys.

430
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,730
But I promised her.

431
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,380
I didn't.

432
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,290
Hu Fei.

433
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,940
This is urgent.

434
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,330
We don't have time to explain.

435
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,140
I will return the boys in five days.

436
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,810
If I break the promise...

437
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,860
You may cut me down.

438
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,220
This lady here is Uncle Hu's friend.

439
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,380
You must listen to her.

440
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,620
Remember to help her out.

441
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,490
Go on.

442
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,250
Fei, don't worry.

443
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,050
Sister Yuan won't break her promise.

444
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:01,730
Lingsu.

445
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,570
How did you two become
so close over the night?

446
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,660
Why do you defend her?

447
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,050
What did Ziyi tell you?

448
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,810
I promise her

449
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,010
I'd say nothing.

450
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,940
Not even to me?

451
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:18,900
Yes.

452
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,460
Especially you.

453
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,050
I can't disclose anything.

454
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,770
But...

455
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,380
Fei.

456
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,900
Please don't make it hard for me.

457
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,290
Just remember that

458
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,330
everyone has their unspeakable reasons.

459
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,250
It's the same for Sister Yuan.

460
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,570
My son Yiming has found the woman.

461
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,050
We'll wreak havoc tonight.

462
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,420
With the two of us working together,

463
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,090
we can accomplish anything.

464
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,620
Father, Uncle Tang.

465
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,530
If we keep watch here tonight,

466
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,700
we will catch her.

467
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,380
Well done.

468
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,420
If we catch her,

469
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,770
it's a great feat.

470
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,810
Everyone, stay alert!

471
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:40,490
Tonight is the night
you make a name for yourselves!

472
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,050
Yes!

473
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,290
Ziyi.

474
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,700
What's wrong?

475
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,330
Are you upset I didn't
tell you about Hu Fei?

476
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,250
I didn't mean to.

477
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,330
Master wouldn't let me tell you.

478
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,330
I can still make it up to you.

479
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,460
As soon as I learn anything about him,

480
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,700
you'll be the first to know.

481
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,730
Never mind.

482
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,730
I get it.

483
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,530
Do you want to know

484
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,330
who the girl by his side is?

485
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,180
Don't worry, leave it to me.

486
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,330
I'll find everything to know about her.

487
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,570
Enough.

488
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:35,980
It's not that.

489
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,090
It's not my fault?

490
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,900
Is it because of Hu Fei?

491
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,530
By the way, I forgot to ask.

492
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,140
How did you explain to him

493
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,380
when you went to their manor?

494
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,570
He really trusts you.

495
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,620
You asked for the kids
and he just handed them over.

496
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,770
Alright.

497
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,460
Focus on driving.

498
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,770
Pull over.

499
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,620
Come with me.

500
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,050
You are working together.

501
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,250
Chief Feng.

502
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,770
It's our lucky night.

503
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,460
Take them down!

504
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,730
Hide inside.

505
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
Yiming!

506
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,140
Ziyi, keep the boys safe.

507
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,700
Go!

508
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,420
Yiming!

509
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,490
Yiming!

510
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:24,860
Catch her!

511
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,460
Feihong.

512
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,090
Go now.

513
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,490
My son...

514
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,940
My son!

515
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:48,860
Master.

516
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,180
Feihong has been captured.

517
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,770
Tie her up!

518
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,210
Hold on.

519
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,380
Who is she?

520
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,940
Where did you get her?

521
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,650
Officers.

522
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,610
This woman

523
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,340
is responsible for
kidnapping the little princes.

524
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,300
She's the culprit.

525
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,260
Stay still!

526
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,690
Great. Wonderful.

527
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:30,090
Brother Tang, Chief Feng, well done.

528
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,420
I'll take her to Official Fu now.

529
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,090
Hold on.

530
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:35,900
Wait.

531
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,090
Well...

532
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,650
After the last attack,

533
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,050
Official Fu scolded me
and blamed me for everything.

534
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,860
If she gets away,

535
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,260
or anything goes wrong,

536
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,090
I could lose everything.

537
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,260
What is the meaning of this?

538
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,610
Don't you trust the guards?

539
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,260
No, misunderstood.

540
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,010
My son died because of her!

541
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,980
I must take her
to Official Fu personally.

542
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,050
In that case...

543
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,490
Come in.

544
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,380
Let's go.

545
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,300
Move.

546
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,610
Tiejiao.

547
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,380
If that girl is connected to Hu Fei,

548
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,820
we'll be in danger.

549
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,530
Don't be so paranoid.

550
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,900
Greetings, sirs.

551
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,610
You did great, brothers.

552
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:34,820
Yes.

553
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,260
Brothers,

554
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,130
the girl we met

555
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,130
at Brother Hu's place

556
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,610
wasn't her.

557
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,900
Don't be silly.

558
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,090
They are clearly working together.

559
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,340
If she tells Official Fu

560
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,050
we'd helped Hu Fei,

561
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,300
we'll be in deep trouble.

562
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,340
We can't trust her to keep the secret.

563
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,210
So, what do we do now, Tiejiao?

564
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,010
I noticed the look in her eyes.

565
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,090
When she saw us,

566
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,460
we were strangers to her.

567
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,170
Even if she was working for Hu Fei,

568
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,530
she couldn't testify against us.

569
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,610
But what if...

570
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,900
Don't be so paranoid.

571
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,010
I've thought it through.

572
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:17,210
Each of us
contacted Hu Fei individually.

573
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,420
As long as Hu Fei is safe,

574
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,490
we are safe.

575
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,530
Go.

576
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,130
Let's meet Official Fu.

577
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,300
Official Fu.

578
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,690
Chief Tang and Chief Feng
want to see you.

579
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,090
It's about the boys.

580
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,980
Bring them here.

581
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:43,860
Yes.

582
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:52,690
Your Honor.

583
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,340
Where are the kids?

584
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,690
I apologize.

585
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,090
I saw the boys,

586
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,570
but I couldn't save them.

587
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,900
I only managed to catch this woman.

588
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,490
Kneel!

589
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,490
Kneel!

590
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,380
She is the All-Knowing Nun's disciple.

591
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,170
Your Honor.

592
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,820
My son Yiming died trying to save

593
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,210
the two little princes.

594
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,130
My son deserves justice!

595
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,860
Your Honor, please send the order

596
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,300
to raid chief accommodation

597
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,570
and arrest the Nun

598
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,010
and her other disciple.

599
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,170
Guards!

600
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,130
My little princes, don't be afraid.

601
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,570
Protect Official Fu!

602
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,740
Come to me, my sons.

603
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,420
Let me take a look at you.

604
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,610
Are you hurt?

605
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,690
No.

606
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,780
Amitabha.

607
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,300
The two boys were rescued

608
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,420
and fortunate to survive the attack.

609
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,130
Your Honor.

610
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,610
Take them to the room.

611
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,530
Take good care of them.

612
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,530
Yes.

613
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:01,900
Venerable.

614
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,420
Please stay.

615
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,900
I have something to say.
