00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,660
Ziyi,

4
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,370
don't get mad.

5
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,370
Ziyi,

6
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,890
actually,

7
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,050
I didn't mean to make you mad.

8
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,410
I always wanted to make you happy.

9
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,780
But I don't know why.

10
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,810
I always screwed things up in the end.

11
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,730
Don't bear grudges against me.

12
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,220
Forgive me,

13
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,730
okay?

14
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,730
You know what?

15
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,900
There's one thing
that I really want to do.

16
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,130
But I've been afraid to do it.

17
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,250
I bought you a small comb.

18
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,090
But I have no idea

19
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,530
how to give it to you.

20
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,780
I know

21
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,500
you're thin-skinned.

22
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,530
If I just give it to you,

23
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,580
I'm sure you won't accept it.

24
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,170
How about this?

25
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,530
I'll leave this comb next to your pillow

26
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,020
tonight.

27
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,890
If you wear it on your head tomorrow,

28
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,610
it means

29
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,370
that you have this feelings too.

30
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,420
If...

31
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,610
If you don't wear it,

32
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,860
just forget about everything
I've said tonight.

33
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,660
What do you think?

34
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,170
Ziyi,

35
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,300
I'm coming over.

36
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,540
Ziyi,

37
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,820
I know that you're not asleep.

38
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,140
I'll leave the comb here.

39
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,420
Someone is here.

40
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,380
Put off the fire.

41
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,100
Old Master Feng,

42
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,420
we follow your instruction
along the way.

43
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,420
We take a break

44
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,610
in the wild instead of an inn.

45
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,730
It's raining heavily now.

46
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,020
There's an abandoned temple.

47
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,610
Why don't we go in there
to avoid the rain?

48
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,700
It won't be too late
to continue our trip afterwards.

49
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,490
Zhiguo, bring our men in
to check it out.

50
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,580
Yes.

51
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,100
Old Master is very prudent.

52
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,450
How could anyone possibly stay

53
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,050
in an abandoned temple like this?

54
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,020
Better safe than sorry.

55
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,770
Let's go in there and check it out.

56
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,700
Let's go, that way.

57
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,260
Master,

58
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,330
are you alright?

59
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,330
I'm alright.

60
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,530
Master,

61
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,380
just let our brothers come in
and avoid the rain.

62
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,940
Okay.

63
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,090
You guard here.

64
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,850
I'll go and tell them.

65
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:20,940
Yes.

66
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,210
Old Master Feng.

67
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,580
Old Master Feng.

68
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,890
We've checked it.

69
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,650
There's no one inside.

70
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,890
Good.

71
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,380
Brothers,

72
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,580
let's go in and get some rest.

73
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,580
Eat up, brothers.

74
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,090
So that we can continue our trip.

75
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,850
Old Master Feng,

76
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,650
do we still have to get going
as it's raining hard?

77
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,700
We need to keep moving
no matter how heavy the rain is.

78
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,090
This place is near to the main road.

79
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,260
We can't lose our lives

80
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,940
just because of a momentary comfort.

81
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,260
Feng Tiannan!

82
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,290
Hu Fei.

83
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,090
Father.

84
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,580
Hero.

85
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,970
Hero!

86
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,410
Everything

87
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,450
is my fault.

88
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,330
Do as you wish with me.

89
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,180
I beg of you.

90
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,940
Spare my son's life.

91
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,060
He's the only heir of Feng Family.

92
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,410
I beg of you.

93
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,410
Let him go.

94
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,580
Father,

95
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,820
if you die,

96
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,140
I'll never live on.

97
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,940
What nonsense are you talking about?

98
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,090
Father.

99
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,740
Hero.

100
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,180
I beg of you.

101
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,620
Let this kid live.

102
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,620
I beg of you.

103
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,210
I...

104
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,380
Father! Father!

105
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,970
Spare his life?

106
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,380
Did you spare Zhong Asi's family
back then?

107
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,820
Did Mrs. Zhong cry to you

108
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,890
like this before?

109
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,770
Did you spare her kids' lives?

110
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,820
San and Er were younger
than Feng Yiming.

111
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,330
They were innocent.

112
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,260
Did you give them a chance?

113
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,450
Hero.

114
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,820
It's me, Feng Tiannan,

115
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,770
who's done wrong to Zhong Asi's family.

116
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,740
Today,

117
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,580
today, I'll kill myself.

118
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,140
So that I won't see
my son die before me.

119
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,020
It will make me even more upset.

120
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,820
Father, what are you talking about? Father!

121
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,090
Hero!

122
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,450
I beg you.

123
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,570
Bodhisattva!

124
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,460
I beg of you.

125
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,860
Let my son live.

126
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,020
Son.

127
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,740
I...

128
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,530
I'll leave first.

129
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,770
Ziyi, what are you doing?

130
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,930
It's inappropriate to kill

131
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,980
someone in the temple.

132
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,860
Get out now!

133
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,930
Let's go, Father.

134
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,020
Let's go.

135
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,770
Why did you stop me?

136
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,100
Why can't you let them go?

137
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,410
I got to avenge Fourth Uncle Zhong.

138
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,560
(Guanyin Temple)

139
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,140
You're getting serious.

140
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,050
Why is that?

141
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,220
I have my own reasons.

142
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,690
You're being unreasonable!

143
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,410
That's right.

144
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,810
This is who I am.

145
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,500
Now that you've seen my true colours.

146
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,860
Ziyi!

147
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,020
Let's get things straight

148
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,410
before you leave.

149
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,740
I'm not as good as you think.

150
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,620
This is who I am.

151
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,620
I was going to leave
after you fell asleep.

152
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,260
My master said

153
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,690
that God has been watching.

154
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,930
Everything is written in the stars.

155
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,620
I finally understand it now.

156
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,890
The current situation

157
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,460
is a result of my karma.

158
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,810
Hu Fei,

159
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,530
from now on,

160
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,810
we're even.

161
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,890
I'll have nothing more to do with you.

162
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,530
Ziyi!

163
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,890
Chief, I'm sorry for your loss.

164
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,690
The monks are reciting
Mantra of Rebirth-in-Pureland

165
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,140
for the salvation of the child's soul.

166

You've been up all night.

We could've been the leader

Unfortunately, the former chiefs always

234

played safe, preserved it
and maintained the status quo.

many apprentices here.

The former chief, Senior Lv Xixian,

personally left the chair to me.

to carry forward the Taiji Sect
before everything.

It's my unlucky day.

276
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,610
I failed miserably in an easy task.

278
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,570

I'm the only one who knows

282

why you hate Miao Renfeng so much.

283
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,130
It's just like

284
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,050
how much I hate my senior.

285
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,260
Over 30 years ago,
I was expelled from the sect.

286
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,740
Then, I was being chased by Senior
along the way.

287
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,810
I was nearly killed.

288
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,570
It was you who rescued me.

289
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,260
So that I could be
at this remote place...

290
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,290
If you remember it, just cut the crap.

291
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,180
I'll help you for sure.

292
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,940
But you have to remember this.

293
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,090
Don't treat me as a dog you're keeping.

294
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,770
This time,

295
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,220

296
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,810
I remember you once said

297
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,530
that you're studying a thing which calls

298
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,020
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis.

299
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,050
It can kill someone silently.

300
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,220
It's been years.

301
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,660
I've given you

302
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,770
so much money all these years.

303
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,050
With all those money,

304
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,850
you should get it by now.

305
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,260
Follow me, Chief Tian.

306
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,260
Come with me.

307
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,370
Let's go.

308
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,660
This is
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis.

309
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,290
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis is
the darkest thing.

310
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,980
It can only germinate

311
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,940
in a dark place like this.

312
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:36,940
Germinate?

313
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,570
Are you blind?

314
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,370
Or am I blind?

315
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,460
None of them germinates.

316
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,570
What have you been doing
all these years?

317
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,330
My master happened to obtain the seed

318
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,700
of Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis
from foreign country.

319
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,130
After years of study,

320
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,940
he still couldn't cultivate it.

321
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,940
Recently, I've found

322
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,130
that only watering it
with the fluid of the rotten body

323
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,460
can lead to its proper growth.

324
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,370
To be honest with you.

325
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,130
I abandon my home and business

326
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,660
and come to the North
just to seek for a safety place.

327
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,130
But that brat just won't give up.

328
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,740
He's been tailing me along the way.

329
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,810
That's why we're in bit of a mess.

330
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,810
I really want to know

331
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,530
what kind of a guy

332
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,530
could corner you like this.

333
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,260
Brother Chen,

334
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,570
I don't want to talk about this.

335
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,260
To prevent causing you any troubles.

336
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,090
Brother Chen,

337
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,180
prepare me some money

338
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,090
that we used in the business transaction

339
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,330
back then.

340
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,460
I'm in urgent need
for this trip to the North.

341
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,740
Sure.

342
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,770
I'll have someone arrange it.

343
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,420
Thank you, Brother Chen.

344
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,610
Okay.

345
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,980
Brother Chen,

346
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,130
please take care of Zhiguo.

347
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,660
I'll treat him like my brother
as he's your buddy.

348
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,770
It's my job.

349
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,610
Okay.

350
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,770
Zhiguo, you stay here and get better.

351
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,090
Wait for my word.

352
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,850
Take care, Old Master Feng.

353
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,220
Old Master Feng, Yiming,

354
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,610
have a safe trip.

355
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,290
I'll see you at the capital.

356
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,020
See you again.

357
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,770
Let's go, Father.

358
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,740
Brother Zhiguo,

359
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,850
take care of the people for me.

360
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,180
Yes.

361
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I can't believe

362
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:56,660
that Feng Tiannan

363
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,370
actually abandons his home and business

364
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,290
because of a brat who comes from nowhere.

365
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,770
If this gets out,

366
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,740
it'll become a joke
in the martial arts world.

367
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,660
Feng Tiannan's reputation

368
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,810
in the martial arts world is
totally ruined this time.

369
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,050
Yes.

370
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,460
Whatever he does now,

371
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,130
it'll be a charity case.

372
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,020
No matter how terrible Feng Tiannan is,

373
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,500
you two are in no position
to look down upon him.

374
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,530
-Yes.
-Yes.

375
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,740
The influence of a powerful man lingers
after his downfall.

376
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,460
Let alone

377
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,900
he's been in Foshan for years.

378
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,850
He's well-connected
in the martial arts world.

379
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,700
Buddy,

380
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,090
this place is so lively.

381
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,020
Is there something going on?

382
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,020
Our new sect leader,
Chief Chen has thrown

383
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,090
a banquet for three days.

384
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,460
He invited the martial arts people
and the citizens over.

385
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
I see.

386
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,090
By the way, Buddy,

387
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,330
have you seen a lady

388
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,810
dressed in purple clothes?

389
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,900
There are many martial arts people
here today.

390
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,370
You can go in there and find her.

391
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:06,740
Thank you.

392
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,810
Come.

393
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,330
Take care of his horse.

394
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,050
Come.

395
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:11,980
Thank you, Buddy.

396
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,500
He's coming.

397
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,500
He's coming.

398
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,570
Who's coming?

399
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,260
That brat who went
after Old Master Feng.

400
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,130
It's a chance for us
to avenge Old Master Feng.

401
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,460
I'll deal with him.

402
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,660
Listen to my instruction.

403
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:30,660
Yes.

404
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,660
Young Hero,

405
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,290
please take a seat here.

406
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,130
Thank you.

407
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,020
Hello.

408
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,500
Congratulations, Chief Chen!

409
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,420
Thank you.

410
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,370
Thank you for coming.

411
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,420
Congratulations, Chief Chen.

412
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,090
Thank you, guys. Thanks for coming.

413
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,740
Congratulations, Chief Chen.

414
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,570
Thank you. Come, this way, please.

415
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,810
Thank you.

416
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,770
Thank you.

417
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,770
Congratulations, Chief Chen.

418
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,420
Thank you, guys.

419
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,700
Young Hero.

420
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,050
I am Chen Yu.

421
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,220
May I ask

422
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,220
why you're sitting here?

423
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,420
Thanks for your treat, Chief Chen.

424
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,460
I'm looking for a lost friend.

425
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,610
And I happen to pass through here.

426
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,610
Sorry to trouble you.

427
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,610
Young Hero,

428
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,460
take things as they come.

429
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,220
We got

430
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,420
a double celebration today.

431
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,610
The banquet

432
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,530
out here is for the citizens.

433
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,660
The martial arts people are
all in there.

434
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,530
Laifei.

435
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:36,900
Yes.

436
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,130
-Quickly take him inside.
-Please.

437
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,130
It's not necessary, Chief Chen.

438
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,610
I got to find my friend.

439
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,810
I'll excuse myself.

440
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,290
There's a saying, making an appointment
is not as good as meeting by chance.

441
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,850
If you respect our Taiji Sect,

442
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,770
please do me a favour

443
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,290
and have a drink at the head table.

444
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,980
I'll feel highly honoured.

445
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,570
Well, if you insist.

446
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,610
Please.

447
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,330
Please.

448
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,050
Come, Young Hero. This way, please.

449
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,700
Buddy,

450
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,220
is it just me alone in this room?

451
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,180
I think it's inappropriate.

452
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,130
Young Hero, don't worry.

453
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,700
There will be more people coming.

454
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,740
The seats will be filled soon.

455
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,770
Besides, our Chief Chen

456
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,660
will come and accompany you.

457
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,020
Here, please take a seat.

458
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,090
Buddy,

459
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,810
have you seen a lady

460
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,980
dressed in purple clothes

461
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,610
with a silver whip in her belt?

462
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,330
Calm down, Young Hero.

463
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,900
I'll help you find her

464
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,770
when I go out to toast later.

465
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,330
I'll tell you if I find her.

466
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,260
Come, have a cup of tea.

467
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,610
Back then,

468
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,180
Senior and I learned
martial arts together.

469
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,570
There was one night,

470
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,420
when Master talked

471
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,980
about the most poisonous thing
in the world.

472
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,290
Things like Arsenic
and the Peacock's Gallbladder

473
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,220
are not the most poisonous ones.

474
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,740
The scariest one is
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis.

475
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,330
Master said

476
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,220
the root, stem, flower and leaf
of Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis

477
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,810
are incredibly poisonous.

478
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,420
After refining it,

479
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,330
it'll become colourless, odorless
and leave no trace.

480
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,050
No matter how smart the person is,

481
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,980
he won't be able to guard against it.

482
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,130
He'll be poisoned without knowing it.

483
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,700
He even sighed

484
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,370
that luckily, it was hard to cultivate
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis.

485
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,500
Or else

486
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,420
the nation would hardly be at peace.

487
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,500
Is someone there?

488
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,290
Quickly let me out!

489
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:40,900
Who are you?

490
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,020
Why do you plot against me?

491
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,940
Save it, brat.

492
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,810
No one will bother you
even if you scream.

493
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,370
He's just an ordinary guy.

494
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,370
Feng Tiannan is getting old.

495
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,420
Feng Tiannan?

496
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,180
Jerk!

497
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,130
Just come and fight me
if you have the capability!

498
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,290
Playing dirty is not
what a man should do!

499
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,460
Say something!

500
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,370
Master,

501
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,940
what should we do with this brat?

502
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,220
He can't get out, anyway.

503
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,090
Just let him stay in there.

504
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,690
Who are you?

505
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,820
(Taiji Sect, Uncle Sun Gangfeng)

506
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,020
Why do you

507
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,300
get locked up by Chen Yu?

508
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:11,980
My name is Hu Fei.

509
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,730
The people of Taiji Sect
and Feng Tiannan join hands

510
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,500
to set me up.

511
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,780
I've fallen into their trap.

512
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,860
That's why I'm here.

513
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,610
So you're not an apprentice
of Taiji Sect.

514
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:24,940
I'm not.

515
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,570
Thank you.

516
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,090
It looks like

517
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,500
you've been locked up in here
for quite some time.

518
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,210
May I ask what your name is?

519
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,940
Why were you locked up in here?

520
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,340
I am Sun Gangfeng.

521
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,570
Chen Yu, who'll soon be the sect leader,

522
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,570
is my martial nephew.

523
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,820
Was it because you disagreed
with him being the sect leader,

524
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,380
that's why he locked you down here?

525
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,250
It's unbelievably hard

526
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,210
to get out once you're here.

527
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,420
Senior,

528
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,530
since you're from Taiji Sect,

529
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,460
you must know the way out.

530
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,820
So what if I know it?

531
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,130
Look at me.

532
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,090
You can teach me if you know the way.

533
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,900
I can get you

534
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,570
out from here when I learn it.

535
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,530
How could it be as easy as you think?

536
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,940
Even so, we still got to do something.

537
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,130
Senior,

538
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,500
based on the current situation,

539
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,300
all we can do is
to try every possible means.

540
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,130
We can't just sit by and wait to die.

541
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,460
Fine.

542
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,210
Come with me.

543
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,250
Okay.
