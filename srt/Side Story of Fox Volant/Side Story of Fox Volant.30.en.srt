00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:50,880
Help!

4
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,240
Help me.

5
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,520
Are you all right? What happened?

6
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:56,880
There's an assassin.

7
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,720
Take me to the Commander.

8
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,680
Come on.

9
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,959
Who is there? Stop!

10
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,159
Go after them!

11
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:16,599
Come on.

12
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,160
Ziyi,

13
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,840
something is going on
at the king's residence.

14
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,200
Go and find out what's going on.

15
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,599
Yes, Master.

16
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,840
The sounds

17
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,279
seem to have come
from the king's residence.

18
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,600
Go and find out

19
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:56,239
what on earth is going on.

20
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:57,400
Yes, my lord.

21
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,999
Official Fu.

22
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,040
Official Fu, Madam has gone missing.

23
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,760
What a useless bunch.

24
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:13,400
Official Fu!

25
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,400
Official Fu!

26
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,799
Official Fu, Hu killed a few
of our personal guards

27
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:19,879
and escaped.

28
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,840
Pass on my order.

29
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,600
Hu Fei trespassed the king's residence

30
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,079
with a malicious intention.

31
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:31,639
Send someone
to take him down immediately.

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,480
Yes, Official Fu.

33
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,000
Catch them all! Don't let them get away!

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,559
Yes!

35
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,480
Chase after them!

36
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,359
Officials,

37
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:09,720
Official Fu has passed an order.

38
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,519
Hu Fei trespassed the king's residence
with a malicious intention.

39
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,079
Please search the whole city now.

40
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,160
Whoever catches him
will be rewarded substantially.

41
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,359
Brother Hu made a great contribution
for protecting Young Lady Ma.

42
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,920
Young Lady Ma's honor increases
as her sons' position rises.

43
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,359
Brother Hu should have received
high regard from Official Fu instead.

44
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:43,079
Why did such a thing
happen all of a sudden?

45
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,359
As the saying goes,

46
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,839
"a wife of nobility will be engulfed
in the family politics."

47
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,079
Young Lady Ma
is from the martial arts world.

48
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,160
How will she see through the veil

49
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,239
and the plot?

50
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,359
Even if she's favored by the Commander,

51
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,720
it's still useless.

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,600
Even the Commander
can't call the shot in certain matters.

53
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,839
Just like how it's like

54
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,359
in the officialdom.

55
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,639
Speak less.

56
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,799
Just fulfilling your duty will do.

57
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,280
But where can

58
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,880
Brother Hu escape to?

59
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,720
Do you even need to ask?

60
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,079
Others might not know it, but we do.

61
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,720
Shut up.

62
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
She is poisoned.

63
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,239
She seems to be dying.

64
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,000
Fei, what happened?

65
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,880
It was Fu Kang'an's

66
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,880
vicious mother

67
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,359
who plotted to take Sister Ma's sons away

68
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,440
and poisoned her.

69
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,679
Her life is hanging by a thread.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,920
The poison is too potent.

71
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,440
Sister Cheng,

72
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,359
didn't you have the Seven Pistil
Chaenomeles sinensis?

73
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,840
Let her take it.

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,160
Without knowing about the poison,

75
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,199
how can I simply prescribe it to her?

76
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,199
By the way,

77
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,119
this is the spoon Sister Ma used
when she was poisoned.

78
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,520
It's Arsenic

79
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,199
and strychnine.

80
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,960
This medicinal pill

81
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,520
can protect her life for two hours.

82
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,040
I'll perform acupuncture
on her immediately.

83
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,239
But in the next 24 hours,

84
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,679
we must not move her body.

85
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,160
Otherwise, her veins will be damaged.

86
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:24,640
We can't save her then.

87
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,920
Okay.

Let's move!

97
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:09,879
We can't find them.

98
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Brother Zhou, we can't find them.

99
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,119
We only found a few servants,

100
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:12,920
but they are clueless.

101
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,080
We've searched the wing

102
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,999
and caught the steward.

103
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,480
He also has no idea
where Hu Fei has gone to.

104
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:20,400
Where are the two young ladies
with Hu Fei?

105
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,879
I found that the lights in their wing

106
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,920
are lit.

107
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,999
There is a pot of warm tea.

108
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:24,759
I guess they didn't go far.

109
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,080
Official Fu has ordered
to seal off the capital!

110
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,119
They can't get far in the capital!

111
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:34,520
Search in the capital!

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,239

Tonight, the Huaquan Sect

will elect the Sect Leader
through a martial arts contest.

116
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,080
We must find a way

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,239
to ensure the position
falls into our Tian Branch's hands.

I'm sure he'll win the fight tonight.

That's right.

(Huaquan Sect, Ji Xiaofeng)
All right, everyone.

128
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:13,640
Despite the martial arts contest
to elect the Sect Leader,

129
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,520
we mustn't strive to outshine others.

130
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,400
The five branches of the Huaquan Sect
are of the same sect

and spirit.

132
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,559
Unfortunately, none of the branches
accepts the others.

133
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,679
Whether they're fighting openly
or secretly, each has suffered losses.

134
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,840
What a disappointment.

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,960
Tonight, I, Ji Xiaofeng,

136
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,960
am willing to come forward
to compete for the Sect Leader position.

00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:36,239
I only hope

138
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:38,280
that with a leader now,

139
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,720
there won't be any infighting again.

140
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,199
Senior, tell us what to do today.

141
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:45,280
We're all at your command.

We're all at your command.

Okay.

145
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,160
When the martial arts contest begins,

146
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:51,999
each of you will take a turn
to challenge on the stage.

147
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,920
When I ascertain the strengths
and weaknesses of the other four,

148
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,040
I'll go on stage to fight.

149
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,799
This is to ensure nothing goes wrong.

150
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,960
That's a good idea.

Even if I hide,

I still risk being discovered.

157
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,160
Covering my face will be safer.

158
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,199
Stop.

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,239
and is resting at home.

169
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,840
I'm helping my father now.

170
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,119
All right. Don't be such a nag.

171
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,239
Have you seen him?

172
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,600
Him?

173
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:57,239
I recall it now.

174
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,280
Someone was running over there just now.

175
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,439
Chase after him!

176
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:16,120
Xiaomei.

177
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,199
I've found

178
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,120
that the capital is full of guards.

179
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,880
The imperial guards
from the Commander's Residence

180
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:24,000
are patrolling the city.

181
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:25,920
They have sealed off the city gate.

182
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,160
Fu Kang'an actually mobilizes the army

183
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,520
to catch me.

184
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,880
If we keep hiding like this,

185
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,959
we'll be caught sooner or later.

186
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,700
(Huaquan Sect)

187
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:38,079
I have an idea.

188
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
Look over there.

189
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,439
The capital's guards flatter
the superior but trample the commoners.

190
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,319
(Huaquan Sect)
They may be saying to search city-wide.

191
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,760
But they act perfunctory when coming
across the wealthy and powerful.

192
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:47,360
Why don't we hide in there?

193
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,199
Okay.

194
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,240
Let's go.

195
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:03,120
Come on.

196
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,520
You guys hide here.

197
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,679
I'll go out and check the situation.

198
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,319
Okay.

199
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,160
You all go on the stage
and focus on the contest.

200
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:21,240
I'll hide here.

201
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,520
I can see
the situation clearly from here.

202
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,599
I'll definitely show up
when the time comes.

203
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,439
Go on.

204
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,120
Who is he?

205
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:47,959
Don't bother about him first.

206
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,839
I'll look for a secluded room

207
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,040
where we can hide for 24 hours.

208
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,079
Let's save Sister Chunhua first.

209
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,640
Time is running out. Hurry up.

210
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,319
Okay.

211
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,400
Sister Cheng,

212
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,599
could this be the theater?

213
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,920
Are they holding
a stage performance tonight?

214
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,319
They didn't wear makeup
and performance costumes.

215
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:14,439
It doesn't look like a performance.

216
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,640
Fei,

217
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,679
there is a crowd out there.

218
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,799
You'll be discovered if you step out.

219
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,439
What to do now?

220
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,839
Let's observe first.

221
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,199
The 48 styles of Huaquan

222
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,920
are divided into Yi, Cheng,
Xing, Tian, and Ya.

223
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,120
Since Huaquan Sect's establishment
300 years ago,

224
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,959
we have accepted many disciples.

225
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:46,400
What our ancestors handed down
to us is not something obscure.

226
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,599
But our reputation is incomparable

227
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,160
to the Shaolin, Wudang,
Taiji, and Bagua Sects.

228
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,079
Why so?

229
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,000
It's because

230
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,959
we've always been divided

231
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,880
into the five branches
of Yi, Cheng, Xing, Tian, and Ya.

232
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,640
We have been without
a Chief Sect Leader for 300 years.

233
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,839
Tonight,

234
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,719
we'll elect our Sect Leader right here

235
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,240
to lead us in the upcoming gathering.

236
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,880
You two,

237
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:18,520
go that way!

238
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,760
Hurry up!

239
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,319
Two of you, search over there!

240
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,640
Search thoroughly!

241
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,040
Look carefully!

242
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,719
Yes, Official!

243
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:30,880
I'll announce it beforehand.

244
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,240
The most powerful martial arts expert

245
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:36,000
will be elected as our Sect Leader.

246
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,839
Regardless of which branch

247
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,760
the elected Sect Leader is from,

248
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,400
everyone must obey his command.

249
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,360
If you disagree and stir up trouble,

250
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,640
you'll be breaking
the Huaquan Sect's rules.

251
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,679
We, the disciples of Yi Branch,

252
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,599
are at the Sect Leader's command.

253
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,599
We have no comment.

254
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:57,240
Great!

255
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,319
We're on an official business!
Open the door!

256
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,400
Yes, Official.

257
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,719
It turns out that tonight,

258
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,319
the Huaquan Sect will be electing
their Sect Leader here.

259
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,520
They will be fighting
against each other.

260
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,000
I wonder how long it will take.

261
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,679
We can't keep waiting here.

262
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,520
While they're electing
their Sect Leader,

263
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,920
I'll snoop around.

264
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,360
We're on an official business!
Everyone, please stay still!

265
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:54,120
What are you all doing here
in the middle of the night?

266
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:57,599
Official,

267
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,719
those who gather here tonight

268
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,120
are the disciples of the Huaquan Sect.

269
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,599
We're holding a martial arts contest
to elect our Sect Leader.

270
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,439
May I know what kind of
official business you're conducting?

271
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,079
I see. So, you're holding
a martial arts contest here.

272
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,319
I apologize for the interruption.

273
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,479
I'm hunting down a fugitive
under Official Fu's command.

274
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,000
All the places in the capital
will not be spared.

275
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,959
Please forgive me.

276
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,079
Since you're on an official business,

277
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,520
we, the Huaquan Sect,
will give our cooperation.

278
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,120
Go ahead.

279
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,439
Split up and search!

280
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,719
Please speed up!

281
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
- Yes, Official!
- Yes, Official!

282
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,719
What should we do now?

283
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,000
Will they search here too?

284
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,640
They're indeed coming here.

285
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,319
We can only blame it on our bad luck.

286
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't worry, Fei.

287
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,839
Man proposes, God disposes.

288
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,000
If we can't escape,

289
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,839
we can die together.
What have we got to lose?

290
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,000
All right.

291
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,160
It will be over
in the blink of an eye anyway.

292
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,240
Why are you so nervous?

293
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,120
Are you a fugitive too?

294
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,679
Why are you staring at me?

295
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,959
I'm telling you now.

296
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,640
You'd better be nice to me.

297
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:30,079
If we end up in the Neatherworld
and meet Yama,

298
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,439
you'll be our companion.

299
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:38,679
Official Zhou,

300
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:39,640
no fugitive is found.

301
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,880
Official Zhou,

302
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:43,360
we've searched the mansion.

303
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,640
There's nothing suspicious.

304
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,559
Official, please forgive us.

305
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,319
We've been waiting

306
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,719
for a long time for tonight.

307
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,520
We've been hoping to elect
our Sect Leader sooner.

308
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,760
We don't want to be
a laughingstock anymore.

309
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,679
Sorry for the disturbance.

310
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,000
Since we can't find him here,

311
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,439
we'll search elsewhere.

312
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,280
Yes, Official.

313
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,599
They're leaving.

314
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,640
Since they've searched this place,

315
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,479
they won't come here again.

316
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,199
This is the safest place now.

317
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,280
Something went wrong, Ziyi.

318
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,799
Ziyi,

319
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,400
is the person in this painting

320
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,400
the same person who chased you
on the street that day?

321
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,520
Where did you get this from?

322
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,839
The guards are all over
the streets in search of him now.

323
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,920
It seemed that a unit of guards

324
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,120
caught someone just now.

325
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,719
Where are you going, Ziyi?

326
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,679
Calm down. I'm just kidding you.

327
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,520
The guards are indeed hunting him down.

328
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,920
But they didn't manage to catch him yet.

329
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,199
Now, you can't deny

330
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,679
your relationship with this brat.

331
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,360
Ziyi, please tell me the truth.

332
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,479
What's going on
between you and the brat?

333
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,000
Is it unrequited love?

334
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,799
Or you two secretly vowed
to marry each other?

335
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,799
Nonsense.

336
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,839
Since you remain tight-lipped,
forget it then.

337
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,760
I had gone to the inn

338
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,360
and snooped around for you.

339
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:28,799
It seems that you're disinterested.

340
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:30,760
What did you find?

341
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,439
Aren't you unrelated to him?

342
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,400
Why do you want to know it for?

343
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:34,880
Stop keeping me in suspense.

344
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,880
Tell me quickly.

345
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,799
I'm more honest than you.

346
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,679
But I found out something.

347
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,320
Do you remember

348
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,999
the young lady staying beside that brat?

349
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,719
They address each other

350
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,320
as Eldest Brother and Second Sister.

351
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,039
They're indeed siblings.

352
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,320
They're not in a love relationship.

353
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,279
I reckon

354
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,959
he still longs for you.

355
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,360
He may not be in love with her,

356
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,039
but it doesn't mean
she's not in love with him.

357
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,160
Senior,

358
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,759
since you understand this,

359
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:04,279
why do you still avoid him then?

360
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,800
That young lady indeed treats him well.

361
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:09,160
Aren't you worried
that he changes his mind?

362
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:13,320
We only vowed to live and die together.

363
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,800
We have no other vows.

364
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,719
So, a change of heart is invalid.

365
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,160
You may deceive others but not yourself.

366
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,120
I'll be honest with you, Ziyi.

367
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,999
When I met you this time around,

368
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:24,959
I realized you've changed.

369
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,120
You've been worrying all day.

370
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,959
It must be because of him.

371
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,759
I can see

372
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,320
that both of you like each other.

373
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,719
Well, you should tell him about it.

374
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,439
As the disciples of the Tianshan Sect,

375
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,320
we shouldn't think about
love relationships.

376
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:45,519
In that case,

377
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:48,039
that young lady
will eventually win his heart.

378
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,759
Isn't it good that there's someone
who treats him well?

379
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,959
When this is over,

380
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,679
I can return to Tianshan
with Master with peace of mind.

381
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,239
Ziyi,

382
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,800
can you still return
to Tianshan in peace now?

383
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,080
I'm from the Cheng Branch.

384
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,840
I'm from the Xing Branch.

385
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,719
Please give me some pointers.

386
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,279
Brother Hu,

387
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,360
the guards already left.

388
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,920
Hurry up and look for a secluded room.

389
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,759
Xiaomei, Fei
is learning martial arts now.

390
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,600
Don't disturb him.

391
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
Learning martial arts?

392
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,439
Senior Ji.

393
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,600
Senior Ji.

394
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,519
It's about time

395
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,800
you appear on stage.

396
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,880
So you're a disciple
of the Huaquan Sect.

397
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:23,320
You're silent. I'll come in now.

398
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,640
Why so noisy?

399
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,999
You're disturbing
Senior Ji watching the fight.

400
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,519
Go and wait by the side.

401
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:28,560
Senior Ji knows

402
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:29,759
when to show up.

403
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,519
When did the Tian Branch

404
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
take in a female disciple?

405
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,920
Sister Cheng,

406
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,759
I'm not sure
how long Brother Hu will take.

407
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,360
Why don't we

408
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,719
apply acupuncture
to Sister Chunhua here?

409
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:02,719
No rush.

410
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,160
Fei knows
when to stop watching.

411
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,360
I can't remember everything,

412
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,120
but I can only take a chance.

413
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:34,719
What do you mean?

414
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,920
I want to contest them on stage.

415
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,880
If I can secure
the Sect Leader position,

416
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,759
they will be at my command.

417
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,640
This way, we can

418
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,360
apply acupuncture
to Sister Ma with ease.

419
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,080
Fei,

420
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,880
they aren't your match.

421
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,800
You'll win for sure.

422
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:50,360
But to secure
their Sect Leader position,

423
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,959
I must use their fist techniques.

424
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,479
I only managed to grasp

425
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,959
a superficial technique
within that short time.

426
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,320
You don't have to worry.

427
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,719
My father said

428
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,679
that out of ten lies,

429
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,999
one truth is enough to frighten others.

430
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,439
Brother Hu,
you're a martial arts expert.

431
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,920
A few tricks can make them submissive.

432
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,519
They can't tell

433
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,999
which sect techniques you've used.

434
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:11,199
Thank you for letting me win.

435
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,959
Who else is dissatisfied?
Please show your skills

436
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,880
and challenge me.

437
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
We can't bother too much.
Let's fight first and see how it goes.

438
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,400
Well, Lingsu.

439
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:21,320
If I still haven't returned

440
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,279
by the hour,

441
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,519
you must go ahead with
the acupuncture treatment here.

442
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,719
We can only take one step at a time.

443
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,120
Don't worry. I'll be here.

444
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,360
I'll challenge you now!

445
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,239
Hold on!

446
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:41,840
Let me challenge him first!

447
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:47,999
Who is he?

448
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:48,880
Senior Ji.

449
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,239
May I know your name?

450
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:53,320
I'm Cheng Linghu,

451
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,039
a disciple of Tian Branch.

452
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,679
Please give me some pointers, Senior.

453
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,679
Sister Cheng,

454
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,759
look at Brother Hu. He's missing you.

455
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:04,360
Cheng Linghu?

456
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,360
We have now become real siblings.

457
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,080
That's not right.

458
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,679
When did Senior Ji grow taller?

459
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,080
Is there something wrong
with your eyesight?

460
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:20,840
He's not Senior Ji.

461
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,800
I get it now.

462
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:37,719
He's Senior Ji's new disciple.

463
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,080
He was sent to be the vanguard.

464
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,439
You're right, Senior.

465
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,959
Bravo!

466
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:51,840
What a powerful skill.

467
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,279
He has powerful martial arts skills.

468
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,360
I wonder whom he's learning from
in the Tian Branch?

469
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,679
Senior Ji of Tian Branch
already has powerful skills.

470
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,840
With Senior Cheng around now,

471
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,360
I think the Sect Leader

472
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:03,880
has already been determined.

473
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,239
My fellow martial brothers,

474
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:08,640
the earlier we elect the Sect Leader,
the better it will be.

475
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,679
If anyone of you
would like to challenge me,

476
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:12,959
you may come forward together.

477
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,880
If I lose,

478
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,560
I have no comment.

479
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,759
Senior Cheng,
please give me some pointers.

480
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,279
Please give me some pointers too.

481
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:37,679
Sister Cheng,

482
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,400
what's wrong with him?

483
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,999
Why is he trembling all over?

484
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,840
He's using his internal force
to unblock his acupoint.

485
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,600
He may be paralyzed
and lose all his martial arts skills.

486
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:57,039
Or even worse,
he'll be deranged and go crazy.

487
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,439
Thank you for your help.

488
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,999
We just don't want you
to attract anyone here

489
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,279
and expose our whereabouts.

490
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,080
We didn't mean to hurt you.

491
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,360
Why do you want
to unblock your acupoint?

492
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,959
You almost hurt yourself.

493
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
I, Ji, will remember

494
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,640
that you've saved me.

495
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:39,840
But that brat who was with you

496
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,199
is too arrogant.

497
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,279
The Huaquan Sect

498
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,640
has acclaimed over 300 years
of expertise in martial arts.

499
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,640
As a lay disciple,

500
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,600
how dare he disrupt
the Sect Leader election

501
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,800
after only learning a few tricks?

502
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,840
That's really...

503
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,479
Your internal breath
is in complete disorder.

504
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,120
You mustn't be sloppy
in nourishing your qi.

505
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,519
That's right.

506
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,759
If you don't want to be a vegetable,

507
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:05,039
keep your mouth shut now.

508
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:10,120
Brother Zhou,

509
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,320
there's no one on the street.

510
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,239
We won't bump into Brother Hu here.

511
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,400
Are you talking nonsense here?

512
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:18,519
We came here

513
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,679
just because he won't come
to such a place.

514
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:21,199
What have you been thinking?

515
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:24,519
You want to bump into him
and fight against him?

516
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,400
You're indeed smart, Brother Zhou.

517
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,959
This shop looks strange.

518
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
The light is lit. But it has no signage.

519
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
Let's search this shop then.

520
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,560
Guards! Knock on the door!

521
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:43,800
Open the door!

522
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,640
I'm coming.

523
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:49,679
Officials.

524
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,360
Why is your shop without signage?

525
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,560
Well, Officials.

526
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,759
I'm selling coffins.

527
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:01,199
We're under Official Fu's command

528
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,999
to search for the fugitive
in the entire city.

529
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,120
We have to search your shop too.

530
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:06,759
Of course.

531
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,239
I'm just afraid
that it will bring you bad luck.

532
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,560
We, the military officials,

533
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,080
have blood on our swords.

534
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:15,400
What is there to be afraid of?

535
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,320
Please lead the way.

536
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
This way, please.

537
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,800
Search thoroughly!

538
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,439
Don't leave out any corner!

539
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,479
- Yes, Official!
- Yes, Official!

540
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,439
She is...

541
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,120
Official,

542
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,199
this is my humble wife.

543
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:54,800
Brother Zhou.

544
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,640
Remove the lid.

545
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,199
Yes, Official.

546
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,080
Hurry up.

547
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,959
What is this?

548
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,479
I forgot to mention

549
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,160
that this coffin was delivered today.

550
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,160
I haven't had the time to send it out.

551
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,999
All right. There's nothing
to search for here.

552
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,320
Let's move on.

553
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,439
Farewell, Officials.

554
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,160
Master, are you all right?

555
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,239
Did those fools distract

556
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:50,199
your martial arts practice?

557
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,679
Fortunately, they went away quickly.

558
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,560
Otherwise, they would be
the ones lying in here now.

559
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:59,239
That's for sure.

560
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,600
Thank you for letting me win.

561
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:24,600
Who else would like to challenge me?

562
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:27,279
The best disciples
of all branches have been beaten.

563
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:30,039
Who else can be Senior Cheng's opponent?

564
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,999
No one else can be
our Sect Leader but Senior Cheng.

565
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,439
Brother Cheng has powerful
martial arts skills.

566
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,479
I'm impressed.

567
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,600
But I noticed
your techniques looked different

568
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,160
from those passed down in our sect.

569
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:52,999
It's similar in appearance
but not in spirit.

570
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,360
It feels

571
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,679
very different.

572
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,279
That's not good.

573
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:01,600
That old man is making things
difficult for Brother Hu.

574
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,800
The old man has a powerful sight.

575
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,840
He has seen through it.

576
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,400
My father told me

577
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:11,519
that there are only very few exquisite
lay martial arts in this world.

578
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,679
The Huaquan Sect is one of them.

579
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,759
Although Brother Hu
has grasped more than half of it,

580
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,600
it's hard to comprehend
its profound knowledge

581
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,800
within such a short time.

582
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,600
You're right.

583
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,999
Those who competed on stage

584
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,519
weren't the best in Huaquan Sect.

585
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,880
Even if Fei
grasped their skills,

586
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,679
he wouldn't be able
to learn its essence.

587
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,679
The 48 styles of Huaquan are divided
into Yi, Cheng, Xing, Tian, and Ya.

588
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:34,479
If it hadn't been
for the different understanding,

589
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,360
our sect wouldn't be divided
into five branches.

590
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,959
There is no fixed method
for learning martial arts.

591
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,439
It's reasonable
that we at Tian Branch understand

592
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,719
the techniques differently.

593
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,719
That's right.

594
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,320
Martial Uncle Cai,
Senior Cheng is gifted.

595
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:51,880
He's not a match for ordinary disciples.

596
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,800
Didn't we agree to elect
our Sect Leader through the contest?

597
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,719
Senior Cheng has the best
martial arts skills here.

598
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,840
Anyone plans to go back on their words?

599
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:04,719
It can be said
that Brother Cheng is and isn't

600
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:05,880
under Ji.

601
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,199
He is and isn't a full disciple of Ji.

602
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,920
There's nothing wrong with my eyesight.

603
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:16,320
I noticed nine out of ten techniques

604
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,679
you used today don't belong to our sect.

605
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:24,439
What Senior Cai said is very true.

606
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,920
If we display a different technique

607
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,800
at the Sect Leaders Gathering,

608
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,479
wouldn't it be like
motivating others' ambition

609
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,320
while ruining our own prestige?

610
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,920
I disagree with what you said.

611
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,039
If we want to compete
against the big sects

612
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,160
like Wudang, Shaolin, Taiji, and Bagua

613
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,239
at the World's Sect Leaders Gathering

614
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:45,120
and display our prestige,

615
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:47,719
we must integrate the old with the new.

616
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,640
The internal force I learned

617
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,840
is created by my master
after he racked his brain

618
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,239
in seclusion.

619
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,479
It's indeed unique.

620
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:58,239
If you think I'm not good enough,

621
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,360
please come forward
and give me some pointers.

622
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,560
I couldn't be more pleased

623
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:05,959
to have such an expert
like you in our sect.

624
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,999
Giving you some pointers?
Just forget it.

625
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,199
Since you're a disciple of Ji,

626
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,080
whether you're a full disciple or not,

627
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:16,840
you must have practiced
Huaquan's basic technique,

628
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,239
Yilu Huaquan.

629
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,560
The dozen of seniors on the scene

630
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,439
will be the witnesses.

631
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,640
If you're willing
to show us Yilu Huaquan,

632
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,479
everything will be fine.

633
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:31,400
No one will dare say a word.

634
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,279
That's right.

635
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,640
If our elected Sect Leader

636
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,039
can't even master this technique,

637
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,880
we'll be only making
a fool of ourselves if known.

638
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:46,320
I'm well-respected in the Huaquan Sect.

639
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,479
Brother Cheng, if you indeed
know Yilu Huaquan,

640
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,400
I'll be the first person to delightedly

641
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,120
hold you as our Sect Leader.

642
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,320
Sister Cheng, what should we do now?

643
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,679
What is Yilu Huaquan?

644
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,600
Brother Hu has never seen it.

645
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:16,920
Huaquan Sect has many techniques.

646
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,239
If one of our dozen Martial Uncles

647
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:22,279
requests Senior Cheng
to display a Huaquan technique

648
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:23,320
while another

649
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,880
requests for Sanlu Saber Technique

650
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
and Qilu Whip,

651
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,719
when will we confirm

652
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,080
our Sect Leader if this goes on and on?

653
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,640
That's right. When can we confirm it?

654
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,719
- That's right.
- That's right.

655
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,719
- When can we confirm it?
- When can we confirm it?

656
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,360
What for?

657
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,160
Senior Cheng has won.

658
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,600
Martial Uncle Cai,

659
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,759
why do you keep making things difficult

660
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,759
for the Tian Branch?

661
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,640
Senior Ji is here.

662
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:52,999
Brother Cheng is a disciple
my father has been proud of.

663
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:54,360
He has joined us for 12 years.

664
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,959
Do you think he doesn't know
Yilu Huaquan at all?

665
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,279
My father is living in seclusion.

666
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,759
He has passed on

667
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:05,360
everything he knows to Senior Cheng.

668
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,920
He has been practicing hard for 12 years

669
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:10,160
just for today.

670
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:13,679
Just now, you've already witnessed

671
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,600
that his skills are ten times
better than mine.

672
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:19,439
What else do you all have to say?

673
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,999
I've long heard that Martial Uncle Ji
has a weird personality.

674
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,840
He hasn't shown up for over ten years.

675
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,479
It turns out that he has been
secretly teaching a disciple

676
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,719
and taken us by surprise.

677
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,679
Everyone has witnessed

678
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,239
Senior Cheng's skills, don't you?

679
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,600
Since Martial Uncle Cai wants to test

680
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,920
our Tian Branch's skills,

681
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,560
I'll display the technique
on behalf of Senior Cheng.

682
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,719
I hope Martial Uncle Cai
will give me some pointers.

683
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:15,200
(Huaquan Sect has indeed
lived up to its reputation.)

684
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,559
(It's not someone to be trifled with.)

685
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
(Senior Ji has a strong foundation.)

686
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,959
(If he works on his internal skills,)

687
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
(he'll surely be
a famous master one day.)

688
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,159
(Based on his fist techniques,)

689
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,920
(he's also a powerful
martial arts expert.)

690
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,800
(But why did he seem)

691
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,240
(to have used a lot of energy
in striking a punch?)

692
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,760
Congratulations, Senior Cheng, for being
named the Chief of Huaquan Sect!

693
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,599
Congratulations, Senior Cheng, for being
named the Chief of Huaquan Sect!

694
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,079
Sister Ma can be saved now.

695
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,680
Senior Cheng, you've been appointed
as our Sect Leader.

696
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,479
Why don't you take off your scarf
and show your true face?

697
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,159
Junior Ji,

698
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:13,519
please find a secluded room first

699
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,320
and bring the two junior sisters
to take a rest.

700
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,599
Thank you.

701
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,720
My fellow martial brothers,

702
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,639
it has been a long day today.

703
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,119
Go home early and take a rest.

704
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,920
Tomorrow night, we'll discuss the plan.

705
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,240
In the World's Sect Leaders Gathering

706
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,360
we must make them exalted

707
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,519
and bring honor to our sect name.

708
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,880
- Yes!
- Yes!

709
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,519
- Yes!
- Yes!
