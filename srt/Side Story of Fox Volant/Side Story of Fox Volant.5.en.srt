00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:00,980
Greetings...

4
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,570
Save the pleasantries.

5
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,730
Your Majesty,

6
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,620
after secluding and mulling
over it for three days,

7
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,900
I've finally found the answer.

8
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,370
The self-proclaimed

9
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,130
righteous martial artists

10
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,170
are in fact fighting against each other

11
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,340
and forming sects.

12
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,260
It will lead to chaos sooner or later

13
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,730
and become a pain in the neck
of the imperial court.

14
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,260
What's your suggestion

15
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,130
to prevent troubles

16
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,940
without a battle?

17
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,940
If the imperial court wants
to battle without bloodshed,

18
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,250
we must get them to kill each other.

19
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,330
So I suggest

20
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,020
sending Hero Invitations

21
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,020
to the Heroes of the World

22
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,660
to invite them
for a martial arts contest

23
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,060
at the World's Sect Leaders Gathering
in the capital.

24
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,500
You've got wits.

25
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,250
No, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,660
I'm ignorant.

27
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,140
I haven't figured out

28
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,300
an appropriate way

29
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,220
to run the Sect Leaders' Gathering.

30
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,860
Have you heard of the story of how Yan Zi
killed three heroes with two peaches?

31
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,250
It's more fun letting them

32
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,500
compete and fight

33
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,610
against each other.

34
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

35
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,450
After Yan Ji's death,

36
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,530
Miao Renfeng has been
to Shuzhong's Tang Sect

37
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,730
and Xiangxi's Chu Sect

38
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,450
and visited many poison experts.

39
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,730
It is said

40
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,300
that he has even found Reverend Yi Chen
of the Medicine King Valley.

41
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,700
Tao,

42
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,490
thank you for your efforts

43
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,610
in gaining intel about Miao Renfeng

44
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,980
and keeping watch on Yan Ji.

45
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,020
What about

46
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,140
returning to Tianlong Sect
and working under me?

47
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,540
I won't treat you badly.

48
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,210
Thank you, Sect Leader.

49
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,100
Great.

50
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,580
Tell me.

51
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,210
What's going on
in the martial arts world lately?

52
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,050
Based on the news
from a friend in the capital,

53
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,210
the imperial court will be holding
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

54
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,890
The World's Sect Leaders Gathering?

55
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,300
Looks like the martial arts world
will be in chaos soon.

56
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,140
Tianlong Sect has to gain a proper place.

57
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,490
This is a great opportunity for us.

58
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,050
You're so naive.

59
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,650
Must we fight

60
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,490
to gain a proper place?

61
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,420
Think about it.

62
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,420
Why does the imperial court
hold the gathering?

63
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,610
Their purpose is to purge
the martial arts world

64
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,650
and exterminate the rebels.

65
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,170
A great man knows
how to ride the tide of his times.

66
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,210
This gathering

67
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,420
is akin to the imperial examination.

68
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,210
To pass the county examination and
enter the final imperial examination,

69
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,650
you need to outline your contribution
and loyalty in the exam.

70
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,420
You'll surely be selected then.

71
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,140
By then,

72
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,170
you'll either be selected
as the first-ranked scholar

73
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,650
or second-ranked scholar.

74
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,580
Everyone will look up to you then.

75
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,450
You're wise, Sect Leader.

You're such a loser.

86

You can't even get past it.

87
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,020
Hey, why didn't you
tell me you couldn't do it?

88
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,290
We could just go around then.

89
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,850
I fell to the ground because of you.

90
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,820
Why did you peep on me? You crook.

91
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,820
Still staring, aren't you?

92
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,090
Hold on!

93
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,210
Let me explain.

94
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm not a crook.

95
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,770
I followed you all the way here.

96
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,770
And you were saying

97
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,620
you weren't a crook?

98
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,580
Wait!

99
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,700
You spattered mud all over me

100
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,210
when you rode by on a horse.

101
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,090
Look at this.

102
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,700
This is all your doings.

103
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,290
You left without even an apology.

104
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,530
What about this?

105
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,210
Apologize,

106
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,380
and we'll call it even.

107
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,620
Sorry for the offense!

108
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,340
Wait.

What are you doing?

110
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,890
We're even now.

111
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,810
Return my clothes to me.

112

I'll keep your cloth bundle
for the moment.

113
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,740
Get it from me when we reach Foshan.

114

Where are you going?

115

Return my clothes to me!

This is what I call even.

What's that smell?

When was the last time
he took a shower?

128

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,170
I hope His Honor

172
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,620
will deliver justice
for the Feng Family.

173
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,050
I feel bad

174
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,860
that you personally
make a trip for such a trivial matter.

175
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,410
Sir,

176
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,980
the Feng Family framed us.

177
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,570
We did not steal their goose.

178
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,100
We are innocent.

179
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,340
Look.

180
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,890
This is thief catches thief outright.

181
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,220
Seize him now!

182
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,930
Yes.

183
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,690
Come on! Drag him in!

184
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,140
Sir!

185
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,690
Sir! I'm innocent!

186
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,770
Sir, please let him go!

187
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,170
Please don't, Sir!

188
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,530
Even if I'm beaten to death,
I still won't sell it!

189
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,410
Sir!

190
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,100
Drag this crazy woman out!

191
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,100
Come on!

192
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,290
Impertinent!

193
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,020
Mom!

194
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,100
He's innocent!

195
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,890
Mom!

196
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,100
Mom!

197
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,690
Waiter!

198
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,340
Young Lady, what would you like to have?

199
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,890
Bring me your best dishes.

200
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,620
Are these taels enough?

201
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,690
Yes, yes.

202
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,410
With this, you can get
more than ten servings

203
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,770
of our most expensive dishes and liquor.

204
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,290
Great!

205
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,770
I'll treat everyone here then!

206
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,290
Just spend

207
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
all these taels.

208
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,410
Young Lady,

209
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,220
you're a God of Wealth indeed.

210
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,930
Thank you, Young Lady!

211
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,890
Nice!

212
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,380
I'll help this brat avoid misfortune
by spending his money.

213
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,620
(Fist and Saber Manual)

214
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,340
(I'll keep this for you for the moment.)

215
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,980
(Don't worry. I won't look at it.)

216
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,020
Something is going on!
Let's take a look!

217
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,620
What is it?

218
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,020
Come on. Let's take a look.

219
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,890
Please make way!

220
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,740
-Why are you all so nosy?
-Please make way!

221
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,460
Please make way!

222
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,410
Oh Heaven,

223
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,570
(Pak Tai Temple)
oh Jade Emperor, please help us.

224
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,260
Come on!

225
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,020
Asi has been framed.

226
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,460
We didn't steal the goose.

227
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,290
I swear to Heaven

228
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,220
that if I lied,

229
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,260
I'll be struck by thunder.

230
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,850
Tell you what.

231
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,660
The true god

232
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,460
in the Foshan land

233
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,700
is my master.

234
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,700
I'll count on you, Your Honor.

235
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,530
Young Master Feng,

236
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,330
it's not that I did not want to help.

237
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,460
Zhong Asi

238
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,370
yields to neither
the carrot nor the club.

239
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,500
What do you expect me to do
with someone even Old Master Feng

240
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,420
can't tackle himself?

241
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,850
Listen closely.

242
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,460
(The son of Feng Tiannan, Feng Yiming)
I must obtain the Zhong Family's title deed today.

243
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,420
Young Master Feng,

244
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,810
could you request your father

245
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,570
to give me another few days?

246
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,940
I've forgotten to mention

247
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,290
that the special envoys
of Official Fu Kang'an

248
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,050
have arrived at my residence.

249
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,530
Would you like me
to introduce them to you?

250
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,180
I...

251
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,050
Or

252
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,500
would you like the two special envoys
to request Official Fu

253
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,610
to replace our county magistrate
upon their return to the capital?

254
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,020
I'll settle it as quickly as possible.

255
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,330
Seventh Master.

256
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,370
Seventh Master, please have mercy.

257
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,180
Since we're fellow townsmen,

258
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,980
please spare my whole family.

259
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,130
I...

260
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,460
I'll ask Asi

261
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,500
to hand you the title deed, okay?

262
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,220
Let go.

263
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,850
You asked for it.

264
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,500
Begging for mercy now?

265
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,700
It's too late.

266
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,770
I want everyone to know

267
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,020
the consequences

268
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,370
of offending the Feng Family.

269
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,740
Waiter,

270
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,050
what's going on out there?

271
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,090
Young Lady,

272
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,420
I bet you're from outland.

273
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,180
You'd better stop inquiring.

274
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,180
Just enjoy your meal

275
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,770
and continue with your journey.

276
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,020
What's happening in Foshan Town...

277
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,260
Can't I even ask about it?

278
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,220
Waiter!

279
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,260
Coming!

280
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,660
I'm innocent, Your Honor!

281
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,940
I'm innocent, Your Honor!

282
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,610
Zhong Asi,

283
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,570
do you plead guilty?

284
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,530
Your Honor,

285
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,180
I did not steal his goose.

286
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,810
Continue the beating!

287
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,050
Well, Zhong Asi

288
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,370
has a trial in his life.

289
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,050
I guess he's done for this time.

290
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,570
I'm innocent, Your Honor!

291
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,370
You! What are you doing?

292
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,570
Revolting?

293
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,330
Put it down!

294
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,420
You don't believe in us, right?

295
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,330
You don't believe in me, right?

296
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,660
Fine.

297
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,370
I'll prove it to you all.

298
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,700
I'll prove it to you all!

299
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,220
Who are you trying to scare here?

300
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,130
I've seen

301
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,570
many scumbags like you.

302
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,420
If you've got the guts, then cut him up.

303
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,130
Go on and prove it!

304
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,900
Mother, don't!

305
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,460
Mother, don't!

306
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,220
No!

307
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,900
Mother, don't!

308
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,130
Mother, don't!

309
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,460
May I ask

310
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,330
how many Feng Families
are there in this place?

311
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,260
How many Feng Families are there?

312
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,850
There is only one.

313
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,570
In Foshan Town,

314
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,570
besides Old Master Feng and his son,

315
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,900
who else dares carry that surname?

316
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:12,900
That's right.

317
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
Then, Zhong Asi

318
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,850
is Old Master Feng's sworn enemy.

319
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,370
What are you talking about?

320
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,900
He's an ignorant villager.

321
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,130
Feng's sworn enemies

322
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,940
have piled up to three feet high.

323
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,570
How did Zhong Asi

324
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,420
offend Old Master Feng?

325
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,770
Well, Young Lady,

326
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,530
why are you inquiring about this?

327
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,220
Stop being so nosy.

328
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,460
Don't bring trouble upon yourself.

329
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,370
Coincidentally,

330
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,050
I love being nosy.

331
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,420
A day without it

332
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,740
makes me feel uneasy.

333
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,130
Young Lady, calm down.

334
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,660
Calm down.

335
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,500
I forgot to mention

336
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,980
that I used to be a merciless robber.

337
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,940
I've returned to the right path.

338
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,900
I'm learning to run a business.

339
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,500
I need ten thousand taels for my business.

340
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,770
But I'm short of money now,

341
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,850
so I have to borrow 5,000 taels

342
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,090
from you two.

343
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,290
Young Lady,

344
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,020
forget about 5,000 taels.

345
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,900
I don't even have 50 taels.

346
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,740
Young Lady, have mercy.

347
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,770
No money?

348
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,420
That's easy.

349
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,370
Tell me in detail what just happened.

350
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,940
I won't borrow money from the person

351
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,740
who can tell me clearly
with the most details.

352
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,570
The loser will bear

353
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,660
the 10,000 taels.

354
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,420
I'll tell you.

355
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,130
I'll do it!

356
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,900
We've told earlier

357
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,500
that we won't sell our vegetable field.

358
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,610
Did I mention the land sales here?

359
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,980
Let me tell you.

360
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,900
I'm here to catch a thief.

361
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,810
What do you mean?

362
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,050
Our Old Master lost his goose.

363
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,090
Search!

364
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,220
What are you all doing?

365
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,370
What are you all doing? Stop it!

366
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,330
Stop it!

367
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,570
How dare you search our house?

368
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,660
Where's your evidence?

369
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,460
We did not steal your goose!

370
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,740
Fret not.

371
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,570
Evidence will eventually show up.

372
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,570
Seventh Master,

373
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,330
we couldn't find the goose.

374
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,660
But we found this.

375
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,810
Asi,

376
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,460
what is this?

377
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:23,940
Well...

378
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,530
How would I now?

379
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,370
That's right.

380
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,130
My fellow villagers,

381
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,850
shouldn't goose feather
grow on the goose?

382
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,220
It's actually quite simple.

383
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,980
You all must have eaten the goose.

384
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,370
This is something
even a three-year-old kid knows.

385
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,180
Nonsense.

386
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,900
Someone!

387
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,180
Take them

388
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:47,940
to the magistrate!

389
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,460
Yes!

390
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,770
Let go!

391
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,660
What are you all doing?

392
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,700
Let him go!

393
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,980
-What are you all doing?
-Let me go!

394
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,700
Absurd!

395
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,460
They've gone overboard.

396
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:57,980
Young Lady,

397
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,220
don't speak

398
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,180
carelessly.

399
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,420
This restaurant belongs
to the Feng Family.

400
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,330
They own

401
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,180
eighty percent
of the businesses on this street.

402
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,900
If you offend the father and the son,

403
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,530
you'll meet a horrible death.

404
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,500
That's true.

405
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,290
Is there no justice here?

406
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,330
Justice?

407
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,090
Old Master Feng is the judge.

408
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,180
Oh, no! Someone is dead!

409
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,330
Someone is dead!

410
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,530
North Deity,

411
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,700
look at this.

412
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,180
This is a snail, not a goose.

413
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,610
San did not eat the goose.

414
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,660
Look.

415
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,460
I have evidence now.

416
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,770
I have evidence now.

417
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,050
That's horrible.

418
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,260
His intestines spilled forth

419
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,500
with just a slash of a knife.

420
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,460
I was almost splattered
with blood all over.

421
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,610
It was so frightening.

422
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,460
Mrs. Zhong has gone crazy.

423
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,900
She's laughing oddly.

424
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,770
The kid's belly was cut wide open,

425
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,850
but no goose meat was found.

426
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,050
Only a few snails were found.

427
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,660
Yes, there were only a few snails.

428
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,290
I don't think the kid will survive.

429
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,500
Please make way!

430
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,660
Get out of the way!

431
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,180
She has gone crazy.

432
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,980
She has indeed gone crazy.

433
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,330
Seventh Master, he's dead.

434
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,180
What should be done now?

435
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,500
What are you saying?

436
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,900
It's not us who killed him.

437
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,290
We're here to catch
the goose thief for Old Master.

438
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,850
Everything else is unrelated to us.

439
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,260
But the kid is...

440
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,500
A goose feather
was found in their house.

441
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,610
If San did not eat it,

442
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,980
then it must be Er.

443
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,700
One of them must have eaten it.

444
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,770
Get it now?

445
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,700
Yes, Seventh Master.

446
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,220
That brat is running away!

447
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,980
Chase after him!

448
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,090
Come on! Chase after him!

449
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,290
Stop! Stop running!

450
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,660
Stop running!

451
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,290
Get out of the way!

452
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,570
Get out of the way!

453
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,420
Stop running!

454
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,610
Stop running!

455
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,500
Come on!

456
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,660
Did you see that kid?

457
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,570
He did not sneak food.

458
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,090
He did not sneak food.

459
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:37,900
He did not sneak food.

460
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,660
(Pak Tai Temple)

461
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,460
Look.

462
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:41,850
Look.

463
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,610
This is a snail.

464
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,570
This is a snail.

465
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,900
This is a snail.

466
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,020
San did not eat the goose.

467
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,020
San did not eat the goose.

468
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,260
Look. This is indeed a snail.

469
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,700
It's a snail.

470
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,020
It's indeed a snail.

471
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,090
Mother.

472
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,460
Mother.

473
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,420
Mother.

474
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,050
It's so pitiful.

475
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,980
Get out of the way!

476
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,770
Get out of the way now!

477
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:20,660
Look.

478
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,740
San did not eat the goose.

479
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,050
Who is it?

480
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,660
Who is being so nosy here?

481
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,570
Show yourself now!

482
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,180
It's you.

483
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:02,980
Go!

484
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,530
Bury your brother

485
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,290
and take care of your mother.

486
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,660
Young Lady.

487
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,130
Where are you going?

488
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,180
To take revenge on that Feng guy.

489
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,090
Foshan is huge.

490
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,460
We're not familiar with this place.

491
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,850
How long will it take us

492
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,220
to find him like this?

493
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,900
Should we just forget it?

494
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,130
I have an idea.

495
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,460
Ride the gravy train.

496
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,660
Didn't the Feng Family
own the businesses in this area?

497
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,900
Let's look into each of them.

498
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,700
I don't believe that he won't show up.

499
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,090
Hold on.

500
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,090
Return my clothes to me.

501
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:50,850
Father.

502
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,220
Father.

503
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,050
What's the matter?
Why are you flustering?

504
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,050
Official Fu's envoys are here.

505
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,460
Please entertain them.

506
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,460
It's inconvenient for me.

507
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,740
But Father, Official...

508
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,220
All right then.

(Heroes Restaurant)

510
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,020
Who are you?

511
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,740
How dare you cause trouble
in Old Master Feng's territory?

512
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,980
I haven't asked your name.

513
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,050
If we're beaten to death

514
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,570
and fall into Netherworld,

515
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,770
at least we can say hi.

516
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,370
Tell me yours first.

517
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,220
I am

518
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,610
Ba

519
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,530
Fengmao.

520
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,290
Fate has indeed brought us together.

521
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,610
We even have similar names.

522
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,770
I'm Zheng

523
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,090
Fengzhua.

524
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,940
Do you have a death wish?

525
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,770
I'm going to kill you.

526
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,460
Hero, have mercy.

527
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,260
Hero, have mercy.

528
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,370
You're a cook, aren't you?

529
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,660
You arrived just in time.

530
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,810
I have something to ask you.

531
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,610
Where is the Feng Family's
largest business in town?

532
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,770
This place is known as
Heroes Restaurant.

533
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,330
Heroes Pawn Shop
is on Qiankun Street.

534
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,130
At the third intersection
towards the east

535
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,660
is Heroes Club.

536
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,130
I get it.

537
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,850
Those with "Heroes" in their names

538
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,090
belong to the Feng Family.

539
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,420
It's not surprising.

540
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,330
In this land,

541
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,570
he's the only one
who dares proclaim himself as a hero.

542
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,050
Ba,

543
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,180
let's pay a visit to Heroes Pawn Shop.

544
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,460
No rush.

545
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,020
Old Master Feng is well-known locally.

546
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,420
No matter what,

547
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,260
we should present him with a gift
during our first meeting.

548
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:47,290
(Heroes Pawn Shop)

549
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,940
Who is it?

550
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,180
Are you blind?

551
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,290
We're closed today!

552
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,980
I have rare items to pawn.

553
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,260
Please make an exception.

554
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,020
What do you want to pawn?

555
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
Six vicious dogs.

556
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,260
One thousand taels each.

557
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,530
What do you mean?

558
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,770
Are you deaf?

559
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,500
We want to pawn six vicious dogs.

560
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,900
One thousand taels each.

561
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,050
Six thousand taels in total.

562
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,770
It's a great deal.

563
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,210
My dear hero, stop kidding me.

564
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,380
It's our rule

565
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,050
not to take in living things.

566
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,340
Please forgive me.

567
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,730
Please make way!

568
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,610
Stop making trouble here.

569
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,170
Do you know what this place is?

570
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,530
Do you know who owns this pawn shop?

571
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,460
You're bearding the lion in his den.

572
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,900
Let me go!

573
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,980
Ba,

574
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,130
looks like we did not apply
enough strength.

575
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,340
Let's apply more strength then.

576
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,020
Is this strong enough?

577
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,210
Yes.

578
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,210
Have mercy, my master.

579
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,610
Hurry up and get the money.

580
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,170
