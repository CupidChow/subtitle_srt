00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,599
Young lady, will these do?

4
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,319
Great.

5
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,440
Get another bucket of water for them.

6
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,880
But lady,

7
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,999
it's getting dark.

8
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,719
Can I water them after I return

9
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,800
from Medicine King Valley?

10
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:37,959
Just stay here and water the flowers.

11
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,399
I only allow you to stay

12
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,440
because you seem nice.

13
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,200
Are you here for the flowers
or the King of Poison?

14
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,279
It's almost sunset.

15
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:48,439
You help me with the flowers

16
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,040
because you want directions.

17
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:52,079
You trade kindness for reward.

18
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,359
That's not sincerity.

19
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,279
You are right.

20
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:41,600
If you really mean to help me,

21
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,719
I wouldn't let you work for nothing.

22
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,320
Take these flowers.

23
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,600
Thank you.

24
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:05,119
Thank you for the hospitality.

25
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,480
Farewell.

26
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,639
Seriously?

27
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,160
You worked here all day

28
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,519
and were covered in sweat,

29
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,160
and she only gave you flowers?

30
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,239
What's wrong with her anyway?

31
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,959
That's enough.

32
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,440
We were in the wrong
for ruining her flowers.

33
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,519
Let's go.

34
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,200
May I know your name?

35
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,519
My surname is Hu.

36
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,239
If you'll head for
Medicine King Manor,

37
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,040
you should go northeast.

38
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,440
Thank you so much.

39
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,200
Let's go.

40
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,119
This place is creepy.

41
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,720
King of Poison!

42
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,639
Show yourself!

43
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,399
Stop hiding in there!

44
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,119
We found you!

(Third Senior Sister of
the Medicine King Sect, Xue Que)

46
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,720
Father, can they get in here?

47
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,439
(Second Eldest Senior, Jiang Tieshan)
Fear not, my son.

48
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,799
They will never get in here.

49
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,840
If they come near the Blood Chinquapin,

50
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,400
they die.

51
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,119
It seems

52
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,999
that is where the King of Poison lives.

53
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:04,879
Brother Hu,

54
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,480
what's that over there?

55
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,439
Stay here.

56
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:13,280
Do not go in there.

(Essentials of Needling Acupuncture)

58
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,999
They carried weapons.

59
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,600
They were probably his enemies.

60
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:38,920
Brother Hu.

61
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:40,679
Look around the house.

62
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,040
These creepy red flowers are everywhere.

63
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,199
They must be toxic.

64
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,879
We should be careful.

65
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,640
King of Poison!

66
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,840
I came without weapons.

67
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,080
I mean you no harm.

68
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,520
Wait.

69
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,840
There are more of them?

King of Poison!

71
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,600
I came looking for medicine.

72
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,480
If you don't come out,

73
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,359
then I shall break into the house.

74
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,720
They can come in
if they have a death wish.

75
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,759
Xiaomei!

76
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,920
Xiaomei!

77
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:33,920
Xiaomei!

78
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,199
Why didn't he knock out?

79
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,559
Xiaomei!

80
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,199
Xiaomei?

81
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,679
Xiaomei, are you alright?

82
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:18,640
You inhaled the poison.

83
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,760
This blue flower is the antidote.

84
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:22,280
It seems the lady

85
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,959
and the King of Poison
are somehow connected.

86
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,520
We should go back to her.

87
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,360
Let's not trespass.

88

Let's go.

Come on.

90
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,199
Oh no.

91
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:40,040
Could it be blue flowers planted by Lingsu
could neutralize

92
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,719
the Blood Chinquapin poison?

93
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,679
This is bad.

94
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,000
If our enemies learn
the blue flower's capability,

95
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,719
we will all die.

96

When it's dark,

98
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:57,920
go out.

99
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,240
Mother, don't worry.

100
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
I know what to do.

101
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,479
Is anyone here?

102
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:18,319
Could we go in there?

103
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,240
Come in.

104
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,160
It's you.

105
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:37,959
Young lady.

106
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,880
There's nothing much here,

107
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,319
I hope you don't mind the simple food.

108
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,719
We are sorry to
trouble you at this hour.

109
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:52,400
The food looks freshly cooked.

110
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,839
She knew we'd come back here.

111
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,640
This lady lives alone

112
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,439
in this forsaken place.

113
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,160
We don't know if we can trust her.

114
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,240
Do not eat the food.

115
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,000
If she wanted to harm us,

116
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,520
why would she give us the flower?

117
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,599
Let's go inside.

118
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:25,520
Take a seat.

119
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,920
Thanks.

120
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:41,000
Dig in.

121
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:43,679
Yes.

122
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,360
I have a stomach ache.

123
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:52,959
I don't feel like eating.

124
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:54,839
Have some tea instead.

125
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,199
You're not eating or drinking.

126
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:01,360
Does the food upset you?

127
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,799
Not at all.

128
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,599
It's because

129
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,880
she knows I eat a lot.

130
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,000
She's worried there isn't enough food.

131
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,679
That's why.

132
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,839
Yeah.

133
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:10,880
Can you finish all the food here?

134
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes.

135
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't push yourself too hard.

136
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,280
I can do it.

137
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,240
I can do it.

138
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,280
Young lady,

139
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,360
have you always lived here by yourself?

140
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,240
I've been on my own since I was 13.

141
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,920
I know life can be hard
when you're alone.

142
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,040
And given you're a girl,

143
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,280
it's even harder.

144
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:11,520
The blue flowers.

145
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:22,880
Who are you?

146
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,920
Why did you do this?

147
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,479
Leave here now!

148
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,280
Xiaomei?

149
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,199
Xiaomei?

150
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,679
Don't touch me.

151
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,000
You didn't drink,

152
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,079
so why do you reek of alcohol?

153
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:08,880
She will be fine.

154
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,880
She is drunk, but not from alcohol.

155
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,719
Impossible.

156
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,559
How could she be drunk
if she hadn't drunk anything?

157
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,479
That is exactly

158
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
why she is drunk.

159
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,240
One more round!

160
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,640
Eight horses, four prosperous...

161
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,839
She was wary of everything,

162
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,199
but it was futile.

163
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,719
One can only be safe
when they live as you do.

164
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,360
As I do?

165
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,120
You clean the outhouse when I say so.

166
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,400
You eat when I say so.

167
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,079
How could I hurt someone so obedient?

168
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,920
So, I managed to get it right

169
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,559
just by doing what you said.

170
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,000
But young lady,

171
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,280
you have a peculiar way
with your prank.

172
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,160
Even now, I still don't get it.

173
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
That flower is the Drunken Fragrance.

174
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,920
The petals are highly intoxicating.

175
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,920
The scent will make
a person drunk over time.

176
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,520
I put the antidote
in the tea and the food,

177
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,799
but she refused to have any.

178
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,839
Young lady,

179
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,400
I haven't learned your name.

180
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:08,040
My surname is Cheng.

181
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:11,079
Do not mention my surname
when others are around.

182
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,799
What should I call you?

183
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,160
My name is Cheng Lingsu.

184
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:17,240
Lingshu Jing and Suwen
are two classic medical texts.

185
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,160
I got my name from the titles.

186
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,280
Lingsu...

187
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,839
May I call you Young Lady Ling.

188
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,040
People might mistake it

189
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,640
for Young Lady Lin.

190
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,799
One more round!

191
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,839
Eight horses, four prosperous...

192
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,280
Don't worry.

193
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,079
She will be fine by sunrise.

194
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,319
I'm meeting some people.

195
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,479
Are you coming?

196
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,360
Sure.

197
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,640
Follow me.

198
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,000
Four prosperous...

199
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:53,240
We must take this.

200
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,959
Sure, I can carry it.

201
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,000
Young Lady Ling, this thing is heavy.

202
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,079
This way.

203
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Eldest Senior.

204
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,120
For our son,

205
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,000
we must go.

206
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,920
Do you usually trust people so easily?

207
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,599
What's wrong with that?

208
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,839
There are plenty of cunning
and treacherous people.

209
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,040
If we saw all human beings

210
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,160
as cunning evildoers,

211
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,559
we'd have no one to trust.

212
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,280
Life would be so boring.

213
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,439
Young Lady Ling,

214
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,679
when I went to the Medicine King Manor,

215
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,959
you sent me on a detour

216
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,120
over 20 li northeast.

217
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,880
I still don't understand why you did it.

218
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,799
That's not what you want to know.

219
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,959
You want to know

220
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,760
why we go east

221
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,160
when the manor is in the northwest.

222
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,160
Yes.

223
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,400
We go east because

224
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,640
we're not going to the manor.

225
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,360
Why not?

226
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,360
I asked you to water the flowers

227
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,880
because I wanted to test you

228
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,719
and stall you.

229
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,160
I sent you on a detour

230
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:26,000
so you arrive at the manor
at 5 o'clock in the evening.

231
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,199
At that hour of the day,

232
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,839
the toxicity of
Blood Chinquapin was much lower.

233
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,400
Only then will the blue flowers
be enough as an antidote.

234
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,280
Thank you for the help.

235
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,000
Otherwise, I would have been

236
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,160
another corpse lying there

237
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,479
with twitched muscles
and dark spots on my face.

238
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,439
Those are symptoms
caused by Wraith Bat poison.

239
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,800
There is no cure for that.

240
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,880
They would even throw their lives away.

241
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:54,759
We're here.

242
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,479
Put the baskets here.

243
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:57,560
Alright.

244
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,600
We must hide.

245
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,239
By the way,

246
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,519
I need you to promise me three things.

247
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,400
First, do not talk to anyone today.

248
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:06,400
Yes.

249
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,199
Secondly, do not fight anyone.

250
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,160
No hidden weapons.

251
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,039
Thirdly and most importantly,

252
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,880
stay within three steps of me.

253
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,560
Sure.

254
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,199
Here.

255
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,560
Put this in your mouth.

256
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,479
Do not swallow it.

257
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,959
Remember our promise.

258
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,120
Senior Murong!

259
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,999
My wife and I came here as promised.

260
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,600
Show yourself!

261
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,519
Show yourself,

262
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:39,120
or face my wrath.

263
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,519
My martial brother and sister.

264
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,080
You get more cunning by the day.

265
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,199
Cunning?

266
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,080
Spoken by the man who hid in a basket.

267
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:57,279
Eldest Senior.

268
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,400
My cunning shall stave off
your constant vigilance.

269
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,840
Are you sure you can
neutralize my poison?

270
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,560
Fine.

271
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,479
You got me.

272
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,199
This is the antidote.

273
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,999
Xiaotie was hurt by your poison.

274
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,400
Let's exchange antidotes.

275
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,439
What?

276
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,400
Xiaotie was poisoned?

277
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:18,279
What poison was it?

278
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,519
I haven't seen him in years.

279
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:23,959
How could I poison him?

280
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,519
But you...

281
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:27,239
You knocked me out halfway

282
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,560
and brought me here.

283
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,360
What is it that you want?

284
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Still playing dumb?

285
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,679
Xiaotie was hit by your poisoned dart.

286
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,400
You can drop the act now.

287
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,160
Congratulations on the cultivating of
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis.

288
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,640
That's the poison used on Xiaotie?

289
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,600
Jiang Tieshan,

290
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,560
if I managed to cultivate the flower,

291
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
would I still be standing here
wasting my time with you?

292
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:03,679
Didn't you ask us to come here?

293
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,320
Me?

294
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:07,759
You wrote this letter.

295
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,640
I recognize your handwriting.

296
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:12,990
(Come and meet at Black Tiger Grove)

297
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,160
(Come and meet at Black Tiger Grove)
I didn't write this.

298
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:17,479
But the handwriting is very similar.

299
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,719
Hand over the antidote

300
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,759
or die in Black Tiger Grove.

301
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,320
(To Murong Jingyue,
Jiang Tieshan, and Xue Que)

302
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,680
(I have grown sick
and tired of your squabbling)

303
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:27,600
Show yourself, Martial Sister.

304
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,999
Martial Sister.

305
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,320
The Verse of King of Poison
is in your possession.

306
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:04,840
Master favored her.

307
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,400
Of course he passed it to her.

308
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,759
Master raised and gave you knowledge.

309
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:09,920
You owed your life to him.

310
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,080
Yet, you care nothing about his death.

311
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,759
You only seek his book.

312
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,279
How cruel of you.

313
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:19,519
It seems our meeting and
the poison used on Xiaotie

314
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,800
are both your doings.

315
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,479
Hand over the Verse of King of Poison!

316
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,880
We studied under the same master.

317
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,439
Could you at least share it?

318
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:27,519
Yes.

319
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,719
Master passed
the Verse of King of Poison to me.

320
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,400
To my disciple Lingsu:

321
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:42,519
After my death,

322
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,439
relay my message
to your martial siblings.

323
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,400
If anyone of the three mourns my death,

324
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,160
you may reveal
the Verse of King of Poison to them.

325
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,920
Those who do not mourn my passing

326
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,759
no longer share any kinship with me.

327
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,479
They are no longer my disciples.

328
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,800
Remember this order.

329
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,279
Last words of Wu Chen.

330
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,199
Martial Sister, it's poison!

331
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,039
Watch out!

332
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,080
Martial Brother, let's leave.

333
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,800
Young Lady Ling.

334
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,479
What is wrong with him?

335
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,880
Young Lady Ling,

336
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:58,279
are you upset?

337
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,039
You didn't hesitate

338
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,560
to break your promise.

339
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,199
You talked despite I told you not to.

340
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,640
You fought despite

341
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,360
I said no.

342
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,039
I told you to stay
within three steps of me.

343
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,039
See for yourself.

344
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:11,199
Where do you stand now?

345
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,600
Young Lady Ling.

346
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,320
They fought with the intention to kill.

347
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,199
I was worried about you.

348
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,519
I forget the promise
in the heat of the moment.

349
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:25,719
You did it for me,

350
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,840
but you forgot everything I said.

351
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:30,039
You blame them for your mistakes.

352
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:31,239
You should be ashamed.

353
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,920
Brother Hu.

354
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,880
The couple never forget a grudge.

355
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,560
They will never stop haunting you.

356
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,039
They can't beat you in a fight,

357
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,560
but if they are to use poisons,

358
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,719
they will find an opening to poison you.

359
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,279
It's too late to think about that.

360
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,560
Let's not think about it.

361
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:51,320
You want to take the blame
for the whole situation

362
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,800
so they wouldn't come after me.

363
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,640
Why do you care so much about me?

364
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,279
Young Lady Ling,
I was returning the favor.

365
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,759
You gave me the blue flowers

366
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,479
and helped me avoid danger.

367
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,560
I care about you because I see you

368
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,439
as my good friend.

369
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,120
Do you mean that?

370
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:12,360
Very well.

371
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,439
I'll save you one more time.

372
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,199
Look at your palm.

373
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,800
If you hadn't stopped them,

374
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,279
I would have taken them down.

375
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,199
But you were only being thoughtful.

376
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,360
I appreciate that.

377
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,039
It was possible they could have hurt me

378
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:29,759
before passing out.

379
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,920
You need not worry about that.

380
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:35,039
Touch my shoulder with your hand.

381
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,320
If they had touched me,

382
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
they would've felt the pain.

383
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,840
Young Lady Ling.

384
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,640
Why is it touching your clothes

385
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,560
gives this burning pain?

386
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,479
Are the clothes covered in poison?

387
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,360
That is the effect of
the Scarlet Scorpion Powder.

388
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,840
It's not lethal.

389
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,600
But the poison in your palm
is more concerning.

390
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,959
Sit down. Let me have a look.

391
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,999
Young Lady Ling.

392
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:14,679
Did your martial siblings
learn Toxic Palm Strike too?

393
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:17,120
Of course.

394
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,479
We were disciples of the King of Poison.

395
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,800
Of course we learned that technique.

396
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,439
I knew it.

397
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,560
Master Wu Chen was
the real King of Poison.

398
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:28,759
But

399
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,479
did he pass away?

400
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,719
Why do your martial siblings

401
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:34,999
show no respect for him?

402
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,320
Young Lady Ling.

403
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,080
Did you write that note?

404
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,080
Yes.

405
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,439
My master had medical texts
copied by Eldest Senior.

406
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,160
I learned his handwriting.

407
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,400
(To whomever the letter is intended for)

408
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,800
But my master's last words

409
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,719
was written with
triple-refined alum solution.

410
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,959
The words only show
when heated by flame.

411
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,080
I use tiger bone marrow

412
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,320
to trace the writings.

413
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,719
So, the words glow in the dark.

414
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,279
You thought of everything.

415
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,439
I feel as if I know

416
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:12,840
nothing at all.

417
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:15,519
If I had even 10 percent of your wits,

418
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,959
that'd be great.

419
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,800
I learned how to use poison.

420
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,800
Every day, I think about
poisoning someone

421
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,920
without getting noticed.

422
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:24,039
I must be alert
to avoid getting poisoned.

423
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,719
I always live in fear.

424
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,679
I'll never know the peace

425
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,600
and freedom you have.

426
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:33,039
Young Lady Ling.

427
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,600
I think your senior is waking up.

428
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,719
No.

429
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:37,160
Not for another six hours.

430
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,279
I heard them talking
about the Verse of King of Poison.

431
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,039
It's a medical text, is it not?

432
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,120
Yes. It was the life's work
of my master.

433
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,679
I'll show you someday.

434
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,479
I hope it doesn't
poison my eyes when I read it.

435
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,519
Young Lady Ling, the poison is gone.

436
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:01,080
It's such a miracle.

437
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,320
I've never seen it before.

438
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,039
This is nothing.

439
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,719
You should see it
when my master opened up the body

440
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:08,080
and connected severed limbs.

441
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
Those are truly extraordinary.

442
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,679
Good point.

443
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,320
Your master could neutralize poisons,

444
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,600
and heal even more sicknesses.

445
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,880
That was how he lived up
to the name of King of Poison.

446
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,439
My master would be glad

447
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,039
to hear that.

448
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,600
He'd call you his young friend.

449
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,759
But sadly, he's no longer with us.

450
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,800
Your martial sister mentioned

451
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,600
that he favored you the most.

452
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,519
From what I see here,

453
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,479
only you miss him.

454
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,360
My master had four disciples.

455
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,039
You've met them all tonight.

456
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,320
Murong Jingyue is my eldest senior.

457
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:46,560
Xue Que was the youngest.

458
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:49,199
My master didn't plan
to accept another disciple.

459
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,439
But the three of them
were always fighting.

460
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,840
He was worried

461
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,400
no one could stop them
after his passing.

462
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,120
So, he made me his disciple
when he was in his old age.

463
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:00,160
They weren't born evil.

464
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:03,479
But Xue Que married Tieshan.

465
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,439
So, they had a feud with Jingyue.

466
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:07,439
Why is that?

467
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,479
Jingyue was already married.

468
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,519
But Xue Que was in love with him.

469
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,120
So, she poisoned and killed his wife.

470
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,560
Perhaps the knowledge of poison

471
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,880
could make one cruel.

472
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,320
Out of anger,

473
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,360
Jingyue poisoned Xue Que.

474
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,920
The poison made her
a limping hunchback.

475
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,239
My master went to Tibet to gather herbs.

476
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:31,400
The damage was already
irreversible when he came back.

477
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:34,039
But Tieshan had always loved Xue Que.

478
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,519
He loved her despite her disabilities.

479
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,999
He married her.

480
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:39,800
But somehow

481
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,479
after the two got married,

482
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,759
Jingyue fell in love with Xue Que.

483
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:44,800
He began to pester her.

484
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,959
Master tried to talk him out of it.

485
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,999
It got on his nerve.

486
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,160
But the three of them
went on a vicious cycle.

487
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,479
Tieshan is loyal to his love.

488
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,959
His love for his wife never wavered.

489
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,080
The couple built a house

490
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,160
in the valley.

491
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,479
They planted Blood Chinquapin
around the house.

492
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,199
The plants were meant

493
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:04,120
to keep Jingyue away.

494
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,080
But they had made too many enemies.

495
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:09,160
That house

496
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,519
became their shelter.

497
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,439
I see now why there are
different rumors

498
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:15,320
about the King of Poison.

499
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,479
Some said he was reckless.

500
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,239
Some said she was limping.

501
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:22,039
Some said he was a scholar.

502
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:24,279
Some even said he was a monk.

503
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,600
My master would never
admit to these claims.

504
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,039
He once said

505
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,840
he felt proud to be call
the King of Medicine.

506
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,640
But calling him the King of Poison?

507
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,120
Was he a merciless murderer?

508
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,080
My master used poisons
as if they were extension of him.

509
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,320
His three disciples
hurt innocent lives.

510
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:41,679
For these reasons,
the name King of Poison

511
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
has been making a wave
in the martial art world.

512
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,320
Whenever there is

513
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,999
a mystery that involves poison,

514
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,880
the blame

515
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,880
will always be placed
on the King of Poison.

516
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,600
Don't you think that's wrong?

517
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,600
Why didn't he come out and clarify?

518
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,199
Clarifying would only make it worse.

519
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,239
There is no end to this.

520
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,199
There are two more things to be done.

521
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,199
Are we going to visit
your martial siblings?

522
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:10,239
It's my fault.

523
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,160
Had I not gotten so rash,

524
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,519
you could have seized them both.

525
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:14,920
I'm glad you know that.

526
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:15,640
Let's go.

527
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,600
By the way,

528
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,160
should we drop
your eldest senior in the basket?

529
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,039
He's all yours.

530
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:23,880
Alright.

531
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,360
Xiaotie, hang in there.

532
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:00,600
I'm here for you.
I will cure you.

533
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,360
Brother Wang.

534
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,800
You may have your revenge today.

535
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,320
Great.

536
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,679
Let's go.

537
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,959
Brother Hu, leave the basket outside.

538
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:52,760
Sure.

539
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,439
Martial Brother, Martial Sister,

540
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,599
I'm here.

541
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:02,880
Martial Brother, Martial Sister?

542
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,680
Lingsu is here.

543
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:13,639
Go.

544
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,800
Reinforce the entrance.

545
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,079
They must never get in here.

546
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,400
Where is everyone?

547
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:27,959
Did they run away?

548
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,559
Brother Wang knows where they are.

549
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,720
You should have killed that blacksmith!

550
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,999
Without him,

551
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:53,720
our enemies still know where we are.

552
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,039
And more importantly,

553
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:57,439
her blue flowers can
neutralize the Blood Chinquapin poison!

554
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,400
Brother Wang.

555
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,079
Could you block the other air vent?

556
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,999
Sure.

557
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,840
Brother Hu, come with me.

558
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,439
Bad news.

559
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,760
Lingsu is not coming in,

560
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,240
she is keeping us in!

561
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,119
Come down here.

562
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:32,159
Increase the heat.

563
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,920
We must cure Xiaotie of the poison now.

564
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,760
It's the Seven Pistil
Chaenomeles sinensis poison!

565
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,240
How are we supposed to cure him?

566
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,959
There must be a way.

567
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,280
Should we just let our son die?

568
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,439
Come down here.

569
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:40,880
Is it going to work?
