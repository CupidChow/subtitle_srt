3
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,319
Young man,

4
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,119
thank you to you too.

5
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,119
You are too kind, Hero Miao.

6
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,039
After chatting with you
in the past few days,

7
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,440
you had talked about a lot of places.

8
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,240
I never thought
that you would be so knowledgeable

9
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,279
at such a young age.

10
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,599
It's just because

11
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,879
I live the life of a nomad.

12
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:19,207
Six years ago,

13
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,520
had you been

14
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,920
to Shang's Fort?

15
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,399
I've never been there.

16
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,839
Hero Miao.

17
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,040
What is your story

18
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,159
with the Shang's Fort?

19
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,719
It embarrasses me to bring it up.

20
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,640
(I let my guard down.)

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,360
(I was trapped
inside a hallway built )

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,159
(with fine steel.)

23
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,399
(The villains started a fire outside.)

24
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:49,800
(They wanted to burn me to death.)

25
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,279
Burning a metal house?

26
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,200
It sounded like they wanted

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,399
to turn you into stew.

28
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,080
You are correct.

29
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,760
No matter how strong I was,

30
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,320
there was no way
to pry the steel walls open.

31
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,320
But there was a young man.

32
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,439
(He risked his life for me)

33
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,119
(to open the doors.)

34
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,320
A young man?

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,999
After he opened the doors,

36
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,119
he vanished.

37
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,360
I asked around about him,

38
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,999
but to no avail.

39
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,439
All I could learn was that

40
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,640
he used the Hu's Saber Techniques.

41
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,159
Hero Miao.

42
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,200
Do you think Brother Hu here

43
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,480
is connected to that young man?

44
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,839
I'm flattered.

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,279
That young man
saved you from certain death.

46
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,559
He was a brave hero.

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,240
I'm afraid I'm not as brave.

48
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,200
Brother Hu.

49
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,719
You are a great martial artist.

50
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,360
Whom did you learn it from?

51
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,360
I was raised by Fourth Uncle.

52
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,679
I learned martial art from him.

53
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,360
Every move and attack you used

54
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,200
was from the Hu's Saber Techniques.

55
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,119
May I know if you are related to

56
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,279
the Legend of Liaodong, Hu Yidao?

57
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:13,679
Hero Miao.

58
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,000
I learned the Hu's Saber Techniques

59
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,520
under your guidance.

60
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:48,239
-Congratulations, Lord Tian!
-Congratulations, Lord Tian!

61
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,680
-A double delight.
-Your future is certainly bright!

62
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:53,919
Thank you.

63
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,000
Thank you.

64
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:56,039
Leader Tian.

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,839
Brother Zhou is waiting upstairs.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,760
Welcome.

67
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,599
Talk about a meteoric rise.

68
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,200
Saw the Emperor's thumb ring?

69
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,440
After years of service,

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,719
we've never seen it,

71
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,279
much less rewarded with it.

72
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,440
Some flattery can get you a long way.

73
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:19,520
People like us

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,760
can only envy it.

75
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
Just how lucky can

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,239
Tian Guinong get?

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,279
He intercepted the message

78
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,120
from the Red Flower Club.

79
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,159
Leader Tian.

80
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,799
Hero Zhou, Brother Zhou!

81
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,320
Leader Tian.

82
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,640
The Tianlong Sect is now
one of the Eight Great Sects.

83
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,680
You've earned the trust of Official Fu.

84
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,560
Our brethren

85
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,039
are all counting on you.

86
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:54,760
Thank you.

87
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,239
(Grandeur And Luxury)
Welcome.

88
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,000
(Grandeur And Luxury)
Welcome.

89
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,000
Brother Hu.

90
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,520
Why did you lie again?

91
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,479
That book in your bag

92
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:24,719
is the Saber Manual of Hu.

93
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,839
Young Lady Ling.

94
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,479
I'll be honest with you.

95
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,399
Miao Renfeng

96
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,279
killed my parents.

97
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,479
The young man in his story was me.

98
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,479
I met him six years ago at Shang's Fort.

99
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:44,479
He was locked inside that steel cage.

100
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,839
The fire almost took his life.

101
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,359
But, I saved him.

102
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:49,799
Why would you save him?

103
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,560
Only the despicable take advantage
of another's predicament.

104
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,200
I want to avenge my parents,

105
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:56,839
but I shall do righteously
with a clear conscience.

106
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,279
He must die by my blade.

107
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,279
I understand.

108
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,640
You wanted me to save him

109
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,599
so you could kill him yourself.

110
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,799
When his eyes heal,

111
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,399
you'll duel him.

112
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:13,359
Yes.

113
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:18,039
Brother Hu.

114
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,320
You saw how powerful

115
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,039
Hero Miao could be.

116
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:23,640
Even when he was blind

117
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,200
and surrounded in the house,

118
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,640
he could still hold his own.

119
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,719
He even gave you guidance
to defeat Tian Guinong.

120
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:30,680
When his eyes heal,

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,039
he could be unbeatable.

122
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,880
Are you sure you can win?

123
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,120
I have no idea.

124
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,479
For as long as I could remember,

125
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,960
I had been learning
martial art from Fourth Uncle.

126
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,880
I learned martial art

127
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,560
so I could avenge my parents.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,200
I don't care if I can win.

129
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,640
That fight is inevitable.

130
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,599
If that was the case,

131
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,440
I wouldn't have saved him.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Young Lady Ling,
you did the right thing.

133
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,359
I must ask you

134
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,039
to treat his eyes

135
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:11,320
so he can regain his sight.

136
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,680
You shall have my gratitude.

137

(Juying Restaurant)

138
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,919
(Juying Restaurant)
I appreciate the feast, gentlemen.

139
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,880
When I

140
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,399
hold a banquet someday,

141
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,080
be sure to be there.

142
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,479
Of course.

143
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,719
We will certainly be there.

144
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,879
Official Tang has arrived.

145
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,400
Welcome upstairs.

146
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,119
(Chief of Sancai Sword, Tang Pei)
It's been too long, Official Tang.

147
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,800
How is the business?

148
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,759
(Grandeur And Luxury)
Not bad.

149

(Grandeur And Luxury)

150
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,080
(Grandeur And Luxury)
This man

151
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,639
knows he's going
to lose his power and status.

152
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,839
He's here to earn Leader Tian's favor.

153
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,200
Official Tang

154
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,119
must not be underestimated.

155
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,239
He's not a very good fighter,

156
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,080
but no information can escape him.

157
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,560
He reports everything

158
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,759
in the martial art world
to the Imperial Court.

159
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,639
The credits he's earned?

160
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,960
It's beyond measure!

161
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,680
But unfortunately for him,

162
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,719
the martial art world
has been peaceful lately.

163
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,680
The Red Flower Club

164
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,119
is the only thing
that worries His Majesty.

165
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,800
He's been keeping an eye
on the Red Flower Club.

166
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,200
But he got nothing.

167
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,920
As it turned out,
Lord Tian got ahead of him.

168
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,239
Impressive.

169
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:29,839
Not at all.

170
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,359
Here he comes.

171
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,400
Hero Tang!

172
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:38,320
Hero Tang, welcome.

173
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,400
You are all here.

174
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,400
Pardon my tardiness.

175
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,320
Leader Tian.

176
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,920
Congratulations.

177
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,800
Isn't this

178
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,200
the Blessing of
Seven Provinces Official Tang?

179
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,719
I requested to meet you many times.

180
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,999
But you were always otherwise engaged.

181
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,440
But here you are!

182
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,119
I must be blessed!

183
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,879
I've finally met you.

184
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,119
Let's all sit down.

185
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:11,800
Take a seat, Official Tang.

186
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,239
Take a seat.

187
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:13,800
Have a seat.

188
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,280
Leader Tian.

189
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,759
I was busy with the affairs of my work.

190
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,999
I apologize for the inconvenience.

191
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,879
Well, since I was late,

192
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,359
I shall drink as my punishment.

193
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,239
I've long heard about Leader Tian's
heroic deeds and generosity.

194
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,239
My apologies.

195
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,440
Not at all, Official Tang.

196
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,759
We both serve the Imperial Court
and Commander Fu.

197
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
We are on the same side.

198
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,560
You are correct, Leader Tian.

199
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,680
You've made a wave
in the Imperial Court, Leader Tian.

200
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,479
You've made the martial art world proud.

201
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
-Yes.
-I'm flattered.

202
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,560
However,

203
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,400
His Majesty is unpredictable.

204
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,400
His orders must not be disobeyed.

205
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:22,040
Serving him

206
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:24,479
is not the same as running a business.

207
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
A business is about
making or losing money.

208
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
But if we fail

209
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:30,519
our mission,

210
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,239
all the hard work
could go down the drain,

211
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,359
or worse,

212
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,280
we could lose the head.

213
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:51,440
Your words...

214
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,040
They are certainly truthful.

215
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,200
I shall

216
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,680
keep your advice in mind.

217
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,440
Come on.

218
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
The food has gone cold.

219
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,839
Let's eat up.

220
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,639
Come on.

221
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,080
Dig in.

222
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,719
Hero Miao.

223
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,519
Why are you drinking?

224
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,839
Keep this a secret for me.

225
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,800
Do not tell Young Lady Cheng.

226
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,719
Scared?

227
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,400
Scared?

228
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,320
You didn't save
a single drop of it for me.

229
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,280
The young man who saved me

230
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,719
at Shang's Fort did the same thing.

231
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,999
You two...

232
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,879
seem one of the same to me.

233
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,800
When you fought Tian Guinong,

234
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,839
the techniques you used

235
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,200
were the same as I described.

236
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,400
If you hadn't done
your research on the techniques,

237
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,479
there was no way you could
master the Hu's Saber Techniques

238
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,839
just by listening.

239
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,119
Therefore,

240
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,800
the Fourth Uncle you mentioned

241
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,080
was the loyal servant
of the Hu Family, Ping Si.

242
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,960
And you,

243
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,080
your connection
to the legendary Hu Yidiao

244
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,960
must be more than just the surname.

245
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,839
If my guess is right,

246
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,560
you are Brother Hu's son.

247
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,400
Am I right?

248
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,560
Yes.

249
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,879
I am Hu Yidiao's son.

250
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,200
My name is Hu Fei.

251
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,479
I have a question for you, Hero Miao.

252
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,239
Why did you kill my parents?

253
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,160
Your father left this.

254
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:57,719
Do you want to learn the truth?

255
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,080
You must use this blade

256
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:07,239
to defeat me.

257
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,280
Bring it on.

258
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:13,879
Show me how much of
the Hu's Saber Techniques

259
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,759
you've mastered.

You killed my parents

270
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,200
but also gave me guidance.

271
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,079
What is your motive?

272
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,279
If you and my father were friends,

273
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,079
why did you kill him?

274

Tell me the truth!

275
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:51,840
Tell me!

276

If I hadn't been so rash,

if I hadn't been blinded by fame,

278
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,519
none of this would've happened.

279

But what's done

280

can't be undone.

Avenge your parents!

283

That

284
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,759
is the truth.

I don't know about your past with him.

But there is one thing I believe.

00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,680
but it ended up killing him.

340
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,160
You have my respect.

341
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,160
Please show respect for my friend.

342
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,479
If Hero Miao and my master

343
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,559
hadn't been so prideful,

344
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,039
if they had sat down

345
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,200
and talked it through,

346
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,239
perhaps they could have known

347
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,640
where the poison
on that blade came from.

348
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,519
My master

349
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,719
never stopped dwelling on it.

350
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,519
The thought of it

351
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,519
made him sigh a little.

352
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,400
When I heard

353
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,880
you tried to save Hero Miao,

354
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,920
I didn't hesitate to come here.

355
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,200
Brother Hu,

356
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,319
I didn't come here for you.

357
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,279
I thought Hero Miao

358
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:15,719
became blind because of another poison.

359
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:18,079
But when I treated him,

360
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:21,239
I learned only the brewing method
from Medicine King Valley

361
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:22,960
can formulate this poison.

362
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:27,640
Thankfully, I planted
the Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis.

363
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:29,799
Otherwise, not even I could save him.

364
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,160
Could it be

365
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,039
your martial siblings
who created this poison?

366
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,120
That was beyond their capabilities.

367
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,759
My master had only mentioned
this brewing method.

368
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,239
He never allowed anyone to use it.

369
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,039
Without the Seven Pistil
Chaenomeles sinensis,

370
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,120
there is no antidote to this poison.

371
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,200
Is it the same poison

372
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,079
that took the lives

373
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:55,920
of my parents?

374
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:01,360
It happened so long ago.

375
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,279
There is no way to prove it.

376
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:07,759
But my master passed his mantle to me.

377
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:09,640
It's my duty to find the truth.

378
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,319
I can't let the evildoers

379
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,039
go unpunished.

380
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,920
If you tell the truth,

381
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,160
I must

382
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,519
find the true culprit.

383
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,600
I think we seek

384
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,880
the same culprit.

385
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,200
By the way,

386
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,440
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering

387
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,600
will be held in the capital soon.

388
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,440
Warriors from different sects

389
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,479
will be there.

390
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,200
If we go there,

391
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,920
we might learn a thing or two.

392
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:45,840
Sure.

393
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,719
We'll go there.

394
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:50,360
Young Lady Ling.

395
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,799
Thank you.

396
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,200
Wonderful!

397
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,120
Wonderful!

398
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,079
I asked for an audience with Tang Pei,

399
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,759
but he shut me outside his doorstep.

400
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,279
He did it several times.

401
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,400
He looked down on the Tianlong Sect.

402
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:14,880
Fine.

403
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,120
As of now,

404
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,160
the Tianlong Sect is one
of the Eight Great Sects,

405
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,719
I can finally...

406
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,160
trample him!

407
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,039
Very astute, Leader Tian.

408
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
The Tianlong Sect is prospering.

409
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,719
Even His Majesty knows the name.

410
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,999
No one would dare look down on us.

411
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:45,680
Let me see it.

412
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,759
Check out this precious ring.

413
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,440
Now,

414
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,120
I can finally redeem myself before Lan.

415
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,319
Young Lady Ling,

416
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,039
his eyes...

417
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:13,880
Don't worry.

418
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,120
I've given the herbs to Senior Sun.

419
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,920
He will be fully healed
after a few treatments.

420
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,559
Brother Hu, Young Lady Cheng,

421
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:33,719
where are you going?

422
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,719
Senior Sun,

423
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:36,999
it's urgent.

424
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,160
Take care of

425
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,920
Hero Miao and Xiaomei for us.

426
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,360
What's so urgent?

427
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,160
Some personal feuds.

428
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,680
Senior Sun,

429
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,039
until we meet again.

430
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,680
Until we meet again.

431
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,160
Xiaomei, be good
and listen to Hero Miao.

432
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,120
Brother Hu, Young Lady Cheng,

433
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,440
don't take too long!

434
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,079
Sure!

435
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:32,999
Leader Tian,

436
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,680
don't be so stingy.

437
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,039
Bring it out and let us have a look.

438
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:37,680
Yeah!

439
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,400
Isn't that right?

440
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:42,279
His Majesty has graced the Tianlong Sect

441
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:44,160
by giving this jade thumb ring.

442
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:46,640
He wants me to remember his kindness,

443
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,319
not to show you off.

444
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,360
Tao.

445
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,960
Order the workers

446
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,680
to start constructing the hall.

447
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,039
I will keep this precious
thumb ring from His Majesty

448
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,400
in the main hall

449
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,840
so every member of
the Tianlong Sect can see it.

450
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,680
This isn't showing off.

451
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,920
I want them to always remember

452
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,960
His Majesty's grace.

453
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,160
It's to remind us
to serve His Majesty.

454
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,479
There is no doubt

455
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:16,719
the Tianlong Sect
will prosper even more!

456
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,680
It will be the greatest sect
in the martial art world!

457
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
-Yes!
-Well said!

458
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,319
Don't be ridiculous.

459
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,279
We can't become the greatest

460
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,999
on an empty belly!

461
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,999
Get to your tables,

462
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,319
drink to your heart's content!

463
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,440
Get to your tables, drink heartily!

464
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,340
Welcome. This way.

465
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,980
Welcome. This way.

466
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,239
Where is my wife?

467
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,600
Leader Tian,

468
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:44,880
she has a headache.

469
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,759
She won't be joining.

470
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,999
Take care of the guests.

471
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,279
Yes.

472
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:13,519
Lan?

473
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,999
Guinong, what brings you here?

474
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,479
You should be with your friends
and have fun.

475
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,719
Don't let me bother you.

476
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,239
It's fine.

477
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,479
By the way,

478
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,719
how are the jewelry and fabrics
I brought back from the capital?

479
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,680
Do you like them?

480
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,440
Yes. I like them.

481
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,479
I knew.

482
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,719
I couldn't bring Ruolan back.

483
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,759
I've let you down.

484
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,999
It's not your fault.

485
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,559
I just miss the child.

486
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,079
Don't worry.

487
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,999
I will fulfill my promise to you.

488
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,840
Take good care of yourself.

489
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,200
Think about it.

490
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,799
When Ruolan finally comes here,

491
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,160
wouldn't it be great

492
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,719
for her to have a sibling

493
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,079
as a playmate?

494
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,319
I have good news.

495
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,559
This is

496
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:27,600
the thumb ring given by His Majesty.

497
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,039
The friends and guests in the courtyard

498
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,200
were dying to look at it.

499
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,279
But,

500
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,079
I must share the joy with you first.

501
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,840
His Majesty's grace is unmeasurable.

502
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,200
Look.

503
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:41,640
In the future,

504
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,600
I, Tian Guinong,

505
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,600
will be a high-ranking officer!

506
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,200
You will be given
the title of a noblewoman.

507
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:54,319
You earned His Majesty's favor,

508
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,920
you won't have time for me.

509
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,279
Lan,

510
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,759
are you not happy about my success?

511
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,999
Fame and power

512
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,440
are glorious to the eyes,

513
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:14,079
but they could easily
cost you your life.

514
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:18,280
I am worried about you.

515
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,240
I did all of this

516
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,280
for our future.

517
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:24,999
Yes, I get it.

518
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,559
Tend to your friends.

519
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,240
I won't be joining.

520
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,519
I feel tired.

521
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,760
I'm going to bed.

522
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,199
Yes. Rest well.

523
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,880
I can see Ruolan again.

524
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,320
Are your eyes well again?

525
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,440
Young Lady Cheng's antidote

526
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,400
worked magic.

527
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
Soon enough,

528
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,639
your eyes will be as sharp as before.

529
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:19,840
Hero Miao.

530
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,280
Can you see now?

531
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,079
It's still blurred.

532
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,159
But I'll manage.

533
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,599
Where is Brother Hu?

534
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,519
Where is Young Lady Cheng?

535
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,159
They went ahead and left.

536
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,760
They want you

537
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,119
to rest well and recover.

538
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,479
Do not push yourself too hard.

539
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,599
Brother Hu.

540
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,079
What are you looking for?

541
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,400
I left something

542
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,920
back in Hero Miao's home.

543
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,720
I packed your luggage for you.

544
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,240
I put the Saber Manual
of Hu in your bag.

545
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,599
There were other things.

546
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
Some money and whatnot.

547
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,519
Without them,

548
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,199
we can't get accommodation.

549
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,639
I have money.

550
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,679
Don't worry.

551
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,360
Are you looking for this?

552
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,240
Young Lady Ling.

553
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,159
You thought of everything.

554
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,920
You got everything packed for me.

555
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:53,960
The Saber Manual of Hu

556
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:54,960
and money

557
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,639
are nothing compared to this.

558
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:11,500
(Memorial Tablet of
Sworn Brother Hu Yidao and His Wife)

559
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,679
Brother, Sister-in-Law,

560
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,320
it's been 18 years.

561
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,840
I've finally found your son.

562
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,280
(Memorial Tablet of
Sworn Brother Hu Yidao and His Wife)

563
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,679
It seems everything
was destined to happen.

564
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,999
Hero Miao.

565
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,119
Hero Hu had passed on years ago.

566
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,519
His son

567
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,960
not only cured your blindness

568
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,800
but also fought by your side.

569
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:43,519
It's truly

570
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,320
a tale to be told.

571
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:47,880
If Hero Hu could see it now,

572
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,880
he would be relieved.

573
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,820
(Memorial Tablet of
Sworn Brother Hu Yidao and His Wife)

574
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,639
Your son has great potential.

575
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,760
He has a remarkable sense of justice.

576
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,159
Someday,

577
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,320
he will conquer the martial art world.
