we hadn't had peace since then!

5
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,820
Folks, beat him up.

6
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,610
If you give him a punch,
I'll reward you with ten taels.

7
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,210
If you beat him to death,

with ten thousand taels!

Ten thousand taels.

12
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,210
So much money.

13
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,370
-Kill them.
-They're good people. Right.

Old Master Feng,
please have mercy on them.

17
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,050
Are you all deaf?

18
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,020
They're good people, Old Master Feng.

19
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,540
They're nice.

20
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,020
You don't even want tael for free!

21
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,980
Or

22
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,370
do you want

Folks!

You'll get what you deserve.

Why do you try to be a hero?

Save your breath.

Today, you're caught by me.
You can't live

33
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,300
unless you kill them all.

34
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,250
Come on and beat them!

35

Anyone

who doesn't do it today

37
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,970
is against our Feng Family

38

and the accomplice of the two thieves.

39
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,730
Don't blame me

40
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,500
for turning against you

41
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,330
by then.

You can't beat them.

-They're not bad people but good people.
-San.

They're good people.

49

You can't beat good people.

50
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,090
You can't kill bad people.

51

You little brat!

52

Let him beat first.

54

Otherwise, I'll bury you alive today.

55
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,700
You can't beat them.

56
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,980
We can't do it.

57

We can't do it either.

if you want to.

63
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,820
You've seen how miserable

64

Mrs. Zhong's family is.

65

Don't be afraid.

66
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,050
This lady

67
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,770
also got hurt

68
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,300
because she stood out for you.

69
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,610
Can you really do it?

70
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,610
Even if you're willing

71
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,100
to do anything for Feng Tiannan,

72
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,580
do you really want

73
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,420
to help him

74
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,730
do evil deeds?

75
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,450
He's a nice man. You can't kill him.

76
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,210
-He's a nice man.
-We can't kill them.

Stop it!

83

You caused big trouble.

84

What's wrong, Father?

85
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,380
These unruly people

86

are rebellious.

87

(Feng's Residence)
Get them out of here! Drive them out!

What matters now

97
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,180
is to stay alive.

98

It seems that we can't stay
in Foshan anymore.

Go and block the door. Come on!

Father.

Go. Hurry up.

Father, where are we going?

I'm afraid

you've started doing this.

177
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,460
You're taking a risk.

178
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,500
Then let's take

a greater risk.

180
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,650
How nice.

I came to send an invitation

You don't have to worry.

it's a good opportunity.

they must choose a new sect leader.

At that time,

you only have to come forward

and seek justice for the chosen one.

Master passed away.

Please forgive us
for any inconsiderate hospitality.

On the order of Official Fu Kang'an,

236
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,810
we're here to invite Master Wan,
renowned in Jiangnan,

237
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,740
to the capital to attend
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

238
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,460
So that the martial arts
of Shaolin Weituo Sect

239
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,260
can be shown in front
of the world's martial arts masters.

240
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,170
We didn't expect Master Wan to pass away.

241
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,530
What a pity.

242
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,100
It was unfortunate.

243
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,020
Thank you, Your Honor.

244
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,340
Although Mr. Wan passed away,

245
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,140
Shaolin Weituo Sect

246
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,620
is a famous sect
in the martial arts world.

247
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,170
You must attend
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

248
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,220
I wonder who will succeed
the sect leader of your sect.

249
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,570
Master passed away all of a sudden.

250
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,290
He didn't leave his last words.

251
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,940
It seems

252
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,610
it'll take a lot of time

253
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,530
to choose the new sect leader.

254
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,420
The Sect Leaders Gathering
hosted by Official Fu will be held

255
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
during the Mid-Autumn
Festival of August.

256
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,370
There are only two months left.

257
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,370
There must be a leader
for Weituo Sect.

258
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,530
Please choose a sect leader
as soon as possible.

Before Official He and I leave,

All right.

263
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,610
We'll discuss it with each other

the three disciples

He's the first disciple of Sect Leader Wan.

315
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,460
He has been following Sect Leader Wan
since he was young.

316
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,420
He also learned the most profound

317
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,570
martial arts of Weituo Sect.

is the second disciple.

320
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,130
He's thoughtful and resourceful.

321
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,220
The changes in the martial arts used
are the most proficient.

322
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,570
The one on the far side is Yang Bin.

323
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,940
He's their third junior disciple.

324
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,050
He's the latest to enter the sect.

325
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,530
But he makes great progress
in the martial arts.

326
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,610
Compared with his two senior disciples,

327
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,740
he's not inferior.

328
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,850
In this case,

329
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,850
fighting for the sect leader

330
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,130
is also a big event.

331
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,530
But it's not easy

332
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,420
for us to take the initiative
to interfere.

333
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,370
It's not difficult.

334

335
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,050
I'll ask them to come over

337

We're here.

338
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,850
We're finally here.

339
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,740
You'll be saved soon.

340
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,640
(Weituo Sect)

341
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,980
What's going on?

342
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,740
Where's Sect Leader Wan?

343
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,900
I'd like to meet Sect Leader Wan.

344
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,570
Sect Leader Wan has passed away.

345
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,050
What?

346
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,460
Why don't you let me in?

347
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,220
Young Lady,

348
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,180
didn't I tell you?

349
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,420
The old sect leader passed away.

350
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,130
I'm the old friend of Sect Leader Wan.

351
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,220
It's the keepsake he gave me.

352
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,290
He asked me to bring it

353
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,660
to find him if I needed help.

354
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,850
Well, Young Lady.

355
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,090
Don't make it difficult for us.

356
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,050
We don't know

357
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,500
whether it's the keepsake
of the sect leader.

358
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,700
What's more, Sect Leader Wan has passed away.

359
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,050
There's no point going in with this.

360
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,740
Then I go in to worship him, can I?

361
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,090
Official He.

362
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,050
Official He.

363
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,530
Senior Sun.

364
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,220
Official He is here as well.

365
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,700
If you have anything to say, go ahead.

366
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,020
Official He.

367
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,050
You've had a long day travelling

368
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,420
to our Weituo Sect.

369
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,660
Senior Sun.

370
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,290
The time of this trip
is pressing for Official He.

371
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,130
He has to go to other sects

372
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,370
to send invitations
of the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

373
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,370
When will the sect leader
of Weituo Sect

374
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,770
be selected?

375
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,260
We're discussing it.

376
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,900
Do you need to discuss it?

377
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,500
You're the first disciple.

378
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,850
You should

379
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,660
succeed the sect leader.

380
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,940
What do you think, Official He?

381
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,370
It's reasonable.

382
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,420
Thank you two for your appreciation.

383
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,740
But my second junior disciple

384
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,130
is also determined
to be the sect leader.

385
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,090
Official He will back you up.

386
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,020
Don't worry about it.

387
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,460
Thank you very much.

388
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,050
Official He.

389
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,330
This string of Buddha beads
is our most precious asset.

390
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,570
It's my little token of appreciation.

391
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,420
Please accept it, Official He.

392
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,530
Official He.

393
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,420
The Buddha beads
are indeed a good thing.

394
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,610
But Senior Sun,

395
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,850
I heard that

396
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,700
the Epiphyllum Dew Cream

397
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,290
is the most precious asset
of Weituo Sect.

398
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,050
The Epiphyllum Dew Cream

399
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,660
is indeed our most precious asset.

400
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,260
But only the sect leader has the right

401
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,980
to use and control it.

402
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,050
But it's all right.

403
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,500
If you two

404
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,500
can make me the sect leader,

405
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,420
I'll offer it to you.

406
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,770
Martial Uncle. Martial Uncle!

407
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,700
Oh, Martial Uncle!

408
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,810
Stop covering up the memorial tablets.

409
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,370
Go and have a look.

410
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,130
They're about to fight outside.

411
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,050
What's the matter?

412
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,370
There are two officials outside.

413
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,740
They're here to send the invitation
of the Sect Leaders Gathering.

414
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,850
Eldest Senior and Second Eldest Senior
are aggressive

415
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,330
after they heard about it.

416
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,700
The disciples urge them
to compete in martial arts

417
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,290
to decide on the sect leader.

418
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,220
Go out and tell them

419
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,130
that no one is allowed to fight today.

420
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,980
Let's wait until
your master is laid to rest.

421
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,940
Well, they won't listen to me.

422
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,290
Don't you see that I'm covering up
the memorial tablets?

423
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,370
Your master just passed away.

424
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:39,570
I have to cover up
the memorial tablets of our ancestors.

425
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,370
We can't disturb them.

426
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,530
Well.

427
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,570
This way.

428
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,610
The garden house where Epiphyllum
is planted is right ahead.

429
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,130
I'll bring you two there.

430
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,130
This way, Official He.

431
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,980
It's the Epiphyllum garden of our sect.

432
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,500
So the Epiphyllum Dew Cream

433
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,090
is made of these Epiphyllum flowers.

434
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,090
Yes.

435
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,260
It's said that the Epiphyllum Dew Cream
can build muscles from damaged tissues.

436
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,940
The curative effect is incredible.

437
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,530
Indeed.

438
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,020
For the injured,

439
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,130
it has the miraculous effect of
building muscles from damaged tissues.

440
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,260
If it's an ordinary person,

441
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,370
especially a woman,

442
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,370
it can keep

443
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,290
a youthful appearance after applying it.

444
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,370
Is it really miraculous?

445
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,130
Official He.

446
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,420
Then we have to take some back

447
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,850
for the women
in the Official Fu's Residence to try.

448
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,770
Your Honor.

449
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,130
Don't worry.

450
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,460
If I can succeed as the sect leader,

451
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,090
I'll offer it to you.

452
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,370
In fact,

453
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,020
my senior's Agarwood Bead is nothing.

454
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,980
This pair of King Kong's Pestle

455
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,290
is the real treasure.

456
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,370
It's said that

457
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,130
it already existed
when the founder of Weituo Sect

458
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:41,940
established the sect.

459
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,220
It has been handed down.

460
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,420
Please accept it, Your Honor.

461
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,570
Your Honor, this way, please.

462
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,090
Martial Uncle! Martial Uncle!

463
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,700
Martial Uncle!

464
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,810
What's the matter again?

465
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,940
Eldest Senior and Second Eldest Senior

466
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,850
have found
these two officials in private.

467
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,810
It seems

468
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,290
they have to fight today.

469
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,180
Since they're going to fight,

470
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,980
you can go and fight with them.

471
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,220
You can fight

472
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,090
for the position of the sect leader
fair and square.

473
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,740
I'm afraid I also can't beat them.

474
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,940
If you had listened to my advice earlier

475
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,900
by playing less and practising more,

476
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,770
it wouldn't have turned out like this.

477
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,220
No, Martial Uncle.

478
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,940
Are you going to let it be?

479
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,130
I can't be

480
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,940
the sect leader.

481
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,020
What can I do?

482
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,570
Oh, Junior.

483
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,370
You know I'm lazy.

484
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,050
Over the years,

485
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,940
you've handled

486
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,180
all the sect's affairs alone.

487
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,260
I also felt at ease.

488
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,660
But you should do good to the end.

489
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,020
You brought

490
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,660
such big trouble when you left.

491
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,330
Forget it.

492
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,020
You took care of me all your life.

493
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,940
I'll help you

494
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,460
anyway this time.

495
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,370
Let you leave carefree.

496
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,500
(Memorial Tablet of Wan Hesheng)

497
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:26,760
(Memorial Tablet of Wan Hesheng)

498
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,700
Senior.

499
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,420
Why would Official He

500
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,700
have the beads Master left to you?

501
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,090
Cut the crap.

502
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,370
If you're dissatisfied,

503
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,370
let's compete in martial arts.

504
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,570
Okay.

505
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,770
Martial arts world fellows.

506
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,370
Disciples in the same sect.

507
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,570
Both officials from the capital.

508
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,850
Since ancient times,

509
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,330
those with excellent martial arts
often boasted they were incomparable.

510
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,290
Today, I'd like you to witness this.

511
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,180
I'll compete with Senior Sun here.

512
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,700
Whoever wins

513
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,770
will be the new sect leader
of Weituo Sect.

514
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,260
The sect leader has just passed away.

515
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,740
But they fight for the position
of the sect leader now.

516
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,220
That's great.

517
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,740
The one with high martial arts skills
will succeed the sect leader.

518
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,220
Even if it gets to
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering,

519
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,370
it'll help Weituo Sect become famous

520
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,370
in the martial arts world.

521
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,570
Both of you compete
before the memorial tablet of Mr. Wan.

522
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,300
It's a good story
in the martial arts world

523
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,900
to have his spirit as a witness.

524
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,460
Eldest Senior.

525
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,090
Why do you make such a fuss
at this time?

526
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,900
Can you listen to me?

527
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,340
What are you two muttering about?

528
00:35:59,050 --> 00:35:59,860
Third Junior.

529
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,730
Are you interested
in the position of sect leader?

530
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,300
Let's compete in martial arts.

531
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,420
I'm not afraid of you.

532
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,170
Okay. Bring it on.

533
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:10,940
Come on.

534
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,340
Seniors.

535
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,730
Who will come first, you two?

536
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,570
Third Junior, it was a good match.

537
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,130
The mourning hall
has become a martial arts arena.

538
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,170
Each generation

539
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,570
of Weituo Sect
is getting weaker and weaker.

540
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,780
(Oh, no.)

541
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,530
(They want to choose the sect leader
by competing in martial arts.)

542
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,570
(When will the fight end?)

543
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,820
(Whatever.)

544
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,130
(Only when I become the sect leader)

545
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,500
(can I save Hu Fei.)

546
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,610
There's no such lousy

547
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,860
Weituo Sect's Saber Techniques.

548
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,570
You two better not
make a fool of yourself here.

549
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,780
Or it'll ruin Master's reputation.

550
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,250
Here comes another lady.

551
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,570
It's getting more interesting.

552
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,570
Look at how this lady
uses the silver whip.

553
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,380
She seems to have
high martial arts skills too.

554
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:07,780
Just fight.

555
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,860
The harder the fight,

556
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,730
the happier Commander Fu will be.

557
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,380
Master.

558
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,570
Your three disciples are so unfilial.

559
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,300
You just passed away.

560
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,340
They start infighting.

561
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,500
They even compete in front of the coffin

562
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,460
and disturb your peace.

563
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,020
Today,

564
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,530
I'll teach them a lesson for you.

565
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,820
Who are you?

566
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,690
Young Lady.

567
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,940
Our sect is choosing a sect leader

568
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,500
in front of our ancestors.

569
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,420
If you're here to mourn,

570
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,860
please sit down and watch the ceremony.

571
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,460
If you're here to make trouble,

572
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,380
don't blame us for being rude.

573
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,610
Since Master Wuxiang

574
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,210
founded Shaolin Weituo Sect,

575
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,980
Weituo Sect has always
been a famous sect

576
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,780
in the martial arts world.

577
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,610
But if the sect leader is chosen among

578
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,380
you three unfilial people,

579
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,170
it'll ruin the reputation
of Master Wuxiang

580
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,050
and the ancestors.

581
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,530
Young Lady, who exactly are you?

582
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,340
I'm Yuan Ziyi.

583
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,380
Speaking of origin,

584
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,570
I'm also a direct disciple of Sect Leader Wan.
