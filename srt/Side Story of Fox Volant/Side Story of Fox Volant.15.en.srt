3
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,730
Thank you.

4
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,980
All the best.

5
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,380
Thanks for coming here
and sending me off.

6
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,660
Thank you so much.

7
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,180
Have a smooth journey!

8
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,530
Master, you must win!

9
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,820
Master, you must win!

10
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,100
Master, you must win!

11
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,420
(Prosperous and Peaceful)
Master, you must win!

12
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,620
(Prosperous and Peaceful)
Master, you must win!

13
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,850
Master, you must win!

14
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,090
Master, you must win!

15
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,500
Thank you so much!

16
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,460
Have a smooth journey!

17
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,940
Have a smooth journey, Master Yi.

18
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,210
Light the firecrackers.

19
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,540
The firecracker broke.

20
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,020
That's a bad omen.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,920
How...

22
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:46,780
Who are you?

23
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,610
How dare you mess with us?

24
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,580
Do you have a death wish?

25
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,610
Be polite.

26
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,420
I only broke
two strings of firecrackers.

27
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,140
How much did that cost?

28
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,420
I can pay you back.

29
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,370
Nonsense.

30
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,730
It's supposed to be an auspicious day
as our master sets off on his journey.

31
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,940
What you did

32
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,300
has upset him a lot.

33
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,610
What do you want me to do now?

34
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,450
Apologize to our master with a kowtow.

35
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,660
What if I refuse to do that?

36
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,500
You're obviously here to mess with us.

37
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,300
And what can you do about that?

38
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,660
The Nine Dragons Sect shouldn't have
acted so haughtily.

39
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,810
You blocked all the other ships
from going through.

40
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,580
I had no choice

41
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,970
but to take over your ship
so that I can cross the river.

42
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,090
If you keep spouting nonsense,

43
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,250
we won't show you any mercy.

44
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,450
Your sect leader hasn't even said
anything yet.

45
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,420
Why don't you keep your mouth shut?

46
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,890
Chief Yi,

47
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,730
it's a bad omen that
the firecrackers broke.

48
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,220
Why don't you stay at home

49
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,170
and give the boat to us?

50
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,220
Just stay at home and enjoy your life.

51
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,530
What's the point of hiring
the fortune-telling warlock?

52
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,250
What does he know?

53
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,370
Why didn't you foresee
that the firecrackers would break?

54
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,300
Rascal.

55
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,450
This is not where you can clown around.

56
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,100
A warlock?

57
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,980
You're just a conman.

58
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,730
I've met many people like you.

59
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,450
You...

60
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,490
What?

61
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,980
Chief Yi

62
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,260
has a dark forehead,

63
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,770
and has signs of misfortune
in the middle of his brows.

64
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,300
You didn't even see that.

65
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,580
Or did you keep it from him
deliberately?

66
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,540
What do you know?

67
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,860
I don't know.

68
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,580
Although I'm not an expert in the...

69
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,490
The Study of Five Elements of Qi.

70
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,610
The Study of Five Elements of Qi.

71
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,420
Although I'm not
an expert in this field,

72
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,770
my...

73
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,450
My master is really well-versed with it.

74
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,860
Right, Master?

75
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,890
You're right.

76
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,610
She's just a young girl
who knows nothing better.

77
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,420
How dare she comment on Taiyi's profile?

78
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,540
Old conman.

79
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,650
There are no grudges between us.

80
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,330
Why are you scorning me?

81
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,450
If that's the case,

82
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,650
let's have a debate.

83
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,020
Chief Yi.

84
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,700
Let's not miss the auspicious time

85
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,770
because these two ignorant young people.

86
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,020
The firecrackers broke into two.

87
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,490
We can buy some other auspicious items

88
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,210
when we arrive at the town later

89
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,260
to get rid of bad luck.

90
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,860
Get ready to lift the anchor.
We'll set off now.

91
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,700
Wait a minute.

92
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,930
If you insist on leaving now,

93
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,300
the mast will break and
the ship will overturn

94
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,140
less than 100 miles from here.

95
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,930
All members of the ship

96
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,730
will lose their lives.

97
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,700
I only put up with your nonsense

98
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,210
because you look young.

99
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,260
But I won't show you any mercy

100
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,980
if you refuse to stop this nonsense now.

101
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,170
You're really bold.

102
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,730
This conman wants to see you die,

103
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,890
and you trust him.

104
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,170
I'll save your life,

105
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,540
but you just won't believe me.

106
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,860
It's difficult to be a nice person.

107
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,260
Let me read your fortune.

108
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,610
It's not too late for you to decide
after listening to what I say.

109
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,420
There's no need for that.

110
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,140
They call you Chief Yi.

111
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,580
So let's talk about your name, Yi.

112
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,540
The character "Yi" made up of the words
"Day" and "No".

113
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,820
Putting together, they're a "no-day".

114
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,170
It's saying
that you won't live a long life.

115
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,300
Chief Yi is traveling by water,

116
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,170
on a ship this time.

117
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,170
If you add the word "Yi" with
the word "Water", you get "Soup".

118
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,610
It means that you'll be in hot soup.

119
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,650
It's going to be a very dangerous trip.

120
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,180
Are you done yet?

121
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,020
Chief Yi.

122
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,140
You want this trip

123
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
to be an auspicious one.

124
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,090
But you shouldn't say the character
"done" completely.

125
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,330
You're attending
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

126
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,530
I'm sure you'll engage in a few fights.

127
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,530
Adding the word "Foot" to "Yi",
it's "Kick".

128
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,020
If you add the character "Knife",
you'll get "Cut".

129
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,140
You'll either get kicked to death,

130
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,410
or they will cut off Nine Dragons Sect.

131
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,500
My name is "Ji",
which stands for "Luck".

132
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,410
I'm auspicious on my own.

133
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,290
Is there anything else you want to say?

134
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,090
You're in grave danger.

135
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,380
"Luck" is supposed to be a good word,

136
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,450
but it's not good for Chief Yi.

137
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,580
"Yi", meaning changes happen easily.

138
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,020
What's the opposite

139
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,770
of "Luck"?

140
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,850
Obviously, it's "Ominosity".

141
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,970
Great.

142
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,450
That's a great explanation, darling.

143
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,740
Master.

144
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,330
What are you staring at?

145
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,650
Can't I marry my master?

146
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,410
Chief Yi.

147
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,620
My master is only telling you the truth,

148
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,380
although it may sound offensive.

149
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,770
The truth often grates on the ears,

150
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,090
but you must take her advice.

151
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,060
Master.

152
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,820
These two lunatics

153
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,330
have upset you repeatedly.

154
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,620
I'll teach them a lesson
on your behalf.

155
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,890
How shameless.

156
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,500
You'll definitely embarrass yourself

157
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,620
when you're in the capital.

158
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,820
Guys.

159
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,090
Kill him!

160
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,210
Chief Yi.

161
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,650
Judging by how incapable
your disciples are,

162
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,890
I'm sure you, as their chief,

163
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,890
aren't any better.

164
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,090
I think you shouldn't go to the capital.

165
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,060
Otherwise,

166
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,450
you might even get yourself killed.

167
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,970
Little rascal.

168
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,580
Chief Yi.

169
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,210
Please stay calm.

170
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,500
You'll miss the auspicious time
if you don't depart now.

171
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,890
Apparently, the chief is a coward.

172
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,330
How are others going to look
at Nine Dragons Sect in the future?

173
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,450
Enough of talking.

174
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,740
Why don't you come on the ship
so that we can have a proper fight?

175
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,970
Sure.

176
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,820
If I win,

177
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,180
you'll give the ship

178
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,090
to my wife.

179
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,260
If I lose,

180
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,290
you can do anything you like.

181
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:58,970
Sure.

182
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,380
I'll teach you a lesson

183
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,410
since you're so full of yourself.

184
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,930
I didn't do that.

185
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,620
Since we're already here,

186
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,690
do you want to jump
into the water yourself,

187
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,770
or do you need my help?

188
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,690
What are you trying to say?

189
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,260
Will you admit your defeat?

190
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,050
I won't.

191
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,980
Is that a little too much?

192
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,650
I don't think so.

193
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,690
He won't drown.

194
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,690
Disciples, save Chief Yi now.

195
00:12:59,290 --> 00:12:59,890
-Let's go!

196
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,860
Save Master now.

197
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,620
Save Master now.

198
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,260
Master!

199
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,340
Let's go.

200
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,980
Please take care of Ruolan.

201
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,650
Don't worry.

202
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,570
I'll take very good care of her.

203
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,050
Thank you so much.

204
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,650
Don't worry.

205
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:47,860
Ziyi.

206
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,340
You're too smart.

207
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,140
Previously, you said,
"Kill a man before midnight,

208
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,170
kill another man after midnight."

209
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,340
And you made Iron Scorpion
and Zhu Rong

210
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,260
kill each other.

211
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,740
This time, you did

212
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,570
an impromptu fortune-telling session,

213
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,290
and infuriated Yi Ji.

214
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,770
According to what you say,

215
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,860
there's "Fei" in my name "Hu Fei".

216
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,810
So am I an erudite man?

217
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,220
Add "Yu" to the character,

218
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,890
you'll get "Fei",

219
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,260
which stands for jade.

220
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,020
If you add "Cao" to it,
you'll get "Fei" too,

221
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,140
but it stands for fragrance and beauty.

222
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,860
If you write it in another way,

223
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,260
it means red gown and jade belt.

224
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,220
I'm going to be a superior official
in the future.

225
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,260
You're really good at praising yourself.

226
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,290
You heard

227
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,460
how I studied Yi Ji's name.

228
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,890
I will remember

229
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,020
everything you said.

230
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:39,810
How loquacious.

231
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,530
But...

232
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,220
If I separate the character "Hu",
your last name,

233
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,220
I'll get "Month", "Ten", and "Mouth".

234
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,260
That means you'll get stabbed nine times
every month.

235
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,290
Really?

236
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,890
That means

237
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,100
I'll be getting one wound after another
my entire life.

238
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,050
Why not give me a new name?

239
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,410
What about

240
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,980
Hu Shuo?
[* It means nonsense.]

241
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,260
I want a better name.

242
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,650
Are you saying that I'm hurt so badly

243
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,690
because I have a bad name?

244
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,650
Luckily, your name is "Fei".
[*The Chinese character "Fei" means not.]

245
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,020
That means

246
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,500
you will turn
the misfortune of nine stabs

247
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,620
into good luck.

248
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,810
Thank you for your kind advice,
young lady.

249
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,100
Thanks for turning my misfortune
into good luck.

250
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,290
Otherwise, I would have wasted
the good name my parents gave me.

251
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,290
I might also need you to take care of me
for the rest of my life too.

252
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,100
Here.

253
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,740
Good job.

254
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,410
Here.

255
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,500
Take your time, Young Lady.

256
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,460
Come to me, Ruolan.

257
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,620
Be careful.

258
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,500
Ruolan.

259
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,170
Young Lady, keep going.

260
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,290
Come to your mom.

261
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,410
Good job, Young Lady.

262
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,100
Be careful.

263
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,980
Miao Ruolan.

264
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,290
We're going home.

265
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,020
Let's go.

266
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,650
Ruolan.

267
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,460
Ruolan.

268
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,140
Madam.

269
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,100
Ruolan.

270
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,890
Ruolan.

271
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,740
My daughter.

272
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,260
Father.

273
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,740
Father.

274
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,290
Father.

275
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,530
I'm getting blisters on my backside.

276
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,810
Can we take a break?

277
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,100
I can't keep going.

278
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,460
He's right, Old Master Feng.

279
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,290
All of us have been following you

280
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,460
and staying in the wild
for the last couple of days.

281
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,620
Why did you pick such a quiet route?

282
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,570
Physically, we can't take it anymore.

283
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,460
I told you beforehand.

284
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,410
I said it was going
to be an arduous journey,

285
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,100
and if you didn't wish to come with me,

286
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,930
you should've quit back then.

287
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,930
Whoever fails to stay loyal to me,

288
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,050
or disobey me,

289
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,290
I won't show you any mercy.

-Chief.

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,410
Come with me.

295
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,140
Come here.

296
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,020
It's time to get to work.

297
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,740
These are all precious items.

298
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,810
Remember

299
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,500
to handle them with care.

300
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,020
Sure.

301
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,380
Lan, look what I brought...

302
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,290
What's wrong with Madam?

303
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,610
Don't worry, Chief.

304
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,020
Madam is just experiencing
some severe morning sickness

305
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,180
and is feeling a little ill.

306
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,020
Lan.

307
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,180
Look at you.

308
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,810
It's only been a few days and
you're looking much weaker than before.

309
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,660
Are you missing me too much?

310
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,940
I'll cook you

311
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,180
some of your favorite dishes myself later.

312
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,740
Are you mad at me?

313
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,810
Are you upset
because I've been away for too long

314
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,610
and been neglecting you?

315
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,260
I'm not.

316
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,740
Really?

317
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,610
You're obviously mad at me.

318
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,940
I only stayed in the capital
for so many days,

319
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,900
so that I could pay the temple a visit

320
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,980
to get you this jade buckle.

321
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,570
It'll be able to keep you
and our baby safe.

322
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,050
Also,

323
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,460
this is the Guanyin buckle.

324
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,810
It's a gift from the master to our baby.

325
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,700
It carries blessings
from Putuo Mountain.

326
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,460
He told us to keep this with the baby

327
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,900
the moment he is born.

328
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,700
It'll bless him with
a lifetime of happiness.

329
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:13,700
Here.

330
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,330
Guinong.

331
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,770
I appreciate it a lot,

Is it sweet?

511
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,940
You can taste it now.

That means

513
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,850
you're much healthier than before.

514
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,260
Since you have an appetite now,

515
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,090
you should eat more.

516
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,770
There are many other fruits here.

517

Why are you staring at me?

520
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,090
Hu Fei.

521
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,330
I have a few words to say to you.

522
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,420
Really?

523
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,130
I have something to tell you too.

524
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,220
Let me go first.

525
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,330
Sure.

526
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,530
You can go first.

527
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,290
Firstly,

528
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,740
although you're a good martial artist,

529
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,700
you've never learned
from a proper master.

530
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,980
Therefore, you don't have
a strong foundation

531
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,130
and you get swayed easily.

532
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,130
You'll be easily defeated

533
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,740
if you run into an expert.

534
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,460
That's not a big deal.

535
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,810
I can learn from you.

536
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,460
Although I know what you're lacking,

537
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:54,740
I am not capable of teaching you.

538
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,900
You need to learn
from a seasoned master.

539
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,570
Secondly,

540
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,220
you're born a hero.

541
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,980
You always stand up for justice,

542
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,810
but you often act
too impulsively and recklessly.

543
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,500
You put your life at stake
when you're in fighting.

544
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,090
You insisted on fighting
even when your leg was broken.

545
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,700
Bear in mind.

546
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,900
If you want to protect others,

547
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,660
you have to first protect yourself.

548
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,500
I only broke my leg
because I was in a hurry to save you.

549
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,420
Fine.

550
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,570
What about this?

551
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,660
I'll always stay with you
no matter what happens in the future.

552
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,740
Once you see me acting recklessly,

553
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,570
you'll step in and stop me.

554
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,530
I'll definitely listen to you.

555
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,940
You shouldn't be counting on me.

556
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,020
Can't you take care of yourself?

557
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,420
Fine.

558
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,900
From now on, I'll think twice

559
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,180
before I do anything.

560
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:40,810
Also...

561
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,810
More?

562
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,850
Yes.

563
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,460
Thirdly.

564
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,500
The martial arts world
is full of danger.

565
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,090
Nothing is predictable.

566
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,130
You're new
and don't know how to read people yet.

567
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,130
You'll get deceived very easily.

568
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,050
That was also why

569
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,980
you fell into Feng Tiannan's trap.

570
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,380
You need to know

571
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,340
that there are not only devils
who appear kind-hearted,

572
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,050
but also fierce-looking angels.

573
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,090
Never

574
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,050
trust others so easily.

575
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,170
Otherwise, you'll surely get
taken advantage of,

576
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,980
or worse, lose your life.

577
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,860
All right. I got it.

578
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,420
Ziyi, everything you said

579
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,050
is so wise and pertinent.

580
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,420
I've thought it through.

581
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
I know

582
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,050
I'm not a skilled martial artist

583
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,570
and always act impulsively.

584
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,940
I can't read people well too.

585
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,530
Then, I'll have to follow you
wherever you go for the rest of my life.

586
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,340
As long as you're with me,

587
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,460
there's nothing I need to worry about.

588
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,730
This is a serious matter,

589
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,020
and you won't stop interrupting me.

590
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,570
Why do you insist on sticking with me?

591
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,300
I'm only doing this because...

592
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,980
Because I want to express
my gratitude.

593
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:49,900
You know

594
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,380
I always make sure I repay
all the kindness I've received.

595
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,300
It's fine.

596
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,090
You saved me
when we were in Foshan.

597
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,170
And I healed your leg in return.

598
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,780
We helped each other once,

599
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,690
and I guess we're even now.

600
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,780
That's not true.

601
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,500
I can never fully repay

602
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,570
what you have done to me.

603
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,090
I'm done.

604
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,860
Why are you mad?

605
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,420
You haven't heard me out yet.

606
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,300
I'm tired.

607
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,380
You can talk another time.

608
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,250
Then...

609
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,780
I...

610
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,650
I'll sleep here.

611
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,650
That's too close.

612
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,730
If I don't stay close to you,

613
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,610
what should I do

614
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,340
if you leave quietly at dawn again?

615
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:34,860
Stay away from me.

616
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,780
No way.

617
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:37,780
I'm leaving then.

618
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,420
Please don't.

619
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,210
I'll leave.

620
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,210
I'll sleep at the door.

621
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,340
I'll watch the door for you.

622
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,300
Ziyi.

623
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,090
Please don't be mad at me.

624
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,980
Let me tell you a bedtime story.

625
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:30,860
When I was picking fruits

626
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,780
in the mountain today,

627
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,900
I saw a rabbit.

628
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,900
I caught it right away.

629
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,570
But when I saw

630
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,130
how it was staring at me pleadingly,

631
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,050
I was suddenly reminded
of the promise I gave you.

632
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,690
I'll be on a vegetarian diet
from now on, just like you.

633
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,020
Therefore, I let it go.

634
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,380
Guess what happened later.

635
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,420
Not long after that,

636
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,420
it came back to me,

637
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,380
carrying a freshly-picked fruit.

638
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,460
It was the fruit you had just now.

639
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:02,940
I told it.

640
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,340
"Little Rabbit,

641
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,340
you don't have to thank me for this.

642
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,780
You managed to cheat death today

643
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,530
all thanks to a very kind-hearted lady.

644
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,050
Don't worry.

645
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,420
I'll definitely send her
your gratitude.

646
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,250
Even a bunny knows how
to repay the kindness it has received.

647
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,170
And me...

648
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,860
I owe the lady

649
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,860
even more."
