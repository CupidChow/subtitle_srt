Chief.

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,760
We've hired some martial experts

5
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,719
to guard the wing as per your command.

6
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,920
Miao Renfeng's shoulder blade
has been pierced.

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,480
He won't be able to escape
even if he has wings.

8
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,719
We are going to head
to the capital tomorrow.

can't die.

I want to let him hear

14
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,639
the sound of suona when I marry Nan Lan.

15
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,280
I understand.

16
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,400
Do you really understand?

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,039
Yes.

18
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,080
That's good.

19
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,919
Guinong, do I look nice?

20
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,039
You've been wanting me

21
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,560
to wear my wedding dress
as soon as possible, right?

22
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,479
So, I've worn it tonight for you.

23
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,280
I hope that the victory will be yours

24
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,960
during the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

25
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,719
I was wrong.

26
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,080
I wasn't considerate towards you.

27
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,240
Now,

28
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,680
you've done everything
to bring Ruolan back to me.

29
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,599
You've reunited us.

30
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,599
You've done so much for me.

31
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm going to repay you
with the rest of my life.

or want to ask about Ruolan's father?

35

Whether he's alive or dead,

36
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,480
I don't want anything to do
with him anymore.

37
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,000
From now on,

38
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:30,560
you and Ruolan are
the only ones in my heart.

39
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,480
I don't care about anyone else.

40

after this.

Let me drink to all of you.

Finally, we caught Miao Renfeng.

I can't drink anymore.

I'm really thankful to all of you.

Go and get Ruolan.

We need to take the kid away from her.

She is Miao Renfeng's biological kid.

Come. Let's go home.

72
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440
Master.

73
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,120
I've found out about everything.

74
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,159
The Firearm Brigade has been training
their troops all day long.

75
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,039
And they've brought in
other elite soldiers from other places.

76
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,919
Now, they are all
under Hailan Bi's command.

77
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,559
Now, Hailan Bi is telling the public

78
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,960
that he's the sect leader
of Heilong Sect.

79
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,360
And he already has
a Jade Dragon Cup by default.

80
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,440
He will order the Firearm Brigade

81
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,000
to cause chaos during
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

82
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Those people have muskets from the West.

83
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,480
We can't defeat them no matter
how good we are in martial arts.

84
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,440
No need to panic.

85
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,559
Keep calm so that
you can handle the danger with ease.

86
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,240
The most critical thing now

87
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,840
is to find out

88
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,879
about their overall plan.

89
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,879
I've already checked the venue.

90
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,960
There are many traps
and secret doors there.

91
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,240
It won't be easy
to find out every detail

92
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:46,919
of their plan.

93
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,639
The venue of
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering

94
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,720
and the Sect Leader Courtyard
are very close to the King's Residence.

95
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,039
Before this, Fu Kang'an sent Hailan Bi

96
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,200
to protect the Old Madam

97
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,559
with the Firearm Brigade.

98
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,360
I'm sure they've set up a camp
inside the King's Residence

99
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,320
to keep their soldiers fresh and fit.

100
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,519
Master, I'll use the Old Madam
as an excuse to send some medicines

101
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,000
into the King's Residence now

102
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,000
to find out whether it's true or not.

103
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,919
Look at this first.

105

Master, I already gave him my advice.

106
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,879
And I had explained it clearly to him.

107
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,480
I'm not blaming you.

108
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
I'm just reminding you to be careful.

109
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Master, we are facing
a formidable enemy.

110
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,840
We need more manpower too.

111
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,080
How about we...

112
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,039
No matter how powerful he is,

113
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
he'll only cause us trouble
if he can't follow orders.

114
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,840
We've been entrusted
with great responsibilities.

115
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,919
We can't fail the masters
of the Red Flower Club

116
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,759
who believe in us.

117
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,840
And we can't sit back and do nothing

118
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,399
while our martial artists are in danger
from the imperial court's trap.

119
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,600
We can't take that risk.

120

Finally, you understand.

121

During the World's Sect Leaders Gathering,

eight Gold Dragon Cups,

and eight most precious
Jade Dragon Cups.

But among the eight Jade Dragon Cups,

four of them are already given
to certain people.

As for the rest of the cups,

the others will fight
to the death for them.

The Qing court

138

is just trying to make us
fight against each other.

Even the cups
are divided into three levels.

Although that's true,

we are no sages.

The poison that killed your father

is most probably created by him.

159

00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:49,879
Okay.

166
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,720
Why are you so slow?

167
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,320
The Old Madam is tired of waiting.

168
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,960
Come on. Let's go.

169
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:00,440
Under Commander's order,

170
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,799
everyone has to be searched.

171
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
What a bother.

172
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,980
(Fu)

173
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,920
Can you bear the consequences

174
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,000
if you offend the Old Madam?

175
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:22,720
By the way, Lingsu,

176
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
guess whose name I saw on the list

177
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,359
of the World's Sect Leaders Gathering?

178
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,119
Shi Wanchen.

179
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,759
Looks like he's really
going to take part in it too.

180
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,319
This is good.

181
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,480
We can settle the score
with him once and for all.

182
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,359
You've seen how he fights.

183
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,880
You have to be careful

184
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
so that you can defeat him.

185
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,039
You'll be the brain
and I'll be the brawn.

186
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,680
Let's have a good fight
with this old geezer.

187
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,400
You don't want to eat this?

188
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,200
You don't want to eat this too?

189
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,160
This is delicious.

190
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Greetings, Madam.

191
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,039
What is this?

192
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,279
This is the Snow Lotus Beauty Cream

193
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,559
that my master made.

194
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,720
It can keep you looking young and fresh.

195
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,839
Take a seat.

196
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,720
Thank you, Madam.

197
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,240
It smells so nice.

198
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,720
Now that I've become older,
no matter what I use,

199
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,160
I can't be compared
to beautiful young ladies like you.

200
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,079
Everyone knows

201
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,000
that you are
the most beautiful woman in Qing.

202
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,359
And you take good care of yourself.

203
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,599
You are way more beautiful than us.

204
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,359
You can't use too much
of this beauty cream.

205
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,720
You are already so pretty to begin with.

206
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,599
Together with the effect
of this beauty cream,

207
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,960
others will think
that you and Commander Fu

208
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,799
are brother and sister after this.

209
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,839
Look at how good
they are at sweet-talking.

210
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,200
Help me thank your master.

211
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,880
Thank her for her kindness.

212
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,279
Grandmother, I want one too.

213
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,519
These are not for you to play with.

214
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,720
They are many other good things
in the King's Residence.

215
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,359
You can play with them.

216
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,039
- No.
- No.

217
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,000
We want to play with these.

218
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,440
Stop making it difficult for me.

219
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,960
You really can't play with these.

220
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,880
Be good. Let's play
with other things, okay?

221
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,880
Let me show you some magic.

222
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,480
- What do you think?
- Great!

223
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,319
What is your favourite fruit?

224
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,680
I love mandarin orange.

225
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,720
I love jujube.

226
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,319
Okay. Let me show you my magic.

227
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:42,599
Turn.

228
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,240
How do you do it?

229
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,519
I have the power of telekinesis.

230
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,799
What else do you want?

231
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,119
I just need to chant the mantra

232
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,559
and a deity will put the thing
that I want on my hand.

233
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,799
Since they like you so much,

234
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,000
you should visit us more often

235
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,240
to play with them.

236
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,039
But this place is strictly guarded.

237
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,359
We can't simply enter the place.

238
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,240
Please forgive us.

239
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,480
Be patient.

240
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,720
Next time, we'll get you
a bunny with magic.

241
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,319
- No.
- No.

242
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,039
- I want the bunny tomorrow.
- I want the bunny tomorrow.

243
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,440
- Grandmother.
- Grandmother.

244
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,279
- Let them in.
- Let them in.

245
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:29,839
Okay.

246
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,039
You are making me dizzy.

247
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Fine. It's not a problem.

248
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:38,039
I'll give each of you a pass.

249
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,079
Then, you can come and go as you please.

250
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,839
No guards will dare stop you.

251
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,640
Thank you for your generosity.

252
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,119
The World's Sect Leaders Gathering
will be held soon.

253
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,839
It's your fault
for creating trouble everywhere.

254
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,880
Now, the whole capital
knows about you.

255
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,680
We can't use the beard anymore.

256
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,279
I know

257
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,160
that you'll have a solution for that.

258
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,400
I do have a solution.

259
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,759
We need to make the beard longer.

260
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,359
And I'll dye it into yellow.

261
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,640
As for your face,

262
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,720
I'll paint it so that
it looks yellowish.

263
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,839
You'll look like a man with a hard life.

264
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
I'll look like an ox then.

265
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,079
If a man with a hard life...

266
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:24,839
I was just joking.

267
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:25,799
I have an idea.

268
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,440
You'll find out later.

269
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,799
I know that you are
smart and resourceful.

270
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:31,680
There's nothing

271
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,880
that you can't solve.

272
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,039
Such a sweet talker.

273
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,680
Remember

274
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
who will lose first and win later.

275
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,960
Do not make a mistake
and waste Official Hai's money.

276
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:53,559
Yes.

277
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,599
I've already memorised

278
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,759
the ranking arrangement.

279
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:58,359
I won't forget it

280
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,640
even if I forget my name.

281
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,079
Official Hai.

282
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,160
Tomorrow, show these to them.

283
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,079
Let the gamblers see

284
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,079
that we have money in this casino.

285
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,359
We'll pay them on the spot. No delays.

286
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,799
I'm in control
of the national treasury of Qing.

287
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,160
If you want to bet against me,

288
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,279
it means that you can't wait
to give me your money.

289
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,920
Official Hai, just wait here
and count the money.

290
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,079
I'm just worried that this warehouse

291
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,240
will be too small

292
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,559
for the money that we'll get.

293
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,839
Hype up the place tomorrow.

294
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,480
Bring in as many people as you can.

295
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
The more the better.

296
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,680
More people, more money.

297
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,319
Just you wait.

298
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,759
All the best storytellers in Beijing

(Haiyuan Hall)

329
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,279
Let me welcome all of you here.

330
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,079
Cheers.

331
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,279
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

332
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,039
His Majesty is paying close attention

333
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,839
to this World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

334
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,960
He has 24 imperial cups
specially made for you.

335
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,440
He has ordered me

336
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,759
(Royal Gift)
to give them to all the 24 sect leaders here.

337
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,039
Those 24 imperial cups

338
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,519
are all made by the most famous

339
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,799
imperial craftsmen.

340
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,960
The jade cups are clear as crystal.

341
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,680
The gold cups are shimmering in gold,
and the silver cups are like starlight.

342
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,440
(Gathering of Fiends)
Each of them is precious and rare.

343
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,160
(Gathering of Fiends)

344
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,759
You might not even be able to find them
in the Queen Mother's

345
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,519
heavenly peach banquet.

346
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,559
As we know,

347
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
there are more than 100 sect leaders
in this gathering.

348
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,519
But there are only 24 imperial cups.

349
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,160
Who can get the cups?

350
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,599
(Gathering of Fiends)
They can't be possibly chosen through a lucky draw.

351
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:18,880
You over there.

352
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,559
You think too much.

353
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,680
They'll be chosen through
a contest of brain and brawn.

354
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,119
It'll depend on the capabilities
of each sect leader.

355
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,000
(The Seat of Gold)

356
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,220
(Hall of Blessing)

357
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,240
The martial arts contest will start now!

358
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,599
I'm Hou Liang from the Monkey Fist Sect.

359
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,559
I'll go first then.

360
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,020
(Investiture of Heroes)

361
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,839
Any of you want to fight me?

362
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,599
Chief Hou, I'll play with you.

(Erlang Fist: Huang Xijie)

364

Greetings.

365
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,920
Greetings.

366
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,640
They call this a contest?

367
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,519
This is too fake.

368
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,960
I heard that they've paid

369
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,160
Hailan Bi to win this contest.

370
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,839
The ranking has already
been arranged and set.

371
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,440
If we only look at real talents,

372
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,960
with Brother Cheng's capabilities,

373
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:47,240
it'll be a walk in the park.

374
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,519
The Monkey Fist is also known
as the White Ape Back Fist.

375
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,200
It was created deep
in the valley of the forest

376
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,480
through the promoting and inhibiting
relationship between all living beings.

377
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,839
It's the building ground
of all types of fist attacks.

378
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,160
The goal is to create
an ever-changing fist technique.

379
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,480
The fist technique
is all about observe, approach,

380
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,880
go down, attack, move, dodge,

381
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,359
attach, get close, suffocate, throw.

Lingsu.

383
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,440
Why is the old geezer not here yet?

384
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,119
I'll find out about it.

385
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,480
Your techniques are great, Chief Huang.

386
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,079
You have my admiration.

387
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,799
First round,

388
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,119
Chief Huang from Erlang Fist Sect wins.

389
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,810
(Gathering of Fiends)

390
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,290
(Erlang Fist: Huang Xijie,
Monkey Fist: Hou Liang)

391
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,559
As they say,

392
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,960
there will always be something
that can overpower you.

393
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,200
(Gathering of Fiends)
Although the Erlang Fist

394
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,160
(Gathering of Fiends)
is bold and fierce,

395
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,599
when it goes against the Jingang Fist,

396
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,160
it's still not enough
to defeat the Jingang Fist.

397
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,440
Zhou Long

398
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,920
trains his whole body to be tough.

399
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,000
He doesn't dodge the opponent's attacks.

400
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,440
You can hear the pummelling
of the fists.

401
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:36,599
But Zhou Long

402
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,079
doesn't even grunt at them.

403
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,000
A counter-attack from him

404
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,880
is the Counter Fist from Jingang Fist.

405
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,079
But he just sends Zhou Long
flying with a kick.

406
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,480
He straight away falls

407
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,599
and rolls on the ground.

408
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:48,960
(Gathering of Fiends)

409
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,440
(Gathering of Fiends)
But he stands up again.

410
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,720
How do you know what is happening?

411
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,119
Yes. How do you know?

412
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,519
I can't reveal my secret to you.

413
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,240
Just listen to me.

414
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,400
(Gathering of Fiends)
I promise you

415
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,000
that it'll be as if
you are experiencing it yourself.

416
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,039
This is even better

417
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,599
than watching it live.

418
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,240
Come.

419
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,960
I'll bet on this person.

420
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,119
I don't believe you.

421
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,000
I'll bet on this person.

422
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,480
I have the answer.

423
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,039
The Medicine King Sect is excused
from the contest today.

424
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,680
He'll enter the final straight away
to fight for the Jade Dragon Cup.

425
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,680
Looks like I have
to make it into the final

426
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,720
to meet him.

427
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,920
Ji.

428
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
I need to make it count
as the sect leader of the Huaquan Sect.

429
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,400
I think getting a Silver Dragon Cup

430
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,359
is not good enough for us.

431
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,000
How about we fight
for the Jade Dragon Cup?

432
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,839
That'll be great.

433
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,640
Third round.

434
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,960
Chief Ouyang
from Yanqing Fist Sect wins.

435
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,559
Who wants to challenge
Yanqing Fist next?

436
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,720
Me.

437
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,000
Me!

438
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,799
Cheng Linghu,
the sect leader of the Huaquan Sect,

439
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,000
is here to challenge you.

440
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,119
Who is he?

441
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:10,920
I don't know.

442
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,000
I should be the one

443
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,079
to fight against the Yanqing Fist Sect.

444
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,519
(Gathering of Fiends)
Before he finishes the question,

445
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,079
(Gathering of Fiends)
someone cuts in.

446
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,319
Yanqing Fist, don't you be cocky.

447
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:24,119
I'm here to defeat you!

448
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,200
A hero glides into the fighting ring.

449
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,720
Who is he?

450
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,599
He's the sect leader
of Xiantian Fist Sect,

451
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,440
Guo Yutang, Senior Guo.

452
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,960
Official Hai,
why did you change the opponent?

453
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,200
I didn't.

454
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,480
What should I do next?

455
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
Should I lose or win?

456
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,039
How much did he pay you?

457
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,240
Are we still going to fight?

458
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,240
Or am I not allowed to be here?

459
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,160
This man is quite interesting.

460
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:59,240
Make it quick.

461
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,359
If he dies, I'll back you up.

462
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:11,799
Ouyang Gongzheng,
sect leader of Yanqing Fist Sect

463
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,079
accepts your challenge.

464
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,119
These two people

465
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:23,400
are evenly matched.
They are fighting fist to fist.

466
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,400
Yanqing Fist is as fierce as the tiger

467
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,000
and as agile as the water dragon.

468
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,359
This fierce fight

469
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,839
causes the sky to darken

470
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:34,359
and blocks out the light.

471
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,039
You are wrong!

472
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,440
Xiantian Fist is not
on the fighting ring now!

473
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,559
Don't listen to his lies!

474
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,759
Take him down!

475
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:42,319
What?

476
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:45,640
Go down!

477
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,319
Cheng Linghu

478
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,519
is quite a good fighter.

479
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,319
Let him continue to fight.

480
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,920
Yes, Commander.

481

In this round, Chief Cheng

485
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,839
Come down!

What are you talking about?

00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,400
I remember it right.

There'll always be someone
more powerful than him.

There will always be someone stronger.

Why do you sound so happy?

520
