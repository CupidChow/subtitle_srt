It can cut the thinnest hair?

171
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,880
All is not gold that glitters.

172
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,040
How imprudent!

173
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
How dare you verbally abuse

174
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,559
the imperial good?

175
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:52,439
Please calm down, Your Honor.

176
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,959
This friend of mine,

177
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:55,839
he... he is not good with words.

178
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,520
Please don't mind him.

179
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:00,199
You're a great person
who is large-hearted.

180
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,880
Don't listen to their nonsense.

181
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,199
There's nothing in the world

182
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,520
as sharp as my ancestral saber.

183
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,640
Bumpkin.

184
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,559
Bring your treasure over.

185
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,479
Let me take a look.

186
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,799
Very well.

187
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,199
It'll blow your mind.

188
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,160
It's nothing special.

189
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,880
This saber looks ordinary

190
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,120
but it's extremely sharp.

191
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,599
If you don't believe it,

192
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,799
use that saber of yours

193
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,880
to battle it out.

194
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,280
Father, it's not necessary to be so mad.

195
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,519
The countryman can be ignorant.

196
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:42,679
Forget it.

197
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,120
This is an imperial good.

198
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,679
It's not something
that you commoner can use to battle.

199
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:49,320
Shoo.

200
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Is it an imperial good
because it's encrusted with jewels?

201
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,400
How can you bring
the Emperor's saber everywhere?

202
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,560
You're telling a barefaced lie.

203
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,080
You...

204
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,719
How dare you!

205
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,880
Unruly commoner,

206
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:02,080
we give you an inch
and you're taking an ell.

207
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,239
I must teach you a lesson today.

208
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,840
Or you won't respect the officials.

209
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,120
My saber!

210
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,999
My saber!

211
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,759
It's a great saber.

212
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,279
Yes.

213
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,279
It's indeed a great saber.

214
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,640
What an amazing saber!

215
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:16,800
Nan,

216
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,439
has it come in contact
with blood before?

217
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,239
It's a treasure for His Majesty.
How could it come in contact with blood?

218
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:23,880
Let's try it on a living person.

219
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,239
So we can have some assurance.

220
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,920
Or you'll be convicted

221
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,600
for defrauding the Emperor
if it's not as sharp as expected.

222
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:31,120
Then, you'll regret for it.

223
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,600
A living person?

224
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:35,360
It is disregard for human life.
It's inappropriate.

225
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,640
There's nothing inappropriate.

226
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:45,880
Don't move.

227
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,120
It's none of your business.

228
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,199
Help, Hero Miao.

229
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,800
Miao Renfeng?

230
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,239
Brothers,

231
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,719
we've run into a tough guy today.

232
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,880
Why is that?

233
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,439
Just because of his title?

234
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,279
We don't know if he's the real one.

235
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:07,439
Besides,

236
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,679
we've been planning this for a while.

237
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,479
How could we possibly mess up
the sure thing?

238
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,519
We outnumber him, why would we fear him?

239
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,519
Who in the world

240
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,840
would dare to falsely use
Hero Miao's title?

241
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,959
Let's see if he's that powerful.

242
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:21,120
Kill him!

243
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,120
Are you alright, Hero?

244
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,640
Are you okay, Hero?

245
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,439
Leave.

246
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,279
Quick.

247
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:50,360
Go.

248
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,880
Get up there.

249
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:21,999
My father's saber.

250
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,279
I'll go get it. Go.

251
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,360
When I get better,

252
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,360
I'll send you home.

253
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,199
My father is dead.

254
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,279
I no longer have a home.

255
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:17,320
Do you have any plan?

256
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,479
Brother Miao,

257
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,360
what is this place?

258
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,519
The people I respected most
were buried here.

259
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,360
All of them were the renowned heroes
in the martial arts world.

260
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
They were magnanimous.

261
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:58,800
It's common to encounter killings
in the martial arts world.

262
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,160
This is the only thing
that makes me feel reassured.

263
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,640
My father was going

264
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,039
to escort this saber, Cool Moon,
to the capital.

265
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,920
But I never thought
that he'd die because of this.

266
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,600
Brother Miao,

267
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,479
can you please

268
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,679
put this saber in a proper place?

269
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:39,439
Perhaps my father could rest in peace.

270
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,920
The Astronomical Chapter
in Book of Han has recorded this.

271
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,640
On the last day and the first day
of every month,

272
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,880
the Moral Star comes out
and lights up the sky

273
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,600
in the place of the moon.

274
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,560
It often occurs
in the well-governed country.

275
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:31,920
Hence,

276
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
I think

277
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,560
as such celestial phenomena appear in Lunan,

278
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,479
(Emperor Qianlong)
as such celestial phenomena appear in Lunan,

279
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:37,880
(Emperor Qianlong)

280
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,199
(Emperor Qianlong)
it's an auspicious sign

281
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,199
that shows Qing is a stable
and peaceful country

282
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,759
which is worshipped by all nations.

283
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,640
This is not sufficient to prove that.

284
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,519
But on the other day,

285
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,479
there was colourful mist in the sky.

286
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,439
It looked like smoke and cloud
but it was neither of them.

287
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,600
This was Qing Cloud.

288
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,039
Qing Cloud indicates good luck.

289
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
This is a propitious omen approaching,

290
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,160
like the commoners always say.

291
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,160
Your Majesty.

292
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,959
Thanks to Your Majesty,
Qing becomes a well-governed country.

293
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,320
A propitious omen is approaching?

294
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:31,800
Why would Shanxi experience
a locust plague?

295
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,160
Why would Henan experience floods?

296
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,600
Why are there bandits in Liang Mountain?

297
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,959
As you're being paid by Qing,

298
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,120
you have to lighten my burden.

299
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,519
Instead of currying favour with me

300
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,519
and embellishing the issues.

301
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,270
(Fair and Square)

302
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,239
We're guilty.

303
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,800
Dismiss.

304
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,999
Long live Your Majesty!

305
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,679
His Majesty is in a bad mood today.

306
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,120
The local official was killed
and the imperial saber was taken.

307
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,400
Official He

308
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,600
was obviously buttering up His Majesty.

309
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,600
Official Fu,

310
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,360
please rise.

311
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,880
His Majesty is waiting for you
at the Imperial Study.

312
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,679
Take it slow.

313
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:41,759
Come.

314
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
You...

315
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:08,800
When will you win credit for me?

316
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:16,959
You've sat on your knees for so long.

317
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,479
Do you know what you've done wrong?

318
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,600
I was careless

319
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,199
and incompetent.

320
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,360
Causing Your Majesty's imperial saber
to be taken by the bad guys.

321
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,239
Please punish me.

322
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:33,519
Careless?

323
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,080
How are you going to settle it?

324
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,880
I'll go after the fugitives right away.

325
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,120
To get the imperial saber back.

326
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,600
And I'll punish the officials
who don't fulfill their duties.

327
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,679
You still don't get it.

328
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:58,400
What's next?

329
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:11,920
The scholars violate the rules
with words;

330
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,120
the warriors flout the ban
with martial arts.

331
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,080
Try to understand

332
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
these sentences.

333
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,600
Come here when you figure it out.

334
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,920
I'll excuse myself.

335
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,080
Greetings to Mother.

336
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,840
Rise.

337
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:49,080
Sit.

338
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:07,600
I heard that His Majesty lectured you.

339
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,920
(The mother of Fu Kang'an)

340
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,719
The local official was incompetent.

341
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,840
The tribute, a saber, was taken.

342
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,120
Why would he be so angry?

343
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,679
The local official was killed.

344
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,279
And the imperial saber was taken.

345
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:22,479
You're a chief.

346
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,959
But it took almost a year
for you to know that.

347
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,999
How could His Majesty not be angry?

348
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:30,600
Do you really think

349
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:33,400
it was just about the imperial saber?

350
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,959
You mean...

351
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:40,360
Since His Majesty ascended the throne,

352
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:41,719
the country has been peaceful.

353
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,800
All nations worship our country.

354
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,280
In such prosperous time,

355
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,320
there are hundreds
of officials working for him.

356
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,200
But there's always pain

357
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,240
that His Majesty can't express
to the officials.

358
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,999
Could it be the Red Flower Club?

359
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:02,760
Looks like you've
finally realised it.

360
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,119
No one knows His Majesty
better than me.

361
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,119
The Red Flower Club is
like a thorn to him.

362
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,880
It's a pain in the neck.

363
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,840
If he mobilises forces to annihilate it,

364
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:19,720
it'll generate controversies.

365
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:21,240
His reputation will be affected.

366
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:23,880
If he just lets it be,

367
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,720
it'll be an eyesore,
he won't be able to rest assured.

368
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,920
His Majesty is busy.

369
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,840
What do you think

370
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,840
he should do?

371
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,720
Of course

372
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,240
he has to find the closest person
who he trusts most.

373
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,959
To play it by ear.

374
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:52,720
Thanks for your reminder, Mother.

375
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,320
I'll work hard

376
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,079
to share His Majesty's burden.

377
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,860
(Boundary of Foshan)

378
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,920
(Fourth Uncle,)

379
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,599
(you hadn't returned
to Foshan for 13 years)

380
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:37,280
(in order to accompany me
when I was growing up.)

381
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,320
Now, I've brought you back here.

382
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:44,920
You're back to your hometown.

383
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,039
You can rest in peace now.

384
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,360
In the past five years,

385
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,920
I've never forgotten
about what you said.

386
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,999
With the passing of time,

387
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,880
I've constantly practised martial arts.

388
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,079
Now that I've grown up.

389
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,880
It's time for me to go to Miao Renfeng.

390
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,360
To avenge my father and mother.

391
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,559
Fourth Uncle, bless me.

392
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
