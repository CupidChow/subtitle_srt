=Episode 35=

3
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,180
Zeng Tie'ou made it sound too easy.

4
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,980
A blessing in disguise?

5
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,610
It's trouble after another.

6
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,500
We didn't have to fight

7
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,740
to get the Jade Dragon Cup.

8
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,690
But now?

9
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,090
We have to duel for it!

10
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,660
With all the great fighters,

11
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,250
it will be more than challenging to win

12
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,410
the Jade Dragon Cup.

13
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,530
Chief.

14
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,180
What is your take on this?

15
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,940
Words about

16
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,660
the Tianlong Sect as a contender
for the Jade Dragon Cups

17
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,940
are already spreading.

18
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,020
Whatever the case is,

19
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,810
we can't afford to ruin our reputation.

20
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,690
It belongs to the Tianlong Sect.

21
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,540
We're obligated to retrieve it.

22
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,340
If I don't have the time

23
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,580
to improve my martial arts skill,

24
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,810
I shall rely on weapons instead.

25
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,090
What weapons?

26
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,020
Fourth Uncle.

27
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,330
Mrs. Zhong.

28
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,730
Er and San.

29
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,610
I trusted the wrong person back then.

30
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,090
My mistake cost you your lives.

31
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,730
Now,

32
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,780
Feng Yiming and Feng Tiannan
are both dead.

33
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
You've been avenged.

34
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,090
You may go in peace now.

35
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,090
Fei.

36
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,090
The work is done.

37
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,370
We should take Sister Ma and leave the capital.

38
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,700
Let's leave this place
after we rescue the boys.

39
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,610
I promised Ji Xiaofeng

40
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,380
to win a Dragon Cup for the Huaquan Sect

41
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,820
during the Gathering.

42
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,860
I can't leave just yet.

43
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,260
Lingsu.

44
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,730
What did Ziyi tell you that day?

45
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,260
She serves the Red Flower Club, correct?

46
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,260
You were worried my recklessness

47
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,140
would ruin their plans.

48
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,770
Is that why you kept me in the dark?

49
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,330
Fei, I promised Young Lady Yuan.

50
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,860
Please don't make it hard for me.

51
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,610
Very well.

52
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,540
That old geezer

53
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,540
ordered us to search
for Lingsu during the day.

54
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,770
At night, he ordered us
to dig up fresh bodies

55
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,770
for the venomous insects.

56
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,450
There is no end to this!

57
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,730
Xue Que.

58
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,380
This is my fault.

59
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,020
I couldn't defeat him.

60
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,650
But fear not.

61
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,330
If we find Lingsu,

62
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,450
this hardship will be over.

63
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,490
Are you going to her for help?

64
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,650
She has the Seven Pistil
Chaenomeles sinensis.

65
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,330
We are no match for her.

66
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,610
She has a soft heart.

67
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,020
That is her greatest flaw.

68
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,730
We can make use of that flaw

69
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,730
and manipulate her.

70
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,580
Then, we get the Verse of King of Poison

71
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,650
and Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis
to cure ourselves.

72
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,210
That old geezer will
no longer be a threat to me.

73
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,620
After those two are out of the way,

74
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,290
we can rule the valley.

75
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,290
(Verse of King of Poison)

76
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,210
Quick.

77
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,530
Let's go.

78
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,620
Master, we're back.

79
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,060
Master?

80
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,620
Master?

81
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,260
Master?

82
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,530
Master?

83
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,260
Is he dead?

84
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,850
Look for the antidote, quick!

85
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,450
The antidote!

86
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,090
The antidote...

87
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,500
Yes, the antidote...

88
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,770
Cut it out, Jingyue.

89
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,090
Master...

90
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,500
Master!

91
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,890
Jingyue.

92
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,620
Master, I am sorry.

93
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,970
Master, I am sorry.

94
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,850
Master...

95
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,700
Master, I am sorry.

96
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,850
You scared us.

97
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,530
You really scared me, Master.

98
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,700
Did you think my death

99
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,650
would be the chance to free yourselves?

100
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,500
No!

101
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,580
Master, I'm sorry.

102
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,500
Sorry, Master!

103
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,580
Sorry.

104
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,060
Master...

105
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,620
Master, have mercy on me!

106
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,970
I've been meditating in seclusion.

107
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,850
I've mastered a new technique!

108
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,620
I am fusing my poisonous blood

109
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,180
with your bodies.

110
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,940
From now on,

111
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,140
you must consume
my poisonous blood on a daily basis

112
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,650
in order to survive.

113
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,970
Now

114
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,090
we are in the same boat.

115
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,180
If I die,

116
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,820
you won't get my blood.

117
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,330
That will mean a horrible death for you.

118
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,290
You will live long and well.

119
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,380
Jingyue and I will
always be loyal to you.

120
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,580
Yes.

121
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,330
From tomorrow on,

122
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,410
your top priority is finding Lingsu.

123
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,090
But Master, the capital is a large city.

124
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,330
Where do we even begin?

125
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,140
You mentioned she was running low

126
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,060
on her Nine Times
Vitality Restoring Pills.

127
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,380
If she is to stay in the capital,

128
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,140
she will need a substitute medication

129
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,580
to prolong her life.

130
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,140
There is only one viable
substitute for the pills.

131
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,020
The Pill of Condensed Fragrance.

132
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,820
The most important
ingredient in making the pills

133
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,290
is the condensation grass.

134
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,450
The condensation grass?

135
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,620
Master, I've never heard of that before.

136
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,180
The plant grows among
the weed around the hot spring.

137
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,820
It prefers darkness and
is weak against coldness.

138
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,090
The plant can be used in
medicines before the bud blooms.

139
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,410
In the capital,

140
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,530
Mount Yuquan is the only place
where the plant can grow.

141
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,530
We shall wait for her there.

142
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,740
Yes, Master.

143
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,410
(Mount Yuquan)
This is Mount Yuquan.

144
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,740
The spring water there is refreshing.

145
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,690
Even the palace takes water from there.

146
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,410
Alright. We'll search there tomorrow.

147
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,220
(Ziyi, I finally understand)

148
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,930
(why you kept me in the dark.)

149
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,410
(It was because your missions)

150
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,050
(required secrecy.)

151
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,290
(I didn't have the chance to inform you)

152
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,570
(that I had)

153
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,770
(become sworn brothers
with Third Master Zhao very recently.)

154
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,020
(In hindsight,)

155
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,260
(it's clear that my doubts for you)

156
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,930
(were all misunderstandings.)

157
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,410
(Ziyi, believe me.)

158
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,930
(Tomorrow morning at nine o'clock,)

159
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,530
(I'll be waiting at the covered bridge
of Purple Bamboo Park.)

160
00:10:59,170 --> 00:10:59,980
(I look forward)

161
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,380
(to seeing you.)

162
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,570
Ziyi, he's a smart one.

163
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,290
He saw through everything.

164
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,740
Master was worried he'd get in our way,

165
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,650
but he had already become
sworn brothers with Third Master Zhao.

166
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,530
Wait.

167
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,100
If they are sworn brothers now,

168
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,500
that makes him my martial uncle!

169
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,980
This won't do.

170
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,530
He got higher seniority than me

171
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,530
too easily.

172
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,530
Ziyi, now that everything is clear,

173
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,500
you should see him.

174
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,690
Why?

175
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,260
If you two get married,

176
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,930
he'll be my brother-in-law

177
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,890
instead of my martial uncle.

178
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,770
When I see Third Master Zhao,

179
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,930
I can even call him "Brother Zhao."

180
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,290
I'll become a senior.

181
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,620
And what about our master?

182
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,050
Well...

183
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,620
Mind your tongue

184
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,530
or I'll teach you a lesson.

185
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,930
Fine. Don't do it for me.

186
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,530
At least do it for yourself.

187
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:57,980
I'm not going.

188
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,170
Why not?

189
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,410
He's not an outsider,

190
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,340
not to mention he has
great martial arts skills.

191
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,690
Given our mission at hand,

192
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,810
we can use as much help as we can get.

193
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,050
Are you too embarrassed
to see him yourself?

194
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,860
I could go with you.

195
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,980
I'm not going, and neither are you.

196
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,100
Mind the steps, Xiaomei.

197
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,460
Sister Cheng, this place is beautiful.

198
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,930
Xiaomei, let's go.

199
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,810
We have herbs to collect.

200
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,740
Sister Cheng,
what is the condensation grass?

201
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,500
As the name implies, it can only be used

202
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,100
when there is condensation on it.

203
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:01,890
I get it now.

204
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,170
Xiaomei.

205
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,460
Watch your steps.

206
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,740
Let's go.

207
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,020
Sister Cheng.

208
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,380
Are you teaching me
medicinal knowledge and skills

209
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,050
to make me your disciple?

210
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,980
Xiaomei, do you have any idea

211
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,140
how many would die
to be Hero Miao's disciples?

212
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,810
It's a blessing to have the chance

213
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,020
to learn from him.

214
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,140
But his training is too tough.

215
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,770
He wakes me up
before daybreak every day!

216
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,810
My entire body is sore.

217
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,810
Is my training easier than his?

218
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,690
At least I learn better
with your teaching.

219
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,140
Besides, you're amazing.

220
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,020
You can kill with poisons

221
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,740
and save lives with medicines.

222
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,170
My name is Lv Xiaomei,
[*Xiaomei means younger sister in Chinese]

223
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,890
but if you make me your disciple,

224
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,570
I'm the eldest senior
of the Medicine King Sect.

225
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,260
Master, just accept me...

226
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,810
Sister? Sister Cheng?

227
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
Wait for me.

228
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,500
Sister Cheng, is this
the condensation grass?

229
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,890
Yes, but there is no condensation yet.

230
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,740
We can't use it yet.

231
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,170
Whatever. Let's dig it up first.

232
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,140
Sister Cheng, wait!

233
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,890
Sister Cheng, what's on your mind?

234
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,290
You didn't notice the blooming

235
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,460
condensation grass.

236
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,220
Are you thinking about Brother Hu?

237
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,410
Xiaomei.

238
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,570
Keep quiet before I wave

239
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,290
and render you

240
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,260
unconscious for the next week.

241
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,290
Please, have mercy.

242
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,690
I'll collect the herb.

243
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,020
I'll collect the herb, alright?

244
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,530
What's wrong with you anyway?

245
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,620
You clearly like Brother Hu a lot.

246
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,810
Just tell him how you feel.

247
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,100
But, you just watch

248
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,500
as he meets with Young Lady Yuan.

249
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,650
You don't even try to stop him.

250
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,050
If those two fall in love,

251
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,340
what about you?

252
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,930
Let fate decide it.

253
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,290
Xiaomei?

254
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,500
Xiaomei!

255
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,380
Xiaomei, what's wrong?

256
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,860
Xiaomei...

257
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,340
She hasn't moved in a while.

258
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,220
The poison worked.

259
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,460
The old geezer doesn't disappoint.

260
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,500
He laced the grass with poison

261
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,220
and took down Lingsu right away.

262
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,530
Proceed with caution.

263
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,690
She is witty.

264
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,690
Let's go.

265
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,570
Poisoned.

266
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,500
You weren't poisoned.

267
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,460
Xiaomei!

268
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,140
Xiaomei, what's wrong?

269
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,460
Stay still.
We must lure the culprit out.

270
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,140
Xue Que, Jingyue,

271
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,740
when will you relent?

272
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,500
Don't get ahead of yourself.

273
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,810
Do you really think

274
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,380
you're unbeatable?

275
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,930
Sister Cheng,
don't waste your time on them.

276
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,410
Finish them off.

277
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,740
Sister Cheng!

278
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,570
Xiaomei, leave me.

279
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,290
Run for your life.

280
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,180
No!

281
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,940
Run!

282
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,180
Wu Chen.

283
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,770
I thought all of your disciples

284
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,050
were worthless fools.

285
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,660
I'm in this predicament

286
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,370
because I deserved it.

287
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,180
We're even now.

288
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,260
We will never see each other again.

289
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,130
Ziyi.

290
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,660
It's been six hours.

291
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,980
That fool is still waiting for you.

292
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,810
I told you not to go.

293
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,020
He said be there or be square.

294
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,020
I wanted to see
if he'd wait that long for you.

295
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,610
By the way,

296
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,020
he has a little comb in his hand.

297
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,810
Is that the token of your love?

298
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,700
Ziyi.

299
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,290
Listen up.

300
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,530
There are no trees around the bridge.

301
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,220
He's been standing
under the scorching sun.

302
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,090
Ziyi, do you not care about him?

303
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,130
Are you done yet?

304
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,810
I...

305
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,530
Ziyi.

306
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,980
Do you know the story

307
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,370
about Wei Sheng and the bridge?

308
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,980
There was a fool named Wei Sheng.

309
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,900
He asked a girl to meet him
under the bridge.

310
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,530
But, the girl's parents wouldn't
let her meet Wei Sheng.

311
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,940
So, he just kept
waiting under the bridge.

312
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,660
Then, there was a flood
because of the downpour.

313
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,020
He thought to himself,
"I'm waiting under the bridge."

314
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,500
"We can't leave until we meet."

315
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,130
So, he held onto
the pillars of the bridge

316
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,530
so he wouldn't get washed away.

317
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,940
Eventually, he drowned and died.

318
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,420
At first,

319
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,130
I thought Wei Sheng was a fool.

320
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,810
But then I realized

321
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,850
how loyal he was.

322
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,810
He may be foolish,
but lovable nonetheless.

323
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,420
Of course,

324
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,020
given Hu Fei's prowess,

325
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,980
not even a downpour or flood

326
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,130
can drown him.

327
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,220
But if he gets heat stroke from the sun,

328
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,770
that will be bad.

329
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,810
Master will be here soon.

330
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,420
I must recite scriptures with her.

331
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,460
Shut up or I'll rat you out.

332
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,610
Let Master take care of you.

333
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,420
Fine, I'll shut up.

334
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,900
Suit yourself.

335
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,370
You're Shi Wanchen, the Lord of Poison!

336
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,850
Correct.

337
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,980
I am way more powerful

338
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,900
than your master Yi Chen.

339
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,700
Fools!

340
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,850
Give up.

341
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,770
They were struck with ink spider venom.

342
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,330
Only the silk from the ink spider
can cure them now.

343
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,530
I wouldn't be so sure.

344
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,220
Brigitte silkworm poison technique...

345
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,260
You are troubled,

346
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,420
hence, unable to focus on the prayer.

347
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,330
The only challenge of prayer

348
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,090
is the distraction.

349
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,130
The path to enlightenment
is a long journey with challenges.

350
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,370
One can't afford to be distracted.

351
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,420
Settle it once and for all.

352
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,500
He is too stubborn.

353
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,740
He may not be convinced.

354
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,420
You are doing this for yourself.

355
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,940
You know a thing or two.

356
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,220
I'll give you that.

357
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,500
I mastered the Brigitte
silkworm poison technique.

358
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,700
Your late master can only
dream of having my prowess.

359
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,900
Why don't you do as they did?

360
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,050
Kneel and pledge your loyalty to me.

361
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,770
Lingsu, kneel down and apologize.

362
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,770
Ask our martial uncle
nicely to take you in.

363
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,500
Murong Jingyue, do you know no shame?

364
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,460
We don't have a martial uncle.

365
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,290
Lingsu, do not be insolent.

366
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,810
Kowtow and apologize now.

367
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,530
If you upset our master,

368
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,940
you'll die the worst death.

369
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,810
Jingyue and I

370
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,940
have both become his disciples.

371
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,220
Hand over the Verse
of the King of Poison

372
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,370
and the Seven Pistil
Chaenomeles sinensis.

373
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,610
Beg for his mercy

374
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,130
and he will spare you.

375
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,770
You betrayed our sect

376
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,980
and sided with an enemy.

377
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,810
That is the highest degree of treason
in the martial arts world.

378
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,090
In any sect,

379
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,570
you should be executed.

380
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,370
In that case,

381
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,330
we are no longer martial siblings.

382
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,570
Your stubbornness

383
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,330
shall warrant my wrath.

384
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,850
They are living proof of it.

385
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,020
Ask them how Jiang Tieshan and his son

386
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,260
died in the end.

387
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,610
It was you who murdered them.

388
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,660
Of course.

389
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,500
There is only ever
one code that I uphold.

390
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,940
Obey me or die.

391
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,220
Xue Que, he killed your son.

392
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,180
How could you side with him?

393
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,770
You are shameless!

394
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,980
Master was right about you.

395
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,850
You abuse your knowledge
and are beyond salvation!

396
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,420
They couldn't see the bigger picture.

397
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,610
Our sect revolves around

398
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,330
the use of poisons and venom.

399
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,050
If we are already
using poisons and venom,

400
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,530
why bother pretending to be
on the side of goodness?

401
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,090
I'd rather be a villain

402
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,770
and be loathed

403
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,290
than be like your dead master

404
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,610
who was a fraud

405
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,810
and a hypocrite!

406
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:27,810
Brother Hu!

407
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:30,900
Come with me.

408
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:31,980
We must rescue Sister Cheng.

409
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,660
She might already be in trouble.

410
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,850
Quick!

411
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,020
You have two options now.

412
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,420
Kneel and be my disciple,

413
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,180
hand over the Verse of King of Poisons
and Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis.

414
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,570
Or, I can take your life right now!

415
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,290
Do you think
the Brigitte silkworm poison technique

416
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,810
is enough to defeat me?

417
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,370
As far as I know,

418
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,570
Grandmaster never passed
the secret knowledge of the Verse

419
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,330
to you.

420
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,330
Does it matter?

421
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,500
The technique is inferior to
the Magic Power of King of Poison,

422
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,530
but you are young.

423
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,660
Even with your talents

424
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,660
and mastery over
the Magic Power of King of Poison,

425
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,770
your ailing body

426
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,180
can't unleash
the full power of the technique.

427
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,260
I've cured the two of them.

428
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,740
That's you against the three of us.

429
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,020
What makes you think you can win?

430
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,940
Get her!

431
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,290
Lingsu, I'm coming for you!

432
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:19,850
Ziyi?

433
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,740
Help me up!

434
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,500
Lingsu, are you alright?

435
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,770
Master, we're almost there.

436
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,460
Master...

437
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,500
Hang in there.

438
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,290
Master.

439
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:25,900
Yes.

440
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:26,850
Quick.

441
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,570
Help me inside.

442
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,050
Help me up.

443
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,530
Watch out.

444
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:33,770
Take it easy.

445
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,500
Be careful, Master.

446
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,500
Be careful.

447
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,610
Close the lid.

448
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,610
Yes.

449
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,900
Sister Cheng.

450
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,090
Brother Hu ran fast as the wind

451
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,700
to rescue you.

452
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,260
I ran as hard as I could,

453
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,180
but the fight was
already over when I got here.

454
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,050
Fei, I feel much better now.

455
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,980
Thank Sister Yuan

456
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,900
for the aid.

457
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,700
That can wait.

458
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,330
Fei.

459
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,420
You should make it clear to Sister Yuan.

460
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,940
You've been through
life and death together.

461
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,500
Feng Tiannan is gone too.

462
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,050
There are many things
you don't know about Sister Yuan.

463
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,700
She has her reasons.

464
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,900
Ziyi.

465
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,610
Thank you for the help.

466
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,130
I am glad that you are willing

467
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,570
to meet me.

468
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,660
I...

469
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,260
That's right.

470
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,940
Do you remember the little comb

471
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,090
I was about to give you
at the Guanyin temple?

472
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,330
Will you

473
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,610
accept it now?

474
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,810
You should give it

475
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,940
to Sister Cheng instead.

476
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,660
She's been of great help to you.

477
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,460
Her love for you is unwavering.

478
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,700
Do not let it go unanswered.

479
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,130
Everything I did for you

480
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,420
was out of guilt.

481
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,050
Everything I did...

482
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,180
was to redeem myself.

483
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,330
To redeem yourself?

484
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,700
Correct.

485
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,980
I've been trying to atone

486
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,420
for my sins.

487
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,940
Even if you'd given it to me back then,

488
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,330
I wouldn't have accepted it.

489
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,660
Ziyi, are you

490
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,260
being honest with me?

491
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,610
And at the Weituo Sect?

492
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,290
You spent all night protecting
the Epiphyllum

493
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,180
until it bloomed

494
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,850
to pray for me.

495
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,020
Was that all just an act?

496
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,180
As transient as the flower's blooming,

497
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,180
it took only a moment,

498
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,260
and withered just as fast.

499
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,660
All of it...

500
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,180
was the result of my karma.

501
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,610
I don't understand.

502
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,660
Feng Tiannan...

He's my birth father.

504
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,570
For justice, he should die.

505
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,850
But as his daughter,

506
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,500
I gave him a proper burial.

507
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,530
(As my master says,)

508

512
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,180
I buried him and his son.

513
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,090
I've put an end to this ill fate.

514
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,220
Sorry, I...

515
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,020
I didn't know you'd
carry such a burden.

516
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,260
Knowing it wouldn't have
changed a thing.

517
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,260
Nothing could have been changed.

518
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,420
Yes.

519
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,330
Nothing could have been changed.

520
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,460
Take care.
