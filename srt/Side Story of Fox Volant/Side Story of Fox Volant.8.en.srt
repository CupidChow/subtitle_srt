=Side Story Of Fox Volant=
(Adapted from Jin Yong's novel)

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,280
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,119
Ruolan, when you grow up,

4
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:47,640
what kind of person will you marry?

5
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,959
I loved storytelling and seeing a play.

6
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:55,520
I especially like the heroes.

7
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,720
They are enjoying their life,

8
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,920
unrestrained.

9
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:03,040
But your life isn't a play.

10
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,080
If you were like me,

11
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,040
married to a hero,

12
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,800
you'd have to worry about him

13
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,240
every day and night.

14
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,120
I wonder how is your father now.

15
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,999
Does he miss us?

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
Goddess of Mercy,

17
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,160
please bless Renfeng with safety

18
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
and come home sooner.

19
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,040
I just found out about this as well.

20
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,719
I didn't teach my son well.

21
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,879
Please accept my apologies.

22
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,200
Today, I'm going to
put the Feng Family in order.

23
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,519
Something is not right.

24
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,560
Kid, now you know!

25
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,760
Listen,

26
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,559
everyone in the Foshan Town
obeys Old Master Feng,

27
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,200
be it man or woman, elder or kid,
human or animal.

28
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,799
When you are here,

29
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,559
no matter how powerful
or strong you are,

30
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,359
you'd want to behave

31
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:00,760
and stay out of trouble.

32
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,559
Hold your tail down.

33
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,399
Who do you think you are?

34
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,280
How dare you go against Old Master Feng?

35
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,799
Who do you think you are?

36
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,440
Exactly.

37
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,679
Well, I don't see any poultries here,

38
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,720
but dogs.

39
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,320
There's one in front of me.

40
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,239
You definitely have a death wish!

41
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,200
How dare you indirectly scold me.

42
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:31,720
Young Master Feng told me

43
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,720
to give you some special treatment.

44
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,959
Today, I'm going to
make your life worse than death.

45
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,200
You'd hope you're beheaded.

46
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,959
Wait, don't hit me.

47
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:44,839
I...

48
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,119
I have some important news for you.

49
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,480
If you dare to lie to me,

50
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,720
I'll skin you alive.

51
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,559
Think about it.

52
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,440
What news do
Old Master Feng and Magistrate

53
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,600
want to know the most?

54
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,720
The news of your accomplice.

55
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,679
Tell me. Tell me now.

56
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,280
When I got the reward,

57
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,559
I'll treat you well.

58
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,160
Come closer.

59
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,559
Come closer.

60
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,679
The accomplice?

61
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,280
She is in...

62
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,480
Old Master Feng,

63
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,679
are you satisfied with the trial today?

64
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,519
Fair enough.

65
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,079
A small potato can't cause much trouble.

66
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:50,639
Foshan Town belongs to you,
Old Master Feng.

67
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,759
I'll help you
to win the heart of people.

68
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,600
Don't worry.

69
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,840
The people of Foshan Town

70
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,559
will surely forget about what happened

71
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,480
in these two days.

72
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,239
Your reputation will soar.

73
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,679
There is

74
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,239
more than this small potato
in Foshan Town,

75
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,199
some of them are at large.

76
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:21,999
I've ordered the patrols to conduct
a thorough investigation in the town.

77
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,119
People are only allowed to
enter Foshan Town, but not exit.

78
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,439
If needed,

79
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:30,199
I can ask for help
from the Green Standard Army too.

80
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,759
That lady can never escape.

81
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,759
There'll always be a man of bravery
under the promise of a big reward.

82
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,640
Well, as for the reward...

83
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,520
100 taels for those who provide leads.

84
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,679
3000 taels for those who capture her.

85
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,759
Dead or alive.

86
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,119
Old Master Feng,
please wait for our good news.

87
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,040
But with the men you have right now,

88
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,559
it's far from enough.

89
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,720
(Announcement: A thief named Hu broke into the
residence at night and hurt two people. Was caught)

90
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,640
(Will be beheaded in a few days)

91
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,199
Move.

92
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,080
Move aside.

93
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,319
Look what's written here.

94
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,119
A thief named Hu

95
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:29,960
broke into the residence at night

96
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,199
and hurt two people.

97
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:32,920
Ruolan.

98
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,759
Ruolan.

99
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,280
Good girl.

100
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,999
Good girl, Ruolan.

101
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,640
Don't cry. Don't cry, Ruolan.

102
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,040
Mrs. Miao.

103
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,119
Let me put her to sleep.

104
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,439
Madam, try on these clothes.

105
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,679
Let me know if it doesn't fit,

106
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,960
I'll get the tailor to alter it.

107
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,640
There's no need. I have enough clothing.

108
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,040
Ruolan, be a good girl
and have some sleep.

109
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,799
The Old Master is
the best friend of Hero Miao.

110
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,879
There's no need to be so polite.

111
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,160
I really don't need it.

112
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,480
If you are so polite,

113
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,080
the sect leader will blame us
for being ignorant.

114
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,879
Furthermore,

115
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,040
these pieces of clothing aren't enough.

116
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,799
When I got married,

117
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,559
I didn't get any new clothes

118
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
or held a banquet.

119
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,759
There's really no need for all these.

120
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,679
Didn't you get a new wedding dress
when you got married?

121
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,999
Hero Miao saved my life.

122
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,280
I can never repay

123
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,359
his kindness.

124
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,879
He doesn't prefer luxury,

125
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,679
and I shall follow in his footsteps.

126
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,520
That's true.

127
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,999
A hero and a beauty,

128
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,999
having bread and water
for life is joyful too.

129
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
It'd been a long day.

130
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Go get some rest.

131
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,600
Please, please.
I haven't eaten for three days.

132
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,439
There are two beggars here.

133
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:11,119
Go.

134
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:15,119
What is it?

135
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,920
I think you are Hu Fei's gang.

136
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,799
You've got the wrong person.

137
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,720
I'm not.

138
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
How dare you deny it!

139
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,720
That day, the brat

140
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,119
was wearing this beggar clothing too.

141
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,799
That wasn't us.

142
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,080
Are you not telling the truth?

143
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,720
How can you arrest people
without evidence?

144
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,199
Bring them.

145
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,359
Go! Go!

146
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,239
It's not us!

147
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:31,119
Oh my. Sir, it's not us.

148
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,439
Oh my, it's not us.

149
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,759
Another waste of effort.

150
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,920
Not even a person in sight.

151
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:42,840
Father,

152
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,920
we treat the professionals
that you hired

153
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,119
like our ancestors.

154
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:50,679
But they couldn't find her too.

155
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,280
I don't get them here

156
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,080
to look for that woman.

157
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,640
But, once they found her,

158
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,679
she'll not have the chance to escape.

159
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,199
But Foshan is a small town.

160
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,439
I searched thoroughly a few times,

161
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,720
there was no trace of her.

162
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,640
Father,

163
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,040
do you think she escaped from Foshan?

164
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,199
We've set up roadblocks on every road,

165
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,160
but she was nowhere to be seen.

166
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,679
Did she fly away with wings?

167
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,000
She must be hiding somewhere else.

168
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,040
Father, if she keeps hiding from us,

169
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,599
then

170
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,760
we will never find her.

171
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,000
Inciting one to take action is more
effective than dispatching an order.

172
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,040
Since she doesn't show up,

173
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,400
we'll force her to show up.

174
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,199
Push her again.

175
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,880
There is a thief named Hu Fei,

176
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,199
(Announcement)
colluding with Foshan's people, Zhong Asi,

177
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:07,000
to fraud.

178
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,599
Then, they had an internal conflict
due to uneven distribution of loot,

179
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,240
and Hu Fei murdered two people.

180
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:16,640
He committed a crime
and is better off dead.

181
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,400
Young Master,

182
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,559
are we killing him tomorrow?

183
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you think

184
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,160
we should behead him

185
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,360
or torture him to death?

186
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,360
Young Master,

187
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,240
but we haven't captured his accomplice.

188
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:37,360
Are we not going to trap them?

189
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,799
Didn't you always take him as bait?

190
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:42,199
He is bait.

191
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,880
As long as he's in our hands,

192
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,799
he'll always be the bait.

193
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,479
The more critical his situation is,

194
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,120
the higher chance
his accomplice will show up.

195
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,120
The moment she appears,

196
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,959
the people of the Two Great Cavaliers

197
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,559
will cut her into pieces right away.

198
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,599
You mean

199
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,679
you are bluffing.

200
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,479
Young Master, you are so smart.

201
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,360
This is what we called
mixing the truth with lies.

202
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,719
If she comes to save him,
then it's a lie.

203
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,000
But if she doesn't come to save him,
then it's the truth.

204
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,319
Kill him

205
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,599
and give vent my anger on him.

206
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:51,079
Screw you!

207
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:56,880
What are you looking at?

208
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:58,880
Are you trying to bite me?

209
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,559
Look, what's this?

210
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,959
No idea?

211
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,839
Tomorrow noon.

212
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:38,199
Brat, when you are in the Netherworld,

213
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,640
please remember my face too.

214
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,599
Screw you!

215
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,760
(Tianlong)

216
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,199
Mrs. Miao,
the Old Master is looking for you.

217
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,559
What is it?

218
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,719
The Old Master mentions
it's something important.

219
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,079
Please go over to his place.

220
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,799
The Old Master repeatedly said

221
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,880
that the matter will need your help.

222
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
Hong, please help me to tidy up.

223
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,160
Yes.

224
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:42,920
Madam. Madam. Madam.

225
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,479
Wishing Madam is blessed with
long life and great prosperity.

226
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:06,479
Wishing Madam is blessed with
long life and great prosperity.

227
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,839
Thank you.

228
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,160
Thank you.

229
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,719
Come.

230
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,439
Leader Tian, these...

231
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:21,160
Did you forget?

232
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,280
It's your birthday today.

233
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,679
Thank you for the arrangement,
Leader Tian.

234
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Did you hear from Renfeng?

235
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:35,760
He...

236
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,520
Right! Before he left,

237
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,760
he asked me to hold a grand and lively

238
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,640
birthday party for you.

239
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,240
There's no way he'll remember this.

240
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,520
He'll only think of
the martial arts world and his friends.

241
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:58,719
Leader Tian, thank you for doing this.

242
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,120
Don't mention it.

243
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,599
Oh, I have another surprise for you.

244
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,839
Please close your eyes.

245
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,920
Close your eyes.

246
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,120
Why are you here?

247
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:31,400
Now you know

248
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,120
I was right.

249
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,439
One who doesn't listen to the elders'
advice will suffer his loss.

250
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,519
They are anxious about
not being able to capture you.

251
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,759
Why do you turn yourself in?

252
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:43,999
You'll tell first.

253
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,120
Which one of us is right?

254
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,880
Fine, you are right.

255
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,600
I was wrong about that.

256
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,160
I was deceived by Feng.

257
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,800
I'm kicking myself.

258
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,400
You couldn't blame
Old Master Feng for this.

259
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,600
As the saying goes,
the idiot and the conman

260
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,800
always come in pairs.

261
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,039
Old Master Feng

262
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
doesn't seem to be unreasonable.

263
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,560
You shouldn't have a bias.

264
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:15,360
His son is a jerk,

265
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,719
doesn't mean he's a bad person.

266
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Furthermore,

267
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:20,439
he is an elder.

268
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,370
And since that's what he said,

269
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,940
it's inappropriate to make him look bad.

270
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,330
Well, you remember
these words very clearly.

271
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,180
Yes,

272
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,660
if you offended me,

273
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,180
I'll never forget about it.

274
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,700
Young Lady, I'm begging you.

275
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,370
Just leave. Please.

276
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,500
Don't let them catch you.

277
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,700
How about you

278
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,130
if I leave?

279
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,180
Don't mind me.

280
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,420
I'll back you up.

281
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,610
Look at you now.

282
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,130
You are barely surviving

283
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,660
and you still think of protecting me.

284
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,420
I don't have the energy
to quarrel with you.

285
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,770
Go.

286
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,050
Who are you thinking?

287
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,260
You are dying,

288
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,420
but you're still being so lusty.

289
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,660
Thinking of girls.

290
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,850
Which sweetheart
that you can't get over?

291
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,530
Tell me,

292
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,900
I'll let her know.

293
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,700
Fine.

294
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,020
Tell your father this,

295
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,050
Master Hu

296
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,220
will chase him to the end of the world
and kill him

297
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,700
to avenge the Zhong Family.

298
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,850
You are dying but still acting tough.

299
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,220
I'll kill you!

300
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,530
If he is beaten to death,

301
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,020
I'll behead you tomorrow.

302
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,610
Get lost!

303
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,260
Yes, yes.

304
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,850
I dare not. I dare not.

305
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,700
I dare not.

306
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,770
Your good days...

307
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,460
are over.

308
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,260
Why are you here?

309
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,660
Sorry for bothering you, Leader Tian.

310
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:19,980
Come in, please.

311
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,700
Have a sit.

312
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,850
Do you enjoy your meal?

313
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,740
Thank you, Leader Tian.

314
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,260
Everything is great here.

315
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,900
I'm here today to ask for a favor.

316
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,420
I guess you must be
worried about Brother Miao.

317
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,180
There's no sign of him coming home,

318
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,260
I'm worried.

319
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,260
I'd like to ask Leader Tian
to figure out his whereabouts.

320
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,050
A single day apart seems like three
years and one longing for a reunion.

321
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,370
It's human nature.

322
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
Not to mention you,

323
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,090
even I miss Brother Miao too.

324
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,130
But Miaojiang is very far and remote.

325
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,940
It's quite hard
to send the message over.

326
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,530
Please be patient.

327
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,570
But don't you worry,

328
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,570
I've sent someone
to gather the information.

329
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,660
Thank you, Leader Tian.

330
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,610
When Renfeng returns,
we'll thank you in person again.

331
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,260
This is nothing.

332
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,420
I've been friends
with Brother Miao for years,

333
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,660
don't mention this.

334
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,420
Sect Leader! Lead...

00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,020
Now, you should be relieved.

336
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,370
What is it?

337
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,770
Do you have any news from Miaojiang?

338
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,660
I...

339
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,940
Sect Leader, can we speak in private?

340
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,220
Please give me a minute.

341
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,130
Tell me, what's wrong?

342
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,810
Sect Leader, things went wrong!

343
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,420
Hero Miao, he...

344
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,090
He died in Miaojiang.

345
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,330
He...

346
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,130
He died in Miaojiang.

347
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,810
Wait. Are you sure about this?

348
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,700
He is at the top of his generation.

349
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,980
Who could kill him?

350
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,980
I rushed back to report

351
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,130
as soon as I got the news.

352
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,130
Rumour has it he was shot by a throat-sealing
needle from Golden Sand Gang.

353
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,740
He died from poisoning.

the time is up. So...

357
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,530
Father, I think
his accomplice is not coming.

358
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,330
You overestimated them.

359
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,260
They are merely gangsters.

360
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,570
Judging from the situation,

361
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,260
I bet they chickened out.

362
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,740
I think that lady

is probably around.

364

Even if she's around,

365
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,570
look at the situation.

366
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,770
Obviously, this is a turkey shoot.

367
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,700
Even if she's good,

368
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,530
she doesn't dare to come close
and seek death.

369
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,370
She is not Miao Renfeng after all.

370
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,260
Father, we are standing
in front of the heroes.

371
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,850
If we keep delaying,

372
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,660
they might laugh at us,

373
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,940
saying that we are manipulated
by a lady.

374
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
If the word spread,

375
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,050
it doesn't bother me,

376
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,050
but it will ruin your reputation

377
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,020
in the martial arts world.

378
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,610
If we kill Hu Fei,

379
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,330
the one who left is a lady.

380
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,500
There's nothing much she can do.

381
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,900
Guard!

382
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,050
Bring up Hu Fei, the thief who killed

I'm giving you one last chance.

386

If you don't show up,

387
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,530
he'll be dead.

388
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,090
Now what?

389
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,740
No one is saving him.

390
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,130

You are such a coward.

Fine.

Isn't this Yang San,
the head of the prison?

How is it not the criminal Hu Fei?

Back to the prison.

to meet a friend of mine,

even if we have to dig into the ground.

420

I'm on it.

421

The Feng Family is everywhere.

Both of you aren't local,

Sooner or later, they'll find you.

As long as I'm still alive,

I'll not allow the Feng Family

for the sake of your child.

452

Finish the medicine.

454
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,850
I'm always on edge

455

when he leaves.

456
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,500
Sometimes, I dreamt about him

457
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,610
covered in blood
and lying on the ground.

458

After waking up,

459
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,980
I would hold Ruolan
and I don't dare to sleep again

until dawn.

the nightmare comes true.

463
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,900
The feeling of gratitude and revenge,

464
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,570
the moment of life and death,

465
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,770
these are something that we are used to.

But you are different.

00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,570
You are from a different world.

469
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,730
It must be hard for you.

470
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,690
He saved me from death

471
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,780
and I'm willing to marry him.

472
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,460
I should have bear with
the feeling of anxiety and worry.

473
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,610
But he should think of Ruolan too.

474
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,130
Now,

475
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,820
he died in a foreign place

476
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,900
for a so-called truth.

477
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,940
Then how about Ruolan?

478
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,690
How about me?

479
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,460
If you don't mind...

480
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,020
If you don't mind,

481
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,860
you can stay here.

482
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,570
I might not be the best
in the world of martial art,

483
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,460
and I might not be a big name,

484
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,380
but I can promise you this,

485
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,300
as long as I'm alive,

486
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,650
I will not let you and your daughter

487
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,460
suffer a bit.

488
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,340
Leader Tian, thanks for the kindness.

489
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,650
My daughter and I have been

490
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,460
bothering you lately.

491
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,570
Lan is still an infant.

492
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,500
Eventually, we have to
think of a long-term plan.

493
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,690
You can live here
for the rest of your life.

494
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,250
Finish the medicine.

495
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,020
I've playing with the wild goose,

496
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,980
but now I was blinded by the geese.

497
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,860
I was in the martial arts world
for decades.

498
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,690
Countless heroes

499
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,610
have fallen in my hands.

500
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,340
I didn't expect

501
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,980
to be tricked by a young lady.

502
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,900
It is hard
to guard against conspiracies.

503
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,780
These two people

504
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,500
are bothering me
unless we've gotten rid of them.

505
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,130
But father,

506
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,420
we don't know how it would turn out yet.

507
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,610
As long as he's still in Foshan,

508
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,300
he can never escape from us.

509
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,460
Be that as it may,

510
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,250
the only bait that I have

511
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,340
is lost.

512
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,460
There are so many people out there.

513
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,210
If we want to locate them,

514
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,250
it's harder than reaching the sky.

515
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,460
Father, who tells you
we don't have bait?

516
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,250
Think about it.

517
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,020
There's Mrs. Zhong.

518
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,690
We can capture and use her as bait.

519
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,530
Do it again.

520
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,570
We can easily catch the fish.

521
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,250
You are right!

522
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,860
I'm so silly.

523
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,300
Why didn't I think of that?

524
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,820
Both of them are chivalrous people.

525
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
If something happened to Mrs. Zhong,

526
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,610
the two of them
will definitely come to the rescue.

527
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:13,860
Right.

528
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,650
But if they didn't show up,

529
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,940
then they are the ones
who kill Mrs. Zhong.
