00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,570
(The manor is well guarded.)

4
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,730
(It's best)

5
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,690
(to infiltrate at night.)

6
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,340
Brother Wang.

7
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,580
Let's both

8
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,450
call it a day.

9
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,130
My shift starts at nine o'clock later.

10
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,540
It's inadequate for me

11
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,020
to reek of booze.

12
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,980
Sure.

13
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,260
This is the last round.

14
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,980
Yes.

15
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,580
It's tough working the night shift.

16
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,660
Eat up.

17
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:46,970
Brother Wang.

18
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,020
You said you knew Hu Fei.

19
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,220
What kind of person is he?

20
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,330
Speaking of Hu Fei,

21
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,170
he has great
martial arts skills for his age.

22
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,170
He is honorable.

23
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,330
A great man indeed.

24
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,660
But sadly,

25
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,810
he's made Official Fu his enemy.

26
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,530
He went to Official Fu's house
to assassinate him.

27
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,370
Where do I even begin?

28
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,250
Brother Wang, you...

29
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,170
Come in.

30
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,860
Brother Wang, you could have told me

31
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,660
you were dining here today.

32
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,140
I was at the Qunying Restaurant,

33
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,330
drinking with Wang Jianying
and Wang Jianjie.

34
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,330
We even mentioned you.

35
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,250
Hu...

36
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,020
Brother Wang, do you know this man?

37
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,260
We are old friends.

38
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,490
It's been a while, Brother Wang.

39
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,650
Today,

40
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,860
it's my treat.

41
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,860
To your health.

42
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,170
We were just talking

43
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,770
about the cage fight.

44
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,820
It was truly thrilling.

45
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,420
But Brother Zhou did not disappoint.

46
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,730
Someday

47
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,930
I must put together
a banquet for you three.

48
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,260
Let's drink heartily then.

49
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,540
I didn't expect you actually know

50
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,300
so many great martial artists.

51
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,580
I am Zhang Jiu,
a Right Barrack constable.

52
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,450
May I know your name?

53
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,300
You should ask Brother Wang instead.

54
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,170
I've had too much drink already.

55
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,450
Pardon my tardiness.

56
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,580
I didn't recognize you just now.

57
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,770
Official Zhang and I have work to do.

58
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,300
Please, leave us be.

59
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,730
We'll meet another day.

60
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,380
Your work got the better of you.

61
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,020
You ate at my house the other day.

62
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,330
When we were about to play dominoes,

63
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,330
something came up.

64
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,450
Brother Zhou ended up
fighting the others.

65
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,420
It didn't end well.

66
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,820
Brother Wang,

67
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,100
do you know remember me, Hu Fei?

68
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,450
Hu Fei?

69
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,580
Brother Hu!

70
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,700
Brother Wang.

71
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,170
Would you fight me as well?

72
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,100
Brother Hu.

73
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,930
You're a wanted fugitive in the city.

74
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,100
You can't stay here.

75
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,770
Leave while you still can.

76
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,260
I'm not going anywhere for now.

77
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,450
I have a debt

78
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,140
to settle with Fu Kang'an.

79
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,930
Brother Hu.

80
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,380
I'm no match for you
when it comes to martial arts.

81
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,490
I have a word of advice for you.

82
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,980
Official Fu is too powerful.

83
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,650
You can make him your enemy,

84
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,260
but you can't defeat him.

85
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,970
I serve him.

86
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,330
I work for him.

87
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,940
I can't protect you all the time.

88
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,890
I'll escort you out of the city.

89
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,180
Leave now.

90
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,380
Brother Wang.

91
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,580
Do you know why I made
Fu Kang'an my enemy?

92
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,380
I have no idea.

93
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,210
It's a long story.

94
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,580
Let's get your friend on the bed.

95
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,770
How could they be so vile?

96
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,290
He's not worthy of Young Lady Ma's love.

97
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,410
Brother Hu.

98
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,650
Your sense of justice and mercy

99
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,820
has left me impressed.

100
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,650
I know you're compassionate.

101
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,770
That is why I told you the truth.

102
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,820
My goal now is to
rescue the two children.

103
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,620
I need your help, Brother Wang.

104
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,060
The manor is heavily guarded.

105
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,210
Rescuing the boys

106
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,290
could very likely be impossible.

107
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,290
Perhaps

108
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,330
we should wait until everything

109
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,620
calms down.

110
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,020
Brother Wang.

111
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,380
If we could wait,

112
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,890
would I take the risk of coming here?

113
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,290
I have a plan

114
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,020
to sneak in and out of the place.

115
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,500
What is your plan?

116
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,700
Come with me.

117
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,290
Zhang Jiu's physique is similar to mine.

118
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,700
I can put on his uniform
and sneak in as a guard.

119
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,020
When it's your shift,

120
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,290
lead me into the manor.

121
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,020
Don't worry.

122
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,740
I blocked his acupuncture points.

123
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,620
He won't be moving for another 24 hours.

124
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,820
I'll wait here.

125
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,020
Pick me up at nine o'clock.

126
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,180
Brother Wang.

127
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,650
I know this is a delicate matter.

128
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,090
We still have time until your shift.

129
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,650
You may reconsider this.

130
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,180
You are such a failure!

131
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,380
You fool!

132
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,060
How could you say yes to this?

133
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,410
I know I've made a mistake.

134
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,620
But

135
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,140
the rule of honor dictates
that we must help Hu Fei.

136
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,290
Besides,

137
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,060
we get along very well.

138
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,500
He is from the martial arts world.

139
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,770
We are officers.

140
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,290
We must obey the law!

141
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,500
(Master.)

142
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,620
(I keep your words in mind.)

143
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,090
(I won't leave unless it's necessary.)

144
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,620
(It's necessary for me
to leave for his rescue.)

145
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,180
(But leaving for the investigation)

146
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,290
(and going to the capital with Hu Fei)

147

(was my personal agenda.)

148
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,090
(I only have a handful)

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,530
(of the life-extending pills.)

150
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,940
(Is this a sign)

151
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,090
(to tell me to give up)

152
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,410
(and return to the valley?)

153
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,820
Yuan Xing.

154
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,530
Master.

155
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,860
Do not forget your mission.

156
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,220
If anything goes wrong,

157
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,810
you will be held accountable.

158
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,650
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

159
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,290
I'll keep watch on
the Madam and the boys.

160
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,770
Boss.

161
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,770
I'm here to see the man
from the Xuan room.

162
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,570
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

163
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,740
Shut it.

164
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,570
Take me to him.

165
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,570
I'm here for official business.

166
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,570
The room upstairs is the Xuan room.

167
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,860
Come in.

168
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,740
Come in.

169
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,650
Brother Zhang of the Right Barrack.

170
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,570
I am Ren Tongwu.

171
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
I serve in the Left Barrack.

172
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,620
Hey there, Brother Ren.

173
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,770
It's a pleasure to meet you.

174
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,770
There are

175
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,220
so many people in the Barracks.

176
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,290
I couldn't recognize you.

177
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,050
The two Barracks are separated.

178
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,380
I'm new here.

179
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,530
It's normal that you don't know me.

180
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,770
(To Zhang Jiu)
This order came from above.

181
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,020
(To Zhang Jiu)
They wanted you to have it.

182
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,530
Thanks, my friend.

183
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,100
Which Barrack

184
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,020
has the shift at nine o'clock?

185
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,220
The Left Barrack.

186
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,770
The Left Barrack?

187
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,890
Put this inside the envelope.

188
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,050
Use the official seal.

189
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,690
Mix it with Assistant
Commander Lin's documents.

190
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,340
A wise move, Eldest Brother.

191
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,500
(I doubt Wang Tie'e)

192
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,260
(could come up with this idea.)

193
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,770
(Zhou Tiejiao must feel
worried for his brother)

194
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,860
(and sent me a scapegoat.)

195
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,810
I was ordered to
follow you for this shift.

196
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,380
It was supposed to be my day off.

197
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,410
But they summoned me
in the middle of the night.

198
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,650
Someone broke into the manor recently.

199
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,530
We're all having a tough time.

200
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,980
But we're getting a reward for it.

201
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,260
Indeed.

202
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,140
When the payment comes,

203
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,220
I'll treat you

204
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,770
to a feast at Juying Restaurant.

205
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:18,930
Brother Zhang.

206
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,260
It's almost seven o'clock.

207
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,980
We should get going now.

208
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,770
Yes.

209
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,650
The work comes first.

210
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,860
Let's go.

211
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,890
Brother Zhang.

212
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,620
Brother Zhang, what's wrong?

213
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,810
I left something in the room.

214
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,810
Let me get it.

215
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,770
Wait downstairs.

216
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,500
Sure.

217
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,410
(Zhou Tiejiao is taking no risks.)

218
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,860
(He's a cruel one.)

219
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,260
(Zhang Jiu must die
or he'd be a loose end.)

220
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,690
(I didn't expect he'd come)

221
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,810
(as soon as I left the room.)

222
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,740
(He didn't even wait for a moment.)

223
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,810
(This is a cruel plan,)

224
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,380
(but it shows Zhou Tiejiao)

225
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,770
(is truly helping me
get into the manor.)

226
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,890
Xiaomei.

227
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,620
How is Sister Ma?

228
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,620
After your acupuncture treatment,

229
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,500
she's been sleeping.

230
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,100
She mumbles in her sleep.

231
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,810
Sister Cheng, how are you feeling?

232
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,140
Much better now.

233
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,570
Where is Brother Hu?

234
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,530
He went out in the afternoon.

235
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,020
He hasn't come back yet.

236
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,220
Why didn't you tell me?

237
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,570
This can't be good.

238
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,530
He must have gone to the King's Residence.

239
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,410
Why would he go there

240
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,500
all of a sudden?

241
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,460
He wants to get the boys out.

242
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,460
That's not possible.

243
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,220
He already went through great
danger to rescue Sister Chunhua.

244
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,810
If he goes there tonight,

245
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,650
he'll face even greater danger.

246
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,260
Xiaomei, come with me.

247
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,980
Uncle Tang.

248
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,770
It's already nine o'clock.

249
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,460
Do you think

250
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,140
Hu Fei will show up tonight?

251
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,740
If he doesn't,

252
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,810
keep your eyes on the Tianshan Sect.

253
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,810
Your father is right.

254
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,500
Yuan Ziyi must have
some ties with Hu Fei.

255
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,810
Ruling...

256
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:56,930
The Four Seas.

257
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,290
Open the gate.

258
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,020
Ruling...

259
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,050
The furthest frontier.

260
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:16,980
Ren Tongwu.

261
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,380
I've never met this man.

262
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,220
Who is he?

263
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,050
This is Brother Zhang
of the Right Barrack.

264
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,620
Zhang Jiu of the Right Barrack.
Greetings, Company Commander.

265
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,100
Move on.

266
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,170
Welcome in.

267
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,220
Ruling...

268
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,380
Throughout history!

269
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,460
(If I hadn't followed Ren Tongwu,)

270
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,620
(I could've passed the first gate,)

271
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,930
(but not the second gate.)

272
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,740
(I could get the password,)

273
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,810
(but I didn't think each gate had)

274
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,690
(a different countersign.)

275
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,740
(But I'm in the rear garden now.)

276
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,500
(I know the way around.)

277
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,620
(This should make)

278
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,770
(the rescue much easier.)

279
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,220
Who are you?

280
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,620
Ren Tongwu, Left Barrack.

281
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,170
Zhang Jiu, Right Barrack.

282
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,930
Who did you say you are?

283
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,220
Zhang Jiu, Right Barrack.

284
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,410
Nonsense!

285
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,890
You...

286
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,050
Sorry, pal.

287
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,290
Sister Cheng.

288
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,740
Are we going in to help Brother Hu?

289
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,740
Just the two of us?

290
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,340
I need to think this through.

291
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,810
If there was a poison

292
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,500
to knock out everyone in there,

293
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,050
we could rush in to get the boys

294
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,690
and leave unscathed.

295
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,650
None could harm us.

296
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,570
Sister Cheng,

297
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,050
does that poison exist?

298
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,570
Let's follow them.

299
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,090
Check this out.

300
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,740
Do you want some?

301
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,810
- Yes.
- Yes.

302
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,900
If you want the snack,

303
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,290
you must call me mother.

304
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,940
Say it.

305
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,610
Come on.

306
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,180
Here you go.

307
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,370
Say it and you get the snack.

308
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,020
No.

309
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,020
You're a bad woman!

310
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,530
Cursed ingrates!

311
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,530
I want my mother!

312
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,090
My young princes.

313
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,770
Get off of me!

314
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,700
Cut it out.

315
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,940
Insolent children,

316
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,460
they have no manners at all!

317
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,420
Cut it out.

318
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:20,980
Cut it out.

319
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,330
I want my mother!

320
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,770
I want to see my mother!

321
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,220
Get off of me!

322
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,290
Insolent kids!

323
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,610
Little princes, cut it out.

324
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,460
Where is our mother?

325
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,460
Guards.

326
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,180
Come here.

327
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,370
I want my mother.

328
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:36,940
You there,

329
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,850
come here.

330
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,260
Stop it, little princes.

331
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,940
I want my mother!

332
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,290
Quiet down!

333
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,330
You know martial arts.

334
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,420
Block their voices now.

335
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,700
Make them quiet.

336
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,500
Stop it, please.

337
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,980
What are you waiting for?

338
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,700
Do it now!

339
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,980
Do it.

340
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,850
Little princes,

341
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,290
quiet down.

342
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,900
Greetings, Madam.

343
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,420
What do you want?

344
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,180
The Old Madam wants to see the boys.

345
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,090
I'm here to escort them.

346
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,130
Get them out of my sight.

347
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,740
They are driving me insane.

348
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,530
Yes.

349
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,180
I want my mother!

350
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,330
Stop it, little princes.

351
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,420
My little princes, come with me.

352
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,020
They can stay with Mother tonight.

353
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,370
Do not bring them back here.

354
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,700
The way is dark at night.

355
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,900
I'll escort them.

356
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,740
Be quick.

357
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:47,940
Stop right there.

358
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,050
Hu Fei.

359
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,530
Uncle Hu.

360
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,530
Let's go now.

361
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,290
You have sharp eyes, Ziyi.

362
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,090
I knew you wouldn't fall for it.

363
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,460
Thank you for not exposing me.

364
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,810
I must take the boys

365
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,980
to their mother now.

366
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,420
This place is heavily guarded.

367
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,220
You can't

368
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,850
rescue them on your own.

369
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,660
I know the risks.

370
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,500
But, I promised Sister Ma

371
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,090
I'd go through anything

372
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,370
to get the boys to her.

373
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,260
- Uncle Hu.
- Uncle Hu.

374
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,940
- Take us to our mother.
- Take us to our mother.

375
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,290
Yes, we'll go to her now.

376
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,220
Hu Fei.

377
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,940
Stop.

378
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,940
Where are you taking
the boys at this hour?

379
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,900
Greetings, Your Highness.

380
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,610
Greetings, Your Highness.

381
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,290
Your Highness,

382
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,130
the Old Madam wants to see the boys.

383
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,330
Nonsense.

384
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,940
I just came from her room.

385
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,980
She never said that.

386
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,290
Who are you?

387
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,260
Arrest him now!

388
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,700
How dare you!

389
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,770
Do not harm the princess.

390
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,530
No sudden movements!

391
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,370
You wouldn't want the princess dead.

392
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,180
Pingping, An'an,

393
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,900
come with me.

394
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,220
Your Highness!

395
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,610
Leave them.

396
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,290
Tend to the princess now.

397
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,850
Eldest Brother, Second Brother,

398
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,180
bad news.

399
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,700
Hu Fei was compromised.

400
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,130
The place is crawling with guards.

401
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,610
If Hu Fei gets caught,

402
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,180
what should we do?

403
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,050
What can happen always happens.

404
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,810
The manor is in chaos,

405
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,660
so let it be.

406
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,900
If Hu Fei gets caught,

407
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,460
we'll be doomed.

408
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,290
How do we make it worse?

409
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,290
Create some distractions.

410
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,610
The bigger, the better. Go.

411
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,260
Yes.

412
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,050
Come.

413
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,570
Brother, the princess was attacked.

414
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,460
She's back in her room.

415
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,980
The two boys have been kidnapped.

416
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,050
Sir, look!

417
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,660
That's the Old Madam's room!

418
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,570
This must be
the Red Flower Club's doing!

419
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,180
Brothers,

420
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,940
put out the fire,
and protect the Old Madam!

421
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,090
Go now!

422
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,180
Official Zhou!

423
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:10,770
Official Zhou!

424
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,460
Official Zhou!

425
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,370
Zhang Jiu...

426
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,290
The assassin posed as Zhang Jiu.

427
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,980
Get him now.

428
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,330
Yes, understood.

429
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,370
Brother.

430
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:24,610
Let's go.

431
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,220
Let's go.

432
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,050
After him!

433
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,090
Hide, quick.

434
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,500
Quick!

435
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,460
Hu Fei?

436
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,940
After him, go!

437
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,050
Lingsu?

438
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,050
Get on the carriage.

439
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,420
Yes. Get on.

440
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,940
Sit tight.

441
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,740
Go.

442
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,500
Quick!

443
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,090
Lingsu,

444
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,420
you came at the nick of time.

445
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,850
Lingsu.

446
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,500
It was wrong of me to disobey you.

447
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
But I have good reasons.

448
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,180
Please forgive me.

449
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,850
Lingsu?

450
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,700
Xiaomei?

451
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,420
Get on that carriage.

452
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,980
Split up and pursue!

453
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,610
Yes.

454
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,460
After them!

455
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,130
Ziyi...

456
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,420
Take down the other troop.

457
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,220
Yes.

458
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,530
Over there!

459
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,180
Quick!

460
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,770
Old Madam!

461
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,330
Get in there.

462
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,130
Quick, hurry up!

463
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,500
Get some water over here!

464
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,050
Quick!

465
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:12,900
Here comes the water!

466
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,660
Go!

467
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,530
Over there!

468
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,050
Quick.

469
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,530
Over there, go!

470
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,530
Go.

471
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,050
Old Madam!

472
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,530
Slow down.

473
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,260
Old Madam.

474
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,260
Make way!

475
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,850
Slow down.

476
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,050
Move aside! Protect the Old Madam!

477
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:48,020
(Huaquan Sect)

478
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,700
Mother, wake up.

479
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,460
Mother...

480
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,090
- Mother...
- Mother...

481
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,290
Wake up.

482
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,020
Mother, wake up.

483
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,610
Mother, please wake up now.

484
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,180
Mother...

485
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,260
- Mother...
- Mother...

486
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,020
Brother Hu.

487
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,020
Xiaomei.

488
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,290
It's been a long night.

489
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
I can take it from here.

490
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,420
Get some rest.

491
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,370
It's even tougher for Sister Cheng.

492
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,940
I apologized to her,

493
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,810
but she wouldn't forgive me.

494
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,770
She hasn't talked to me
after we came back.

495
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,180
She really treats you well.

496
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,900
If it were the others,

497
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,180
she wouldn't just shut them away,

498
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,610
she would poison them.

499
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,500
Well, I'm not like the others.

500
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,130
She wouldn't poison me.

501
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,850
I wouldn't be so sure.

502
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,850
If you don't make it up to her,

503
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,460
she's going back
to Medicine King Valley.

504
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,050
Wait, what?

505
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,570
Now you're worried.

506
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,500
Go and apologize to her.

507
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,700
Xiaomei.

508
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,770
Could you teach me the recipe

509
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,570
of a tonic soup that isn't too greasy?

510
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,330
The Old Madam had a frightful night.

511
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,370
She breathed in a lot of smoke.

512
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,050
Therefore, the coughing.

513
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,570
I'll prescribe her
some yellow pear soup.

514
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,420
That should help with the coughing.

515
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:14,980
Thank you, Reverend.

516
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,330
I must thank your disciple

517
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,090
for saving me from the culprit.

518
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,810
Kang'an.

519
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,570
Be sure to thank them.

520
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,500
That is not necessary.

521
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,850
Your Highness is a blessed person.

522
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,570
The Old Madam has
the protection of her faith.

523
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,900
I shall take no credit for this.

524
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,460
You are too humble, Reverend.

525
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,220
I always punish and reward accordingly.

526
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,570
I will reward if a reward is due.

527
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,180
Amitabha.

528
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,180
Lingsu.

529
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,090
I'm here to apologize.

530
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,460
I don't want to see you.

531
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,220
Go away.

532
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,020
You're still mad at me?

533
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,610
Calm down.

534
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,460
I brought you some food.

535
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,370
I'm not hungry.

536
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,570
How about this?

537
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,850
If you won't see me,

538
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,020
I'll leave the food outside.

539
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,050
Come out and get the food after I leave,

540
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,900
is that alright?

541
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,940
I'm going now.

542
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,420
Don't let the food go cold.

543
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,420
Lingsu, I've been poisoned...

544
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,290
You opened the door, so leave it open.

545
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,020
Lingsu, I know you're unwell.

546
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,290
I made this soup for you,

547
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,050
for your nourishment.

548
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,180
Lingsu.

549
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,940
You arrived in the nick of time.

550
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,460
If you hadn't

551
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,570
hired the sanitation carriage,

552
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,940
any other vehicles would have

553
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,570
drawn suspicion.

554
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,610
So what?

555
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,700
You threw your life away.

556
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,460
You deserve to get killed by the guards.

557
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,500
I do deserve it.

558
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,660
But if I make you sad,

559
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,940
I'll feel bad about it.

560
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,500
You disobeyed me

561
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,460
and threw your life away.

562
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,850
Why would I be sad?

563
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,260
Lingsu.

564
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,220
I know you care about me.

565
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,980
Your help last night

566
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,090
is greatly appreciated.

567
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,020
I get it.

568
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,570
You are the only girl
in the entire world

569
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,570
who would come to my help

570
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,530
despite knowing how reckless I could be.

571
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,090
You gave me all kinds of fancy words

572
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,850
when you needed
my help saving Sister Ma.

573
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,610
When you don't need me,

574
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,740
you forget about everything I say.

575
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,020
Lingsu.

576
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,500
My goodness!

577
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,700
If I lied to you,

578
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,770
I'd die a horrible death.

579
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,330
If it's true, it's true.

580
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,810
I didn't ask you to swear.

581
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,220
I disobeyed you.

582
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,290
I made you worried.

583
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,220
When we first met,

584
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,220
did you listen to me?

585
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,260
I told you not to leave my side

586
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,020
and not to fight,

587
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,420
but did you follow my order?

588
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,570
Lingsu, enjoy the soup.

589
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,770
Fei.

590
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,850
Get your face cleaned.

591
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,850
What's wrong with my face?

592
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,850
I found out

593
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,810
that Ren Tongwu was
a spy from the Red Flower Club.

594
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,220
I've eliminated him.

595
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,700
During the pursuit,

596
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,050
I ran into a one-arm Taoist priest.

597
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,940
We fought.

598
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,220
I ran into a fat guy

599
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,260
who used hidden weapons.

600
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,740
Based on your descriptions,

601
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,610
could it be Taoist Wu Chen

602
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,220
and the third in command
of the Red Flower Club, Zhao Banshan?

603
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,290
Very astute, sir.

604
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,500
It's probably them.

605
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,500
If it were them,

606
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,420
the bunch of you would be dead by now.

607
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,130
Sorry, sir.

608
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,050
We've learned from our mistake.

609
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,220
However,

610
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,020
we did spot several figures
that attacked the manor.

611
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,020
We tried to pursue them,

612
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,940
but then again,

613
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,090
we were ordered to maintain
peace inside the manor.

614
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,660
We were worried
it could have been a decoy.

615
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,530
Therefore, we stood by our post.

616
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,770
Summon Tang Pei.

617
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,810
Yes.

618
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,500
Come in.

619
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,460
Why did Official Fu summon you?

620
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,260
What else could it be?

621
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,530
It was the attack last night.

622
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,420
Official Fu

623
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,020
is too biased.

624
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,770
I stood by my post last night,

625
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,460
then I pursued the assassin.

626
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,810
You know what he said?

627
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,570
The guards inside did a great job
defending the place.

628
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,810
The guards outside failed
to capture the assassin.

629
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,850
Zhou Tiejiao and his gang
were all rewarded.

630
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,090
But me? He scolded me!

631
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,370
This is outrageous.

632
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,130
Well, you were a loyal officer
of the former commander.

633
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,850
Chief Tang, fear not.

634
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,940
There is a chance to earn his favor.

635
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,130
I know.

636
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,130
I must rescue the boys.

637
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,330
Do you think it's that easy?

638
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,220
We don't even know where they are.

639
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,130
Father.

640
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,050
Uncle Tang.

641
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,570
I searched all night
and made a great discovery.

642
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,220
What did you find?

643
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,290
I found out

644
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,130
who broke into the manor last night.

645
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,290
Fortune is on our side this time.

646
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
This is your chance
to make a name for yourself.

647
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,700
Yiming saw it with his own eyes,

648
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,660
but still,

649
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,370
we need evidence.

650
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,370
The girl is nowhere to be found,
and they can't take our word for it.

651
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,530
So where are the kids?

652
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,090
We have to find them.

653
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,130
We'll search every inch of this city

654
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,940
and find the culprit.

655
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,420
Inform Official Fu at once.

656
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,170
Hailan Bi from the Firearm Brigade
requests an audience.

657
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:49,820
Yes.

658
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,500
His Majesty has learned of the attack.

659
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,860
The Old Madam
and the princess were harmed.

660
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,170
His Majesty is worried.

661
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,900
The Firearm Brigade has been ordered
to guard this place.

662
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,570
I was just thinking about
reinforcing the security.

663
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,460
With you here,

664
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,780
I shall have nothing to fear.

665
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,420
A decree from His Majesty.

666
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,050
I have been ordered

667
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,130
to escort Princess Hejia
back to her manor.

668
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,210
I'll go and get her right away.

669
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,340
Thank you for the escort, Official Zhou.

670
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,780
Nun.

671
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,610
A token of appreciation
from Official Fu.

672
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,420
Please accept it.

673
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,820
A monastic does not need worldly
possession such as money.

674
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,730
I appreciate the gesture.

675
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,860
If you refuse to accept it,

676
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,340
it'll be hard for us
to explain to Official Fu.

677
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,940
Kang'an, I finally get it now.

678
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,780
The guards on the outside
perimeter are useless.

679
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,340
Firearms are the most trustworthy.

680
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,130
Indeed, Your Highness.

681
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:26,460
The Red Flower Club might be
great at martial arts,

682
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,170
but they are no match for the guns.

683
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,130
By the way,

684
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,980
His Majesty sent in

685
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,250
the Firearm Brigade,

686
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,130
so the Nun and her disciples
may return to the side rooms.

687
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,900
It's been a long night for them.

688
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,050
I will see to it.

689
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,460
Depart.

690
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,420
Have you learned from your mistake?

691
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,170
Kneel.

692
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,780
You may have saved Her Highness

693
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,690
and gotten rewarded,
but you can't fool me.

694
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,780
I have.

695
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,820
How dare you be so brazen

696
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
right under their noses.

697
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,250
You even ask Feihong to help that brat.

698
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,570
Your action

699
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,980
will ruin our plan.

700
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,380
I give you my word,

701
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,340
I won't see him again.

702
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,900
No, you must see him.

703
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,690
You lost the kids.

704
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,530
You must go to Hu Fei

705
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,690
and bring them back.
