00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:58,400
I...

163
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:01,880
Fourth Uncle.

164
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,120
Sorry. It's my fault.

165
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,319
Please don't get mad at me.

166
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,479
One day, you'll understand where
Fourth Uncle is coming from.

167
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,719
Fourth Uncle...

168
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,839
Young Lady.

169
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,040
Sorry.

170
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,599
Let me clean it for you.

171
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,360
What are you doing, pervert?

172
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,439
Stop now or I'll chop off your hands.

173
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,319
How could you hit me?

174
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:28,040
You swore at me too.

175
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Me? A pervert?

176
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,599
Guys. Come and take a look.

177
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,400
Look at this young lady.

178
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,160
Not only did she hit me,
but she also swore at me.

179
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,439
I didn't mean to do that.

180
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:36,719
You're the only one who knows
whether you meant it or not.

181
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,280
I never argue with women,

182
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,240
and I was just being kind to you.

183
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,000
However I look at it,

184
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,280
he didn't seem
to have done it deliberately.

185
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,240
Precisely.

186
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:47,479
Are you trying to bully him?

187
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,240
Let's go.

188
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:58,679
Ping Fei.

189
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,719
What are you doing?

190
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,400
I only left you alone for a while,

191
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,959
and you got yourself into trouble again.

192
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,479
When you're away from home,

193
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,880
you shouldn't act contemptuously.

194
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,240
You were lucky
you ran into a kind man like me.

195
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,599
Do you have anything you want
to say to me?

196
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,400
It was just a misunderstanding.

197
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,679
It was just a misunderstanding.

198
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,959
When you're kind to others,

199
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,640
others will be kind to you too.

200
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,439
She's too young to know anything,
so please forgive her.

201
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,479
Go away.

202
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:53,880
-Protect escort carriage. Quick.
-Protect escort carriage.

203
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,240
Protect escort carriage. Quick.

204
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,640
My name is Yan Ji.

205
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,479
Hero, you must be Ma Xingkong,

206
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,920
the Invincible Fist.

207
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,599
I'm flattered,

208
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,799
but I don't deserve the compliment.

209
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,319
It's been a few days since we last ate.

210
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,679
Can Hero Ma give us some food?

211
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:57,920
Master, thanks for the compliments.

212
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,240
Xu Zheng, give him 5000 taels.

213
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,319
Yes.

214
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,559
5000 taels?

215
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:06,559
Did you take me for a beggar?

216
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,000
There are so many escort carriages here.

217
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,760
They're worth 300,000 taels at least.

218
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,959
I'll take a half,

219
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,760
and leave you the flag
of your escort agency.

220
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,719
That won't make either of us look bad.

221
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,160
I can't stop you

222
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,199
if you want to put your life at stake.

223
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:28,240
A half?

224
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,839
This looks more like an act of revenge

225
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,640
than a robbery.

226
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,319
Are there really so many people

227
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,199
holding grudges against me?

228
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,400
I wonder where your mountain fortress
is located at.

229
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,160
It's none of your business.

230
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:45,880
Are you trying to write a book
out of it?

231
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,599
Brothers.

232
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,839
Bring the horses.

233
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,839
-Yes.
-Bring the horses.

234
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,679
Yes.

235
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,920
Master, they're a gang.

236
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
You keep an eye on them.
I'll take care of this.

237
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:57,959
If that's the case,

238
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:00,599
you shouldn't trouble your apprentices.

239
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,280
You'll do what you're good at
and escort the carriages,

240
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,439
while I'll do what I'm good at
and rob you.

241
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,799
We'll each carry out our own jobs.

242
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,520
Here.

243
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,199
It's just the two of us now.

244
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,719
Both of you. Go to the side.

245
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,439
Be careful, Master.

246
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,280
Please enlighten me.

247
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,120
Watch and learn.

248
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,920
You can only learn from a real fight

249
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,799
where the participants
put their lives at stake.

250
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,799
Yan Ji's punches seem odd.

251
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,880
I can't tell which sect he's from.

252
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,839
However, it seems like
he's only practicing three techniques.

253
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,160
Three techniques aren't a lot,

254
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,400
but it's more than enough
if they work well.

255
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,520
Look at the three techniques he uses,

256
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,319
and look at how many fist techniques
Ma Xingkong was forced to use.

257
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,519
Chaquan, Ditangquan,

258
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,360
Tiger and Crane Fists,
and 18 Tan Family's Kick.

259
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:09,959
Dad.

260
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,719
Master.

261
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,279
Master.

262
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:16,880
Dad.

263
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,039
What's the matter?

264
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,080
You need to pay
your ancestor's karmic debt.

265
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,199
You have to put your life at stake

266
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,519
if you wish to eat.

267
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,840
Brothers.

268
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,080
Pull out the flag of the escort agency.

269
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,239
Yes.

270
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,120
Master.

271
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,800
Protect escort carriage no matter what.

272
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,400
Yes.

273
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,039
What are you doing?

274
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,999
Stop being nosy.

275
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:43,719
Fourth Uncle, I'm not being nosy.

276
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,320
Didn't you see it?

277
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:51,999
They came prepared.

278
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,640
Even Escort Ma was no match for them.

279
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,239
You will only get yourself killed
if you go.

280
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,080
Never let them pull out the flag.

281
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:07,080
Yes, dad.

282
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,600
Ping Fei.

283
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:53,360
Chunhua.

284
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:54,199
Are you all right?

285
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:54,959
Wake up.

286
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,959
Who is this brat?

287
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,160
One should always stand up

288
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
for injustice.

289
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,279
Great.

290
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,320
Let me help put you to death.

291
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:28,479
Ping Fei!

292
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,880
Take him down.

293
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,759
Mom.

294
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,039
Who's that?

295
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:38,239
He

296
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:40,840
is Miao Renfeng.

297
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,160
Kill him.

298
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,920
Young man.

299
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,560
Are you all right?

300
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:12,679
Are you all right?

301
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,360
I'm fine.

302
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,439
Let's go.

303
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,679
Are you a bandit now?

304
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,719
Hero Miao, I...

305
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,719
I swear I didn't know it was you.

306
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:30,959
Where is the kid?

307
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,519
Kid?

308
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,759
What kid?

309
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,120
Hero Hu's kid.

310
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,999
I swear to God.

311
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,120
I have no idea where did the kid go.

312
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,400
I was only there

313
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,600
to check on him.

314
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,800
I prescribed him

315
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
some medications too.

316
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,600
That was the only thing

317
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,719
I did.

318
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,400
From where did you learn Hu's Fist?

319
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:02,840
I...

320
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,400
I saved that kid.

321
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,479
Master Hu was grateful for what I did,

322
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,519
and taught me three techniques,

323
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:11,479
so that I can use them for self-defense.

324
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,880
You saw it yourself.

325
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,160
I only know the three techniques.

326
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,239
I swear to God

327
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:20,959
I was telling the truth.

328
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,120
You should never use
the Hu's Fist again,

329
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,439
because it's not your place to use it.

330
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,679
I'll kill you if you ever use it again.

331
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,199
Leave.

332
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:48,479
Hero Miao.

333
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,560
Please stay.

334
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:57,479
If it weren't for Hero Miao,

335
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,840
Feima Escort Agency would've suffered
a great loss.

336
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
And no one will dare

337
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,999
spend a night at my place again.

338
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,120
You saved two families.

339
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,120
Please come with me to the living room.

340
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,479
Let me serve you some hot tea
as a token of gratitude.

341
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:14,719
It's fine.

342
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,640
I've got to go.

343
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,039
Hero Miao.

344
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,519
You're an unparalleled martial artist,

345
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,719
but you need to think about
your horse too.

346
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,400
What if your horse gets injured
and loses life during the journey?

347
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,239
It'll definitely hinder your progress.

348
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,479
If you don't mind,

349
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,080
you can take
one of Shang's Fort's horses.

350
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,439
Don't worry, Hero Miao.

351
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,679
I'm not giving you my horse for free.

352
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,199
I'm lending it to you.

353
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:43,999
Thank you.

354
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,160
Hero Miao.

355
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:51,920
This is the fastest horse
in Shang's Fort.

356
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,360
Miao Renfeng.

357
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,880
Close the door.

358
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,999
What's the matter?

359
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,640
Have a seat.

360
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:35,439
Do you know who was the guy
who saved you just now?

361
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,400
Who?

362
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:38,080
He's Miao Renfeng.

363
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,560
He's Hero Miao?

364
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,120
I didn't know Hero Miao was
such a great martial artist.

365
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,560
When I grow up,

366
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,479
I want to be a great hero like him too.

367
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,439
Little rascal.

368
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,199
He's not a hero.

369
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:50,880
Fourth Uncle,

370
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,479
but he saved the escort agency
and Chunhua.

371
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,360
He even injured Yan Ji.

372
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,199
How could he be a bad guy?

373
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,999
They're equally wicked.

374
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,519
None of them are good.

375
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,400
It was Miao Renfeng who killed your dad.

376
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,080
What?

377
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,160
Is it really him?

378
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,039
Yes, it is.

379
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,279
Back then,

380
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,640
Miao Renfeng colluded

381
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,679
with Yan Ji and his guys.

382
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,400
They poisoned the weapons

383
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,439
and killed your parents.

384
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,279
This is bad.

385
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,959
Something big has happened.

386
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,560
Miao Renfeng killed
Hero Hu and Madam Hu.

387
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,199
He's going to eliminate us all.

388
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:29,320
We...

389
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,719
We need to go now.

390
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,999
That's impossible.

391
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:33,719
Why not?

392
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,120
He poisoned the saber,

393
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,719
and killed Hero Hu
while he was distracted.

394
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,600
Madam Hu didn't manage
to escape death too.

395
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:41,719
Stop standing there.

396

and surrender it to Miao Renfeng.

404
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,239
Only then could I get spared.

405
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:34,519
Let go.

406
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,320
Let go or I'll kill you.

407
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,039
Give me the saber manual.

408
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,719
I won't give it to you
no matter what the cost.

I've been keeping you incognito.

I gave you a new name, Ping Fei,

413
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,239
and wouldn't allow you to show
your martial arts skills before others.

414

I only did that because I hope
that one day

415

you'll be able to retrieve
the Hu family's saber manual

and practice it well,

so that you can recuperate here.

430

Here's medicine.

I'm too ashamed
to call myself an escort again.

Yet, they couldn't find
where I was hiding.

Eventually, they killed
my brother and his wife.

494
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,360
Shang Jianming.

495
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,600
He's a martial artist,

496
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,199
yet he always abuses his power.

497
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:50,160
I must kill him.

498
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,360
I beheaded Shang Jianming

499
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,679
with Miao's Sword Techniques.

500
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,519
Then, you can consider
your revenge taken.

501
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,300
(Shang's Fort)

502
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:54,599
This way, please.

503
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,150
(Shang's Fort)

504
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,639
(Shang's Fort)
Hero Ma, thank you so much.

505
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,599
Shall we proceed with the lesson

506
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,200
only after you have recovered?

507
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,479
I always make sure
I repay the kindness I received.

508
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,519
Thanks for keeping me at the fort
and taking care of me.

509
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,479
Of course, I have to do my best
to show my gratitude.

510
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:11,880
As the saying goes,

511
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,079
there's no day

512
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,360
without a single line.

513
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,159
I can wait,

514
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:19,320
but I don't want it to affect
the future of the younger generation.

515
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,360
My son is rather slow.

516
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:23,639
Please take good care of him, Hero Ma.

517
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,240
What's wrong?

518
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,479
Again.

519
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,880
It seems like
your son will be a good apprentice

520
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,999
for a famous sect.

521
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,880
We're flattered, Hero Ma.

522
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,840
He knows nothing about martial arts.

523
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:07,999
The technique he just used

524
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,280
is probably evolved

525
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,159
from a Bagua Sect's palm technique.

526
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,320
It's quite impossible for him
to achieve this

527
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,760
without proper guidance.

528
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:19,519
He was just copying what others did.

529
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,599
I see.

530
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,479
Mother, are you looking for me?

531
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,920
Did you accidentally show off
our family's technique?

532
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,720
Did you forget

533
00:37:56,999 --> 00:37:57,760
what I told you?

534
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,760
That's impossible.

535
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:00,760
Bear in mind.

536
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,840
He's the King of Invincible Fist.

537
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,039
He is well-versed with
all the fist techniques in the world.

538
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,920
He might not be as good a martial artist
as those from famous sects,

539
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:06,959
but he never misses

540
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,240
anything he sees.

541
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,639
I only showed
a little of the Bagua Palm.

542
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,800
Yet, he noticed it.

543
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,999
He knew what it was.

544
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,400
What do we do now?

545
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,559
It's fine.

546
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,039
There are things

547
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,039
we should come clean about
sooner or later.

548
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:26,800
I suppose

549
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,639
you agree with what I said,

550
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,039
right?

551
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:31,840
Yes, Mother.

552
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,119
We should make friends, not enemies.

553
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:35,599
We should leave whatever happened

554
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,200
between us and the Ma Family
in the past.

555
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,200
We don't have to...

556
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,720
Fine.

557
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,119
How could you say that?

558
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,519
Have you forgotten

559
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,720
how your dad died?

560
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,639
Of course, I haven't.

561
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:44,840
Get on your knees.

562
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,400
I made a mistake.

563
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,200
After all, the Ma Family is our enemy.

564
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,800
I must take revenge against them.

565
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:55,999
Did you?

566
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,079
It's my fault.

567
00:38:57,999 --> 00:38:58,800
I was being a terrible son.

568
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,320
Dad, look.

Oh, no.

572
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:27,599
We fell into their trap.

573
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,400
Pack your things now.

574
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:30,240
We'll leave right away.

575
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,159
What is that?

576
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:33,959
It's a long story.

577
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:34,720
Let's go now.

Mother.

580
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,320
The letter is here.

581
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,439
What about the things

582
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,800
I told you to prepare?

583
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,479
Yes, they are prepared.

584

God will always bless
hardworking people.

585

This day has finally come.

Mother.

587
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
It's just the two of us.

588
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:12,840
Do you think we can work this out?

589
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,519
Don't worry.

590
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,680
I told you to send the letters

591
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,119
because I was asking for help.

592
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,519
I feel much assured

593
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,079
now that I've received this reply.

Kneel down before your father.

Thank God.
