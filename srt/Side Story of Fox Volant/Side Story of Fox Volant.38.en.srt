=Episode 38=

3
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,080
Chief Cheng.

4
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,020
Incredible martial arts.

5
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,050
Let me raise my spirits
by taking a few puffs.

6
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,820
There's a lot of

7
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,410
charcoal in his pipe.

8
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,620
As he keeps blowing,

9
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,730
the Damascus steel pipe
is getting hotter and hotter.

10
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,260
No one can get close to it.

11
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,980
Oh no.

12
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,580
His smoke contains hallucinogenic drugs.

13
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,490
We must not be charmed.

14
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,220
Linghu.

15
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,500
You must be thirsty.

16
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,090
Have a drink.

17
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,940
People always say

18
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,860
there's always someone greater.

19
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,700
Although Huaquan Sect is very capable,

20
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,370
it still can't
defeat the Smoking Commoner's

21
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,610
elusive smoking pipe.

22
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,810
Everyone,

23
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,500
you can bet on Shangguan Tiesheng.

24
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,940
I guarantee with my head.

25
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,580
The match will be decided

26
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,780
within ten rounds.

27
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,420
Great!

28
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,050
Tell us!

29
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:02,930
Hurry!

30
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,890
What happened?

31
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,930
Huaquan Sect wins in this battle!

32
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,260
Huaquan Sect has won!

33
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,770
Huaquan Sect has won!

34
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,980
Beat him!

35
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
- Come down!
- Beat him!

36
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Come down!

37
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
Beat him!

38
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,540
Get down!

39
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,860
Get our money back!

40
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,020
Liar!

41
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,490
Hurry! Stop them!

42
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,930
Stop them!

43
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,860
Hurry!

44
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,650
Don't hit me!

45
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,610
Don't hit my mouth!

46
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,650
Lingsu.

47
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,450
Thankfully, you thought of this idea.

48
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,650
Otherwise, I didn't know

49
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,140
how to defeat the smoker.

50
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,300
Congratulations, Linghu.

51
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,020
You've obtained the Silver Dragon Cup.

52
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,610
The Golden Dragon Cup
will surely be yours as well.

53
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,330
You are only one step away
from the Jade Dragon Cup.

54
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,330
Don't worry.

55
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,700
I will definitely
progress to the finals.

56
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,820
A small sect like Huaquan Sect

57
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,050
actually has an expert like him?

58
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,100
Seems like

59
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,490
the martial arts world
is really full of hidden talents.

60
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,700
I do want to see

61
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,300
if he can

62
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,930
win until
the end of the tournament tomorrow.

63
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,210
Chief.

64
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,740
In today's battle,

65
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,420
Huaquan Sect has been leading

66
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,170
without a single defeat.

67
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,020
Cheng Linghu

68
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,930
has the potential
of winning the tournament.

69
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,380
In tomorrow's battle,

70
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,050
you have to be careful.

71
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,650
Are you afraid?

72
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,700
Chief.

73
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,860
I'm not afraid.

74
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,580
That's right.

75
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,970
We are not afraid.

76
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,500
Cheng Linghu?

77
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,380
Fine. I'll fight at the end

78
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,330
to stop his momentum.

79
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,090
How much did we lose?

80
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,260
We lost everything

81
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,970
we won in the beginning.

82
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,940
With our initial bet,

83
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,090
the total amount

84
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,940
is 5,383,700

85
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,700
taels of silver.

86
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,260
Look what you've done.

87
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,820
You kept saying

88
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,410
everything has been arranged

89
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,500
and I just have to receive money.

90
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,090
What about now?

91
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,740
Where's the money?

92
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,090
Your Honour, I was wronged.

93
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,260
That brat was just a fluke.

94
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,530
I enquired from all my friends

95
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,770
in the martial arts world.

96
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,060
No one

97
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,700
has heard about him.

98
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,620
Use your brain

99
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,060
and investigate him.

100
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,890
Tomorrow,

101
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,330
I want you

102
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,700
to double

103
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,740
the money I earned!

104
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,290
Yes.

105
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,940
I'm grateful to two people

106
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,410
for our fortune.

107
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,850
One, our brother.

108
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,380
Two. Hero Hu Fei.

109
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,890
Master Hu?

110
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
Nonsense.

111
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,500
A slip of the tongue.

112
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,290
It should be Chief Cheng, Cheng Linghu.

113
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,700
Remember.

114
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,090
Make sure you are alive

115
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,020
to spend the money you earned.

116
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,140
Why are you still so careless

117
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,580
after becoming an official for so long?

118
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,060
Wang.

119
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,580
Just do the hard work next time.

120
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,740
You should do anything

121
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,890
that involves talking.

122
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,700
Yes.

123
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,650
In the future,

124
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,580
I'll just work more and talk less.

125
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,180
I'll act like a mute.

126
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,580
Still, you will be a rich mute.

127
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,820
All of you.

128
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,060
You look like you're in a good mood.

129
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,970
Greetings, Official Hai.

130
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,210
No.

131
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,210
I should be the one
to greet the three of you.

132
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,450
Official Hai.

133
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,580
You can't do that.

134
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,020
Are you trying to shorten our lives?

135
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,380
I can't do that?

136
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,650
Isn't it right

137
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,820
for a poor man like me

138
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,850
to greet three wealthy men?

139
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,770
Stop!

140
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,650
It's too late.

141
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,500
Silver.

142
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,060
My silver.

143
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
I was careless

144
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,770
and troubled all of you.

145
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,770
You are all mine.

146
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,020
Your Honour, what are you trying to say?

147
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,450
Stop pretending.

148
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,500
Don't you know

149
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,820
who this silver belongs to?

150
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,090
Wang.

151
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,450
You placed this bet

152
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,260
and accepted the money.

153
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,580
Don't you know

154
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,970
who the gambling den belongs to?

155
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,650
Official Hai.

156
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,290
We really didn't know

157
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,380
you are behind the gambling den.

158
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,500
If we knew,

159
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,090
we wouldn't dare

160
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,090
to win money from you.

161
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,380
It's a misunderstanding.

162
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,700
It's all a misunderstanding.

163
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,770
Why are you two spacing out?

164
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,140
Hurry up

165
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,770
and send Official Hai's silver
back to his residence.

166
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,410
Stop.

167
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,740
No need to return it.

168
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,290
I don't mind paying out money

169
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,180
as the owner of a gambling den.

170
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,620
What you've won

171
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,940
belongs to you.

172
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,180
We can't break the gambling den's rules.

173
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,580
However,

174
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,890
you have to tell me the truth.

175
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,020
You can't take my money

176
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,530
and call me an idiot behind my back.

177
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,970
Tell me.

178
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,500
Who is

179
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,740
Cheng Linghu?

180
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,220
Don't tell me he is someone
from Huaquan Sect.

181
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,980
I've investigated him.

182
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,930
This person doesn't exist

183
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,170
in Huaquan Sect two weeks ago.

184
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,620
Did he fall from the sky

185
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,140
or appear

186
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,500
from the ground?

187
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,650
Brother Hu. Today's battle

188
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,740
has increased the reputation of the
Huaquan Sect in the martial arts world.

189
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,460
I represent the sect's disciples

190
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,890
to propose a toast to you.

191
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,260
Ji, you are too polite.

192
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,650
Without your help,

193
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,050
I can't join the Sect Leaders' Gathering

194
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,410
so successfully.

195
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,220
Helping Huaquan Sect

196
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,290
is what I should do.

197
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,460
Besides,

198
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,620
I also made them lose some money.

199
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,570
It felt great.

200
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,810
Sister Cheng.

201
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,810
Guess how much money I've won today.

202
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:01,890
What?

203
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,890
You placed a bet too?

204
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,930
Of course.

205
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,930
How would I miss out
on something that good?

206
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,170
I bet all my savings

207
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,690
and won more than 300 taels.

208
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,380
You are such a daring child.

209
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,260
Tomorrow, I'm going to turn 300 taels

210
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,380
into 3,000 taels.

211
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,050
Chief.

212
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,570
Manager Sai is asking to see you.

213
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,290
We don't know him.

214
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,690
You don't know him?

215
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,930
Wang.

216
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,930
I'm trying to be very polite here.

217
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,500
You bet on Huaquan Sect in every battle.

218
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,810
You were

219
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,770
quite good at predicting the result.

220
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,860
Official Hai.

221
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,690
You are wise and insightful.

222
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,290
We can hide nothing from you.

223
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,050
Since you found out,

224
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,810
then...

225
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,340
We dare not lie to you anymore.

226
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,770
We know

227
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,530
that person.

228
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,620
Tiejiao.

229
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,690
You should know.

230
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,170
In the past,

231
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,380
before we became officials,

232
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,500
we were bandits.

233
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,770
We met him

234
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,340
back then.

235
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,770
He was

236
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,380
a lone bandit who appeared

237
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,740
on the Sichuan-Tibet Border.

238
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,140
It's normal

239
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,410
for you to not know a lot about him

240
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,290
because he seldom appears
in the Central Plains.

241
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,340
I knew it.

242
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,740
When I saw him,

243
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,410
I knew he is not a good person.

244
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,980
As for how he became
the sect leader of the Huaquan Sect,

245
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,380
I really don't know.

246
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:44,810
Yes.

247
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,410
He is strong.

248
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,180
None of the sect leaders can defeat him.

249
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,460
An expert from undeveloped lands

250
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,260
suddenly became
a sect leader of a small sect.

251
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,980
He must know

252
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,860
about Tang Pei's gamble

253
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,860
and came here to make a fortune.

254
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,500
Why are you here,

255
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,890
Manager Sai?

256
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,260
I'm here to greet Chief Cheng.

257
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,810
Chief Cheng is resting

258
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,170
to prepare for tomorrow's fight.

259
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,500
This lady

260
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,980
is his sister.

261
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,290
She has been requested by Chief Cheng
to meet you.

262
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,460
I've heard a lot about you.

263
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,820
I've heard a lot about you.

264
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,930
Please.

265
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,530
Please.

266
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,770
Please sit.

267
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,380
Manager Sai,
just go straight to the point.

268
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,810
I came here today

269
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,860
to congratulate Chief Cheng's victory.

270
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,650
He was invincible today

271
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,140
and didn't lose a single match.

272
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,930
He received high praise
from Official Hai.

273
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,930
Secondly,

274
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,810
I have something urgent

275
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,650
that requires Chief Cheng's help.

276
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,170
Sure.

277
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,930
My brother is an open person
and doesn't care about fame.

278
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,290
If he can be friends with Official Hai,

279
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,650
why not?

280
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,460
Both of you

281
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,980
are righteous

282
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,930
and chivalrous heroes.

283
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Thank you in advance.

284
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,020
Sit down.

285
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,570
To be frank,

286
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,860
we are the dealer.

287
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,770
If you work with the dealer,

288
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,860
you will definitely
earn more than you do now.

289
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,380
You will also get

290
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,650
the Jade Dragon Cup.

291
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,770
Just think of this

292
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,930
as a deposit.

293
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,340
When it's done,

294
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,460
you will be handsomely rewarded.

295
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,650
What do you want us to do?

296
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,220
Get beaten up tomorrow
once he goes on the arena?

297
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
No way.

298
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,620
Since it's a contest,

299
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,570
it needs to be full of highlights,

300
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,410
ups and downs, and surprises

301
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,260
to be exciting.

302
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,170
Chief Cheng became famous
after his fight today.

303
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,460
The gamblers

304
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,930
will surely bet on him.

305
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,220
We just need to pile up the excitement

306
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,810
for the gamblers

307
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,140
and let them bet on Cheng.

308
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,530
Then,

309
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,500
when the situation turns around,

310
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,650
we will be able to make a fortune.

311
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,770
Good idea.

312
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,570
In that case,

313
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,340
you want us to lose
after winning a few matches?

314
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,570
You are wise.

315
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,980
Just listen to my instructions tomorrow.

316
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,860
It's fine for us to lose.

317
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,570
The problem is losing to whom.

318
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,770
My brother is a reputable character

319
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,380
in the martial arts world.

320
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,020
If he loses to a nobody,

321
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,220
how will he roam the martial arts world
in the future?

322
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,260
No way.

323
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,530
That won't do.

324
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,460
We will give Chief Cheng

325
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,380
an honourable defeat.

326
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,570
How?

327
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,460
All those participants

328
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,170
are not good enough.

329
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,220
Don't be anxious.

330
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,770
Some experts

331
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,050
are not here yet.

332
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,500
Look at this.

333
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,530
These are the participants for tomorrow.

334
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,440
(Tianlong Sect: Tian Guinong
Medicine King Sect: Shi Wanchen)

335
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,340
(Huaquan Sect: Cheng Linghu)

336
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,290
All right.

337
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,810
It's decided.

338
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
Don't go back on your promise.

339
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,050
Sure.

340
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,100
Just wait and see.

341
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,260
Tiejiao.

342
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,260
These are the latest odds.

343
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
(Tianlong Sect: Tian Guinong

346
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,100
is the favourite indeed.

Tiejiao.

348
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,530
Are we still betting on him tomorrow?

349
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,810
Are you stupid?

350

Can't you see?

351
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,690
We want Cheng to be the favourites

352

so we can

353

make a fortune from an upset.

354
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,980
Yes, Tie'ou.

If he loses a match,

356
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,410
the odds will be high.

Why don't we

358
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,050
bet on him to lose tomorrow?

359
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,620
No.

360
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,460
We won't bet on anyone tomorrow.

361

Watch the silver well.

362

Don't spend a single tael.

Why, Tiejiao?

364
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,770
It's such a good opportunity.

365
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,930
We even got the name list.

366
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,290
It's easy money.

367
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,460
Silly!

368
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,620
Are you being fooled by your own lie?

369
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,620
Tomorrow is the last day.

370
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,770
If something happens,

371
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,890
it will be something major.

372
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,930
You are always talking

373

about Red Flower Club.

374
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,410
Do you really think

375
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,530
Tang Pei was a member

376
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,810
of the Red Flower Club?

377
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,290
Is it him?

378
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,740
We can't betray him.

379
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,140
I don't want to betray

380

or protect anyone.

381
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,860
We can't afford
to offend Red Flower Club

382
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,100
or the imperial court of Qing.

383
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,050
We become officials

385
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,260
and not to risk our lives.

Understand?

00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,660
Yes.

388

You are right.

389
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,050
We need to be alive

to spend the money we earned.

391

Quit while we're ahead.

Quit while we're ahead.

393
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,420
So, are we going to sit by tomorrow

394
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,740
and wait to see if anything happens?

395
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,290
No.

396
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,420
We will

397

Are you saying...

400
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,980
We will find a reason

401
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,500
to guard the outskirts.

402
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,770
We won't even enter
the King's Residence.

403
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,460
Yes.

He is right.

405

We need to

406

be as far away
from the capital as possible.

407
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,090
Even if the King's Residence
is in a mess,

408
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,060
we will just pretend
that we know nothing about it.

409

Do you really want me
to participate in this farce?

412

I don't care about that.

The person we want is Shi Wanchen.

So,

415

you need to work with them

416

and they won't get suspicious.

417

Are you saying

that you have a
personal relationship with Feng Tiannan?

517
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:15,980
Yes.

518
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,050
Feng Tiannan

519
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,420
was my father.

520
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
To be exact,

521
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,090
I was his illegitimate daughter.

522
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,020
He abandoned my mother

523
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,940
and she died a pitiful death.

524
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,570
I almost got sold by a human trafficker

525
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,740
to become a prostitute.

526
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,330
Thankfully, I met Master.

527
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,980
She brought me back to Tianshan
and taught me Buddhism

528
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,850
so I wouldn't starve to death.

529
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,260
Amitabha.

530
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,850
My mother hated him.

531
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,740
She left a will before her death

532
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,220
asking me not to reconcile with him.

533
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,500
So,

534
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,370
I've never mentioned this to anyone.

535
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
But I can't bear
to see him die on the streets.

536
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,660
After all,
I have his blood flowing inside me.

537
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,900
So, I gave him a funeral
and sent out the obituary

538
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,260
to end my relationship with him.

539
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,980
Wonderful.

540
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,220
Distancing yourself from bad encounters
brings you closer to Buddhism.

541
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,050
Having such comprehension

542
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,940
means your study
of Buddhism is not in vain.

543
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,420
Since I got to know Buddhism,

every karma

545
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,500
was gone in an instant.

546
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,980
I wanted to give you a tonsure
when we return to Tianshan.

547
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,610
Since this has happened,

548
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,130
let's not wait any longer.
