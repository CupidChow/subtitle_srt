Commander.

8
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,610
So far, Huaquan Sect

9
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,610
has won three rounds in a row.

10
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,020
Official Hai.

11
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,170
Looks like Cheng Linghu

12
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,300
is on the path of victory.

13
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,530
Where is the martial arts expert
who you told me about?

14
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,530
Do you want the sect leader
of Tianshan Sect to fight him herself?

15
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,140
There's no need to go overboard.

16
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,580
He's just a nobody.

17
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,940
You don't need
a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

Yuan Xing.

19

Yes, Master.

(Tianshan Sect: The All-knowing Nun,

I, Yuan Xing,
the disciple of the Tianshan Sect,

22
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,860
will be your opponent for this round.

23

A great master makes a great disciple.

24
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,730
The disciple of the Tianshan Sect

25
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,380
is indeed extraordinary.

26
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,540
Tell me. What are you trying to do?

27
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,730
Look.

28
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,490
We are being ambushed.

29
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,940
Looks like this is
a banquet of treachery.

30
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,410
Everyone, get ready.

31
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,650
Commander.

32
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,770
Do you

33
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,650
want me to explain to them?

34
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,450
There's no need to panic.

35
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,290
Since they've found out,

36
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,090
no need to keep it a secret anymore.

37
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,260
Official Hai.

38
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,740
Ask them to secure the door.

39
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,180
Others can come in,
but don't let anyone out.

40
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,380
Yes, Commander.

41
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,530
You are indeed a great fighter.

42
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,770
I am not your match.

43
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
Official.

44
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,740
It's not that I'm incompetent.

45
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,450
But Huaquan Sect is too powerful.

46
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,210
Look.

47
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,260
Even Tianshan Sect has been defeated.

48
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,650
I don't believe it.

49
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,500
Isn't there anyone here

50
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,530
who can defeat Huaquan Sect?

51
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,650
I'll fight him.

Chief Shi.

54
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,290
It's time to make a name
for ourselves today.

55
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,260
I'm at your service, Chief Tian.

56
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,290
Greetings, Commander.

57
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,260
Chief Tian, you are finally here.

58
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,700
I've been waiting for you.

59
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,850
Commander.

60
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,410
I had something to take care of
at Tianlong Sect.

61
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,620
That's why I was late.

62
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,530
Please forgive me.

63
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,330
It's good as long as you are here.

64
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,260
Without the Tianlong Sect here,

65

the World's Sect Leaders Gathering

66
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,620
is no fun at all.

67
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,450
These people are...

68
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,740
Commander.

69
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,620
This person is my friend.

70
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,970
He's the best poison master
in the world.

71
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,940
He's the chief of
the Medicine King Sect.

72
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,970
The King of Poison, Shi Wanchen.

73
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,820
Tianlong Sect is here
with an ill intention.

74
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,260
The old geezer behind him

75
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,770
is an even greater problem.

76
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,140
I've been waiting for him.

77
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,890
Isn't Master Wu Chen

78
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,530
the sect leader
of the Medicine King Sect?

79
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,890
When has that changed?

80
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,450
But the two people behind him

81
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,140
are indeed Master Wu Chen's disciples.

82
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,140
Do you really believe that he belongs
to the Medicine King Sect?

83
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,450
I've been tricked by him before.

84
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,380
I'll remember him even when
I've turned to dust.

85
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,970
The Medicine King Sect
had kicked him out a long time ago.

86
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,210
Now,

87
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,260
he's just deceiving us
with a false title.

88
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,410
If you bad-mouth someone
behind their back,

89
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,740
your mouth will rot.

90
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,290
What is your name?

91
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,530
Let's get to know each other better.

92
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,450
I am Ke Zirong from Qiqing Sect.

93
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,020
Senior Shi, how are you?

94
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,850
So, you are Chief Ke.

95
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,970
Sorry for the disrespect.

96
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,330
What is it?

97
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,090
Do you have to stay so far away from me?

98
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,380
Please forgive me.

99
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,890
The martial arts world
is a dangerous place.

100
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,890
Since you call yourself
the King of Poison,

101
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,380
I'll have to be careful around you.

102
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,330
Since you know
that I'm the King of Poison,

103
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,620
you shouldn't bad-mouth me
behind my back.

104
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,580
Do you think I can't poison you

105
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,530
just because you are out of my reach?

106
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,650
It'll have to depend on...

107
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,260
You've overestimated yourself.

108
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,970
I'm not called the King of Poison

109
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,940
for nothing.

110
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,580
The King of Poison

111
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,580
is indeed amazing.

112
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,940
Thank you, Commander.

113
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,700
Sect Tian.

114

Let's get it started.

115
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:04,850
Yes, Commander.

116
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,770
Chief Cheng has won many rounds.

117
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,100
(Tianlong Sect: Tian Guinong)
He has yet to be defeated.

118
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,570
(Tianlong Sect: Tian Guinong)
In this round,

119
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,140
(Tianlong Sect: Tian Guinong)
if Chief Tian can't defeat him,

120
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,340
the Jade Dragon Cup
will go to Huaquan Sect.

121
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,100
If Chief Tian can't win this round,

122
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,410
then, the Jade Dragon Cup will go to

123
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,890
you?

124
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,380
What a joke.

125
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,260
I'm here at
this World's Sect Leaders Gathering

126
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,170
to get the Jade Dragon Cup!

127
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,100
It'll have to depend on
how capable you are.

128
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,260
Master.

129
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,650
Someone capable is helping him out.

130
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,690
Is it her?

131
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,220
Great!

132
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,650
If Chief Tian

133
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,650
can't win this round.

134
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,860
Chief Tian has won this round.

135
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,220
Are you okay?

136
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,880
(Huaquan Sect: Cheng Linghu)

137
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,020
Tianlong Sect is indeed
as powerful as they say.

138
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,100
Even Huaquan Sect
that was on a winning streak

139
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,530
couldn't last more than
a few moments with you.

140
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,930
You deserve

141
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,860
the Jade Dragon Cup, Chief Tian.

142
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,020
Thank you, Commander.

143
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,050
I'll accept the Jade Dragon Cup
with thanks.

144
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,620
Guards!

145

Protect the Commander!

146
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,930
Who dares

147
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,460
use poison here?

148
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,570
Official Hai.

149
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,740
Do you have to ask?

150
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,220
The King of Poison is here.

151
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,570
Who else can poison it?

152
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,770
Nonsense!

153
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,530
Chief Tian and I are friends.

154
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,410
Why would I poison him?

155
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,140
This is your doing.

156
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,690
Commander, Official Hai.

157
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,770
That girl can use poison too.

158
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,740
Just now, you said

159
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,260
that you are not called
the King of Poison for nothing.

160
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,140
What is it?

161
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,530
Have you forgotten about it already?

162
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,770
This is our chance.

163
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,340
This time,

164
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,570
don't let her get away again.

165
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,290
Let's go.

166
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,570
Linghu, move aside!

167
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,220
Commander Fu.

168
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,290
Let them fight each other
to exhaustion first.

169
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,050
We don't have to waste our energy.

170
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,770
Be careful! It's poisonous.

171
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,890
You brat.

172
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,810
I've already mastered
the Ultimate Poison.

173
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,770
You better surrender.

174
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,220
Since you dare call yourself
the chief of Medicine King Sect,

175
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,050
I'll expose your true colours.

176
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,220
Shut up.

177
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,570
If you don't surrender,

178
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,530
I'll torture you until
you wish you are dead.

179
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,770
Young Lady Cheng, be careful.

180
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,740
This is how you neutralise
the Brigitte silkworm poison

181
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,220
with the Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis.

182
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,140
Master!

183
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,770
Linghu!

184
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,260
So, it's you.

185
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,340
Lingsu.

186
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:21,980
Linghu.

187
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,530
There's poison on the sword.

188
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,260
It's indeed you.

189
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,650
Back in Miao's Residence,

190
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,650
I lost to you on purpose.

191
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,050
I'm sure there are still some traitors
from the Red Flower Club here.

192
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,980
I rather kill the wrong person
than letting any of them escape.

193
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,570
Arrest everyone here.

194
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,690
Firearm Brigade!

195
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,570
Hurry up.

196
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,140
Be careful.

197
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,380
Chief Tian.

198
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,170
I command you

199
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,140
to punish him on the spot.

200
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,530
Roger that.

201
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,620
Lingsu!

202
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,570
Young lady.

203
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,620
What are you doing?

204
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,340
Are you trying to protect him?

205
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,170
The poison on the sword

206
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,220
is the poison that blinded Hero Miao.

207
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,690
You and Shi Wanchen

208
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,220
are working together
since the very start.

209
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,020
You are the one who killed my parents.

210
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,170
Scapegoats.

211
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,810
They are just Miao Renfeng's scapegoats.

212
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,890
Now,

213
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,170
the son is going to die

214
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,460
from the same poison as his father.

215
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,740
You and your father

216
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,620
share the same fate.

217
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,690
Let me kill you now.

218
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,650
Lingsu!

219
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,570
Move aside.

220
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,930
Linghu!

221
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,410
You are indeed here.

222
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,770
Get away!

223
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:56,860
Hero Miao.

224
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,850
Defend justice,

225
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,570
act with loyalty

226
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,260
and cherish your reputation.

227
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,810
That is the true martial arts world.

228
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,290
Arrest him.

229
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,770
Do it now.

230
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,500
Yes, Master.

231
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,420
Don't move.

232
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,260
Commander.

233
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,570
Ask them to stop.

234
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,050
Never.

235
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,980
Arrest them all!

236
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,180

237
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,460

Sister Ma, you are awake.

00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,740
We are leaving the capital.

272
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,460
We'll meet them at Shili Port.

The World's Sect Leaders Gathering?

Give up.

278
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,570
You won't be able to get out of this.

279
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,740
Here.

280
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,020
Official.

281
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,370
Official.

282
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,180
Grave news.

283
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,810
There is...

284
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,850
There's a fight within the city.

285
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,610
Your prediction is on point.

286
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,370
Okay.

287
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,180
Tell Official Hai

00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,500
that this is the vital checkpoint
of the city defence.

289
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,770
We can't leave this place.

290
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,570
So, we can't go to their aid.

291
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,180
We don't have to go to their aid.

292
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,290
They are coming towards us.

293
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,740
They've kidnapped Commander Fu.

294
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,330
Official Hai has ordered

295
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,940
that no one is allowed to leave.

296
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,530
They've kidnapped Official Fu?

297
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,850
Yes. It's true.

298
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,940
Okay. You may leave now.

299
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,570
Roger that.

300
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,420
Tiejiao.

301
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,330
We are too unlucky.

302
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,260
Even if we don't look for trouble,
the trouble comes to us.

303
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,570
We are already all the way out here.

304
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,570
But we still can't escape it.

305
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,740
What should we do now?

306
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,420
Do we...

307
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:09,980
Remember.

308
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,370
Don't act tough.

309
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,660
The sect leader from each sect
is not easy to defeat.

310
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,420
It'll be troublesome
if we accidentally hurt

311
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,770
Commander Fu.

312
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,130
We don't need to achieve anything.
Just don't make a mistake.

313
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,330
As long as we don't let anyone out,

314
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,020
even if the city turns red,

315
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,370
we'll just ignore it.

316
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,180
Understand?

317
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,260
Yes.

318
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:37,980
Yes.

319
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,050
Guards!

320
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,770
Close the gate and tighten the security.

321
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,980
Make sure that no one gets out!

322
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,700
Yes, Official!

323
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,130
Close the gate now!

324
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Do not close the gate!

325
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,850
Don't move.

326
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,460
Stop it. Don't shoot!

327
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,530
Hua!

328
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,050
Hua!

329
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,090
The Firearm Brigade

330
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,850
is totally useless!

331
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,850
The sound of firearms reverberated
through the whole Beijing.

332
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,260
But still, they got away!

333
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,130
They...

334
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,940
They kidnapped Commander Fu.

335
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,660
The soldiers of the Firearm Brigade

336
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,500
were worried that they would hit

337
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,980
Official Fu with the muskets.

338
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,500
That's why

339
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,050
they didn't dare to shoot.

340
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,130
Where is Fu Kang'an?

341
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,900
He has been kidnapped and brought

342
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,570
into the suburbs.

343
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,130
But

344
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,980
I've sent out a capable troop

345
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,330
to surround them.

346
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,090
If we attack them now,

347
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,420
Official Fu's life will be in danger.

348
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,980
If we don't attack them,

349
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,570
I'm afraid that they'll get away.

350
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,130
If others find out about this,

351
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,700
it'll affect the reputation of us Qing.

352
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,700
Those traitors are vicious and evil.

353
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,020
I'm afraid that Official Fu
is already...

354
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,220
I'm afraid that...

355
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,180
Get lost.

356
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,220
Official Hai. Hurry up. Let's go.

357
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,020
I'll take my leave now.

358
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,460
Come on. Hurry up.

359
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:08,700
Xiaomei.

360
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,610
Sister Xiaomei.

361
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,500
Pingping, An'an.

362
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,180
Come.

363
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,460
Take it slow.

364
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,370
Be careful.

365
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,420
Sister Feihong.

366
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,610
You are amazing.

367
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,610
You managed to save them by yourself.

368
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,900
If it wasn't because
the King's Residence is in chaos

369
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,050
due to Commander Fu's kidnapping,

370
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,090
I wouldn't be able
to get them out so easily.

371
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,660
By the way, where's my master?

372
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:46,980
They are inside.

373
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,900
Let's go.

374
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,420
Sister Ma, take this.

375
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,850
Don't talk unless it's necessary.

376
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,370
Pingping, An'an.

377
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,290
Go and be with your mother.

378
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,260
Go.

379
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,850
Mother.

380
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,530
Lingsu.

381
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,220
Fei, what about your wound?

382
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,130
Don't worry. I'm fine.

383
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,980
How is Sister Ma?

384
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,660
I've already pulled out the arrow.

385
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,740
But unfortunately...

386
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,220
Even you can't do anything about it?

387
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,050
The arrow hit her heart.

388
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,420
If it wasn't
for the life-extending pill,

389
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,700
I'm afraid that she would be...

390
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,130
Fei.

391
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,980
Hero Miao is dead because of me.

392
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,420
Now,

393
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,290
the same is going
to happen to Sister Ma.

394
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,330
Fei.

395
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,260
Stop blaming yourself.

396
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,460
If you say that,

397
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,020
I'll feel bad too.

398
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,460
As a healer,

399
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,330
I can't save her.

400
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,700
Lingsu.

401
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,050
Don't say that.

402
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,020
I know that you've done your best.

403
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,740
Wang.

404
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,050
Stop looking.

405
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,460
It's so dark.

406
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,700
You can't see Official Fu.

407
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,330
We don't know

408
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,050
if he's dead or alive now.

409
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,980
Why are you still worried about him?

410
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,500
You should worry about yourself.

411
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,740
Worried about myself?

412
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,570
Yes.

413
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,330
If it wasn't for you,

414
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,260
they wouldn't be able
to escape the city.

415
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,610
Luckily, they didn't know it was your fault.

416
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,050
Or else,

417
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,130
you would've died.

418
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:41,900
Tiejiao.

419
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,500
What should we do now?

420
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,020
I think Official Hai should be back

421
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,610
from the palace already.

422
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,420
We can only

423
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,020
wait for the emperor's verdict.

424
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,610
But

425
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,980
Official Fu is in their hands.

426
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,460
What will His Majesty's order be?

427
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,020
We'll either kill them all

428
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,570
or let them go.

429
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,850
As long as

430
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,770
Hailan Bi

431
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,050
doesn't abandon us,
it'll be the best for us.

432
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,460
Yes.

433
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,810
Mother, wake up.

434
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,260
Mother, wake up.

435
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,770
Mother, wake up.

436
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,500
Mother, wake up.

437
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,610
Mother, wake up.

438
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,090
Mother.

439
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,900
Mother.

440
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,420
Come.

441
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,740
Sister Ma.

442
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,420
My kids.

443
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,370
Don't worry.

444
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,810
I'll take good care of them for you.

445
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,900
When I die,

446
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,500
bury me

447
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,090
beside Senior Xu.

448
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,850
Okay.

449
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,460
I understand.

450
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,700
Fei.

451
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,770
Tell me, Sister Ma.

452
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,130
I want

453
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,130
to ask you for one last favour.

454
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,370
Tell me.

455
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,570
Kang.

456
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,570
I just gave Sister Ma a pill.

457
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,700
She has 15 minutes left.

458
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,050
Fei.

459
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,500
Come.

460
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,130
Sister Cheng.

461
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,050
Why did you and Brother Hu

462
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,940
let him see her?

463
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,740
We want to fulfil her dying wish.

464
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,660
Sister Ma said

465
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,090
that she wants to be buried together
with her senior.

466
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,460
But she has given her heart

467
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,610
to Fu Kang'an.

468
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,090
She still thinks about
that heartless man at her deathbed?

469
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,810
Why?

470
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,180
You'll know how complicated

471
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,500
feelings are when you grow up.

472
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,810
The one who hurts you the most

473
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,130
is usually the one you love the most.

474
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,050
Hua.

475
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,780
I've failed you

476
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,530
in this life.

477
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,860
In my next life,

478
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,730
I'll wait for you.

479
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:27,440
(Justice and Compassion)

480
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,210
Your Majesty.

481
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,980
You need to take care of your health.

482
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,820
You should

483
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,860
eat something.

484
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,210
Grind the ink.

485
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,420
