=Side Story Of Fox Volant=
(Adapted from Jin Yong's novel)

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,900
=Episode 26=

3
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,610
What did you say?

4
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,210
The poisoning was nullified?

5
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,410
Yes.

6
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,340
Didn't you say

7
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,730
your poison could take lives?

8
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,530
But he only lost his sight!

9
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,820
And that wasn't the worst.

10
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,500
He was cured of his blindness!

11
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,780
That is not possible!

12
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,620
It took me ten years to formulate

13
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,810
the Heart-stab Poison.

14
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,050
There is no antidote to that poison!

15
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,130
I'm telling you the truth!

16
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,660
To make it worse,

17
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,090
a girl cured him!

18
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,410
A girl?

19
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,340
From the Medicine King Valley!

20
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,220
Only the flower

21
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,490
known as the Seven Pistil
Chaenomeles sinensis

22
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,900
is capable of

23
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,450
neutralizing the effects
of my Heart-stab Poison.

24
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,810
She must have cultivated the flower!

25
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,540
Medicine King Valley...

26
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,620
I'm back.

27
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,060
Xiaotie.

28
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,140
To master the Soul Steal Grasp,

29
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,580
you must be steady,

30
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,700
precise,

31
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,860
and never hesitate.

32
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,700
Like this!

33
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,090
Do you get it now?

34
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,020
Now,

35
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,220
try landing a hit on me.

36
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,370
Martial Uncle,

37
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,450
am I doing it right?

38
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,060
Xiaotie,

39
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,530
let go of him

40
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,860
before you hurt him.

41
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,890
Mother.

42
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,810
Martial Sister, I'm tougher than this.

43
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,220
Xiaotie,

44
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,810
after the acceptance ceremony,

45
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,610
he will be your master.

46
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,810
Work hard and learn.

47
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,300
Your martial uncle carries

48
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,780
all knowledge
of the Medicine King Valley.

49
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
Yes, Mother.

50
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,650
I will work hard and train hard.

51
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,730
Eldest Senior,

52
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,330
I leave Xiaotie

53
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,450
in your care.

54
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,420
You're covered in sweat.

55
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,730
It's been a long day for you.

56
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,860
Get some rest.

57
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,170
I'll ask Xiaotie to hunt some games.

58
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,050
Don't forget the ceremony tonight.

59
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,050
I will never forget.

60
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,380
I take my leave now.

61
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,890
That old geezer

62
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,020
really hurt me when he choked me.

63
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,730
I was quick enough to return the favor.

64
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,020
Silly child.

65
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,210
You disobeyed me again.

66
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,210
You need to learn from him.

67
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,730
Master what he's mastered.

68
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,490
Is that clear?

69
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,980
Yes, Mother.

70
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,020
Go on.

71
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,930
There is mud on the vegetables.

72
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,300
What's wrong with that?

73
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,300
Should I build him
a shrine and worship him?

74
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,730
Murong Jingyue

75
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,930
chased away our enemies,

76
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,020
should I worship him

77
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,170
for the rest of my life?

78
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,490
Don't be so paranoid.

79
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,050
I asked him to be Xiaotie's master

80
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,540
so our son can learn him.

81
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,730
Is that wrong?

82
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,300
Master?

83
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,730
Do you want Xiaotie to be his disciple?

84
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,730
It is you who want to be with him!

85
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,330
I'm not blind.

86
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,490
You even handed him a towel!

87
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,890
Are you jealous because of that?

88
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,260
Think with that brain of yours.

89
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,420
Who was the one

90
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,530
who scarred my face
and hunched my back?

91
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,530
I spend every waking moment
wishing him death.

92
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,450
You've used everything you know

93
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,060
to treat me.

94
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,970
Can you cure me?

95
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,890
I can't cure you,

96
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,020
but can Murong Jingyue cure you?

97
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,290
Lingsu beat him

98
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,740
without breaking a sweat.

99
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,620
Yes, she inherited
our master's knowledge.

100
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,530
But, she is still a woman.

101
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,210
She can't lead our sect.

102
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,940
If she falls in love

103
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,090
with a peasant,

104
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,210
our secret knowledge will fall

105
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,380
into the hands of an outsider.

106
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,260
Xiaotie can learn martial art first.

107
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,090
Then, he can go to her.

108
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,740
He will retrieve
the Verse of King of Poison

109
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,090
whether by force or deception.

110
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,060
Xiaotie is the one true heir
of Medicine King Valley.

111
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,620
-Xiaotie?
-Xiaotie?

112
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,180
Xiaotie?

113
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,380
Xiaotie? What's wrong??

114
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,290
Who did this?

115
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,210
Who did this?

116
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,500
Who killed my son?

117
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,060
Martial Sister?

118
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:58,940
Xiaotie!

119
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,020
Xiaotie!

120
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,180
Xiaotie!

121
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,580
Who could have done this to you?

122
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,020
I will avenge your death!

123
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,620
Martial Sister.

124
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,090
Xiaotie is...

125
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,620
No.

126
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,620
It's not me.

127
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,770
I didn't do it.

128
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,330
Why would I kill Xiaotie?

129
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,260
Murong Jingyue!

130
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,330
I'll make you pay for this!

131
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,580
Martial Sister,

132
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,290
you are being ridiculous.

133
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,060
Why would I kill Xiaotie?

134
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,090
He is my son!

135
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:26,970
Martial Sister,

136
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,500
is he telling the truth?

137
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,330
Martial Sister?

138
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:33,970
Martial Sister!

139
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,740
I get it now.

140
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,620
Jiang Tieshan is the murderer.

141
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,210
He knew Xiaotie wasn't his son.

142
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,210
He set me up!

143
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,850
He wanted to get rid of us.

144
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,020
Jiang Tieshan!

145
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,530
How evil of you!

146
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,410
Martial Sister,

147
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,410
your secret has made me suffer!

148
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,060
Yi Chen, oh Yi Chen.

149
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,940
What a disgrace to your name!

150
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,140
Who would have thought?

151
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,580
Yi Chen, oh Yi Chen.

152
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,410
Look at your three precious disciples!

153
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,650
How did Xiaotie die?

154
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,890
And you call yourselves

155
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,820
the disciples of the Medicine King Sect!

156
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,820
How can you not tell

157
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,140
that Xiaotie died

158
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,090
by the Soul Steal Grasp?

159
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,500
All of you

160
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,620
can train for another lifetime

161
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,500
and still be unable to unleash

162
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,850
a Soul Steal Grasp that powerful.

163
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,940
You killed Xiaotie!

164
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,090
Indeed.

165
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,620
Of the entire Medicine King Sect,

166
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,530
only I

167
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,020
am capable of unleashing

168
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,850
the real Soul Steal Grasp.

169
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,690
Who are you?

170
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,170
Me?

171
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,690
I am your martial uncle,

172
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,460
Shi Wanchen.

173
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,380
From what I've heard,

174
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,460
your master is no longer with us.

175
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,260
I am now

176
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,620
giving all three of you a chance

177
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,020
to kneel down and become my disciples.

178
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,570
Do so and I shall spare your lives.

179
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,020
Old geezer,

180
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,380
do you have a death wish?

181
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
I shall avenge my son!

182
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,460
Retreat to the house, we need a plan.

183
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,340
Official Fu.

184
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,690
Where are the children?

185
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,500
Is their mother back yet?

186
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,340
Official Fu,

187
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,170
thanks to Vice-Commander Shang...

188
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,050
Do not say his name!

189
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,410
He ruined even the simplest task.

190
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,860
Even if he survived,

191
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,810
I'd still punish him for it.

192
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,620
Hua?

193
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,140
Come.

194
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,220
Come to your father.

195
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,650
Come on.

196
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,930
Let me see you.

197
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,380
Say "father."

198
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,740
Say it.

199
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,460
Come on.

200
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,050
They are not familiar with you.

201
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,980
It's alright.

202
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,650
Our family is reunited.

203
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,260
We have plenty of time

204
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,980
to know each other better.

205
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,860
Servant?

206
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,410
Sir.

207
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,410
Take them to the yard

208
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,810
and let them play there.

209
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,460
Prepare some sweets and snacks.

210
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,980
Serve them well.

211
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,260
Yes.

212
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,810
Go on.

213
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,020
Go on.

214
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,690
-Mother.
-Mother.

215
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,530
Go on.

216
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,340
Take good care of them.

217
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,860
Hua.

218
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,100
It's been almost six years

219
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,020
since we parted at Shang's Fort.

220
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,380
I didn't know

221
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,220
you had given me

222
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,260
two wonderful children.

223
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,410
I was overjoyed.

224
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,530
Young Master Fu.

225
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,460
I was worried about the children.

226
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,650
That was why I came here to the city.

227
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,380
Now that

228
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,530
they've safely arrived at your manner,

229
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,290
it's time I went home.

230
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,380
Hua,

231
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,930
why do you say that?

232
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,930
Back at Shang's Fort,

233
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,570
I didn't know your identity.

234
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,140
I was naive

235
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,100
to ask for what was beyond my reach.

236
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,410
I am no longer

237
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,570
the girl I was years ago.

238
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,740
I'm even less worthy now.

239
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,410
Back in Shang's Fort,

240
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,140
I knew who you were.

241
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,140
But still,

242
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,890
the moment I first laid my eyes on you,

243
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,810
you've already taken my heart.

244
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,380
After that day,

245
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,740
I sent my men to search for you.

246
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,650
They searched the whole fort,

247
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,530
but to no avail.

248
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,220
Hua.

249
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,410
To be honest with you,

250
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,340
I thought

251
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,770
I would never see you again.

252
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,770
But you're now standing before me.

253
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,020
This feels like a dream to me.

254
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,690
I can barely believe it.

255
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,620
Hua,

256
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,050
after we parted that day,

257
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,620
I've never played the flute again.

258
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,290
Official Fu.

259
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,340
What is it?

260
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,740
The Old Madam is upset again.

261
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,340
Princess Hejia

262
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,690
requests your immediate return.

263
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,740
Scram!

264
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,260
What took you so long?

265
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,340
That was the seventh physician.

266
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,100
It's grown bigger.

267
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,460
What was wrong with her anyway?

268
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,290
She was always well-pampered,

269
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,170
how did she even get it?

270
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,530
The Old Madam is very
particular with her look,

271
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,050
even more so than us.

272
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,890
With that thing growing
bigger on her every day,

273
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,460
she hasn't left the room in days.

274
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,020
As her daughter-in-law,

275
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,860
I feel pity for her.

276
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,020
They are nothing but frauds

277
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,170
and a bunch of liars!

278
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,980
If you bring more of them here,

279
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,810
you shall be punished!

280
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,020
Mother.

281
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,050
No, I will see no one.

282
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,930
Mother, don't worry.

283
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,500
My men have set out to
get you the best physician.

284
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,890
We will get it cured.

285
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,170
Just leave it.

286
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,100
Stop torturing me.

287
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,170
Dismissed.

288
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,570
Dismissed, all of you!

289
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,500
Do you like the look now?

290
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,410
It was worth it to have
Jingyue pestering you for years.

291
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,500
You finally got something in return.

292
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,690
Jiang Tieshan,

293
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,860
just how dense can you be?

294
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,220
If I had the antidote,

295
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,570
I would've given her.

296
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,690
Why would I wait until now?

297
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,220
It was him.

298
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,340
I remember now.

299
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,260
It was Shi Wanchen who cured me.

300
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,380
He struck my face and back.

301
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,460
According to Master,

302
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,410
he once had a junior so vile

303
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,860
who would commit any evil imaginable.

304
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,700
But Master poisoned and killed him

305
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,940
to put an end to his evil.

306
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,260
Could it be

307
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,130
that Shi Wanchen was that junior?

308
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,290
If Master killed him,

309
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,090
who would that be?

310
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,660
That ignorant Yi Chen

311
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,020
could never take my life.

312
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,610
Not only did I survive his poison,

313
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,530
I even mastered
the art of poison unlike anything else.

314
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,220
Be my disciples.

315
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,330
It will be well worth it.

316
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,570
It seems

317
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,900
he did manage to cure himself

318
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,260
of the poison Master had formulated.

319
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,660
He must not be underestimated.

320
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,220
So what?

321
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,180
Master banished him.

322
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,940
And just now, he killed Xiaotie!

323
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,570
Unless we kill him now,

324
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,660
we will be

325
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,420
mocked by the entire world.

326
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,420
Keep it down.

327
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,570
How is the scar

328
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,370
on your face?

329
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,420
That was

330
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,740
but an easy trick to me.

331
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,660
Become my disciples

332
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,370
and the Medicine King Sect

333
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,850
will make a wave
in the martial art world

334
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,740
and eventually conquer it!

335
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,770
He's too powerful for us.

336
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,700
We can't win a head-on fight.

337
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,500
We might as well be his disciples for now

338
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,220
and kill him later.

339
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,130
You are right.

340
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,740
Jiang Tieshan,

341
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,570
could you calm down a little?

342
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,020
We are facing a common foe.

343
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,260
I need you two

344
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,770
to follow my lead.

345
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,220
Wonderful.

346
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,090
Wonderful, my disciples.

347
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,050
Now, kowtow to me!

348
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,370
Master!

349
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,500
Yes!

350
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,330
You dare use deception against me?

351
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,900
You bit off more than you could chew.

352
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,700
Listen up!

353
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,940
You've fallen prey to

354
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,900
my Bone-Crumbling Poison.

355
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,850
If you do not get the antidote
within the next 15 minutes,

356
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,370
your body will crumble
into a puddle of blood!

357
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,460
I'm giving you a chance.

358
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,090
I have

359
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,980
two antidote pills.

360
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,330
Do what you must

361
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,740
with them.

362
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,810
Only the quickest can be my disciple!

363
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,700
You three,

364
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,850
fight harder!

365
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,130
Only one can survive.

366
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,530
Make your choice now.

367
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,610
If I were you,

368
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,420
I'd kill Jiang Tieshan.

369
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,330
As long as

370
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,370
he is alive,

371
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,810
he will resent you for the betrayal.

372
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,220
Martial Sister!

373
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,260
Martial Sister.

374
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,370
Kill him!

375
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,290
Sooner or later,

376
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,500
he will have his revenge on you.

377
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,740
Martial Sister!

378
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,530
Kill him now!

379
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,180
Martial Sister...

380
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,020
Martial Sister...

381
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,090
Senior.

382
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,460
Thank you for taking
care of my son and me.

383
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,700
But as long as you live,

384
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,700
I'll forever live in shame.

385
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,020
Sorry.

386
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:19,980
Martial Sister.

387
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,330
Well done!

388
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,500
My disciple,

389
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,530
take the pill now.

390
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,700
The Bone-Crumbling Poison
has been neutralized,

391
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,660
but you've been touched
by the Miaojiang Venom.

392
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,570
But still,

393
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,020
as long as you obey me,

394
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,570
I won't let you

395
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,180
suffer too much pain.

396
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,770
Try some, lady.

397
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,530
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

398
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,770
Try some, lady.

399
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,610
Are you alright?

400
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,330
Are you hurt?

401
00:25:59,330 --> 00:25:59,770
Hey...

402
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,660
Sorry.

403
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:03,260
Stop right there!

404
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,260
Move aside.

405
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,500
Stop!

406
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,130
Stop!

407
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:07,700
Move aside!

408
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,850
There's nothing valuable in it!

409
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,290
Watch out!

410
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:13,940
Stop right there!

411
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,370
I told you.

412
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,180
There is nothing valuable in it.

413
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,180
Give it back.

414
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,020
How dare you!

415
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:44,850
Martial Sister!

416
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,370
You're always so clumsy.

417
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,220
That won't do.

418
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,810
We haven't met in forever.

419
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,740
Don't lecture me as soon as we meet.

420
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,810
If I didn't lecture you,

421
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,090
how would you explain to Master

422
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,050
if you broke the cast?

423
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,420
Yes, my dear martial sister.

424
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,900
I've learned my mistake.

425
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,220
Please, don't tell Master about this.

426
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,130
I don't want to get locked up and forced

427
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,020
to reflect on my mistakes.

428
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,740
I've finally had the chance to come out.

429
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,530
I haven't had

430
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,530
enough fun yet.

431
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,900
Please.

432
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,370
Come on, please.

433
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,900
Martial Sister?

434
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,500
My dear martial sister?

435
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,940
My pretty martial sister?

436
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,370
Fancy words.

437
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,260
Master.

438
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,660
Did anything go wrong on the way?

439
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,850
No, nothing happened.

440
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,020
When I saw Feihong,

441
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,020
she was rushing toward me
with the package.

442
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,660
Very well.

443
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,460
We may depart now.

444
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,570
Master, where are we going this time?

445
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,420
To the Prince's residence.

446
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,460
Useless fools.

447
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,420
Walk faster!

448
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,610
Master.

449
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,740
Where are we going?

450
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,810
World's Sect Leaders Gathering
will be held in the capital soon.

451
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,020
Cheng Lingsu will be there as well.

452
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,940
We must find her there

453
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,810
and make her hand over
the Verse of King of Poison

454
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,940
and the Seven Pistil
Chaenomeles sinensis.

455
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,900
Scram!

456
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,090
Leave, all of you!

457
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,530
Leave!

458
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:42,460
Leave!

459
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,530
See? She chased away
yet another physician.

460
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,500
A patient must stay calm
during recovery.

461
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,850
With the Old Madam's temper,

462
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,330
none of the medicine would work.

463
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,940
You're right.

464
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Besides, she doesn't like to go outside.

465
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,420
She's not seeing any sunlight or people.

466
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,180
However, I think

467
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,220
it's best that she doesn't
want to see us.

468
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,420
I wouldn't want her

469
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,660
to take it out on us instead.

470
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,370
Honestly,

471
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,530
of all my time as a wife in this manor,

472
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,900
this is the most peaceful time I've had.

473
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:27,940
Couldn't agree more.

474
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,420
We don't have to greet her
every time we see her.

475
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,530
My appetite has become much better.

476
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,610
This way.

477
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,370
Who are they?

478
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,090
Who knows?

479
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,370
It hurts!

480
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,500
Old Madam.

481
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
This horrible thing itches and hurts!

482
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,660
Old Madam, the Nun is here.

483
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,660
Come.

484
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,530
The Nun is here?

485
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,460
Reverend!

486
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:19,940
Reverend!

487
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,260
This thing on me

488
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,940
hurts and itches.

489
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,020
It's been tormenting me

490
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,370
for weeks.

491
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,290
I couldn't even leave the house.

492
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,370
Please, help me.

493
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,610
Let me have a look.

494
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,740
Yes.

495
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,050
It hurts and itches.

496
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,530
I can't take it anymore.

497
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,740
Old Madam, you need not worry.

498
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,850
Let me show you something.

499
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,500
I asked my disciple

500
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,370
to get the snow lotus
from Tianshan.

501
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,130
The snow lotus

502
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,330
can cleanse the body of toxins
and nourish the skin.

503
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,900
It must be plucked
within 14 hours after it blooms

504
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,180
for the best effect.

505
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,660
Really?

506
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,180
This is wonderful!

507
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,220
I am counting on you.

508
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,900
Prepare the medicine.

509
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,980
Yes.

510
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,530
Yu.

511
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,850
Come here.

512
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,940
Your Highness, Madam Hailan.

513
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,290
Who are those people?

514
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,460
They came from Tianshan.

515
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,050
They are here to treat the Old Madam.

516
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,220
It's said that

517
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,130
they brought a snow lotus
from Tianshan.

518
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,740
We can't get that flower here.

519
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,330
Dismissed.

520
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,460
Yes.

521
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,700
People from Tianshan?

522
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,260
Let's not underestimate them.

523
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,050
I hope they manage
to cure the Old Madam.

524
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,740
Otherwise, the whole family

525
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,660
will be worried.

Father.

528
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,370
This is a huge manor.

529
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,260
Official Fu arranged

530
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,370
this manor specially for the Gathering.

531
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,500
(Heroes Garden)
Official Fu's house

532
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,420
(Heroes Garden)
is right next to it.

534

(Heroes Garden)
See?

535
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,370
(Heroes Garden)
This plaque was written

536
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,020
by Official Fu himself.

537
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,370
The city

538
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,420
really is a place of grandeur.

539
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,420
The land of the capital
is where the Emperor resides.

540
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,530
Security was already tight.

541
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,570
The Gathering

542
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,370
was approved by His Majesty personally.

543
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,290
So, you two may stay here

544
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,530
without any worries.

545
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,700
Chief Tang,

546
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,980
your words bring great relief.

547
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,610
But that cursed Hu Fei

548
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,660
is always unpredictable.

549
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,900
As long as our feud

550
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,500
isn't resolved,

551
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,980
I'll never have ease of mind.

552
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,660
Fear not.

553
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,610
I have everything ready.

554
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:11,770
Tomorrow

555
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,020
you shall meet my friends.

556
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,090
Much thanks, Chief Tang.

557
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,130
Chief Tang!

558
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,610
Chief Feng, Chief Tang, welcome.

559
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,850
Please come inside.

560
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,740
-Yes.
-After you.

561
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,020
Oh my,

562
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,940
as soon as you applied the medicine,

563
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,610
the pain and itching stopped!

564
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,770
Such a miracle.

565
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,660
From now on,

566
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,220
change the bandage once every two days.

567
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,420
After seven applications,

568
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,660
you will be rid of this sickness.

569
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,740
Wonderful.

570
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,220
Reverend.

571
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,500
Your medicine works wonders!

Amitabha.

573
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,370
Everything is the result of karma.

574
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,370
You are merciful and charitable.

575
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,570
You've done great deeds.

576
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,610
The medicine worked

577
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,180
because of your good karma.

578
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,290
The credit is not mine to have.

579
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,530
Reverend,

580
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,420
it's worth it for me to follow

581
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,090
the practices of Buddhism.

582
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,020
Reverend.

583
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,260
We may not know each other well,

584
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,220
but I feel we can get along very well.

585
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,290
Would you stay here?

586
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,770
It gladdens my heart

587
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,290
to have you here.

588
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,370
I was willing to come here,

589
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,260
so I must cure you of this sickness.

590
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,980
Old Madam, you have nothing to worry about.

591
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,740
Thank goodness.

592
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,500
Great.

we've never crossed path

597

with Chief Tang in the past.

598
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,180
Why would he invite us

599
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,460
to come here?

600
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,570
What if it's something good?

I feel honored.

Allow me to introduce this chief.

Chief Feng Tiannan
of the Five Tigers Sect.

Take a seat.

This is our first-ever

meeting.

I hope you don't mind.

Chief Feng.

617

You brought us great gifts
at our first meeting.

618
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,300
To what do we owe the honor?

619
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,980
According to Chief Tang,

620
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,780
everyone here is an outstanding warrior.

621
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,820
I have a favor to ask.

Let's hear it.

If we can be of help to you,

we shall gladly assist you.

626

It's not exactly

627
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,250
anything serious.

628
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,570
I was destined to face this threat.
