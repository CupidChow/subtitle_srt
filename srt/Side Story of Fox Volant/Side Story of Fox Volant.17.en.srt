3
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,639
Senior Lv Xixian was seriously ill.

4
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,839
Chen Yu took the opportunity
to go to Senior's house

5
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:47,880
and forced him to hand over

6
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,759
the cultivation formulas of Ying
and Yang Formula and Circles Formula.

7
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,240
Senior knows him well.

8
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,520
He didn't hand it to him.

9
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,799
He killed Senior and his family
straight away.

10
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,319
Only his daughter survived.

11
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,599
Senior!

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,399
Senior.

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,120
Father.

14
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,959
Senior.

-Father.

Martial Uncle Sun.

18
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,880
(Baihu)
What's wrong with you?

19
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,679
Chen Yu!

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,319
You're such a traitor.

21
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,160
You killed the sect leader.

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,599
I'm here to expel you today.

23
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:29,760
Martial Uncle Sun.

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,840
You're no match for me.

25
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,959
Why are you so stubborn?

26
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,319
You scum.

27
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,719
You don't deserve to live!

28
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,680
Senior Sun.

29
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,999
Did Chen Yu

30
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,960
hurt your hand?

31
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,279
No.

32
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,079
I knew I couldn't take revenge.

33
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,079
I thought of a person.

34
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,120
Only this person could help me.

35
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,320
But we were

36
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,560
just acquaintances.

37
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,840
Therefore,

38
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,600
I cut off my palm

39
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,320
and handed it to Lv Xiaomei.

40
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,519
She took it to see him

41
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,560
as a gesture of sincerity
to ask him for help.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,799
Senior Sun.

43
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:49,559
Why would you need to
give him your hand?

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,040
You don't know our relationship.

45
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,679
Now there seems

46
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,480
to be no hope.

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,160
It's hard

48
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,160
to get out of here.

49
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,519
Senior.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,639
Since you're from Taiji Sect,

51
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,559
you must know how to get out of here.

52
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,720
So what?

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,239
Look at me now.

54
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,119
You can teach me if you know the way.

55
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,079
If I learn it,

56
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,720
I can take you out of here.

57
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,559
It's not as easy as you think.

58
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,040
But we have to find a way.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,519
Senior, we have

60
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,440
no choice now.

61
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,239
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

62
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,480
All right then.

63
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,200
Follow me.

64
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,160
Okay.

65
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,119
This mechanism dungeon was designed

66
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:00,720
according to the principle
of Taiji Bagua.

67
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,440
There are 64 kinds in total.

68
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,079
They correspond to

69
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,399
64 kinds of divinatory symbols in Bagua.

70
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,720
Senior Sun.

71
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,440
I don't understand what you said.

72
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,920
Just tell me what to do.

73
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,880
The mechanism of Bagua is changeable.

74
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,160
Every step

75
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,079
will depend on the mechanism changes

76
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,440
to know which step you should take next.

77
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,119
Okay. I'll do as you say.

78
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,079
Harm Door is opened.

79
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,359
Metal destroys wood.

80
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:25,480
Southeast middle.

81
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,200
You're too slow.

82
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,720
Every step has infinite changes.

83
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,600
Only when you grab stone steps
at the right time

84
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,040
can it follow the direction you set.

85
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,040
Southwest up.

86
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,959
Earth realm.

87
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,839
Earth generates metal.

88
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,280
Due west is metal.

89
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,839
Be careful!

90
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:58,520
Northeast up.

91
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,199
There's water at the foot
of Menggua Mountain.

92
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,160
Earth soaks up water.

93
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,160
Southwest up.

94
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,480
Gen is mountain.

95
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,199
There's fire under the mountain.

96
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,239
Things develop step by step.

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,160
This is Gen palace of Bagua.

98
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,799
Earth attribute.

99
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,160
Wood breaks up earth.

100
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,520
Southwest down.

101
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Kun is earth.

102
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,040
Earth attribute.

103
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,840
Earth for mountains.

104
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:42,999
Lose something to gain
something back in return.

105
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:44,920
Good faith.

106
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,400
In the middle west.

107
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,600
Auspicious fortune.

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,679
Senior Sun!

109
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,439
We can go out now!

110
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,600
Thank you

111
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,319
for saving me.

112
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,319
Otherwise,

113
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,759
I'd die with hatred.

114
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,199
I thought

115
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
I'd die in the dungeon like a coward.

116
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,160
There is divine justice.

117
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,439
You saved me.

118
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,040
Senior Sun.

119
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,040
What are you going to do next?

120
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,199
Tell the world about his crimes.

121
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,879
Tomorrow is the ceremony for him
to take over the sect leader.

122
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,119
Many people

123
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:08,031
in the martial arts world
will come to congratulate him.

124
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,920
I'll expose his crimes

125
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:13,439
in front of all of them.

126
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,600
Even if I die,

127
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,480
I have no regrets.

128
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,359
Senior Sun.

129
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,480
Since you've made up your mind,

130
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,439
I'll go with you.

131
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,600
Chen Yu killed his master
and betrayed his ancestors.

132
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,759
And he even worked with Feng Tiannan.

133
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,439
I'll get even with him.

134
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,960
Thank you.

135
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,400
This poison

136
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,679
is much stronger than
what I gave you before.

137
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,520
There's no antidote.

138
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:22,520
But you have to figure out

139
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,799
how to use it.

140
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,359
Whether it works or not,

141
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,640
I don't want to be involved.

142
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,840
Don't worry.

143
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,080
I'll keep

144
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,679
your head that is full of bugs

145
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,600
for you.

146
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,640
I won't let you die.

147
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,119
You have to figure out

148
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,840
how to plant

149
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,920
Seven Pistil Chaenomeles sinensis for me.

150
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,280
(Taiji Sect)

151
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,920
What a grand occasion.

152
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,479
Once he's in power, he gives orders.

153
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,280
Well, Chen Yu

154
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,240
is the head of our eight guards.

155
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,920
Now he has become the sect leader.

156
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,799
He'll have a higher status

157
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,000
in Commander's mind later.

158
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,280
His gain is our loss.

159
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,799
We should be

160
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,920
more careful in the future.

161
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,799
Chief Chen.

162
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,079
Congratulations.

163
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:19,920
Congratulations, Chen.

164
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,559
Congratulations, Chen.

165
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,520
I don't know you're here.

166
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,280
Congratulations.

167
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,240
Sorry for not welcoming you.

168
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,040
Please forgive me for my rudeness.

169
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,400
Chen.

170
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,120
You're too polite.

171
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,799
We're colleagues in public.

172
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:32,520
In private,

173
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,760
your Taiji Sect and my Bagua Sect

174
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,439
share the same origins.

175
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,160
We're all brothers.

176
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:41,719
Yes, Chen.

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Come on, Chen.

178
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,839
The invitation of
World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

179
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,199
Commander asked the two of us

180
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,640
to congratulate you
on your succession as sect leader

181
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,000
and give this invitation

182
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:57,040
to you after the succession ceremony.

183
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,280
Chen.

184
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,679
This is a double blessing.

185
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,559
Please help us two more

186
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,240
in front of Commander.

187
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,120
I can't afford it.

188
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,839
Master, it's the auspicious time.

189
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:16,719
Please help yourself.

190
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:17,880
I'll excuse myself.

191
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,400
Please go ahead.

192
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,160
The auspicious time is here.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
The succession ceremony
of the sect leader of Taiji Nanzong Sect

194
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,319
now begins.

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,760
Today,

196
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:34,079
Taiji Nanzong Sect
will have a new sect leader.

197
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:37,000
Chen Yu, our new sect leader,

198
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:40,599
was appointed by
the late Old Chief Lv Xixian

199
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,439
to take over the sect leader
of Taiji Nanzong Sect.

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,040
Chief Chen,

201
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:51,319
please accept the holy relic
inherited by the sect leader.

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,959
Taiji Sword.

203
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:21,120
Stop there.

204
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:25,160
Chen Yu!

205
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,679
You traitor!

206
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,400
Sun Gangfeng.

207
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,079
How dare you.

208
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:31,799
Get them!

209
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,160
Martial Uncle Sun.

210
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,599
You brought such a brat

211
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,199
to mess up my succession ceremony.

212
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,360
Why did you do so?

213
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,799
Dear heroes,

214
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm Sun Gangfeng.

215
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:14,520
I'm the elder of Taiji Sect.

216
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:15,479
Today,

217
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,520
I'm going to reveal the true colours

218
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,400
of the traitor Chen Yu
in front of you all.

219
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,439
Sun Gangfeng.

220
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,760
You're trying to frame me
because you fail to be the sect leader.

221
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:27,839
What's your intention?

222
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:29,000
It was him.

223
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,599
He killed Senior Lv Xixian
and his family.

224
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,079
You said I killed
Martial Uncle Lv and his family.

225
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,760
Is there any evidence?

226
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,959
Don't forget that

227
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,120
Senior Lv's daughter,

228
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,959
Lv Xiaomei,

229
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,559
saw what you did.

230
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,319
How ridiculous.

231
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,959
Then ask Lv Xiaomei to come up.

232
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,520
Let's confront face to face.

233
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,599
I organized Martial Uncle Lv's funeral.

234
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,439
Many of you here

235
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,319
also attended.

236
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:03,280
I have a clear conscience.

237
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,280
I'd like to ask you

238
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,959
what you have done.

239
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,559
He

240
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,719
always wanted his disciple

241
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,120
to take over the position
of the sect leader.

242
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,719
After knowing that Martial Uncle Lv

243
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,719
had appointed me as the sect leader,

244
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,959
he sent someone to attack me secretly.

245
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,479
He wanted to kill me

246
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,479
so that his disciple
could take the position.

247
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,640
You're slandering me!

248
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,439
Martial Uncle Sun.

249
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,959
I tolerate you again and again.

250
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,360
But you took advantage
of your seniority and were ungrateful.

251
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:31,199
Today,

252
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm going to expel you.

253
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,599
You're over-confident.

254
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,719
Chen Yu has practiced Taijiquan
for many years.

255
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,559
His internal skill
is indeed extraordinary.

256
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,959
This brat is going to suffer a lot.

257
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:00,280
I think it's more than just suffering.

258
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,599
Look

259
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,559
at Chen Yu's eyes.

260
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,520
I think he's going to kill him.

261
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,199
This brat is going to die.

262
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,719
Chen Yu exerts strength without much effort.

263
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,000
He uses force without any strength.

264
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,000
He has practiced Taijiquan
to perfection.

265
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,199
Look at that brat.

266
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,719
All the attacks

267
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,880
are pushed back by Chen Yu's Taijiquan.

268
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,439
It means that

269
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,559
all the attacks are on him.

270
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,760
Be careful.

271
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,599
Young man.

272
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,000
(Thousand Arms Buddha, Zhao Banshan)
You're injured and spit blood.

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,479
Take this medicine
and you'll be all right.

274
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,799
Thank you, Senior.

275
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:45,479
Zhao Banshan.

276
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,880
Thousand Arms Buddha, Zhao Banshan.

277
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,679
-Yes.
-Uncle Sun.

278
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,599
The Third Master of Red Flower Club.

279
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,079
Xiaomei, you're back.

280
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,880
She's Senior Lv's daughter,

281
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,839
Lv Xiaomei.

282
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,520
She can give evidence.

283
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,460
(The Daughter of Taiji Sect's Chief, Lv Xiaomei)

284
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,400
(The Daughter of The Sect Leader of Taiji Sect, Lv Xiaomei)
It was him.

285
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,719
He killed my parents
and younger brother.

286
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,319
I saw it all.

287
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,439
Why can't I be the sect leader?

288
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,240
Why can't I learn Ying and Yang Formula
and Circles Formula?

289
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,439
Because you have to
rely on the imperial court,

290
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,280
not Taiji Sect.

291
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,559
What's wrong with that?

292
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,599
If I become the sect leader

293
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,160
and rely on Commander Fu,

294
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,079
it'll only make Taiji Sect stronger.

295
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,839
You're wrong.

296
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,880
Since ancient times,

297
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,120
the imperial court has been most afraid
of using force to disrupt government.

298
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,360
In particular, Red Flower Club
caused a riot a few years ago.

299
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,920
The imperial court has been on guard
against those in the martial arts world.

300
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,280
If you become the sect leader,

301
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,360
Taiji Sect

302
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,759
will be in great trouble
if something happens.

303
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,360
It seems that
you won't change your mind.

304
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,880
Don't blame me for being merciless.

305
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:49,959
Kill them!

306
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,560
Mother.

307
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,320
Today next year

308
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,880
is the anniversary
of your family's death.

309
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,479
Today,

310
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,320
someone will help me kill you

311
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,759
to avenge my parents
and younger brother.

312
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,320
Are you the new sect leader
of Nanzong Sect?

313
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,679
Senior Zhao.

314
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,519
According to the seniority
of Taiji Sect,

315
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,400
I have to call you Martial Uncle.

316
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,800
I dare not.

317
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,160
I'll be in danger

318
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:30,199
of being killed if I become your Martial Uncle.

319
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,239
Martial Uncle Zhao.

320
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:38,120
Even if what Sun Gangfeng
and others said is a little true,

321
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:40,039
you coming from Beizong Sect
have no right to meddle

322
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,719
in the affairs of Nanzong Sect.

323
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,400
Are you trying to suppress me
with your seniority?

324
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,640
Senior Zhao said
he dares not be your Martial Uncle.

325
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,479
You keep calling him Martial Uncle.

326
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,719
How shameless.

327
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:54,120
I've lived in seclusion in Xinjiang
for many years.

328
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,840
I don't care about my sect.

329
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,160
I also don't care about the grudges
in the martial arts world.

330
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,679
But one day,

331
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,800
this little girl found me.

332
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,080
She knelt before me

333
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,439
and asked me to uphold justice.

334
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,959
Senior Sun wrote the letter with blood

335
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,759
that Taiji Sect met
an unforeseen disaster.

336
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,120
A traitor assassinated the sect leader.

337
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,360
He felt guilty for being incompetent.

338
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,400
He can't deal with
the traitor named Chen.

339
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:20,039
We only met once,

340
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,279
but I'll definitely help you.

341
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,719
Although I'm from Taiji Beizong Sect,

342
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,679
I have the same origin
as Taiji Nanzong Sect.

343
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,600
It's the misfortune

344
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,160
of Taiji Sect to have such a traitor.

345
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:39,519
Chen Yu.

346
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,600
You killed three people
to learn the Ying and Yang Formula

347
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,719
and Circles Formula.

348
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,999
You don't have to do that.

349
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,239
These two rhyme formulas

350
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,640
aren't the secrets of Taiji Sect.

351
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,160
I'm not capable.

352
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:53,160
But I still remember them.

353
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:54,640
I'll tell you now.

354
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,239
As a martial arts hero,

355
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
why do you humiliate me
with such ironic words?

356
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,479
Listen up.

357
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,239
Circles skill is the most difficult.

358
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,880
Follow the direction of the gesture.

359
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,360
Trap the enemy into the circles.

360
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,880
Overcome great force with small force.

361
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:13,439
Attack the opponent from his sideways.

362
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:16,039
Avoid the attack from being missed.

363
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,959
How to use the circles skillfully?

364
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,959
Hit the right opponent's landing point.

365
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,719
Senior Zhao,

366
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,199
please tell me the meaning.

367
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:26,999
Our Taiji skill

368
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,160
involves attacks in circles.

369
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:33,199
The so-called circles mean that
there are styles in the fist skill.

370
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,199
The change lies in the person.

371
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,360
The fist skill is all circles,

372
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:39,679
but it can be divided into
different levels of attack and defense.

373
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,080
There are big circles, small circles,

374
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,679
visible circles and invisible circles.

375
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,880
When facing the enemy,

376
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,320
overcome the small circle
with the big circle.

377
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,600
Attack from sideways
rather than frontal.

378
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:53,239
Overcome the visible circle
with the invisible circle.

379
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:56,360
Every move has hidden strength.

380
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,199
Push the enemy with my strength

381
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,999
into my invisible circle.

382
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,560
At that time, if he wants to move left,
you move left.

383
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,360
If he wants to move right,
you move right.

384
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,239
Then use a small force
to attack the enemy

385
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:11,239
with a great force.

386
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,039
Victory or defeat of Taijiquan
depends on

387
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,959
finding the right starting point

388
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,239
and hitting the landing point precisely.

389
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,320
It's a lifelong skill to ensure that

390
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,320
the oblique and invisible circles

391
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,560
used are right

392
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,600
and the starting and
landing points are accurate.

393
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,840
Do you understand?

394
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,320
Senior Zhao.

395
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,039
What about Ying and Yang Formula?

396
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,239
Ying and Yang Formula is also a rhyme.

397
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,439
Listen up.

398
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,279
I'll keep it in mind.

399
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,519
Most people don't know Yin and Yang
contain two opposite natures.

400
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,640
The law of strength and softness
is taking inhaling and exhaling.

401
00:22:44,152 --> 00:22:45,951
Seize the opportunity between
the two sides to advance and retreat.

402
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,199
Be calm and flexible in the changes.

403
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,360
Use the skills of striking first and
guarding against the enemy's attack.

404
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,239
Dodging and attacking at the same time.

405
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,600
Use a small force
to overcome the large force.

406
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:58,039
Follow the trend of the force to attack.

407
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,239
Everything is divided into Yin and Yang.

408
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,080
Yin and Yang of the fist skill

409
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:04,759
are divided into front and back, gentle
and harsh, soft and hard and so on.

410
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,920
Try to use the push technique.

411
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,840
Strike with strength.

412
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,759
Like a snake taking in food.

413
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,719
Use the devouring skill first.

414
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,840
Plunge with soft force.

415
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,759
Like a cow spitting grass.

416
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,320
When facing the enemy,

417
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:24,279
attack the enemy's corner
in my front direction.

418
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,999
Rush forward if facing each other.

419
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,039
Fight hard with great force.

420
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,920
If you're young and weak,

421
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,400
you'll lose if
you don't improve your skills

422
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,600
in time.

423
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:35,880
Brother.

424
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,679
Chen Yu is the traitor who killed
his master and betrayed his ancestors.

425
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,840
Why would Zhao Banshan

426
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,800
teach him the secret skill of Taiji?

427
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:48,600
No.

428
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:51,920
Zhao Banshan isn't teaching Chen Yu

429
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:53,840
but that brat.

430
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:55,519
After teaching him,

431
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,400
Chen Yu has no chance of escape.

432
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:01,463
It's called light to light
but all missed

433
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:03,920
in terms of fist skill

434
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:04,920
if attacking the corners.

435
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,920
Strike the enemy with utmost strength.

436
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,360
And avoid heavy blows from the enemy.

437
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:12,479
Attack and defense.

438
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:13,880
Advance while dodging.

439
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,239
Dodge while advancing.

440
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:16,959
According to the fist formula,

441
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:19,120
attacking is defencing.

442
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,039
Advancing is dodging.

443
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,120
Without attack and defense,

444
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,880
it's not excellent martial arts.

445
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,800
The strength of martial arts
is ever-changing.

446
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,199
Fighting against each other.

447
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,279
One attacks while one defends.

448
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,679
A great force overcomes a small force.

449
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,519
Succeed only by hitting
the enemy's weakness

450
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:38,600
with a small force.

451
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:40,519
Make the enemy's force in vain.

452
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:43,279
Although my strength is weak,
I can defeat the enemy.

453
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:44,800
Do you understand?

454
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,560
Thank you for teaching me.

455
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,920
You enlightened me.

456
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,120
If I had known it earlier,

457
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,120
I wouldn't have begged Martial Uncle Lv.

458
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,439
If you had known it earlier,

459
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,360
you wouldn't have killed three people.

460
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,120
I taught you these two sets
of fist formulas.

461
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,160
I think

462
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,199
you still don't understand
how to use them.

463
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:12,759
Young man.

464
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,840
Do you understand?

465
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,080
Thank you for your teaching, Senior.

466
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,439
After listening to your explanation,

467
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:20,360
I'm enlightened.

468
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,080
Now I figured out something

469
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,959
that I couldn't before.

470
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:23,999
Okay.

471
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:26,999
Then you can fight with Chen Yu.

472
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,840
My martial arts are ordinary.

473
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,959
I think we can let it go.

474
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,719
Even Chief Lv was killed by you.

475
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,519
How can

476
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,279
your martial arts be ordinary?

477
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,560
Come on.

478
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,160
Young man.

479
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,239
You've got me beaten.

480
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,959
Please spare my life.

481
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,479
Spare your life?

482
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:04,479
Have you ever thought
about sparing their lives

483
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,320
when you killed Chief Lv's family?

484
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,640
What are you waiting for?

485
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,759
Kill him.

486
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:27,479
Chen Yu.

487
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,840
Now you've been deserted
by your followers.

488
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,640
No one will help you again.

489
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,160
Senior Zhao.

490
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
He has lost his martial arts.

491
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
How to deal with him?

492
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,920
He's responsible for what he did.

493
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,959
He has to bear the consequence

494
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,360
of what he has done.

495
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,039
Great.

496
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:14,600
Brother Hu is a rare talent

497
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,279
in our Taiji Sect.

498
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,999
It's a blessing for Taiji Sect.

499
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:19,400
Brother Zhao.

500
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,239
Brother Hu is not our disciple.

501
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,039
You're not a disciple of Taiji Sect?

502
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,360
No.

503
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,679
I'm not a disciple of your sect.

504
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,679
It's strange.

505
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,360
The Yin and Yang Formula
and Circles Formula

506
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,400
are the secrets of our sect.

507
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,400
They're only passed down
to the sect leader.

508
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:41,920
Otherwise,

509
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,560
Chen Yu wouldn't have done
anything to get it.

510
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:46,199
I've told it to so many people.

511
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,479
Only you

512
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:49,080
can understand what I said.

513
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,320
It's hard for even a martial arts genius to do it.

514
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,719
Senior.

515
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,120
I'm not a disciple of Taiji Sect.

516
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,439
But I learned some

517
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:57,840
of the key techniques of Taiji Sect.

518
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,199
I know a little

519
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:00,999
about Taiji Sect kung fu.

520
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
Who taught you that?

521
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,320
Brother Zhao, it's me.

522
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,279
I was imprisoned in the dungeon
by Chen Yu.

523
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,400
I couldn't escape.

524
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,120
My martial arts are ordinary.

525
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,920
It's all because of him

526
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,959
that we can escape from the dungeon.

527
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,199
It seems

528
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:21,400
Brother Hu and our Taiji Sect
are destined.

529
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,199
Don't worry, Senior.

530
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:25,360
Although I'm just a nobody

531
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,519
in the martial arts world,

532
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:28,360
I also know that
faithfulness comes first.

533
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,479
If I don't get your permission,

534
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,080
I won't use your martial arts casually

535
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,560
in the martial arts world.

536
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:35,279
Young man, don't worry too much.

537
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,279
Martial arts are only passed on
to those who are destined for them.

538
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,600
Since you've learned them,

539
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,160
there's no need to worry
about the sects.

540
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,759
You can carry them forward.

541
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,640
I admire you for your uprightness.

542
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,279
You defend the weak against the strong.

543
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:51,160
It's what we who learn martial arts should do.

544
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:54,519
So I have a personal favour.

545
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:57,360
I want to be your brother
with a different surname.

546
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,239
What do you think?

547
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,279
That's great.

548
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,400
Now there will be more excitement.

549
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:03,800
No way.

550
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:04,840
Senior.

551
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,640
You're a great master
in the martial arts world.

552
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:08,479
I don't even deserve
to be your disciple.

553
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,360
How can we call each other brother?

554
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,519
Young man.

555
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:14,519
We met by chance today,
and we're compatible.

556
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:16,360
There's no need to care
about seniority and age.

557
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,080
Now is the best time.

558
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
Let's make it today.

559
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,400
That's right.

560
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
My father said

561
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,999
brothers are called
regardless of their ages.

562
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,279
Brother Hu, don't reject anymore.

563
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,519
Okay.

564
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,920
-The God of Heaven.
-The God of Heaven.

565
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,279
I'm Zhao Banshan.

566
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,360
I'm Hu Fei.

567
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,719
-Today we become sworn brothers.
-Today we become sworn brothers.

568
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,320
-From now on, we'll be brothers forever.
-From now on, we'll be brothers forever.

569
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,800
-Till death do us part.
-Till death do us part.

570
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,279
-Close like brothers.
-Close like brothers.

571
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,880
-Heaven above and earth below
-Heaven above and earth below

572
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,400
-prove our sincerity.
-prove our sincerity.

573
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,880
-Whoever betrays
-Whoever betrays

574
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:02,439
-will be punished.
-will be punished.

575
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,279
My good brother.

576
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,080
Third Brother.

577
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,959
Congratulations on
meeting your soulmate.

578
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,640
There's another good story
in the martial arts world.

579
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,279
Yes.

580
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Congratulations,
Third Uncle Zhao and Brother Hu.

581
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,439
But isn't that a bit awkward?

582
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,640
You must show your respect.

583
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,600
From now on,

584
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,039
you have to call me Uncle Hu.

585
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,400
Forget it.

586
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,120
I'll follow your seniority.

587
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,999
I'm much younger now

588
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,840
that I recognize you as my brother.

589
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:57,759
Third Master!

590
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:58,439
What's the matter?

591
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:02,999
I got it.

592
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,439
Go back and tell First Master

593
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,320
that I'll deal with it right away.

594
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,279
Yes.

595
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,560
Brother.

596
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,080
I wanted to get together with you.

597
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,800
But we're in the martial arts world, after all.

598
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:16,239
I have something urgent to deal with.

599
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,640
Let's say goodbye.

600
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:20,526
Third Brother, we just got together.

601
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,719
Yet, you're leaving now.

602
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,120
There's always a way out.

603
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:25,360
The world is neither big nor small.

604
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,880
We'll meet again
in the martial arts world.

605
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,679
If you really miss me,

606
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,279
go to Xinjiang to find me.

607
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,800
Okay.

608
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,199
A promise is a promise.

609
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,679
As the elder brother,

610
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,880
you can't go back on your word.

611
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:39,279
Don't mind my nagging.

612
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,039
There's something I want to ask you.

613
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,719
Go ahead, Third Brother.

614
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,120
Brother, you and I met by chance.

615
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,320
I know you're stubborn.

616
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,959
You've offended many people
in the martial arts world.

617
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,360
Tell me if there's a strong enemy.

618
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,880
I'll work with you.

619
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,640
Third Brother.

620
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,439
As a man, I think I'd better

621
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,999
solve some problems by myself.

622
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:07,360
Thank you for your concern,
Third Brother.

623
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,840
You're a real man.

624
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,640
It's my token of appreciation.

625
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,279
The keepsake of Red Flower Club.

626
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,320
Yes.

627
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,039
Seeing the flower
is like seeing a person.

628
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,600
Heroes in the martial arts world
will know that you're my friend

629
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,120
when they see this flower.

630
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,719
If you encounter difficulties
in the martial arts world,

631
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:30,999
you can ask them

632
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,519
for a helper or money with this flower.

633
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,560
Thank you, Third Brother.

634
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,080
It seems that

635
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,840
I have to learn not only your skills

636
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,239
but also your personality.

637
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,279
You have friends all over the world.

638
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,320
I was busy chatting.

639
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,719
I almost forgot my real work.

640
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,360
I came here mainly to deliver a letter.

641
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,239
I have something important
to deal with this time.

642
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,920
Senior Sun, please deliver it for me.

643
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,990
(To Miao Renfeng)

644
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:57,880
It's my pleasure.

645
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,630
(To Miao Renfeng)

646
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,400
Miao Renfeng.

647
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:03,479
Yes.

648
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,080
Back then,

649
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,959
Miao Renfeng and Yan Ji

650
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,360
worked together

651
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:10,039
and poisoned the weapons.

652
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:12,080
They killed your parents.

653
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,360
This is a letter from Chief Chen
to Hero Miao.

654
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:17,320
You must deliver it to him in person.

655
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,160
The three red flowers
startle the world.

656
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,560
The Divine Land is in unrest.

657
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:24,239
The secret letter
of the three red flowers

658
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,840
must be something urgent.

659
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,400
I'll send the letter to Hero Miao
as soon as possible.

660
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:29,759
Great.

661
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,239
Uncle Sun and Hero Miao
know each other very well.

662
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,160
We're just in time to
go to Miao Village.

663
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,279
Brother Hu, if you have nothing else to do,

664
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,479
come with us.

665

as they heard that you invited them

675

to deal with the great enemy
Miao Renfeng.

676
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,079
It's such

a heaven-sent opportunity.

678

680
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,959
without them knowing.
