3
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:05,980
Lingsu.

4
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,980
Should I not have stayed
in the capital?

5
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,810
Ziyi…

6
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,050
Young Lady Yuan said,

7
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,090
after the World's Sect Leaders Gathering ends,

8
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,450
she will bring the children back.

9
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,580
Instead of waiting here,

10
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,690
we should go outside the city.

11
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,450
After all, I'm a wanted criminal
of the imperial court.

12
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,450
I will cause trouble for them.

13
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,980
I can't leave yet.

14
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,540
I want to join
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

15
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,340
The person you met today

16
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,810
is Shi Wanchen.

17
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,170
He is known as the Lord of Poison.

18
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,730
He once practiced
under the same sect as my master.

19
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,090
He used poison without restraint

20
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,580
and killed a lot of people.

21
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,610
So he was banned by the grandmaster.

22
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,970
In the decades since then,

23
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,860
he fought many times with my master.

24
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,300
At first, my master still cared
for the relationship of sect-mates,

25
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,370
so he didn't kill him.

26
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,780
But since he continued
to do evil things,

27
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,300
my master decided to help the grandmaster
restore the sect's reputation

28
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,660
and put a poison without a cure on him.

29
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,890
We thought he was killed by the poison,

30
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,220
but we didn't know that he had a plan B.

31
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,610
At last, he used over ten years
to force out the poison.

32
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,140
It is not until now that I found out

33
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,300
that he is still alive.

34
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,610
Those unreasonable situations

35
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,060
have answers now.

36
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,020
Fei, do you still remember my words?

37
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,170
I once told you

38
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,660
the poison that made
Hero Miao become blind

39
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,810
was related to my sect.

40
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,090
Was it really him?

41
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,580
I'm not sure yet.

42
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,780
If it was really him,

43
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,300
then the poison that killed your father

44
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,020
is probably made by him.

45
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,300
Today, he mentioned that he is joining
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

46
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,300
This is my opportunity.

47
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,020
He has done too many evils.

48
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,700
I will not let him stay alive
and continue to kill more people.

49
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,260
I will restore my sect's reputation.

50
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,610
Lingsu.

51
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,260
I will go with you.

52
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,170
Fei, this is too dangerous.

53
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,420
Now that he has mastered
the Brigitte silkworm poison technique.

54
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,170
And he knows so well about the poisons.

55
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,650
Today, I suffered a lot from him.

56
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,140
We must find out a way

57
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,420
to restrain him.

58
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,700
And it is exactly because of this

59
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,100
that I must stay.

60
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,540
In this world,

61
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,980
you are my only family now.

62
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,050
Hero Miao, what are you doing?

63
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,890
Hero Hu's death anniversary
is coming soon.

64
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,020
I'm going to pay my respects to him.

65
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,650
I was thinking to bring Ruolan along.

66
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,580
But she is still young.

67
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,100
Brother Sun.

68
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,770
Go on.

69
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,930
I will leave my daughter with you.

70
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,540
I will be back very soon.

71
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,450
Take care, Hero Miao.

72
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,380
Hong.

73
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,650
Madam.

74
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,940
Where's Guinong?

75
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,260
Master is in the study.

76
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,740
Locked for many years

77
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,330
but still sharp.

78
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,650
Nice.

79
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,820
Why are you so happy?

80
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,940
Lan, Lan.

81
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,820
Give it to me!

82
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,290
Lan, don't do that.

83
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,850
Be careful.

84
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,500
Why did you do that?

85
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,650
You promised me
you would quit the martial arts world.

86
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,180
Why did you dig one's grave?

87
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,620
And you seized one's saber
to fight for hegemony.

88
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,330
Lan. Well, stay calm.

89
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,380
Let me explain to you.

90
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,140
That…

91
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,020
The World's Sect Leaders Gathering
has a change of circumstances.

92
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,940
The Jade Dragon Cup that was given to me

93
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,210
has been canceled.

94
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,260
I have to compete on stage.

95
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,770
You know the level of my martial arts.

96
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,770
Without this Cold Moon Saber,

97
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,580
I have no chance of winning at all.

98
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,500
My dad died because of this saber.

99
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,090
I don't want you to repeat his mistake!

100
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,530
Why are you so obsessed
with vague vanity?

101
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,530
Because I'm the leader of Tianlong Sect!

102
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,020
Think about it.

103
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,940
There are so many disciples
in Tianlong Sect.

104
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,700
They rely so much on me.

105
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,410
Do I have any choices?

106
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,060
So,

107
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,770
what you told me earlier

108
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,180
is just a lie.

109
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,970
You never considered quitting, right?

110
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,650
You can't always do as you like.

111
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,700
Do you want to see

112
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,970
Tianlong Sect ends in my hand?

113
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,970
How can I let the ancestors down?

114
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,090
Lan!

115
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:11,930
Lan.

116
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,340
Madam.

117
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,290
Lan...

118
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,860
Lan. I…

119
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,650
I'm sorry. Well...

120
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,170
I shouldn't have yelled at you just now.

121
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,140
Go away.

122
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,170
I have nothing else to say to you.

123
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,260
You did so many evil things

124
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,980
just for that Jade Dragon Cup.

125
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,220
Lan.

126
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,140
Listen to me first, okay?

127
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,810
What I did

128
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,690
is actually all for you.

129
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,460
Miao Renfeng will not let us go.

130
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,860
But I'm so useless.

131
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,380
My…

132
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,810
My technique is so far from his.

133
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,100
Only if I get the Cold Moon Saber

134
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,380
can I protect you better.

135
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,810
And so I can bring Ruolan back soon.

136
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,860
What I did

137
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,890
is not open and aboveboard.

138
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,530
But

139
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,020
it is all for

140
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,620
our future.

141
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,930
If it is just like what you said,

142
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,770
everything happens because of me,

143
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,020
now listen to me.

144
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,460
Don't do anything for me anymore.

145
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,260
Return the saber.

146
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,500
I don't want that ominous thing.

147
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,220
I will no longer be obsessed with
bringing my child back.

148
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,290
I really don't want to have
any relationship

149
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,530
with Miao Renfeng anymore.

150
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,570
Since I have chosen you,

151
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,050
I will go through thick and thin
together with you.

152
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,170
If you die, I will go with you.

153
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,810
Guinong.

154
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,410
I really want to

155
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,500
live a peaceful life with you.

156
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,020
To forgive others
is to set ourselves free.

157
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,500
Promise me.

158
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,690
Don't do that anymore.

159
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:28,930
Okay?

160
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,570
I promise.

161
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,100
I will return the saber immediately.

162
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,650
I will also

163
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,220
rebuild Hero Hu's grave soon.

164
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,290
Believe in me.

165
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,170
Okay?

166
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,980
How?

167
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,570
How many taels
can he get fined this time?

168
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,100
It's roughly 30 million taels.

169
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,290
Is Tang Pei so rich?

170
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,650
It's such a pity.

171
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,340
There are so many people who envy him.

172
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,620
We can only keep the small balance.

173
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,570
The large number should be passed up.

174
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,140
Sir, don't worry.

175
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,650
Tang Pei has already left behind the way

176
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,410
to become rich.

177
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,100
Please have a look.

178
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,660
(Jindao Sect, Wang Yuanbai,
40 silver taels)

179
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,740
Stop beating around the bush.

180
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,690
Tell me.

181
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,460
Tang Pei took bribery
from the sect leaders.

182
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,460
And based on the amount,

183
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,650
he privately distributed
eight Silver Dragon Cups

184
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,020
and eight Golden Dragon Cups

185
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,500
according to the seat numbers.

186
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Till the day
of the World's Sect Leaders Gathering,

187
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,620
those people will go on stage
with pretense

188
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,220
and simply pose on stage.

189
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,020
And then they distribute the cups

190
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,930
and everyone is happy.

191
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,140
I know all this.

192
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,140
What Tang Pei can do,

193
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,860
I can make it too.

194
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,860
I will make a

195
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,100
reopening session.

196
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,770
And let the sect leaders pay again.

197
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,500
Good idea, sir.

198
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,860
Brother Zhou.

199
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,050
Here you are.

200
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,100
You have to

201
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,460
help us.

202
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,650
I have heard about it.

203
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,140
Please be seated.

204
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,410
Don't panic.

205
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,530
How can we not panic?

206
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,340
Tang Pei has grabbed an amount from us.

207
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,810
And now Hailan Bi
is doing the same thing.

208
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:26,930
We just want to

209
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,980
show up in the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

210
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,140
Why should we suffer
from these two problems?

211
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,570
Brother Zhou asked you
to sit down and talk.

212
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,980
Didn't you hear him?

213
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,410
There are no such rules
in doing business.

214
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,810
They are obviously robbing us.

215
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,810
Our money don't grow on trees.

216
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,410
Why should we pay twice

217
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,690
to get a thing?

218
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,770
Brother Zhou.

219
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,570
Do you know
that we pay taels to Tang Pei

220
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,930
because we believe in you?

221
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,620
What are you talking about?

222
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,410
It was you guys that begged our brother

223
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,570
to help you pull some strings.

224
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,100
If Tang Pei rips you off,

225
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,500
that makes us unlucky too.

226
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,170
Enough.

227
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,220
Tang Pei this, Tang Pei that.

228
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,410
Tang Pei is the spy
from the Red Flower Club.

229
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,620
Do you want to die?

230
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,020
Look at you.

231
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,740
Look at how useless you are.

232
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,100
A thousand gold coins spent,
more will turn up again.

233
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,930
If you give bribery to Official Hai,

234
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,690
you will get the cups.

235
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,860
Later when you have more disciples,

236
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,890
you can become a hegemony.

237
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,810
Do you still think your taels
will not come back?

238
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,740
Moreover,

239
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,650
Hailan Bi is already imitating Tang Pei,

240
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,860
setting up a gambling house.

241
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,930
When he is the banker and wins a lot,

242
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,740
why don't you

243
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,650
get some money from him?

244
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,140
That's right, Tiejiao.

245
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,530
If we know

246
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,860
who loses first and who wins later,

247
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,740
those gamblers

248
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,740
will become

249
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,290
a fool that gives us taels.

250
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,260
You are clever.

251
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,290
Chief.

252
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,050
I have done what you assigned.

253
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,340
And we have set up an ambush.

254
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,650
If he comes,

255
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,460
I guarantee that we will succeed.

256
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:30,930
Remember.

257
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,290
Don't let Madam leave the backyard.

258
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,570
Let her pay full attention to the play.

259
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,220
I understand.

260
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,020
Guinong.

261
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,690
Have you returned the saber?

262
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,220
Don't worry.

263
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,650
I have already assigned someone
to send it back since yesterday night.

264
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,810
Come. Let's watch the play closely.

265
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,650
Miao Renfeng is here!

(Tianlong Sect)

267
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,610
Come out!

268
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,460
Good girl, Ruolan.

269
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,530
Don't cry.

270
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,090
See, it's drizzling tonight.

271
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,130
It's such good weather
to watch a play,

272
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,420
a play about
the father and daughter's reunion.

273
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:36,940
Ruolan.

274
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,020
I'm afraid
I can't control my hands.

275
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,420
Hero Miao, Hero Miao.

276
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,370
Do you still remember what I told you?

277
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,980
You killed my child.

278
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,770
And today, your child

279
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,770
is in my hand.

280
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,290
Well, whether she stays alive or not,

281
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,850
that depends on you.

282
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,660
Knee down.

283
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,460
Miao Renfeng,
the best hero in the martial arts world,

284
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,570
has dignity.

285
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,660
You don't want to kneel?
Great, then don't.

286
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,260
I'll kneel.

287
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,980
I'll kneel.

288
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,460
Good boy.

00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,900
(Ancestral Merit)

290
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,810
If you hurt her even a bit,

291
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,940
I will kill your whole family.

292
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,460
Guinong.

293
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,180
Where's Master?

294
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,130
Madam, Master…

295
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,700
Master is back.

296
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,260
Guinong, where have you been?

297
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,570
I have a

298
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,740
surprise for you.

299
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,530
Master, Madam.

300
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,130
Ruolan.

301
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,020
Ruolan.

302
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,810
Guinong.

303
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,370
Didn't I tell you?

304
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,260
I will always keep my words.

305
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,220
You can play with Ruolan.

306
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,860
I have to go

307
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,050
for the troupe.

308
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,290
It wouldn't be polite

309
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,500
if both of us aren't there.

310
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,130
Ruolan.

311
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,610
Do you miss me?

312
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,530
You are awake.

313
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,530
I hate your eyes

314
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,090
the most.

315
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,220
In your eyes,

316
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,810
am I so useless?

317
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,700
Nevermind.

318
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,610
Does that hurt?

319
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,220
It does.

320
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,050
So you are neither omnipotent

321
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,050
nor impervious to swords and bullets.

322
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,530
You have your own Achilles' heel.

323
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,570
You don't care about anything

324
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,850
but your child.

325
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,050
To be honest,

326
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,530
I'm quite impressed.

327
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,850
But it's too late.

328
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,740
From now on,

329
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,420
I am

330
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,530
the only Dad of the child.

331
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,050
How did Ruolan come back?

332
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,810
I didn't expect that unreasonable man

333
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,020
to change his mind

334
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,810
and give Ruolan back to me.

335
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,460
How did Master

336
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,020
bring Ruolan back?

337
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,610
Madam.

338
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,740
Please don't ask us.

339
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,460
Then you help me to take care of Ruolan.

340
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,330
I'll get back to the play.

341
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,370
Yes, Madam.

342
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,770
Madam never treats us as servants,

343
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,900
but we lied to her.

344
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,260
This… This is so sinful.

345
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,050
That's right.

346
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,810
Madam is so pitiful.

347
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,090
Last time, Master made
Hero Miao's eyes blind.

348
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,090
This time, he used
the saber and the child

349
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,180
to lure Hero Miao into the trap.

350
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,130
But Madam knows nothing about it.

351
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,700
But what can we do as a servant?

352
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,180
We have no idea even if we want to help.

353
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,420
Fortunately, the child
is brought back now,

354
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,220
which relieved Madam's pain
of missing her.

355
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,810
God bless. God bless.

356
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,940
I've treated you well in the past.

357
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,610
If both of you have a conscience,

358
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,530
you must tell me the truth.

359
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,050
Where is

360
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,370
the child's father?

361
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,260
He's being locked in the ancestral hall.

362
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,530
You all must help me.

363
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,770
Okay. Let's not mention him.

364
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,420
Let's talk about us.

365
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,330
Both of us.

366
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,850
Well...

367
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,570
Our families
have been friends for generations.

368
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,700
And we are childhood friends.

369
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,050
I'm very sad too.

370
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,370
Why did things end up like this?

371
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,290
Be brothers forever,

372
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,050
make our family proud,

373
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,810
and become famous.

374
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,770
Aren't these good?

375
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,180
I've admired you since I was young.

376
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,020
And I look up to you.

377
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,260
How nice. You are a martial arts genius.

378
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,130
But me?

379
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,900
No matter how hard I work,

380
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,940
how much I practice,

381
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,420
I am nothing but an ordinary one.

382
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,330
Even so, why should I

383
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,090
be bossed around by you

384
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,500
and despised by you when I grow up?

385
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,020
I was just happy to share with you

386
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,130
that I have many disciples,

387
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,900
but you called me vulgar.

388
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,660
Is it because people's martial arts
are not as good as yours,

389
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,610
and they are not qualified

390
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,660
to set up a sect and enroll disciples?

391
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,090
Or am I the only one
that doesn't deserve it

392
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,530
in your eyes?

393
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,550
(Ancestral Merit)

394
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,290
You are so lucky.

395
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,020
You can fight all masters in the world.

396
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,370
Golden-face Buddha.

397
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,700
What a great name.

398
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,660
I promoted your name a lot.

399
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,740
But of course, it's not for you.

400
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,610
I was just thinking

401
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,220
if someone can defeat you,

402
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,330
at least they can avenge my grievance.

403
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,020
People say

404
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,020
you are a noble person.

405
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,460
Am I

406
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,090
the narrow-minded one here?

407
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,460
I can still call you brother
for few times.

408
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,130
Brother.

409
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,700
Brother.

410
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,020
Brother, brother!

411
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,330
I have called you brother
for half of my lifetime.

412
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,530
But you refused
to teach me a single technique.

413
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,700
But Hu Yidao.

414
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,050
You guys were rivals and enemies.

415
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,530
You knew each other in two days

416
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,460
and became soulmates.

417
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,530
You even taught him
Miao's Sword Techniques.

418
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,090
It's not fair.

419
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,940
It's not fair!

420
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,570
I feel sad and disappointed.

421
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,570
Aren't you always looking for the truth?

422
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,850
Who put the poison

423
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,850
on Hu Yidao's saber?

424
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,740
I did that.

425
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,500
Madam.

426
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,770
Get us another bottle of wine.

427
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,740
Sure.

428
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,980
It's me

429
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,220
who did it.

430
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,090
Why did I do that?

431
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,420
You must know the reason.

432
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,940
It's because my skills are below others.

433
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,420
So I treat you as my brother,

434
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,610
hoping you to help
and take good care of me.

435
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,700
But I am totally hidden by you.

436
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,530
I am just moss in the jungle.

437
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,180
As long as you are alive,

438
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,500
I have to stay in the mud
for my whole life!

439
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,850
Later,

440
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,810
why did the whole thing go wrong?

441
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,610
Why did you exchange
your weapon with him?

442
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,180
Why did he

443
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,900
die for you?

444
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,700
I… I was too disappointed.

445
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,700
So disappointed.

446
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,980
But later I found out that…

447
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:20,900
I found out

448
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,530
that everything has both sides.

449
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,180
I watched you looking for the truth

450
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,370
until you became
mentally and physically exhausted.

451
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,290
As if you were in a living hell.

452
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,420
You got drunk every day.

453
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,810
It's fine too.

454
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,260
Rather than

455
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,660
feeling apprehensive afterward,

456
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,380
I thought it was worth it.

457
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,210
Right?

458
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,300
If you died, you would be free.

459
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,900
That's not fun.

460
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,980
But watching you stay
in a living hell,

461
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,460
I'm so happy.

462
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,300
So happy.

463
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,300
Okay. Since I have the mood now,

464
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:05,940
let me

465
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,940
tell you another thing.

466
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,380
Your eyes became blind

467
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,460
because of my poison too.

468
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,460
Yes.

469
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,090
It's me again.

470
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,650
Why?

471
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,020
Because I think God is blinded.

472
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,650
Why did God let a person like you

473
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,860
have a pretty and gentle girl

474
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,500
to accompany you?

475
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,460
You…

476
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,020
It's such a waste.

477
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,250
You didn't know to be grateful.

478
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,460
If I were you,

479
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,210
if God were to give me such a lady,

480
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,690
I would definitely
take good care of her.

481
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,020
I'm left with no choice
but to do God's work.

482
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,570
And help you to take care of them.

483
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,650
Because you are disqualified to do so.

484
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,340
I want to let you become one

485
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,380
who has no brother, wife, or child.

486
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:10,130
I want you to be all alone.

487
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,820
I will let Nan Lan stay with me forever.

488
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:19,610
Because she is my reward
for defeating you.

489
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,420
Her appearance will always remind me

490
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,420
that I'm better than Miao Renfeng,

491
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,570
that I'm stronger than Miao Renfeng.

492
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,820
Soon,

493
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,780
I will get the Jade Dragon Cup.

494
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,500
I will give Nan Lan a great wedding.

495
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,300
And people around the world

496
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,300
will recognize me as
one of the Eight Great Sect Leaders.

497
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,340
While you,

498
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,530
the Golden-face Buddha
worshipped by thousands of people,

499
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,340
will have your golden paint going off.

500
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,820
And your real identity
as a wooden sculpture will be revealed.

501
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,910
Your temple
will be broken and abandoned.

502
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,170
You'll become
the laughing stock of the world.

503
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,420
