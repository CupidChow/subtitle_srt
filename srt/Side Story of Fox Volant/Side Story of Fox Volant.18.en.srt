=Side Story Of Fox Volant=
(Adapted from Jin Yong's novel)

2
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,520
=Episode 18=

3
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,719
This is called body repatriation.

4
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,200
It's also known
as the soul displacement.

5
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,800
It originates from Xiangxi.

6
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
The taoists in charge
of the body repatriation

7
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,639
will usually put a dot of cinnabar

8
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,639
on the forehead of the body

9
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:37,880
followed by a talisman.

10
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,160
Then,

11
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,079
they will let the body
wear a conical hat.

12
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,560
After that, the taoist

13
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,079
will shout out an incantation.

14
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,840
Rise!

15
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,519
See?

16
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,840
The body has stood up.

17
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,320
Martial Uncle Sun.

18
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,359
Look at him. He always bullies me.

19
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,760
Brother Hu.

20
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,960
She's born timid.

21
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,480
Stop scaring her.

22
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,639
Okay now, Xiaomei.

23
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,519
I was just playing with you.

24
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,200
There's no ghost in this world.

25
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,600
Even if there's a ghost,

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,799
it won't be as evil as humans.

27
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:05,639
Think about it.

28
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,879
Someone like Chen Yu

29
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,079
is way worse than a ghost.

30
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,999
This is bad.

31
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,439
I won't be able to sleep tonight.

32
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,960
That's good.

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,439
Senior Sun and I can sleep

34
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,279
while you take the night shift.

35
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:18,879
Don't do that.

36
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,639
I beg you, Brother Hu.

37
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,079
If both of you are asleep,

38
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,639
I'll be even more terrified.

39
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Silly girl.

40
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,639
The dead are on the road.

41
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,999
The living should make way.

42
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,239
If you run into the dead,

43
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,359
calamities will follow!

44
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,040
This is bad.

45
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,959
We've become the targets of ghosts.

46
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,720
Since they are targetting us,

47
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,280
let me go and keep them company.

48
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,600
Brother Hu, don't go. It's dangerous.

49
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,079
Stop sneaking around.

50
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,480
If you are a deity,
go back to your temple.

51
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,200
If you are a ghost,
go back to your grave.

52
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,880
If you are a person,

53
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
show yourself.

54
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,399
Ghost!

55
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,440
I won't let you get away!

56
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,400
You are just a trickster!

57
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,400
Brother.

58
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,600
Tell me.

59
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,840
Who are you?

60
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:50,359
This is bad.

61
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,640
The Three Heroes of Zhong

62
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,879
have been defeated today.

63
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,559
You are the Three Heroes of Zhong
from the Golden Bell Sect?

64
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,080
Don't say that.

65
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,439
It's just the name of a gang.

66
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,920
You shouldn't mention it.

67
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,840
Since we are all
from the martial arts world,

68
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,759
we are all friends.

69
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,920
We don't have to be

70
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,640
so formal with each other.

71
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,600
My fellow heroes.

72
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,600
Our friendship will never be broken.

73
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
We'll meet again after this.

74
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,759
See you again.

75
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,239
Let's go.

76
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,119
You can try leaving.

77
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,759
Please spare our lives.

78
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,439
Hero.

79
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,280
We are destitute.

80
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,999
We have no food at home.

81
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,559
We can't find a job.

82
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,960
We have no choice

83
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,840
but to choose this path.

84
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,119
Did you kill or hurt anyone?

85
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,239
We just scare those who pass by here

86
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,799
to make some money.

87
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,759
We are not trying to hurt anyone.

88
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,239
If I see you again,

89
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,439
I'll kill you.

90
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,400
Get lost now!

91
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,600
Let's go.

92
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,359
Let's go.

93
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,799
Senior Sun.

94
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,119
Actually, when I think about it,

95
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,199
our night has become more interesting

96
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,520
because of them.

97
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,600
It's not a loss for us.

98
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,960
Oh no.

99
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,720
My bag.

100
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,040
Luckily, it's still here.

101
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,239
Looks like

102
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,600
we can't sleep tonight.

103
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,400
We have to travel through the night

104
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,799
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

105
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
It's so fun to travel through
the martial arts world.

106
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,280
Brother Hu, Martial Uncle Sun,

107
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,640
if you have a journey like this again,

108
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,799
remember to bring me along.

109
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:37,679
Xiaomei.

110
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,720
There's a ghost.

111
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,960
You are scaring me again.

112
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,310
(Tianlong)

113
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:52,640
(Tianlong Sect)
Please, Madam.

114
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,720
(Tianlong Sect)
Drink something.

115
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,319
Otherwise, Old Master will blame us.

116
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,640
Yes, Madam.

117
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,439
You don't have an appetite?

118
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,239
Lan, I know

119
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,520
that you are upset.

120
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,319
But

121
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,920
it has already happened.

122
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,799
You can't continue to be
so depressed about it.

123
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,080
We still have a long way to go.

124
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:29,840
We can have
another child again after this.

125
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,840
Guinong, stop talking.

126
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,720
I know that you are sad about it too.

127
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,119
I should be blamed for this.

128
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,040
I think our child is gone

129
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,799
because God is punishing me.

130
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,640
This is Miao Renfeng's fault.

131
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,720
Our child is dead because of him.

132
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,439
If he didn't upset you,

133
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:54,280
none of it would happen.

134
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:04,040
Everything will be fine.

135
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,479
Lan.

136
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,839
You have to promise me

137
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,479
that you'll take good care of your body.

138
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,839
Don't think too much.

139
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,959
This is not your fault.

140
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,400
You didn't fail anyone.

141
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,360
I want to bring you to a place.

142
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,839
Come with me.

143
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,959
I promise that it will make you happy.

144
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,479
Come, let me help you to stand up.

145
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,880
Let's fix your clothes.

146
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,360
Here.

147
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,599
Come on.

148
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,799
Come.

149
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,120
Come.

150
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:41,799
Guinong.

151
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,479
These are...

152
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,599
I prepared these

153
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,120
for our child.

154
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,439
Don't forget

155
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,000
that Ruolan called me

156
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,240
father first.

157
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,000
This room

158
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:10,959
is prepared for Ruolan.

159
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,319
But now, Ruolan...

160
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,160
Now...

161
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:21,839
Now, she's not with us

162
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,360
because last time...

163
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,079
Because last time,
I couldn't make her stay.

164
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,360
But I want to tell you

165
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,160
that soon,

166
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,559
Ruolan will be living here.

167
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:43,520
Really?

168
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,880
Can Ruolan really live here?

169
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,280
If I don't mean it,

170
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,319
I won't show this room to you.

171
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:55,719
Don't worry.

172
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:58,040
I have a meticulous plan.

173
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,520
I'm 100% sure.

174
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,040
This time,

175
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,920
I'll bring Ruolan back.

176
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,120
Trust me.

177
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,640
Can you

178
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,319
give me a smile?

179
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,719
Give me a smile.

180
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,719
Look at how sweet your smile is.

181
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,160
Are you going to accompany me
to watch an opera show now?

182
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,439
Start the show!

183
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,000
Hero Miao is such a powerful person.

184
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,920
But he's living in such a small village?

185
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,920
Hero Miao

186
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,120
has a queer personality.

187
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,160
He likes to keep a low profile.

188
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,640
He likes to live a simple life
away from the people.

189
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,760
He prefers the quiet.

190
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,439
So,

191
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,920
he has been living in seclusion.

192
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,799
Is Hero Miao home?

193
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,479
Please come in.

194
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,880
Let's go.

195
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,280
Sun Gangfeng, Brother Sun.

196
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,400
Why are you here?

197
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:39,760
Hero Miao.

198
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,439
Long time no see.

199
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,079
Your hand.

200
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,199
It's a long story.

201
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,000
Let me get down to business first.

202
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,319
I'm here on behalf of Zhao Banshan,
the Thousand Arms Buddha

203
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,479
of the Red Flower Club

204
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,760
to send you this letter.

205
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,640
(To Miao Renfeng)

206
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,120
The three red flowers mean
that something serious has happened.

207
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,439
The Red Flower Club won't simply
send this kind of a secret letter.

208
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,679
Something has happened
to Chief Chen.

209
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,319
I'll kill you if you take
another step forward.

210
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,400
Sun Gangfeng.

211
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,400
We've known each other for many years.

212
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,520
I treat you as a friend.

213
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,439
Why did you betray me?

214
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,839
What happened to him?

215
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,880
There's poison in the letter.

216
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,160
This is impossible.

217
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,400
Why would Third Master Zhao do this?

218
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,400
That's right.

219
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,959
This letter is given to us

220
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,280
personally by Third Uncle Zhao.

221
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,640
I understand now.

222
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,559
Our letter has been switched
to a fake one.

223
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,839
The dead are on the road.

224
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,360
The living should make way.

225
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,599
When Hades wants you dead,

226
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,839
you will not survive another day.

227
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,120
Miao Renfeng.

228
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,719
Time for you to die!

229
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,640
So, it's you.

230
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,199
Attack me if you want to seek revenge!

231
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,479
Don't hurt the others!

232
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,959
Old man.

233
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,319
You've overestimated yourself.

234
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,400
You are

235
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
not worth my brothers' time.

236
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:30,799
Move aside.

237
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,360
They are here for me.

238
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,599
You are indeed wise, Hero Miao.

239
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,439
You got that right.

240
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,679
We are here to kill you.

241
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,920
Are you the one
who poisoned the letter too?

242
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,719
That's right.

243
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,120
At first, I could continue
to let you doubt each other.

244
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,280
But we can't let others
take credits for the work

245
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,520
of the Three Heroes of Zhong.

246
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,439
Besides, it won't matter.

247
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:00,599
The three of us against one blind man

248
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,079
is more than enough.

249
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,640
Who sent you?

250
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:10,920
We are just paid to get rid
of someone's problem.

251
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,199
Miao Renfeng.

252
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,319
I've already written your name

253
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,920
on the death certificate.

254
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,240
After we kill you,

255
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,559
we'll burn it for you

256
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,719
on your grave.

257
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,439
Do it then.

258
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,360
This is my fault.

259
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,839
If you want to kill Hero Miao,

260
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,360
you'll have to go through me first!

261
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,160
Chief.

262
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,920
The Three Heroes of Zhong
have found Miao Renfeng.

263
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,360
Reward them.

264
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,320
Hide!

265
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,199
Good!

266
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,120
Hero Miao, you can't see.

267
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,679
Now, you don't have
to worry about an attack from behind.

268
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,360
If you trust me today,

269
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,479
I'll do my very best

270
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,959
to protect you and your daughter.

271
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,080
Young man.

272
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:57,679
You look familiar.

273
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,400
Have we met before?

274
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,199
We've never met before.

275
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
I'm just a stranger.

276
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,279
Good.

277
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,439
The outside of the house is on fire.

278
00:23:52,340 --> 00:24:02,600
(Memorial Tablet
of Sworn Brother Hu Yidao and His Wife)

279
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:49,719
Hero Miao.

280
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,759
Do you have any other medicines
in your house?

281
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,999
Even if it can't cure you at once,

282
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,439
it can at least slow down the poison.

283
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,479
It's pointless.

284
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,039
Since this is a planned attack,

285
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:03,920
they won't use a poison
that can easily be cured.

286
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,759
Hero Miao.

287
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,840
I had made such a lowly mistake.

288
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:15,640
I was used against you.

289
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:17,880
And I had let Third Master Zhao down.

290
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,959
I'll give you my eyes as an apology.

291
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,120
Brother Sun.

292
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,360
This is not your fault.

293
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,439
You and Zhao Banshan
are both my friends.

294
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,800
I trust both of you.

295
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,039
This is just an accident.

296
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,160
Yes, Senior Sun.

297
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,880
The most important thing now

298
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,360
is to cure Hero Miao's eyes.

299
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,080
We can talk about
the other things later.

300
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,679
If we want to cure Hero Miao's eyes,

301
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:51,479
only the King of Poison from
the Medicine King Valley can help us.

302
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,199
I'll beg for his help.

303
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,199
I will do my best

304
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,679
even if I die for it.

305
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,199
The King of Poison?

306
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,959
This person is an expert in poisons.

307
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,719
And he knows how to neutralise
various poisons.

308
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,800
I heard that he's living
in Dongting Lake.

309
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,400
He leads a secluded life.

310
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,360
He has little contact with anyone.

311
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,120
No one has ever seen his face before.

312
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,080
Senior Sun,

313
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,880
your hand will only slow you down.

314
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,120
You should stay here to take care
of Hero Miao and the kid.

315
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,239
I'll look for this King of Poison.

316
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,360
Brother Hu, I want to go with you too.

317
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,479
Hero Miao, don't worry.

318
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,759
I'll find the King of Poison

319
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,800
to treat your eyes.

320
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,719
Have you seen the King of Poison before?

321
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,199
I...

322
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,840
I'm sure I can find him
if I search through

323
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,959
the whole town.

324
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,080
Young man.

325
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,279
Actually, five years ago,

326
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,759
I've seen this King of Poison before.

327
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:53,719
The King of Poison
is strange and unpredictable.

328
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,679
And we stay out of each other's way.

329
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,800
Even if you can find him,

330
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,279
it doesn't mean that he'll help.

331
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:02,959
You don't have to look for him.

332
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Hero Miao.

333
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:06,279
Don't worry.

334
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,920
I think he'll be willing to help you

335
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,759
just for your name alone.

336
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,759
Besides, Brother Hu and I

337
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,039
will be able to convince him to help.

338
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,519
Don't worry.

339
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:17,800
Hero Miao.

340
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,199
What does the King of Poison look like?

341
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,560
I don't remember.

342
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,239
Okay.

343
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,160
I'll find a way to find him.

344
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,759
Senior Sun,

345
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,519
one of the attackers got away.

346
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,880
If he attacks again with
more experienced fighters with him,

347
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,959
you won't be able to fight against them.

348
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,080
You better find a place to hide first.

349
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,279
Brother Hu.

350
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,840
I'll leave it to you then.

351
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,120
Senior.

352
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,999
What did you find?

353
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,519
We didn't find anything

354
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,479
in Miao Renfeng's house.

355
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,239
But on our way back,

356
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,039
we saw someone suspicious.

357
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:24,679
Bring me there.

358
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:25,320
Okay.

359
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:35,519
Brother Zhong.

360
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,080
Brother Zhong.

361
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,640
Is Miao Renfeng still alive?

362
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,439
Yes.

363
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,320
Brother Zhong.

364
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,840
This must be the White Mane Temple Town.

365
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,279
We'll reach
the King of Poison Manor soon.

366
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,600
My father told me

367
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,199
that the King of Poison

368
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:25,279
is a woman.

369
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
He says that she's very ugly.

370
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,439
Like a demon.

371
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,320
You won't be able to forget her face

372
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,959
after you see it.

373
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
But some say

374
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:36,560
that he's a burly man.

375
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,400
Or he can be an old man.

376
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,560
I think

377
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,640
this King of Poison

378
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,840
must be a master of disguise.

379
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,160
I don't care who he is.

380
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
As long as he's a human.

381
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,519
Miao Renfeng is still alive?

382
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:09,360
Yes.

383
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:10,679
Brother Zhong said it himself.

384
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,239
A bunch of useless men!

385
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,560
You can't kill Miao Renfeng.

386
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,800
And you can't even find a kid!

387
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,239
He was helped by someone.

388
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,239
Brother Zhong said that he's blind now.

389
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:21,199
He's blind now.

390
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,479
A blind person.

391
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,479
What can a blind person do
even if he has a helper?

392
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,360
Gather our men.

393
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,160
I want Miao Renfeng killed!

394
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,920
Roger that.

Wait for me here.

00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:59,439
I'll go in for a while.

I'm here.

403
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,360
Come.

404
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,920
Why are you looking for me?

405
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,080
Are you the owner here?

406
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,959
Since we are doing business,

407
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:45,239
we need to be formal.

408
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,840
Shopkeeper.

409
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,120
Go out and talk.

410
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,519
Go out and talk from there.

411
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,120
Go.

412
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,840
Tell me.

413
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,360
Why are you looking for me?

Shopkeeper.

415
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,880
I'm going to meet the King of Poison
at the King of Poison Manor.

416
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,719
Can I keep my sword with you here?

417
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,560
I can pay for it. What say you?

418
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,400
Give me the money first.

419
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,800
One tael of silver.

420
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:16,880
I've seen many

421
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,039
who went to the King of Poison Manor.

422
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,400
But only a few came back.

423
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:21,999
Do you understand what I mean?

424
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:25,719
This is just an apothecary shop.

425
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,679
I have no use for a weapon.

426
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,120
This is not a weapon shop.

427
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,120
Shopkeeper.

428
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:44,320
Can you tell me

429
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,719
how to get to the King of Poison Manor?

430
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:49,479
It's not that I don't know.

431
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:51,880
But even if I know,

432
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,519
I don't dare to tell you.

433
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,519
If I offend the King of Poison,

434
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,279
I might

435
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,560
get killed.

436
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,320
Bye.

437
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,999
Are you mad?

438
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,920
This is a dangerous place.

439
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:16,600
And you left your weapon in there.

440
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,199
Won't it be more dangerous for us?

441
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,360
Now,

442
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,999
we can only show
that we are here with good intentions.

443
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,199
Just like what you said,

444
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,479
even if I bring my sword with me,

445
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:26,320
what good will it do?

446
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,880
Besides,

447
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,479
they are all living in the same town.

448
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,920
Maybe this shopkeeper

449
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:32,360
knows the King of Poison.

450
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,439
By keeping my sword here,

451
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,719
I can at least show that we have
no ill intentions towards him.

452
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,759
You need to remember this too.

453
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:39,840
Now that we are here,

454
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,239
we can't drink

455
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
or eat here.

456
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:43,999
No matter how hungry or thirsty we are.

457
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,600
How do you know everything?

458
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,360
My father told me about it.

459
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:49,999
Of course I have to tell you about it.

460
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:51,999
We can't touch anything

461
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,080
from here too.

462
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,120
Anything can be poisoned.

Hero Miao was blinded

464
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,719
because of a letter.

465
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:01,279
If we have to be so paranoid,

466
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,439
we should just go back.

467
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,880
We can't save Hero Miao like this.

468

00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,519
my friend's eyes.

507
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,920
I want to find the King of Poison

508
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,119
to ask for a cure from him.

509
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,119
Do you know him?

510
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,400
I only know his name.
But I've never seen him before.

511
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:25,959
How do you know

512
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,159
that he'll give you the cure?

513
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,479
I want to try.

514
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,039
Please help us.

515
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:46,320
Go over there

516
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,519
and bring me a bucket of excreta.

517
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:18,800
Young lady.

518
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,200
What else do you need me to do?

519
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,360
Go there and get me a bucket of water.

520
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,079
Mix one bucket of water with half
a bucket of excreta to water the plants.

521
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,039
Understand?

522
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,880
Not only she refuses to point the way,

523
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
she's being so rude to you.

524
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:42,959
The people here

525
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,360
are all abnormal.

526
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,039
I don't know why.

527
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,760
But I feel like this lady

528
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,840
knows something.

529
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,840
Let's just do as she says for now.

530
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,159
Be careful.

531
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,720
Make sure not to wet
the petals and leaves with the excreta.

532
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,519
Okay.

533
