3
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,719
Hold your breath at the dantian.

4
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,719
Steady your lower body.

5
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Put strength into your arms.

6
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,560
Hero Miao.

7
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,079
Ruolan is awake.

8
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,600
You must be starving.

9
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,679
I'll get the food ready.

10
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,880
Xiaomei!

11
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,399
We can't let the baby starve.

12
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:25,000
Brother Hu, we should part here.

13
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,320
I thought we were
both going to the capital.

14
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,959
I'm going to learn the origin

15
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,880
of the unknown poisons.

16
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,839
It has nothing to do with you.

17
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,440
I'd only slow you down if I went.

18
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,760
What gave you that thought?

19
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,559
After I went to
the Medicine King Valley,

20
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:42,720
I only made it out alive
because of your help

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,079
every time.

22
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,359
You almost died at the hands of villains

23
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:47,920
when you tried to cure Hero Miao's eyes.

24
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,359
I have no idea

25
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,480
if I'll ever be able
to repay your kindness.

26
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:54,000
I merely offered some help, that's all.

27
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,959
Brother Hu, until we meet again.

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,119
Young Lady Ling.

29
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,119
It's a long way to the capital.

30
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,519
I cannot let an unarmed girl

31
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,559
travel alone.

32
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,399
You know what I am capable of.

33
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,079
I'll do fine on my own.

34
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,239
But...

35
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,280
Yes.

36
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,040
You are right.

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,720
Without you,

38
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,079
I'd be dead by now.

39
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,799
Tian Guinong and his goons

40
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:24,799
would have taken my life.

41
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,959
The road to the capital
could be a perilous one.

42
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,559
I hope you can come along

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,839
and save me when I need saving.

44
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,880
Is that what you think?

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,799
Of course.

46
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:39,839
Even the most powerful warrior out there

47
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,760
can't attack without leaving a trace.

48
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,239
But when you use poisons,

49
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,639
no one can even notice it.

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,839
Everyone says Hero Miao
has beaten every warrior in the world.

51
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,320
With you by my side,

52
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll have nothing to fear in this world.

53
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:56,040
Whatever.

54
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,959
Since you think so highly of me,

55
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,720
how can I say no to your offer?

56
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,040
I need to set some rules.

57
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:09,440
I can go to the capital with you,

58
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,519
but you must do as I say.

59
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes.

60
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,439
Uncle Sun?

61
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,920
Are you upset?

62
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,319
Do you not like the food I prepared?

63
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:42,759
Your food is bland.

64
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,480
You don't train hard enough.

65
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,319
Uncle Sun.

66
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,040
I'll be honest with you.

67
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,239
Hero Miao's martial art
techniques are remarkable,

68
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,559
but they are not meant for me.

69
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,359
Such a bold claim.

70
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,439
Uncle Sun,

71
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,799
who do you think is stronger, Hero Miao

72
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,759
or Sister Cheng?

73
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,799
Hero Miao has beaten countless warriors.

74
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,040
How can Cheng Lingsu best him?

75
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,439
Tell me,

76
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
do you think Hero Miao is strong

77
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,999
because he defeated

78
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:13,400
those villains so easily?

79
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,799
Of course.

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,920
What Hero Miao can do,

81
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,400
Sister Cheng can do just as well.

82
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:21,280
And she doesn't even
need to throw a punch.

83
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:24,520
Whether it's a legendary hero
or a nameless thief,

84
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
no one can withstand

85
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,879
Sister Cheng's poisons.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,960
You...

87
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,199
Hero Miao is powerful,

88
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,600
but weapons

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,319
are meant for men.

90
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,600
I think girls should follow
in Sister Cheng's footsteps.

91
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,400
We should take down
the enemies in silence.

92
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,119
We won't even break a sweat!

93
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,400
A bunch of nonsense!

it's getting dark.

Let's get some food from a tavern

and take a break.

Yes.

This is him.

Excuse me, are you Master Hu Fei?

Yes, I am.

Who might you be?

104
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,679
My surname is Zhang.

105
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,879
You may call me Manager Zhang.

106
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,439
My master has long
admired you for your feats.

107
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,280
I was ordered to welcome you.

108
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,080
Your master?

109
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,359
Who is that?

110
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,920
My master ordered me

111
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,840
to serve you with
the utmost hospitality.

112
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,799
As for his identity,

113
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,119
you will know when you meet him.

114
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,520
Take good care of Master Hu

115

and the lady's horses.

116

-Yes.
-Yes.

117
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,999
It's been an exhausting
trip for both of you.

118
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,400
You must be tired.

119
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,439
I ordered food and
tea at the restaurant.

120
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,920
Please come with me.

Young Lady Ling.

122
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,119
I have no idea

123
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,799
what is going on here.

124
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,960
Why not check it out?

125
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,239
Perhaps

126
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,720
this is your chance

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,799
to give away the comb.

128
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,359

129
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:16,679
This way.

130
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,679
Serve the tea.

131
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:38,879
Please enjoy the tea.

132
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,999
I'll get you some snacks.

133
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,879
I appreciate the hospitality.

134
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,759
Why not sit down and join us?

135
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,040
I was ordered not to leave you slighted.

Master Hu, take a break.

137

I'll be right back.

138
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:00,920
If he knew martial art,

139
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,199
he would have fought back.

140
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,439
It seems

141
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,480
he really is just a manager.

142
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,239
It's hard to say no
to the warm welcome.

143
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,520
We can have the food

144
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,600

Your Master booked this place for us?

149
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:09,360
He knew you'd traveled a long way.

150
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
I was ordered to prepare this room

151
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,120
for your respite.

152
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,880
Master Hu, I shall take my leave now.

You're a prestigious guest here.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,920
Perhaps I should start
addressing you as Master Hu.

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,920
Young Lady Ling, stop teasing me.

That aside,

Young Lady Yuan

159
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,839
is very thoughtful.

160
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:38,679
I thought it was her,

161
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,160
but I now think
it could be someone else.

162
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,559
How so?

163
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:45,559
Ziyi is not one to be
particular with grandeur.

164
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,160
She wouldn't spend so
much money on these.

who could it be?

00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:54,520
I'm not sure.

168
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,040
But since that person
is not showing hostility,

169
00:09:58,439 --> 00:09:59,640
we might as well rest here.

170
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,760
Maybe we'll get to meet the master soon.

171
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,640
Master Hu, the bath water is ready.

172
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,920
It's been a long trip.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,319
You should take a bath and get changed.

174
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:38,199
This pond is not as big as a bathhouse.

175
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,439
Brother Hu.

176
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,640
This is a hot spring,
not a bathhouse.

177
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,679
Clear your mind, enjoy it.

178
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,880
You are very knowledgeable.

179
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:51,040
But still, what person
would spend so much

180
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,240
to pamper us as if
we're prestigious guests?

181
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,439
Perhaps an official you rescued

182
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,319
on your journey

183
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:00,280
is repaying the kindness.

184
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,719
Give me a break, Young Lady Ling.

185
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:07,079
I've been alone
since I was 13 years old.

186
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,479
What officials could I possibly meet?

187
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,079
However,

188
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,319
I do know a villain
who sits on his wealth

189
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:15,360
while committing evils.

190
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:18,360
He is my sworn enemy.

191
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,040
He would hate me to the bone,

192
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,439
much less show me any hospitality.

193
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,479
Brother Hu,

194
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,599
every time you mention that villain,

195
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,719
it is as though you want him dead.

196
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,000
Just how big of a villain is he?

197
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,079
His name is Feng Tiannan.

198
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,640
He killed the entire Zhong Family

199
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,040
over a small plantation.

200
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,760
Don't you think

201
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:42,959
he deserves to die?

202
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:45,319
I had my chance.

203
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,719
With one more strike,

204
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,199
I could have avenged the Zhong Family.

205
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:51,640
But Ziyi...

206
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:58,439
I have no idea why she stopped me.

207
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,240
What do you want?

208
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,400
My lord.

209
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,040
Stay away!

210
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
We'll help you get changed.

211
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,319
Stay away!
I can do it myself!

212
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,479
My lord!

213
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,240
I can do it myself!

214
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:30,360
I can do it myself!

215
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,079
Stay away!

216
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,079
Don't touch me!

217
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,559
I can do it myself!

218
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:33,959
My lord.

219
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:34,719
Stop!

220
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,280
You've slighted me!

221
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,760
You've slighted me!

222
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,120
Put the clothes on the table.

223
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,360
Get out.

224
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:42,839
Young Lady Ling,

225
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,199
why do you dress like a bride?

226
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,839
Look at yourself.

227
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,360
You look like a groom.

228
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,520
Seriously?

229
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,760
I thought it felt strange.

230
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,280
I like my old style better.

231
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,760
Those servants

232
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,160
called me "my lord."

233
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,120
What was that all about?

234
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,839
Let's ask Manager Zhang.

235
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,839
Sure,

236
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:07,479
Bride.

237
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,719
Master.

238
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:19,920
Is everything set?

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,640
Yes.

240
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,240
Dismissed.

241
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,160
Get the dinner ready.

242
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,240
Yes.

243
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,439
Master Hu.

244
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Perfect timing.

245
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:35,719
I was just going to

246
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:36,719
send you these.

247
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,319
"A gift for Master Hu."

248
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,079
These are for me?

249
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,280
Yes.

250
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,079
415.7 mu of fine paddy fields,

251
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,599
a mansion,

252
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,679
and a total of 121 servants.

253
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,760
Hold on.

254
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,760
Everything you just said

255
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,079
are inside this ledger?

256
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes.

257
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,599
The location of the paddy field,

258
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,040
the size of the mansion,

259
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,880
and the list of names for the servants.

260
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,479
Daily necessities such as money,
carriage, and fabrics

261
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,160
are all inside this ledger.

262
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,599
My master said

263
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,000
he was in a hurry
and couldn't make it here.

264
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,240
He hopes you wouldn't mind.

265
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:18,319
Why would I need all of these?

266
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,160
Brother Hu.

267
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,640
Congratulations!

268
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,199
Hold on.

269
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,079
I'm getting light-headed here.

270
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,599
If your master is so generous,

271
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:27,679
why won't he show himself?

272
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,000
As per his order,

273
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:33,679
when the time is right,
you will meet him.

274
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:36,719
Please,

275
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,079
enjoy dinner.

276
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,679
The Commander
visited me just as many times

277
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:58,559
as he visited Madam Hailan.

278
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,599
How did I get pregnant so soon?

279
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,319
It's only been three months,

280
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,760
but the imperial physician forbids me

281
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,640
from doing anything.

282
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,719
This is so exhausting.

283
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:10,160
Don't say that.

284
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:11,959
This is a blessing.

285
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,839
Only the blessed can have it.

286
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Some time later,

287
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,199
the baby will come along.

288
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,079
A great blessing awaits you.

289
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,319
Does it matter?

290
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,160
With Madam Hailan's envy,

291
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,040
this blessing

292
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,439
might as well bring me trouble.

293
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:28,920
Madam Hailan has been married for years,

294
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,640
but she still hasn't gotten pregnant.

295
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,360
We don't know
if she can stay as a consort yet.

296
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,760
So, focus on taking care of yourself.

297
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
When the baby is here,

298
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,799
you might just get more attention.

299
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,319
Your fancy words convinced me.

300
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,360
I'm a little thirsty.

301
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,400
Bring me some ginseng tea.

302
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,039
Official Fu.

303
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,080
How is the baby?

304
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,479
My deepest apologies, Official Fu.

305
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:35,920
I've failed you.

306
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,920
How could you let this happen?

307
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,479
Official Fu,

308
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,800
this isn't my doing.

309
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,120
Consort, bad news.

310
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,439
The Commander knows about the baby!

311
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,519
He's headed this way as we speak.

312
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,759
Calm down.

313
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,640
Commander.

314
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:07,080
Scram!

315
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,800
You seem furious.

316
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,360
Did someone upset you?

317
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,759
Was this your doing?

318
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,239
What do you mean?

319
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,120
What have I done?

320
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:31,239
Your acting won't be enough

321
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:32,199
to fool me.

322
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,920
You couldn't get pregnant,

323
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,999
but you wouldn't let
another bear a child.

324
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:43,160
Do you really wish to end

325
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,600
my royal bloodline?

326
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Do not simply accuse me, Commander.

327
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,320
I'm incapable of such scheming.

328
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:53,560
I know.

329
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,959
You begrudge me for giving you a child.

330
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:58,999
But what about you?

331
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,759
You barely visited me
throughout the year!

332
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,320
How can I bear a child without you?

333
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,920
Do you not remember

334
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,600
what you've done over the years?

335
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,239
The vilest is the woman's heart.

336
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,199
Sooner or later...

337
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,360
Sooner or later...

338
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,080
Fu Kang'an!

339
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,160
The Hailan Family

340
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,679
has status and power in the capital.

341
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,519
If you ever try to hurt me,

342
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,279
Mother will have your head for it!

343
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,479
What's the fuss about?

344
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,560
I could hear you from outside the yard.

345
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,679
You came at the right time, Sister-in-law.

346
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Be the judge for us.

347
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,039
He just lost his child

348
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:45,759
and is now grieving.

349
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,360
Be more considerate.

350
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,479
Every human being feels sadness.

351
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Kang'an, you're in the wrong too.

352
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,959
Taking your anger out on your wife

353
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,120
won't bring the child back.

354
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,360
This is no one's fault.

355
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,360
She was not meant to have the child.

356
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,800
Come with me.
You need to cool your head.

357
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,160
Come on.

358
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,120
Kang'an.

359
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,479
You know this isn't Madam Hailan's fault.

360
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,679
Your concubine came from the troupe.

361
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:41,039
She's always lacked manners.

362
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:42,999
You know

363
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,920
you're the only person who likes her

364
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,120
in this place.

365
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Mother has urged me
to get a child to be my heir.

366
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,039
When I finally had one,

367
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,640
that cursed woman
from the Hailan Family...

368
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,679
We must talk to Mother
regarding this matter.

369
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,439
I'll persuade her.

370
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,160
You have my thanks, Sister-in-law.

371
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,679
Hand these drawings to them.

372
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,120
Make sure they recognize Master Hu.

373
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:37,880
We can't afford any mistakes.

374
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:38,840
Yes.

375
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,519
Brother Hu?

376
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,479
Young Lady Ling.

377
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:06,999
Are you scouting the villa too?

378
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,239
I think Manager Zhang is working

379
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,279
with the people here.

380
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
He will make a mistake,

381
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,160
so I came at night
to check things out.

382
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,160
We had the same plan.

383
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,880
But I also saw pictures of me

384
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,840
in the treasury.

385
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,439
Something must be amiss.

386
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,360
Let's see if we can learn more.

387
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,360
Certainly.

388
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,600
I was hoping

389
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,400
to find some clues or traces.

390
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,120
But it seems

391
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,800
pictures of my profile are the only

392
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,600
strange things in the villa.

393
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,279
Young Lady Ling.

394
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,959
We should leave tomorrow.

395
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:41,160
Yes.

396
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,080
You will never know peace

397
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,600
until that cursed villain is eliminated.

398
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,800
When Zhong Asi and
his family were killed,

399
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,880
I swore

400
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,679
I would avenge them.

401
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,239
A man of his word

402
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,600
must fulfill his promise.

403
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,400
Brother Hu.

404
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,999
You only told me

405
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:00,640
how Feng Tiannan
killed the Zhong Family.

406
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,679
You haven't told me

407
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,920
how you banished him from Foshan.

408
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:06,039
How?

409
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,800
It's a long

410
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,600
and complicated story.

411
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,120
My guess is that Young Lady Yuan

412
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,759
helped you in the fight
against Feng Tiannan.

413
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,360
She helped you

414
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,039
but stopped you from killing him.

415
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:21,880
That is why you're so frustrated.

416
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,279
Yes.

417
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,920
So this is why you dwell on it.

418
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,640
You two went through
life and death together.

419
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,719
What was that?

420
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,920
Brother Hu, don't you think

421
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,959
Young Lady Yuan had a very good reason

422
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,400
to stop you from killing Feng Tiannan?

423
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,600
A good reason?

424
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,959
Do you regret it?

425
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,600
Regret what?

426
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,719
I bet Young Lady Yuan
is a beautiful woman.

427
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,279
Young Lady Ling.

428
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:23,279
Are you not feeling well?

429
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:24,640
No.

430
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,920
I'm a little light-headed
from sitting so high up.

431
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,039
I see.

432
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:30,600
Let's go to the town.

433
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,560
Do you feel better now?

434
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,120
Much better now.

435
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,479
The folks eat and drink during the day.

436
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:45,999
But at night,

437
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
all the shops are closed.

438
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:50,479
Only then can these stalls
make a few more coins.

439
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:52,959
Indeed.

440
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,600
There are too many who are impoverished.

441
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,560
Young Lady Ling.

442
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,840
Let me buy you some snacks.

443
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:07,199
Sir,

444
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,519
two bowls of stinky tofu.

445
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,999
Sure.

446
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:13,679
Stinky tofu?

447
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:14,880
This must be new to you.

448
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,360
You should try it out.

449
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,640
Here's the food.

450
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,719
Enjoy.

451
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,120
Sir, here's the money.

452
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,400
Thanks.

453
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,800
Brother Hu, what is this?

454
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,439
This is stinky tofu.

455
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,080
I know it smells,

456
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,360
but it tastes great.

457
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:39,999
Here, try it out.

458
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,800
Do you like it?

459
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,999
Not bad.

460
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:54,880
Really?

461
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,679
Ziyi liked it too.

462
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:57,880
Eat up.

463
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,400
Young Lady Ling.

464
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:37,039
This is where I see you off.

465
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:52,279
Young Lady Ling, what's wrong?

466
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
I'm fine.

467
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,920
Are you not feeling well?

468
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,360
I ate a little too much just now.

469
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,080
A pill should do the trick.

470
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,880
I'll be fine.

471
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:09,360
This is on me.

472
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:11,840
I shouldn't have
let you try the snack.

473
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,640
Master told me

474
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,800
to have a simple and plain diet.

475
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,640
I've just left the Medicine King Valley.

476
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,039
I need more time to adapt.

477
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,519
And it's still my fault.

478
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:25,239
Punish me if you want.

479
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,679
That will make me feel less guilty.

480
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:34,560
Will you do anything I say?

481
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,080
Sure.

482
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:38,840
I promised I'd do one thing you asked.

483
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,959
I'll do anything you ask.

484
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,640
Alright.

485
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,679
Hand me the comb.

486
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,120
Sure.

487
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:28,160
Young Lady Ling,

488
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,640
what are you doing?

489
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,239
I want to break it.

490
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,840
It's just a comb.

491
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,679
Why?

492
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
From now on,

493
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,400
don't simply promise anyone anything.

494
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,840
Many things

495
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,880
are easier said

496
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,719
than done.

497
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:12,279
Young Lady Ling.

498
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,479
After fate brought us together,

499
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,560
I've always remembered

500
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,479
everything you've done for me.

501
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,400
I do

502
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,600
have a wish.

503
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:30,759
I wonder if you'd agree with it?

504
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,880
I wonder if I even have the honor.

505
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,199
What are you trying to say?

506
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:56,320
Be my sworn sister,

507
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:57,840
will you?

508
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:11,759

00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,639
None of them would agree

676
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,079
to be a secondary wife.

677
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,320
You need to look harder.

678
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,360
Kang is a high-ranking officer.

679
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:25,320
His two older brothers
serve the Imperial Court.

680
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,519
And you, his sister-in-law, are a princess.

681
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:31,039
It's the utmost honor and blessing

682
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,639
to be married to him.

683
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,320
Mother.

684
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,360
Enough.

685
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:37,880
That's enough.

686
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,200
You may go now.

687
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,159
I need some rest.

688
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,200
Official Shang, this way.

689
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:06,800
Housekeeper Li.

690
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:08,800
Official Shang!

691
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:11,559
What's the occasion today?

692
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,039
It's been too long.

693
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,439
You still look sharp as ever.

694
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,400
Thank you.

695
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,519
I have a gift for you.

696
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,920
This is unnecessary.

697
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,800
Do you need something done?

698
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,079
Relay a message for me.

699
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,200
Send my regards to Official Fu.

700
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:27,680
Sure.

701
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,639
Take a seat.

702
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,800
I'll deliver the message.
