3
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,690
Step aside!

4
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,930
Renfeng.

5
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,370
What you see

6
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,100
isn't what you think it is.

7
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,770
I can explain it...

8
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,620
Leader Tian.

9
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,660
Go away!

10
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,890
Alright.

11
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,460
To die by the world's
best swordmaster's hand,

12
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,690
I, Tian Guinong,

13
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,300
have no regrets.

14
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,370
Come on!

15
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,540
Stop!

16
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,540
This is between me and him.

17
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,690
It's between you and me.

18
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,940
Let me finish what I have to say.

19
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,490
Then you can do as you wish.

20
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,060
We really thought
you had died in Miaojiang.

21
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,610
Otherwise...

22
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,420
You shut up.

23
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,730
Miao Renfeng.

24
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,780
Be honest.

25
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,330
Did you ever really love me?

26
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,860
Have you ever cared about me?

27
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,500
If I were the sword in your hand,

28
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,780
I'd at least get
more attention from you.

29
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,300
But you only cared about
the martial world and your friends,

30
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,610
and the promise you made
to Hu Yidao and his wife.

31
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,220
I'm a woman.

32
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,730
I only wished for you to be with me.

33
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,140
So I wouldn't have to always worry.

34
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,780
So I wouldn't have
to watch the empty house.

35
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,970
I'm grateful to you
for saving my life back then.

36
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,420
I once thought

37
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,860
I'd grow old with you.

38
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,420
Later I realized

39
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,610
you didn't need a wife or family.

40
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,020
You're living in your own world,

41
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,100
doing as you please.

42
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,860
You're not willing to change for me.

43
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,380
It's the same when Ruolan came along.

44
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,100
If so,

45
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,490
then why keep me by your side?

46
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,610
Is this how you see me?

47
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,330
How else am I supposed to see you?

48
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,380
Even when Ruolan got a fever today,

49
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,770
you weren't there.

50
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,260
I've finished what I wanted to say.

51
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,930
Go on then.

52
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,540
I will never give up the promise

53
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,490
I made to Hu Yidao.

54
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,100
If you're willing to stay,

55
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,650
I will protect you forever.

56
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,380
Let us go home.

57
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,490

96
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,770
it has to be kept
in this cold jade container.

97
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,620
Otherwise, the efficacy

98

will dissipate within three days.

99
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,180
Supposedly, the old sage

100
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,140
tried to use other jade containers.

101
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,290
But none worked.

102
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,180
This jade box is bone-chilling cold.

103
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,580
How mysterious.

104
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,770
It is said that this cold jade container

105
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,580
and the Epiphyllum Dew Cream

106
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,580
were given to Master Wuxiang
by the manifestation

107
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,850
of Buddha himself

108
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,850
the day he founded the Sect.

109
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,140
Vedo Bodhisattva has already attained
his divination then.

110
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,620
Meaning to say this jade box

111
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,330
isn't from the human world.

112
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,290
Lady Yuan.

113
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,410
You are now Weituo's leader.

114
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,650
This jade box

115
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,210
will be yours to keep and use.

116
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,940
Now,

117
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,260
I will teach you how to operate it.

118
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,530
Weituo Sect's mechanism code

119
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,530
is Guanyin?

120
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,500
Don't you see the connection?

121
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,700
Do you mean

122
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,090
the legend that Guanyin
and Vedo Bodhisattva

123
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,330
were husband and wife?

124
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,220
Senior.

125
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,770
Will he soon recover after putting on

126
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,290
the Epiphyllum Dew Cream?

127
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,290
Change the dressing once a day.

128
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,140
Do it continuously for seven days.

129
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,290
The bone injury will heal.

130
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,140
Next, apply the Epiphyllum dew

131
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,690
to repair the damaged meridian.

132
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,220
Epiphyllum Dew?

133
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,690
To be more specific,

134
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,570
I'm now using
the Epiphyllum Dew Cream on him.

135
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,100
Its job is to heal the broken bones.

136
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,140
You are a martial arts practitioner.

137
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,220
You should know

138
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,100
that once the meridian is damaged,

139
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,140
your skills can no longer improve.

140
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,980
The magical effect
of Epiphyllum Dew Cream

141
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,620
is its ability to repair
damaged meridians.

142
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,620
Thus, you need to gather
fresh Epiphyllum dew

143
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,050
and mix it together with the dream.

144
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,500
But I heard

145
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,170
that the Epiphyllum is very scarce.

146
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,340
Don't you worry.

147
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,050
Weituo built its own garden,

148
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,340
specifically to plant Epiphyllum.

149
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,170
Once Young Hero Hu's injuries heal,

150
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,620
I'll get someone

151
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,620
to collect the Epiphyllum dew.

152
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,410
Thank you, Senior.

153
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,690
The young man's fever has gone down.

154
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,770
Just get plenty of rest.

155
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,020
I can assure you

156
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,140
that you'll have him back all sprightly.

157
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,410
Senior...

158
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,890
Servant.

159
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,050
Get Madam...

160
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,290
Get Lan some water.

161
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Be good. Don't cry.

162
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,770
Take a seat, Lan.

163
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,620
Be good, Ruolan.

164
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,810

00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,930
Miao Renfeng.

170
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,170
Come at me if you're frustrated.

171
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,620
Come at me!

172
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,770
Don't take it out on them.

173
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,100
Don't make things hard for Nan Lan.

174
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,770
It's me you're after.

175
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,530
What do you want?

176
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,530
I won't hurt you.

177
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,460
Nor will I bother you again.

178
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,570
Sorry.

179
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,650
Her name is Miao Ruolan.

180
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,860
Ruolan.

181
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,930
Ruolan!

182
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,570
Ruolan!

183
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,690
Ruolan!

184
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,810
Let me go!

185
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,980
Miao Renfeng, give me back Ruolan!

186
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,140
Ruolan!

187
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,860
Let me go!

188
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,290
Ruolan!

189
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,020
Ruolan!

190
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,530
Ruolan!

191
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,220
Ruolan!

192
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,620
You're awake.

193
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,220
How are you? Does it still hurt?

194
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,810
Why didn't you wake me?

195
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,380
You were smiling so sweetly.

196
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,410
It must have been a good dream.

197
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,650
I couldn't bear to wake you up.

198
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,650
So annoying.

199
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,810
Why am I annoying?

200
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,020
I didn't do anything.

201
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,810
I just watched you.

202
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,260
I didn't say you could.

203
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,380
Next time, without my permission,

204
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,220
you're not allowed to look at me.

205
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,770
Oh dear, that's not good.

206
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,890
Because the moment I open my eyes,

207
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,500
I see only you.

208
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,570
So cheeky.

209
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,980
Listen up.

210
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,140
If not for Weituo Sect,

211
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,050
your leg would've never healed.

212
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,620
Make sure you thank them properly.

213
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,020
Of course.

214
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,020
I know the importance of gratitude.

215
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,810
What's so funny?

216
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,530
Now, when you're asleep,

217
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,930
you're so docile.

218
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,860
Like a lazy cat sunbathing.

219
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,770
Why did you suddenly

220
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,860
become a little tiger after waking up?

221
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,020
Who's a little tiger?

222
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,460
How rude. You called me a little tiger.

223
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,620
Look.

224
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,650
You're just like a little tiger.

225
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,220
Hey...

226
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,740
I... I just dropped by.

227
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,810
You two chat.

228
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,100
I'm going to check the kitchen

229
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,260
to see if there's food.

230
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,980
Senior.

231
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,980
I'll go to the kitchen.

232
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,570
Please check on him.

233
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,860
Lad, let's see how you're doing.

234
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,260
Let me see.

235
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:03,810
Chief Yuan.

236
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,740
What would Young Hero Hu like to eat?

237
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,020
I'll get it prepared right away.

238
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,050
That's alright.

239
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,770
He just woke up.

240
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,290
He hasn't eaten in a while.

241
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,410
I'll make some porridge for him.

242
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,500
Okay.

243
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,980
You're recovering well, lad.

244
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,740
Make sure you eat.

245
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,020
It will help you heal.

246
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,650
My leg.

247
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,810
Thank you for saving it.

248
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,570
I'm grateful.

249
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,620
Thank me?

250
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,410
You should thank the chief.

251
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,340
I only did

252
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,100
the task given to me by the chief.

253
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,220
When I can walk,

254
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,940
I'll thank the chief myself.

255
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,700
Seems like you really don't know.

256
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,660
You mean,

257
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,290
Ziyi

258
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,420
beat everyone
to become Weituo Sect's leader?

259
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,290
That's right.

260
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,530
She and I fought for numerous rounds.

261
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,530
She even beat you?

262
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,660
Indeed.

263
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,610
The lady is something
to be reckoned with.

264
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,770
Her leg is injured.

265
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,940
Without it,

266
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,330
I wouldn't have lasted

267
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,370
more than a few rounds.

268
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,500
Injured?

269
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,850
Where?

270
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,330
You have some conscience at least.

271
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,290
You know to be concerned
about Lady Yuan.

272
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,090
Lady Yuan carried you here.

273
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,130
Her knees are pretty knackered.

274
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,260
Carried me?

275
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,570
Where is this?

276
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:57,900
Weituo Sect.

277
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,570
Where is Weituo Sect?

278
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,740
Hunan.

279
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,330
Not just Hunan.

280
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,740
Weituo Sect is built on Weituo Mountain.

281
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,810
From the base to the entrance,

282
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,700
there are 9999 steps.

283
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,850
To save you, Lady Yuan carried you

284
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,940
up here one step at a time.

285
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,330
Lady Yuan worried
your leg would get worse.

286
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,500
So she didn't carry you normally

287
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,220
or used too much Acrobatic Jumping.

288
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,220
She knelt and crawled up here.

289
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,420
I'm talking about 9999 steps.

290
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,330
Who knows what deeds
you contributed in your past life

291
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,660
that Lady Yuan

292
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,700
would sacrifice so much for you.

293
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,770
It's a long way

294
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,180
from Foshan.

295
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,500
The young lady

296
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,940
went through so much for you.

297
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,370
Hopefully you know

298
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,180
what to do in the future.

299
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,810
Don't worry, Senior Liu.

300
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,260
I, Hu Fei, vow

301
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,660
to never let Ziyi down.

302
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,460
The porridge is ready.

303
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,980
You two chat. I'm off.

304
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,260
See you, Senior.

305
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:48,900
What are you looking at?

306
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,500
You haven't eaten in some days.

307
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,700
Eat the porridge while it's hot.

308
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,020
Ziyi.

309
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,900
Talk after you finish eating.

310
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,260
I want to tell you first.

311
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,900
You hurt your leg, not your hand, right?

312
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,050
Are you expecting me to feed you?

313
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
Alright, I'll eat first then tell you.

314
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:11,900
Careful, it's hot.

315
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,610
You should've blown on it first.

316
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:19,980
Forget it.

317
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,290
I'll feed you.

318
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,370
Is it good?

319
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,050
I don't think
it's your leg that's injured.

320
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,500
But your brain.

321
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,290
Upon a nice mid-spring day,

322
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,900
let's take a look at nature's way.

323
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,980
Breathe the scent of nice fresh air,

324
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,900
feel the breeze within your hair.

325
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,500
Your Majesty is a literary genius.

326
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,090
I'm humbled.

327
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,940
So humbled.

328
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,700
Your Majesty.

329
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,090
You're dismissed.

330
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:43,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

331
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

332
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,940
What's the update?

333
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,220
It's proceeding as
Your Majesty has suggested.

334
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,940
Once news of the World's
Sect Leaders Gathering got out,

335
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,020
the sects have begun to act.

336
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,810
Some sects

337
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,180
have separated into different factions

338
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,980
in order to improve their chances.

339
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,050
While others saw the rise of discord,

340
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,850
internal conflicts are erupting.

341
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,700
Not bad.

342
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,530
Anyway,

343
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,290
the lychees sent as tribute by Lingnan
are pretty good.

344
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,740
Take some of them back

345
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,050
and give them to your mother.

346
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,530
Thank you, Your Majesty.

347
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,590
(Tianlong)

348
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,850
Greetings, Leader Tian.

349
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,090
Have you found out?

350
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,570
The people at the capital have no idea.

351
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,130
And they dare not

352
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,740
ask Commander Fu about the matter.

353
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,610
From what I heard,

354
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,700
even the smaller Sects

355
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,090
that are farther away from the capital

356
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,180
have received invitations.

357
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,570
Then why

358
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,900
is it that Tianlong Sect
did not get one?

359
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,260
I heard

360
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,220
the Hu, Miao, Fan and Tian families

361
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,770
did not receive an invite either.

362
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,660
Could it be because

363
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,500
us four families once followed
the Dashing King, hence...

364
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,740
the imperial court is wary of us.

365
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,090
People in the capital
have similar thoughts.

366
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,050
Looks like,

367
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,700
that's the most probable reason.

368
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,260
I'd have to make a trip to the capital.

369
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,180
If the imperial court thinks that way,

370
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,660
I have to take the initiative

371
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,130
to resolve the misunderstanding.

372
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,370
After all, Tianlong Sect
is a big institution

373
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,810
and we have a lot of disciples.

374
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,900
Who knows one day

375
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,900
the imperial court
might become suspicious of us.

376
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,850
That would be problematic.

377
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Plus, if we could use this chance

378
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,850
to become acquainted with Commander Fu,

379
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,810
it could only be beneficial
to Tianlong Sect's

380
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,810
future development.

381
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,850
Your idea is sound.

382
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,980
Go and make preparations.

383
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,660
Bring gold, silver and gems.

384
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,700
Better to act sooner than later.

385
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,810
There's not much time left

386
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,020
until the Sect Leaders Gathering.

387
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,460
We have to make full use
of this opportunity.

388
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,290
I'll get to it right away.

389
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,130
Go on.

390
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,420
Thanks.

391
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,900
Thorowax 5 qian, crow-dipper 2 qian.

392
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,530
Thanks.

393
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,530
Such a good person.

394
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,660
Boil with three bowls of water.

395
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,570
Madam, there's a crowd.

396
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,850
You need not come personally.

397
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,130
I'm still worried.

398
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,530
Careful, Madam.

399
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,290
Madam is here.

400
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,220
Hello, Madam.

401
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,570
Thank you, Madam...

402
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,260
Thank you, Madam...

403
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,660
Thank you, Madam...

404
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,420
(Tianlong)
Hello, Madam.

405
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,330
(Tianlong)

406
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,740
(Tianlong)
Here's the prescription for the medicine.

407
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,370
Thank you, Madam.

408
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,810
Doctor, can you manage?

409
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,610
Yes. Take a seat.

410
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,330
Are you okay? Come, get up.

411
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,020
Where is the father of this child?

412
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,260
Madam, she's mine.

413
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,700
Madam, the girl's dirty.

414
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,770
Don't get soiled.

415
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,570
Why didn't you watch her?

416
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,900
Hurts.

417
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,500
Why is it swollen?

418
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,530
Doctor, the girl's arm is swollen.

419
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,770
Please take a look.

420
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,050
Okay.

421
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,460
Come.

422
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,770
Come here.

423
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,740
It hurts.

424
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,610
Don't be afraid.

425
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,980
Let the doctor take a look.

426
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,090
Madam.

427
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,330
The girl's injury is quite serious.

428
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
It's affected the bone.

429
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,570
Then treat it quickly.

430
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,980
We can't ignore a bone injury.

431
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,660
We don't have expensive medicine.

432
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,570
What about I write her a prescription

433
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,370
and she can get it outside? Is that...

434
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,260
Hong.

435
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,420
Here, take the money.

436
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,020
This...

437
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,090
Make sure you get her treated.

438
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,770
Come to me if you need more money.

439
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,020
Girl, kneel.

440
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,090
Kneel before our benefactor.

441
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,660
Thank you for your kindness, Madam.

442
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,220
Please get up.

443
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,900
Thanks, Madam.

444
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,900
It's distressing for a child
to be without their mother.

445
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,900
As the father,

446
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,740
you need to do the best you can.

447
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,530
Yes, Madam.

448
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,130
Madam, here's the prescription.

449
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,740
(Peeled white cardamom)
Take this.

450
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,690
(Three bowls of water
boiled down to one)

451
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,570
Good girl.

452
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,530
Make sure you be good

453
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,130
and listen to your father.

454
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,370
Thank you for your kindness.

455
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,610
Go on.

456
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,260
A kind soul.

457
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,770
Thanks, Madam.

458
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,090
Madam, are you all right?

459
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,130
(Tianlong Sect)
Let me take you back to rest.

460
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,660
Nan Lan.

461
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,460
Nan Lan, what's wrong?

462
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,900
Madam is a bit dizzy.

463
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:29,700
Come.

464
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,200
(Tianlong Sect)

465
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,020
Guinong, I'm really fine.

466
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,500
Hush.

467
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,220
Put me down.

468
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,180
Hush.

469
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,980
Here.

470
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,220
Sit down.

471
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,900
How could you be fine?

472
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,330
You're always busy preparing food
and medicine for others.

473
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,940
Besides, you've always been weak.

474
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,850
Next time, let the servants

475
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,370
handle the work.

476
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,130
You,

477
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,740
just go and supervise.

478
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,980
Here, have water.

479

Guinong.

480
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,370
You saw it for yourself.

481
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,570
Many people need help.

482
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,330
I don't have anything to do anyway.

483
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,260
Yes, sure.

484
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,330
You worry about them.

485
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,050
As for me,

486
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,700
I'll just worry about my Nan Lan.

487
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,810
Rest a while.

488
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,980
The doctor will be here soon.

489
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,570
I'm really fine, Guinong.

490
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,180
Just listen to me.

491
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,940
Master, the doctor is here.

492

Leader Tian.

493
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,220
Come, doctor. Take a look.

494
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,260
Did the madam get a heat stroke?
Quickly.

495
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,180
It's nothing serious.

496
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,460
I guess I didn't rest enough

497
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,370
and got light-headed.

498
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,610
Just let the doctor check.

499
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,370
Alright.

500
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,420
Pardon me, Madam.

501
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
How is it, doctor?

502
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,220
Is Madam sick?

503
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,260
She almost fainted

504
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,740
out there just now.

505
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
Madam is fine.

506
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,090
She is pregnant.

507
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,220
Congrats, Leader Tian.

508
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,050
Congrats, Madam.

509
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,050
Congrats, Master and Madam.

510
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,220
Why are you crying? This is happy news.

511
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,980
I'm just overjoyed.

512
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,740
Alright.

513
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,660
Okay.

514
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,090
Everyone's watching.

515
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,660
Gosh...

516
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,090
You two

517
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,260
are the madam's personal helpers.

518
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,050
Now,

519
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,420
Madam is pregnant.

520
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,220
Make sure you look after her well

521
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,500
and do whatever she asks.

522
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,420
Make no mistake,

523
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,130
you hear?

524
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,180
Yes.

525
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,130
Rest assured, Master.

526
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,090
We will do our best

527
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,530
to ensure madam is comfortable
and well looked after.

528
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,020
You may go.

529
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,460
Chief, everything is ready.

530
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,940
We can depart tomorrow.

531
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,020
Tomorrow?

532
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,290
That's so soon.

533
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,180
You said it yourself. This matter is...

534
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,330
Sooner rather than later.

535
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,460
Got it. You can go.

536
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,420
Yes, Sir.

537
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,220
Look.

538
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:21,810
Do you like it?

539
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,940
This craftsmanship is exquisite.

540
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,050
And the orchid looks very lifelike.

541
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,180
I like it.

542
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,530
Let me.

543
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,900
The hairpin and hair
accentuate each other.

544
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,180
But nothing beats the beauty
before the mirror.

You're always looking out for me.

547
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,660
The free medicine and food

548
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,420
have amounted to a lot of money.

549
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,700
Next time,

550
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,660
don't waste more money on me.

551
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,740
Money is just materialistic stuff.

552
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,850
I'm happy

553
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,260
as long as you're happy.

554

Besides,

555
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,130
what you're doing are good deeds.

556
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,370
That's why the Tian Family

557
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,980
received a blessing

558
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,810

Nan Lan.

560
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,370
There's something
I wish to discuss with you.

561
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,290
It's an urgent matter.

562
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,700
I have to go to the capital
for a few days.

563
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,700
When are you leaving?

564
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,660
Tomorrow.

565
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,660
So soon?

566
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,500
If it wasn't so urgent,

567
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,370
I wouldn't wish to leave you now.

568
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,180
But I worry...

569
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,130
Just go without worry.

Guinong.

571
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,220
Don't put your business on hold

572
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,770
because of me.

573
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,660
This is what it means to have a wife.

574
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,610

Be safe on the way.

When it's dark,

579

find an inn to rest.

580

Don't over-exert yourself.

581

Same for you.

Don't overwork yourself.

Remember.

There is another.

handle the menial work.

to get plenty of rest, okay?
