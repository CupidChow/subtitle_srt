=Episode 3=

3
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,920
I was sixteen years old that year.

4
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,439
I saw a young lady

5
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,760
at a harbour.

6
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,719
She was standing at the bow
of a pleasure boat.

7
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,719
Amidst the misty rain,

8
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,719
she was holding an oil-paper umbrella.

9
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,840
She glanced back

10
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,600
and flashed a smile at me.

11
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,159
And that smile

12
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,439
still imprinted in my mind.

13
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,760
At that time,

14
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,480
I wanted to rush towards her

15
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,840
and ask for her name.

16
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,680
However,

17
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,840
my legs

18
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:47,119
were rooted on the ground
at the boat's bow.

19
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,480
I was frozen.

20
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:52,880
That night,

21
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:56,000
I was wide awake all night.

22
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,559
I went to the harbour the second day

23
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,079
wishing to meet her once more.

24
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,959
However, I was waiting there

25
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,639
two days.

26
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,639
I couldn't meet her again.

27
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,399
Young lady.

28
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,399
Before you showed up,

29
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,320
I thought

30
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,320
my heart has stopped fluttering.

31
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,079
This time,

32
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,040
I won't let you slip through
my fingers.

33
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,359
Master, mind the threshold.

34
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,880
Be careful.

35
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,320
Why did you drink so much?

36
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,880
Mind the steps.

37
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,600
Hero...Hero Miao.

38
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,320
Hero Miao, don't come back.

39
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Please...

40
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,880
Please don't come back.

41
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
Master, what did you just say?

42
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,000
Hero Miao?

43
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:34,559
How do you feel now?

44
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,519
Let me pour you some water.

45
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,639
Go and check on Chun.

46
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,239
Go now.

47
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,519
Fine. Let's go.

48
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,400
Mind the steps.

49
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,199
Be careful.

50
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:04,799
This way.

51
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,199
-Martial Sister.
-Chunhua.

52
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,080
Father.

53
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,439
I'm going to sleep.

54
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,160
Master, I'll take you to your room.

55
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,119
Let's go.

56
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:22,679
Alright.

57
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,759
Be careful.

58
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,040
Mother.

59
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,439
Please drink some tea.

60
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,520
Mother, we've given them all the money.

61
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,239
But, what if Miao Renfeng
doesn't return?

62
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,720
Bite your tongue.

63
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,879
I won't regret my decision
whether I sink or swim.

64
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:06,920
Zhen.

65
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:08,840
Mother.

66
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,960
He's here.

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,220
(Shang's Fort)

68
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,520
Hero Miao,
you didn't fail your reputation.

69
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,759
You're a man of your word.

70
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,720
I met this lad on my way back.

71
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,520
Thank you, Hero Miao.

72
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,119
Come and fetch this lad.

73
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:49,640
Yes.

74
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:53,160
We're grateful that you've saved

75
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,280
the members
of Feima Escort Agency twice.

76
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,679
Hero Ma.

77
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,480
You should thank him properly.

78
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,359
True.

79
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,119
Thank you so much, Hero Miao.

80
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,080
Don't mention it.

81
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,520
Please help me to look after this lad.

82
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,559
I will.

83
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,199
I shall take my leave.

84
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,559
Hero Miao.

85
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,999
I won't allow this

86
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:13,840
if you're going
to leave in a hurry again.

87
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,960
We're very fortunate
to encounter you, Hero Miao.

88
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,999
I'll be appreciative

89
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,040
if we can take a sip

90
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,999
and chat a little.

91
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,600
Old Madam Shang, you flattered me.

92
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,520
I'm not pleasing you.

93
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,199
Instead, I'm inviting you sincerely.

94

(Shang's Fort)

95
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,840
We're lucky to meet each other.
But, I'd rather not bother you long.

96
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,080
Hero Miao, are you worried

97
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,840
that we'll be bragging about our meeting

98
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:38,600
in the future

99
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,960
and ruin your reputation, aren't you?

100
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,840
In that case,

101
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,160
I'll join you.

102
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,359
Thank you for coming, Hero Miao.

104
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,879
Ping Fei.

105
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,359
Thank you.

106
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,840
Did you drink?

107
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,720
How dare you.

108
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,759
You even drink wine now.

109
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,160
What has happened to you?

110
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,559
Your head is injured.

111
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,040
How dare you left without telling me.

112
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,160
I'll beat you when you're awake.

113
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,920
When I grow up,

114
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,040
I'll beat you to death.

115
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,280
Have a good rest.

116
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,679
I have many things to share

117
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,879
when you're awake.

118
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,400
I met a man.

119
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,600
He's the most gentle and considerate man

120
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,999
in the world.

121
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,400
I'm sure you'll be happy for me
after you meet him.

122
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,839
Young Lady Ma.

123
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,640
Young Lady Ma.

124
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,760
Young Lady Ma, two hours later,

125
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,760
Young Master Fu will be performing
his new song in the garden.

126
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,799
Please come for the performance.

127
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:49,439
Hero Miao, have a seat, please.

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,160
Coincidentally, a few friends of mine

129
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:16,280
learned that you're here.

130
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,760
So, they requested me

131
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,360
to introduce them to you.

132
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,479
And I accepted their requests.

133
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,880
Hero Miao, I'm Wang Jianying.

134
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,199
This is my younger brother.

135
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,439
I'm Wang Jianjie.

136
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,439
Nice to meet you.

137
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,280
I'm Zhou Tiejiao,
from Eagle Claw Yanxing Sect.

138
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,319
Wang Tie'e.

139
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:50,640
Zeng Tie'ou.

140
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,679
Qin Naizhi, the eight-armed Nezha.

141
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,400
I'm Chang Yiji.

142
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,920
Little brat.

143
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,120
You have no way to go now.

144
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,079
You can never escape from me.

145
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,719
Come down.

146
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,760
You have no way out, little brat.

147
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,520
Thank you, Official Fu.

148
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,959
Hero Miao, nice to meet you.

149
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,880
This is the Minister of War,

150
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,280
cum Vice Secretariat, Official Fu.

151
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,280
We shall skip those formalities

152
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,360
before Hero Miao.

153
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,040
I made a trip here from the capital

154
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:59,160
hoping to open doors for you
in the imperial court

155
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,760
and let's contribute to the people
under Qing's reign.

156
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,479
What do you think, Hero Miao?

157
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:07,839
I'm just a martial arts practitioner

158
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,319
and have no interest in politics.

159
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:17,199
I really need a bodyguard

160
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,040
who's well-known in the martial world
like you.

161
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Where's the saber manual?

162
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,799
I don't have it.

163
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,079
No?

164
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,640
Tell me. Where's the saber manual?

165
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,319
I've told you. I don't have it.

166
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,160
Curse you.

167
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,199
You better tell me
where the saber manual is.

168
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:49,120
Tell me now.

169
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,079
Alright.

170
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,400
Where's it?

171
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,640
In the Martial arts hall.

172
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,000
The corrupted imperial court

173
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:05,719
where officials are
no better than bandits,

174
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,760
I don't deserve a place there.

175
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,479
The general offered his hand
to you with sincerity,

176
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
don't you get carried away
and force our hands.

177
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,959
Everyone has their own pursuit.

178
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:29,120
I won't force you.

179
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,479
Everyone, please take care of Hero Miao
on my behalf.

180
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:39,839
Official Fu.

181
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,520
Official Fu.

182
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,079
Official Fu.

183
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:50,920
How cocky of you.

184
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,640
Break his legs.

185
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,599
Yes.

186
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:56,599
Sir, you have to be assertive.

187
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,000
Otherwise, your hesitation
will lead to unceasing trouble.

188
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,439
Jianming forsook his life
for the nation.

189
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,240
Plus, he's loyal to you.

190
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,799
You...

191
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,000
You must avenge him, Fu...

192
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,799
How could you be lenient to
the remnant of rebels

193
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:10,839
to give them a second chance?

194
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,280
Are you lecturing Official Fu?

195
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,439
I didn't.

196
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,400
It's just...

197
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,319
Didn't you hear what Official Fu said?

198
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,640
I want his life.

199
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,559
Is that helpful by breaking his legs?

200
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,559
Do you think your words matter

201
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,559
or Official Fu's?

202
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,520
A crippled man

203
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,799
will

204
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,599
end up dying.

205
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,360
Even if this day arrives,

206
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,240
I'd be in my coffin.

207
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:39,599
Don't you be too arrogant.

208
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,000
If you think your money
was wrongly spent,

209
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,479
you may claim it back.

210
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,160
You!

211
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,240
Mother.

212
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,160
Hero Miao,
I'd like to show my sincerity.

213
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,160
A toast for you.

214
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,040
Leave now.

215
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,760
Thank you.

216
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,640
I'm indebted to your kindness.

217
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,640
Hero Ma.

218
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,400
You held this feast for Hero Miao.

219
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,599
Speaking of challenging him,

220
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,640
the one should take the lead

221
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,599
is you, Invincible Fist.

222
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,880
Am I right?

223
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,839
That's right.

224
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,000
-True.
-You sound reasonable.

225
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:39,400
Master is seriously injured,

226
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,799
how could you mention him?

227
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,319
Aren't you afraid of being humiliated
by people

228
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,360
for bullying an honest man like him?

229
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:48,640
Go.

230
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,880
Keep on walking.

231
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:05,160
Little brat. You're asking for my blade.

232
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,959
Little brat.

233
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:28,240
I knew there must be
something up their sleeves.

234
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,400
Fortunately,
I've prepared for this.

235
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,559
Mother, but

236
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,240
I'm afraid the subordinates
of Official Fu will be involved.

237
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,880
Plus, two Martial Uncles are there.

238
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,280
They're all villains

239
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:39,880
and fence-sitters.

240
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,759
They have no position
to point their fingers at us.

241
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:42,759
Little brat.

242
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,840
What brings you here?

243
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,719
Men in the stockade have all fled.

244
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,800
I came to discuss the solution with you.

245
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,959
Useless fool.

246
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,759
Stealing the three hundred thousand taels
of escorted money

247
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,160
was a piece of cake, yet you failed.

248
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,239
Don't expect
that I'll offer you money again.

249
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:00,640
Get lost.

250
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,959
Stay out of my way.

251
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,560
I've captured the son of your enemy.

252
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
The son of my enemy?

253
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:08,679
Who's that?

254
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,600
That brat named Ping Fei.

255
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,600
He's Hu Yidao's son.

256
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,600
Where's he now?

257
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,959
I was on my way delivering him to you.

258
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,959
But, he escaped halfway.

259
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,800
You...

260
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,840
But, his hands were tied.

261
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:23,920
He can't run far.

262
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,519
Get him now.

263
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,360
Have they started the fight?

264
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,959
Only fiery words are exchanged for now.

265
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,759
The so-called experts? Tsk, tsk.

266
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,600
Since no one dares
to challenge Hero Miao,

267
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,479
I volunteer myself.

268
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,479
I'm Chen Yu, from Taiji Sect.

269
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,759
I'd like to take up the challenge.

270
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,400
Finally, someone responds.

271
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,199
Stand right there.

272
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:43,199
Hero Miao, we'd like to duel with you.

273
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,199
Stand right there.

274
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:49,800
Come down.

275
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,519
Come down.

276
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:56,840
The Eagle Craw Three
from Yanxing Sect

277
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,400
is honoured

278
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,199
to fight with you.

279
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,279
You're an unparalleled hero.

280
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:05,360
The three of us challenging you

281
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:06,880
won't fail

282
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,360
your mighty name.

283
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,199
The three of us would meet you
with three moves.

284
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,600
It's a friendly match
and that's all.

285
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:17,959
Three moves?

286
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,080
Little brat.

287
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:02,759
Stop.

288
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,320
The three moves have ended.

289
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,560
Hero Miao, it's a fruitful match.

290
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,519
Qin Yiji, it's your turn.

291
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,279
Hero Miao, looking at this situation,

292
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,600
we shall end here.

293
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:29,479
Since it's a friendly match, I reckon

294
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,920
launching a fight is unnecessary.

295
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,120
Anyway, weapons are blind and risky.

296
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,800
Therefore, I'll challenge Hero Miao

297
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,959
with imaginary moves mentally.

298
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,479
Imaginary moves?

299
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,560
Great move.

300
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:49,560
Leaning out to reach the sword
and then turning around.

301
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:52,360
These moves are Erlang Cleaves Mountains
and Tyrant King Holds The Cauldron.

302
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,439
To deal with these moves,
I'll use Spring Breeze Shakes Lotus,

303
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,039
White Rainbow Pierces Through The Sun,

304
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,759
and Drifting Light Raft.

305
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,439
What do you think, Hero Miao?

306
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,920
Impressive moves.

307
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,640
A bunch of lazybones.

308
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,840
This is ridiculous.

309
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,600
Do it now.

310
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,390

The sky after the setting sun

is most beautiful.

Old Madam Shang, what are you up to?

All I want is to seek justice.

332

You're either brothers or fellows
of Jianming.

333
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,800
Are you worthy of being his friends?

334
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,560
I provided you with good food and drink

335

and even money

336
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,959
on the request of killing Miao Renfeng.

337
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,560
Yet, you betrayed

338
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,920
my trust.

339
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,920
Are you trying to leave here?
Only if you team up

340
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,560
and slaughter Miao Renfeng.

341
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,880
Otherwise, you'll stay here
till your last breath.

342
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,320
Old Madam Shang.

343
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,199
Do you think

344
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,400
you can trap us here with this?

345
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:31,479
You may try.

346
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,160
I spent a great fortune

347
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,800
in building this iron chamber.

348
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,920
If you sit idly by,

349
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,719
you'll witness
what's special about this place.

350
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,840
Old Madam Shang, if you mean to harm us,

351
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,080
Official Fu won't
let you off the hook easily.

352
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:47,920
Official Fu?

353
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,679
To him, you're merely dogs.

354
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,039
Previously, Jianming was loyal to him.

355
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,519
And look how he ended up.

356
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,360
Besides,

357
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,160
Official Fu has no time
to care about you right now.

358
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:03,920
He's busy courting

359
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:06,400
Young Lady Ma.

360
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,239
What did you do to my daughter?

361
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,880
Ma Xingkong, you're indeed an ignoramus.

362
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,999
Back then,

363
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:21,640
if you hadn't competed with Jianming

364
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,360
and worn him out,

365
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,679
such competent Jianming

366
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,479
wouldn't have been killed

367
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:28,080
by that darned Hu Yidao.

368
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,320
You!

369
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,120
You vicious woman.

370
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,080
Master.

371
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,199
It's only between us.

372
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,400
Let go of them.

373
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,199
Come at me.

374
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,239
Fine.

375
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,560
Kill yourself then.

376
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,679
Perhaps I'll spare their lives.

377
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,239
But, mark my words.

378
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,640
Before killing yourself,

379
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,120
you have to kowtow three times

380
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,479
before Jianming's memorial tablet.

381
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Ignite.

382
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,920
Jianming.

383
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Did you see that?

384
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,959
I'll have those good-for-nothings

385
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,479
and Miao Renfeng

386
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,840
to be buried with you in your grave.

387
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,439
I'll have them kowtow
and apologise to you

388
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,920
six feet under.

389
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,999
You have no way to go.

390
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,800
Tell me.

391
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:48,279
Where's the saber manual?

392
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,039
I won't tell you
even if you beat me to death.

393
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:54,519
Then, I shall grant your wish.

394
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,800
Come on.
