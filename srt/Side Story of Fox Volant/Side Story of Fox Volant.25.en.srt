00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,439
I couldn't find it.

4
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,240
Are you really here

5
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,599
to look for something?

6
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,480
You are here to scout the place out.

7
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,200
Senior.

8
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,439
Are they looking for this?

9
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,200
This is the one.

10
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,720
Thank you, Young Lady.

11
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,999
The child is too naughty.

12
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,080
When he found this in the room,

13
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,040
he took it out to play with it.

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,680
Please forgive him.

Sister Ma.

16
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,760
Who are you?

17
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,719
It's me, Fei.

18
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,920
I am Hu Fei.

19
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,880
I'm Fei.

20
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,200
Fei.

21
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,920
He's Fei.

22
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,599
Fei.

23
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,359
I never thought

24
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,880
that I would see you again here.

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,719
By the way, let me introduce her to you.

26
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,079
She is my second sister.

27
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,760
She's the successor
of the King of Poison,

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,440
Young Lady Ling.

29
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,440
The King of Poison?

30
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,359
We are only here for our target.

31
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,799
Our target is the Feima Escort Agency.

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
For the others who want to live,

33

get lost now!

Who are you?

36
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,040
Escort Xu.

37
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,960
You never thought
that someone would hold a grudge

38
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,920
against you for 9000 taels, right?

39
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,439
Which sect are you from?

40
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,920
Do you dare to give me a name?

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,359
Feima Escort Agency

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,760
won't allow you to bully us.

43
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,560
We are here to rob you,
not make friends with you.

44
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,719
Chunhua, protect the kids.

45
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,200
If you let Zhou Tiejiao and his team
to take the lead,

46
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,040
when it's time for Official Fu's reward,

47
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,440
they'll steal

48
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,359
the merits from us.

49
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

50
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:32,119
We don't care about the merits.

51
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,519
We are just afraid that Zhou Tiejiao
will try to overthrow you.

52
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,440
Don't be so anxious.

53
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,799
Both of you should calm down.

54
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
Calm down.

55
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,920
We don't know
what's the situation inside.

56
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,880
If something happens,

57
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,000
Zhou Tiejiao will be blamed for it.

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,679
Even if everything goes smoothly,

59
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,239
when we go back to the capital,

60
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,079
I'm the one

61
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,920
who is going to report it

62
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,600
to Official Fu.

63
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,079
We can just wait here and be at ease.

64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,519
Zhou Tiejiao

65
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,440
won't be able to take away
this merit from us.

66
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
I understand now.

67
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,920
We

68
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,679
just have to watch the fight in safety

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,559
and reap the advantages
at the end of the fight.

70
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,000
Senior, are you okay?

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,679
I'm fine.

72
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,559
Nice sword.

73
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,839
Since you like it,

74
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,399
I'll kill you with this sword.

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,959
It'll be an honour.

76
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:13,999
Tiejiao.

77
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,080
This precious sword is indeed sharp.

78
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,640
I wonder if I'm able to break it

79
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,840
with my sabre.

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,520
Stop.

81
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,999
I admit defeat.

82
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,799
If you like it,

83
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,999
you can take it.

84
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,679
Don't break something so precious.

85
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,679
He values his sword as much as his life.

86
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,239
He rather gives the sword to his enemy

87
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,119
instead of letting it get destroyed.

88
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,840
You can have it back.

89
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,239
Are you really going

90
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,119
to give the sword back?

91
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
You don't take the lives
of the innocents.

92
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,439
So, I don't have
to make an enemy out of you.

93
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,160
If you give up on robbing us,

94
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,640
we can forget about this attack.

95
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,520
Since you are so straightforward,

96
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,520
we'll be frank with you too.

97
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,119
Today,

98
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,520
we planned to rob you.

99
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,679
Since we are not your match,

100
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,799
we'll have to retreat.

101
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,040
Young man.

102
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,280
See you again if fate allows it.

103
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,359
Retreat.

104
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:36,759
Fei.

105
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,999
Fei.

106
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,999
Thank you for your help today.

107
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,999
I was so foolish.

108
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,280
I failed to recognise you.

109
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,799
Sorry for being rude to you.

110
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,160
Don't blame me for it.

111
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,119
Xu Zheng,

112
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,400
if you say that,

113
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,679
I'll feel so guilty.

114
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,080
Back then, you had taken good care of me.

115
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,679
I'm really glad

116
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,679
to run into you again today.

117
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
You've become

118
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,600
so good in martial arts
after just a few years.

119
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,400
I thought that we would
never see you again.

120
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,879
I'm ecstatic today.

121
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,239
Ask the boss here

122
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,439
to prepare some good wine
and dishes for us.

123
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,480
I want

124
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,759
to drink with Fei today.

125
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,280
Your body has been injured.

126
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,199
You better don't drink.

127
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:17,640
I have to drink with him

128
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,799
today.

129
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:20,160
Well...

130
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,359
Xu Zheng, since you insist,

131
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,199
I'll drink with you.

132
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,239
Good.

133
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
The owner of the shop
has already run away in fear.

134
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,239
Take a rest.

135
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,400
I'll go and cook some dishes for you.

136
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:32,239
Okay.

137
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:43,439
Even with the combined power
of Eagle Claw Sect and Yanxing Sect,

138
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,999
you still can't take down
the weak Feima Escort Agency.

139
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,280
It's not difficult to defeat the people

140
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,960
of Feima Escort Agency.

141
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,480
But a young man

142
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,960
appeared out of nowhere.

143
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,960
That young man
is very well-versed in martial arts.

144
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,520
With Feima Escort Agency's
current situation,

145
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,319
can they hire someone
so powerful to protect them?

146
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:04,679
You can fight him yourself
if you think you are that great.

147
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,319
It's easy for you to say.

148
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,600
Enough.

149
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,720
Stay here and act as our reinforcements.

150
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,400
Let me show you what I'm capable of.

151
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,319
Fei.

152
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,799
When we were in the agency back then,

153
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,040
I was such a fool

154
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,119
to treat you so rudely.

155
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,840
But you forgave me

156
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,119
and saved me again and again.

157
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,319
I feel so guilty

158
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,999
as an elder brother.

159
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:32,840
Xu Zheng.

160
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,119
Don't say that.

161
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,480
Back then, Fourth Uncle and I
were living on the streets.

162
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,640
Feima Escort Agency

163
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,920
was the one that fed us.

164
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,119
We have no way to repay the agency.

165
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:45,199
That's not true.

166
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,439
Come.

167
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,359
Let's drink this

168
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:49,679
in respect of Master Ma.

169
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,239
Come.

170
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,239
Okay.

171
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,879
This is for you, Master.

172
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,080
Your children look
so smart and intelligent.

173
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,600
They look so adorable.

174
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,360
Only someone as beautiful as you

175
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,160
can give birth to such cute children.

176
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,559
You are too kind, Young Lady Ling.

177
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,599
I'm already the mother of two children.

178
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,640
But in Hu Fei's heart,

179
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,120
you'll always be
the gentle and kind Sister Ma.

180
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,439
Fei has always been kind.

181
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,160
He doesn't have
any ill intentions towards anyone.

182
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,719
The lady who marries him will be

183
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,160
very fortunate.

184
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:40,839
Sister Ma.

185
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,360
You said that he has been kind
since young.

186
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,880
I'm sure

187
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
there are many girls who like him.

188
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,319
I don't know if the girls
like him or not.

189
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
But I know what Fei likes.

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,959
What does he like?

191
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,199
He likes to train.

192
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,240
Whenever I see him,

193
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,199
he's always in training.

194
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,280
One time, he was so focused on his training.

195
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:04,120
When Fourth Uncle asked him to eat,

196
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,280
he hurriedly

197
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,319
stuffed a bun into his mouth.

198
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,679
In the end, he almost broke his teeth.

199
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,319
How could a bun break his teeth?

200
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,760
Because he mistook a stone for a bun.

201
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,760
Are they back again?

202
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,719
No matter what,

203
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,520
we need to bring the children
to safety first.

204
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,520
There's no one here.

205
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,479
They must be in hiding.

206
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,439
Split up and look for them!

207
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,360
Roger that!

208
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,839
Who are you?

209
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,839
He had put it so nicely.

210
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,280
Did he ask us to stay back

211
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:55,719
so that we can take care of his horse?

212
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,360
Second Brother.

213
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,760
What's wrong with taking care
of the horse?

214
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,319
When Sun Wukong
was at the Heavenly Realm,

215
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,280
he used to take care of the horses too.

216
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Are you a fool?

217
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,280
He was still defeated in the end.

218
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,520
I wonder how the fight is right now.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't believe that Shang

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,079
can defeat that young man.

221
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,040
That Shang

222
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,920
asked us to rob them.

223
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,640
Then, he asked us
to kidnap the children.

224
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,360
We don't know what Official Fu

225
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,920
wants us to do.

226
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:20,439
Official Fu

227
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,760
won't care about those 9000 taels of silver.

228
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,839
As for Feima Escort Agency,

229
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,240
there's no one important there.

230
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,719
And it's not the commander's target.

231
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,280
I think

232
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,520
something is fishy about this.

233
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,040
Eldest Brother, Second Brother,

234
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,360
did you see the children just now?

235
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,240
What do you mean?

236
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,559
Don't you think that the children

237
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,640
look like the one in the capital?

238
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,520
Now that you say it,

239
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,000
they look really similar.

240
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:50,880
I know it.

241
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,240
I understand now.

242
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,640
So,

243
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,839
Official Fu was not asking us

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,199
to rob or steal something.

245
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,959
He just wanted us
to kidnap the children for him.

246
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,240
No wonder he suddenly

247
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,719
became Official Fu's favourite.

248
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,319
So, it's because he found Official Fu

249
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:11,040
long lost sons.

250
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,520
When Shang

251
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,120
sends the children into the capital,

252
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,000
he won't be just
a vice Commander-General anymore.

253
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,240
He may even ascend three ranks.

254
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,000
That's right.

255
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
He'll be intoxicated with success.

256
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:25,920
Looks like he's going
to be arrogant for a while.

257
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:41,439
My child!

258
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,959
Mother!

259
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,040
Mother!

260
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,120
Mother!

261
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,559
Mother!

262
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:19,880
Mother, save me!

263
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,760
Who are you?

264
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,240
Mother, save me!

265
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,479
Mother, save me!

266
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,959
Save me!

267
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,360
Mother!

268
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:28,920
An'an!

269
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,360
Mother!

270
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,839
Save me!

271
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,839
Run!

272
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,240
Mother!

273
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,000
Senior!

274
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,079
Xu Zheng.

275
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:27,199
Xu Zheng.

276
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:27,559
Here.

277
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,719
Xu Zheng.

278
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:32,679
We have to hide now.

279
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:33,479
Let's go.

280
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:35,000
Be careful.

281
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,439
Fei.

282
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:45,640
Let them eat this antidote.

283
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,799
I'm going to stop them with poison.

284
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,439
Okay.

285
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,319
So, it's you.

286
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:56,760
Today, I'm going to seek my revenge

287
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:58,559
for all the old and new grudges.

288
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:02,679
Surround

289
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,959
this inn.

290
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,920
Roger that!

291
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:02,520
Vice Commander-General Shang.

292
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,719
They have gone in to search for them.

293
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:05,920
If they've gone in,

294
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,079
why is it so quiet?

295
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,880
Is there a trap inside the inn

296
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,599
and they've all been killed?

297
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,319
Even if there's a trap,

298
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:18,240
it won't be so quiet.

299
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,240
Looks like

300
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,880
they have someone
who's adept at using poison.

301
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,920
There's no need to be afraid.

302
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,120
Continue to look for them.

303
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,240
Well...

304
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,360
What is it? Are you going
to disobey a military order?

305
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,120
Vice Commander-General Shang.

306
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,679
The soldiers from the garrison are here.

307
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,319
The flint and kerosene are ready too.

308
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,239
Well done.

309
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,120
Listen to my command.

310
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,719
Split up into two.

311
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,920
The first team will surround
the inn with firewood.

312
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,239
The other team

313
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,160
will dip strips of cloth into kerosene

314
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,719
and wrap them around the arrows.

315
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:53,679
Roger that.

316
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:07,719
Fire.

317
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,199
Vice Commander-General Shang!

318
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,199
The children are inside!

319
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:24,679
You can't set the inn on fire.

320
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,920
How do you know that.

321
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,560
Vice Commander-General Shang.

322
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,759
Say no more.

323
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,160
We have to save the children first!

324
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:40,600
Lingsu.

325
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:41,999
Check on Xu Zheng's wounds.

326
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:48,400
Fei.

327
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,320
Stop pressuring Young Lady Ling.

328
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
Ma Chunhua.

329
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,160
I'm sure

330
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,080
you know who I am now.

331
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,039
Fate is really a funny thing.

332
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:03,959
I never thought

333
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
that we would meet again today.

334
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,519
I'm sure I don't have

335
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,999
to talk about the past.

336
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,239
You know what happened.

337
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,800
But there's something
that you might not know.

338
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,320
The handsome, elegant,

339
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,439
and powerful Young Master Fu back then

340
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,880
has become the renowned Official Fu now.

341
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:23,479
Today,

342
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm here on behalf of Official Fu

343
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,199
to bring the two young masters back to the capital.

344
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:30,719
Of course.

345
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,239
If you want to come with us,

346
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,759
we'll take you with us.

347
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,360
After all,

348
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,239
we can't separate
the children from their mother.

349
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,439
For old time's sake,

350
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:46,880
I can put in some good words for you

351
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,959
in front of Official Fu.

352
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:51,600
It's possible for you

353
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,039
to regain his favour.

354
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,600
When that happens,

355
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,719
you'll have a bright future
ahead of you.

356
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,519
And you'll be able

357
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,959
to enjoy all the riches and luxuries
in the world.

358
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,519
Those evil men.

359
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:12,800
Xu Zheng,

360
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,120
I know that you can't bear
to part with the children.

361
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,920
After all, you've raised them
for five to six years.

362
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:20,080
But have you thought about it?

363
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,600
Feima Escort Agency

364
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,199
has become a dying business.

365
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,999
Do you want your two children

366
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
to become

367
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,239
pedlars like you?

368
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:36,080
They are born for greatness.

369
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,600
In the future,

370
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,120
they may become an official,
a nobleman or even a minister.

371
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,600
If you really care for the two children,

372
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,640
you should hand them over to me.

373
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,719
Let them go back to their real family.

374
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,160
Don't say that I'm heartless.

375
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,160
I'll give you the 9000 taels of silver.

376
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,479
That's all I have to say.

377
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,120
Think about it.

378
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,080
Senior.

379
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,360
Hang on.

380
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,360
We still have to go back
to our home town together.

381
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,279
Chunhua.

382
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,999
I may not be able to go back now.

383
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,519
My sons.

384
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,199
My sons.

385
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,519
I can't be by your side anymore after this.

386
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,479
When I'm gone,

387
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,199
remember to listen
to your mother and Uncle Hu,

388
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:40,600
okay?

389
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,840
Okay.

390
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,199
Although I won't be by your side,

391
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,759
I'll always think about you

392
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,039
in my heart, okay?

393
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,039
Father!

394
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:58,239
Father.

395
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,039
Chunhua.

396
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,560
You've gone through a lot with me.

397
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:08,840
But it's worth it

398
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,239
because I get to

399
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,800
marry you.

400
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,600
It's totally worth it.

401
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,560
I have no regrets.

402
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,880
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,560
I have no regrets.

404
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,759
Father!

405
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,679
Father!

406
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,519
Father!

407
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,920
I'm sorry, Senior.

408
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,400
Father, wake up!

409
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,039
I'll be good, father.

410
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:50,880
Father!

411
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,959
Ma Chunhua.

412
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,920
Stop crying.

413
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,560
There's nothing for you to cry about.

414
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,039
What you have is something

415
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,519
that others will die for.

416
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,800
It's almost dawn now.

417
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,560
Time to make up your mind.

418
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:21,320
Fei.

419
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,640
I'll do it.

420
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:51,519
Young Lady Ma.

421
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Long time no see.

422
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,959
You don't look as graceful now.

423
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,800
Looks like your life has been rough
in the past few years.

424
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,840
Come here.

425
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,560
I have something to ask you.

426
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:04,959
If I don't get the answers I want,

427
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,239
I won't let the children go with you.

428
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,519
Are you the one who hired someone

429
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:27,679
to give Xu Zheng those 9000 taels of silver?

430
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,679
Is that

431
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:31,039
important?

432
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:38,719
How does Fu Kang'an
know that the children are his sons?

433
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:43,080
Official Fu is the Minister of War.

434
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:45,560
There's no one more powerful
than him except the emperor.

435
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,759
He knows everything.

436
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:50,999
Besides the children,

437
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,360
what else did he say?

438
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,239
You wench.

439
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,640
Why do you have so many questions?

440
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,519
Do you really think

441
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,080
that Official Fu

442
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,199
will have feelings
for a wanton woman like you?

443
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:07,959
You animal.

444
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,360
I shouldn't have spared
your life back then.

445
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:13,840
It's you again.

446
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,800
Open your eyes and look.

447
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,920
How many people do you have

448
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,400
and how many people do I have today?

449
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,840
They are the soldiers
of the imperial court.

450
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,039
So what if you are good at fighting?

451
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,959
If you fight them,

452
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,120
I'll sentence you to death
for being a rebel.

453
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
I regret my mistake
for sparing your life

454
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,759
when we were at Shang's Fort.

455
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,360
Otherwise,

456
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,759
you would've lost
more than half of your face.

457
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,039
So, it was you.

458
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,800
God has been kind.

459
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,880
I'm going to kill you today

460
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:17,560
to avenge my mother!

461
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:28,160
Why are you standing there? Attack them!

462
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,239
Don't you dare!

463
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,199
Stop!

464
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,479
We can't hurt the children.

465
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,800
Zhou Tiejiao, darn you!

466
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Vice Commander-General Shang.

467
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,239
It's not that we don't want to save you.

468
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,479
But if the children got hurt,

469
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,920
all of us will have to die with you

470
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:46,560
if Official Fu blames us for it.

471
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,560
Ma Chunhua.

472
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Shang Baozhen.

473
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,719
Your life will end today.

474
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,360
Ma Chunhua, calm down.

475
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,920
This

476
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,360
is for my father.

477
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,759
This

478
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,519
is for my senior!

479
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,039
This

480
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,479
is for the father

481
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,880
of my sons.

482
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,999
We were just

483
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,279
doing our job.

484
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,279
Please forgive us

485
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,880
if we've offended you.

486
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,800
It's not that serious.

487
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,400
You've been tricked

488
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,640
by Shang Baozhen.

489
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,160
Now that we've cleared
the misunderstanding,

490
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,759
we don't have to go against
each other anymore.

491
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,519
I still haven't

492
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,360
asked you about your name.

493
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,920
My surname is Hu. My name is Fei.

494
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:24,360
My name is Zhou Tiejiao.

495
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:25,759
Zeng Tie'ou.

496
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,519
Wang Tie'e.

497
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:28,880
May our friendship

498
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,439
remains forever.

499
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:32,920
When you visit the capital,

500
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,600
remember to tell us

501
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:36,840
so that we can hang out together.

502
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,719
Thank you for being so kind.

503
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,479
See you in the future.

504
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,120
See you in the future.

505
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:28,040
(Grave of Xu Zheng)

506
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,679
Mother, won't father feel cold in there?

507
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,479
He's not in there anymore.

508
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,279
He is in the sky now.

509
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:41,360
Why is he in the sky?

510
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:44,320
He has become a star in the sky.

511
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:46,800
He'll look at us every day.

514
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,239
Fei, thank you for staying with me
in the past few days.

515
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:12,400
It's time for you to say goodbye.

516
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,239
Sister Ma, take good care of yourself.

517
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,320
You don't have to worry about me.

518
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,120
For Pingping and An'an,

519
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,679
I will take care of myself.

520
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,400
Unfortunately,

521
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,039
we've just been united.

522
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:25,600
But we have to part ways again.

523
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,880
Although I'm not your real sister,

524

in my heart,

525
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:33,519
I've always treated you
as my real brother.

526
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:36,519
This bracelet doesn't worth much.

527
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,880
But I want to give it to you as a gift.

528
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,080
Find a good timing

529
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
to give it to Young Lady Ling.

530
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,039
You fool.

531
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,320
Take good care of her.

532
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,239
See you again.

Sister Ma has never been

538

able to forget about Young Master Fu, right?

539
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,199
I don't know.

540
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,039
You can't forget about someone

who has made such
a deep impression on you.

By the way,

Sister Ma

545
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,959
asked me to give this bracelet to you.

546
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,759
Why?

547
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:19,999
Maybe because she likes you a lot.

548
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,279
She even asked me
to take good care of you.

Will you take good care of me?

550
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,519
Of course.

551
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:29,080
I'll take care of you forever.

Father.

556
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,239
Something bad has happened.

557
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:14,160
What's wrong?

558
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,239
Why are you so nervous?

559
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,199
Is Hu here to attack us?

560
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,479
It's not that.

561
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:20,400
He is gone. He has run away.

562
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,519
Slow down.

563
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,360
Ever since he left Yitang Town,

564
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,360
we've lost sight of him.

565
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,080
Let's take this to Chief Tang.

566
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:29,560
Okay.

567
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,120
Calm down.

568
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
You've just lost sight of him.

569
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,360
It's nothing.

570
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,039
He can't infiltrate this mansion.

571
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,039
Chief Tang.

572
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,160
Since it has come to this,

573
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,560
we better come up with a sure-fire plan.

574
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,479
I already have a sure-fire plan.

575
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,279
Tomorrow,

576
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,880
I'll bring you and your son

577
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,759
into the capital.

578
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,800
The capital?

579
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:01,320
That's right.

580
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,600
Chief Tang, tell me about it.

581
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,479
Chief Feng.

582
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,600
I've used a lot of your money
in the past few years.

583
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,439
But you know

584
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:19,239
that the money

585
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:23,039
is used to take care of
those martial arts fighters.

586
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:26,239
They'll pass on the intel
that they've gathered to me.

587
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:29,920
And I'll report it
to the imperial court.

588
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,560
I'm not trying to boast.

589
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,959
But almost all of the officials
in the capital

590
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:40,959
know me now.

591
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,400
If anything happens

592
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,280
in the capital, no matter how minor,

593
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,880
I'll know everything about it.

594
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,200
What do you think?

595
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,519
Do you feel reassured now?

596
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:57,840
Comes to think of it, the capital

597
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:00,079
is indeed a safe place to be.

598
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,280
Moreover,

599
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,880
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering

600
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,159
will be held soon, right?

601
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,999
The Five Tigers Sect is invited too.

602
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:12,880
You

603
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,760
can use this chance
to enter the capital.

604
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:18,639
What if that man

605
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,039
knows about it too

606
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,280
and is waiting for me

607
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,039
in the capital?

608
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,840
The World's Sect Leaders Gathering this time

609
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,880
is personally organised by Official Fu.

610
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,880
Do you think

611
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,479
that man

612
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,360
will dare to kill you in front

613
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:36,439
of Official Fu?

614
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:41,920
Don't worry.

615
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,880
Go back

616
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,439
and pack your bags.

617
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:48,159
We'll enter the capital

618
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,639
