I'm much better now.

I can walk with this crutch.

00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,640
I thought it through.

82
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,280
In fact,

83
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,160
when I regained consciousness,

84
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,999
I thought about it.

85
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,439
What should I do

86
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,879
if my leg can never be healed?

87
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
What should I do
if I can't avenge my parents?

88
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,439
But I found out from Senior Liu that

89
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,999
you were the one

90
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,400
who brought me from
Foshan all the way here.

91
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,759
You even carried me

92
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,520
up 9999 stairs on your knees.

93
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,160
I think

94
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,439
all these are no longer important.

95
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,920
Your meticulous care
for me during this time

96
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,759
is the biggest providence for me.

97
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,520
To have met you

98
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,799
is the luckiest thing
that happened to me.

99
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:30,840
Don't worry.

100
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,439
I'm fine.

101
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:35,720
In the worst care
I should become a cripple.

102
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,559
As long as you don't mind.

103
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,759
I don't want you to be a cripple.

104
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:42,040
I didn't work so hard

105
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,400
to save a cripple.

106
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:32,839
Chief Yuan,

107
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,920
why are you so obsessed?

108
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,559
Senior.

109
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,920
Can we not treat his leg

110
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,040
without Epiphyllum Dew?

111
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,000
Can we still find Epiphyllum?

112
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,280
I've sent people to look for it.

113
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,000
Epiphyllum

114
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,319
is very exotic.

115
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,599
Besides,

116
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,959
they only bloom once a year.

117
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,240
They bloom only for two hours.

118
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,799
Have you heard

119
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,479
the story of Veda and Epiphyllum?

120
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:24,880
It's said

121
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,360
that Epiphyllum was a flower goddess.

122
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,040
She bloomed every day.

123
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,240
She fell in love

124
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
with Veda who watered her every day.

125
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,959
Veda was still a mortal then.

126
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,439
Jade Emperor was furious
when he found out.

127
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:39,920
He wanted to split them up.

128
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,360
He punished Epiphyllum
so that she could only bloom once a year

129
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,599
for only two hours.

130
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,880
He also sent Veda to be
a monk at the Vulture Peak,

131
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,640
so he could forget
the mortal world and the flower goddess.

132
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:56,280
The flower goddess knew that

133
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,160
every late spring

134
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:02,120
Veda would collect
spring dew at Vulture Peak

135
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,599
to make tea for Buddha.

136
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,599
Hence she gathered all her energy

137
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,280
to produce the most beautiful blossoms

138
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,719
when Veda passed by.

139
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,640
What happened later?

140
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,640
Regrettably,

141
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,199
spring after spring,
blossom after blossom,

142
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,199
Veda still didn't notice

143
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:25,120
that Epiphyllum bloomed for him.

144
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:28,000
He even forgot about the flower goddess.

145
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,640
All destined relationships end someday.

146
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,240
The flower goddess

147
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,959
and Veda missed it.

148
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,400
What's more, we're just mortals.

149
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,520
Chief Yuan.

150
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,040
Not everything

151
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,559
goes as your will.

152
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:53,400
As long as you do it without regret.

153
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,040
No.

154
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,760
I must find a way to treat his leg.

155
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,280
Leader Tian.

156
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,479
This is Sect Leader Tian of Tianlong Sect.

157

Pleased to meet you.

158

Let's go to Juying Restaurant.

Thanks to your referrals,

166

Then

173
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,280
I shall thank you

174
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,520
on behalf of my brothers.

-Thank you, Leader Tian.
-Thank you, Leader Tian.

176
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,160
You're welcome, Official Zhou.

177
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,280
Please sit.

178
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,439
All of you

179
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,360
are trusted followers
of Official Fu.

180
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,520
How...

181
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,400
is his temper? What's his hobby?

182
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,319
What special rules
are there in his residence?

183
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:41,640
Please guide me.

184
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,400
Sure.

185
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,880
Sure.

186
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,799
Let's eat before we talk.

187
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,360
I've found it!

188
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,319
I've found it!

189
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,439
Martial Uncle.

190
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,719
Look.

191
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,240
Epiphyllum.

192
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,880
Where did you find it?

193
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,079
In the Master's study room.

194
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,959
This Epiphyllum wilted.

195
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,360
But Master didn't want it to die,

196
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,959
so he transplanted it into this pot

197
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,479
and brought it to
the study to care for it.

198
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,400
We forgot about it.

199
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,360
I didn't expect

200
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,040
Master to have saved this Epiphyllum

201
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,520
and it's in bud.

202
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,280
Look.

203
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,959
It's a blessing.

204
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,280
Your sincerity has touched Buddha.

205
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,120
Senior.

206
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,479
Can we collect dew from this Epiphyllum?

207
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,439
Yes.

208
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,880
If it blooms from midnight to dawn,

209
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,760
we can surely collect its dew.

210
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,520
Okay.

211
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,240
I shall wait

212
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
for it to blossom.

213
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,959
Yuan Xing.

214
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,439
You've committed greed.

215
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:35,199
Master.

216
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,079
I only wanted to treat his leg.

217
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,400
It was Feng Tiannan who did that to him.

218
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,760
Since you don't allow me to kill him,

219
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,679
I shall pay

220
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,040
for his sin.

221
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
If you hadn't left
the mountain without permission,

222
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,679
none of these would happen.

223
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,920
Since I've caused all this,

224
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,760
I shall take all the bad karma.

225
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,160
You...

226
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,040
Don't worry, Master.

227
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,719
After I heal his leg,

228
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
I'll go back to Tianshan

229
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,479
and pray to Buddha

230
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,400
in seclusion.

231
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,319
I beg you, Master.

232
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,760
You denied that you're greedy.

233
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:16,640
When his injury is healed,

234
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,360
I'll leave right away.

235
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,920
Oil lamp and Buddha
shall be my only company.

236
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,599
I'll serve Buddha sincerely.

237
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,719
I know I've committed greed.

238
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
Please let me covet for awhile more.

239
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,959
As long as
the Epiphyllum blooms tonight,

240
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,479
the dew is collected,

241
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,880
and his leg is healed,

242
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,640
I'll return to Tianshan immediately.

243
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,479
Oil lamp and Buddha
shall be my only company.

244
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,880
I'll serve Buddha sincerely.

I, Tian Guinong,

I wonder from whom

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,679
this starling learned it.

260
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,039
Not only that Official Fu is good
in mapping out strategies for victories,

261
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,279
but even your bird is so humane.

Get up.

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,519
Thank you, Sir.

Talking about the families
of Hu, Miao, Fan and Tian,

00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:56,199
all of you were formidable then.

No.

267
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
To be able to work for you

268
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,279
is truly formidable.

269
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,199
It's my fortune.

00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:07,800
I came this time to...

271

That's enough.

272

They told me

273
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,320
what you wanted to say.

274
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,679
I know that Tianlong Sect

275
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,199
has been developed well
in the past years.

276
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:21,479
You have plenty of wealth

277
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,199
and apprentices.

278
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:26,519
You flattered me, Sir.

279
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:31,800
In order to see me,

280
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,360
you've done a lot, right?

281
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,519
I couldn't find another way
to serve the imperial court.

282
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,039
Out of anxiety...

283
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,400
I'll give you a chance

284
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,999
to serve the imperial court now.

285

Remember,

286
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,519
I lack neither taels

287
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,759
nor loyal slaves,

288
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,360
but truly capable people.

289
00:20:58,479 --> 00:20:59,600
Just say the word,

290
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,959
I'll try my best to do it,

291

even at the expense of my life.

292

You have a good relationship with Miao Renfeng,

293

right?

294
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,519
I heard that

295
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:14,959
the two of you

I've seen Miao Renfeng.

Before this,

299
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,600
I wanted to recruit him.

300
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,840
But unexpectedly

301
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:29,360
he rejected me.

302
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,160
I want him to attend

303
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,800
the World's Sect Leaders Gathering.

304
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,120
After all,

305
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:41,959
he has the undeserved
reputation of being unbeatable.

306

If he comes,

307

it'll be more interesting.

00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:47,479
how can you succeed in the future?

344
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,199
I've never had

345
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:49,479
such a grievance in my life.

346
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,160
I don't want to go.

347
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,920
If the two of them catch up,

348
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,600
we'll be dead.

349
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,800
Father.

350
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,199
We've been walking for so many days.

351
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,999
It's okay to take a rest.

352
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,320
I was too soft-hearted.

353
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:06,360
When I caught them,

354
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,320
I should have just killed them

355
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,560
so this could be avoided.

356
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:14,519
Let's go.

357
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:16,640
Let's go.

358
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,199
Come on.

359
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:17,959
I don't want.

360
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,679
I have blisters on my feet.

361
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,679
I need more rest.

362
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:22,199
Hurry up.

363
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,160
Let's go.

364
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,800
Carry me.

365
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:26,479
Okay.

366
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,279
Okay, I'll carry you.

367
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,120
Okay.

368
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,719
Here.

369
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,560
Slow down, Father.

370
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,959
Epiphyllum Dew Cream is really great.

371
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,360
My leg healed so quickly.

372
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,199
Hu Fei.

373
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:58,800
Are you done?

374
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,519
Okay, I'm almost done.

375
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,560
Don't come here.

376
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,719
I haven't put on my pants.

377
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,279
I'm coming.

378
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
I'm done.

379
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,840
Sorry for the wait.

380
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,880
Lazy people always need the loo.

381
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,959
Why are you so slow?

382
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,640
It was because of the leg.

383
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:27,679
What happened?

384
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:29,999
Perhaps

385
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,640
it's not entirely healed.

386
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,199
And I've been
squatting for a long time,

387
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,999
the fracture site feels numb.

388
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,640
Really?

389
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,999
You were very active
on the way down the mountain.

390
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,199
But it hurts a little.

391
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,080
I'll hold you.

392
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,719
Okay.

393
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,320
Father.

394
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,239
Are you alright, Father?

395
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm fine.

396
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,080
Get up.

397
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,920
I'll hold you.

398
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,920
Let's go.

399
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,120
Pay to pass.

400
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:22,880
Stop!

401
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,519
Don't be afraid.

402
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,160
What's going on, Father?

403
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Fellow heroes.

404
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,880
Father.

405
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,479
Please tell me your names.

406
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,199
Old Master Feng.

407
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,039
It's me.

408
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,840
God has mercy on me.

409
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,360
It's not cooked yet.

410
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,479
Hold on.

411
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:14,239
What types of mushrooms are these?

412
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:16,199
This is shaggy mane.

413
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,039
This is hygrophorus.

414
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:19,640
I picked them from the forest.

415
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:22,679
Ziyi, you're awesome.

416
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:23,999
Not only that
you're good in martial art,

417
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,479
but you're also good at cooking.

418
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,199
This is nothing.

419
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,800
If we added in

420
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,120
matsutake and
true morels of Tianshan,

421
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,039
it would be a true delicacy.

422
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,439
You have no idea.

423
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,039
In Tianshan when I was a child,

424
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:37,320
after rain,

425
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,039
I would pick mushrooms in the forest.

426
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,560
I need to stop talking.

427
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,039
I'm going to drool.

428
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:48,239
Turns out you're from Tianshan.

429
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,439
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

430
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,880
I told you everything about me.

431
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,479
Yet I don't know anything about you.

432
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,080
Why do you need to know about this?

433
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,600
I of course have to know.

434
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,999
Didn't you promise

435
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,479
to obey me?

436
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,239
I'm asking you not
to inquire about all these.

437
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,080
Okay.

438
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,120
I'll stop asking.

439
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,039
Why don't you

440
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,039
take this chance

441
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,479
to massage my leg?

442
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,519
Wasn't it enough?

443
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,479
I was massaging
your leg the entire journey.

444
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,840
I just feel a little numb.

445
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:28,519
After giving it a thought,

446
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,439
it was perhaps
because I carried you down the mountain.

447
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,239
I told you not to, but you insisted.

448
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:37,840
Why did you show off?

449
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,959
I just wanted to repay you.

450
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:51,920
Master.

451
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:54,880
You didn't come
to Foshan from Tianshan

452
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,719
because I left without permission.

453
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,039
Did something happen?

454
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,800
I know that

455
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,239
the grudge between you and Feng Family

456
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,600
must be solved someday.

457
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,759
I was afraid that
you might act recklessly,

458
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,920
so I came to stop you.

459
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:13,479
I didn't expect

460
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,880
to find out on the way here

461
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,759
that the imperial court used World's
Sect Leaders Gathering as an excuse

462
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,080
to distribute Hero Invitation

463
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:20,959
and attempt to provoke a sectarian war

464
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,279
and a martial art world infighting.

465
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,600
Chief Chen

466
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,360
doesn't care about the martial art world
in the recent years.

467
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,959
I don't want
the upright people to suffer.

468
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:32,519
I want to take you
to visit the upright sects

469
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:33,759
to discuss a strategy.

470
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,679
Master.

471
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,199
I'll go with you.

472
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,320
Follow your heart.

473
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,320
Take care of the injured first.

474
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,039
Master.

475
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,160
There's something

476
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,999
I'm not sure if I should tell.

477
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,959
On my way to Foshan,

478
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:53,679
I've seen the evil sects collude

479
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,759
and gather.

480
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,320
If the upright sects
don't go to the capital,

481
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,999
these dregs of the martial art world

482
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:00,080
will miss a good opportunity.

483
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,400
The imperial court
invited the leaders of various sects over

484
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,560
to force them to obey and to take over

485
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,479
the martial art world.

486
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:08,120
If we can

487
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,360
recruit the sects that plan to derail

488
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,239
the martial art world,

489
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,239
the Leaders Gathering

490
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:13,759
won't work out.

491
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,080
How to recruit them?

492
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,199
Take over the position of their leaders.

493
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,120
How great would it be

494
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,320
if this lasts forever?

495
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:30,999
Do you want me to serve you forever?

496
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,279
I don't mind.

497
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:34,080
I do.

498
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,600
Try walking on your own

499
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:52,600
to see if it got better.

500
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,279
It's still a little numb.

501
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,120
I can't use much strength.

502
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,279
Support me.

503
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:58,999
Here.

504
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,920
(Auspicious Wind)

505
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,880
(Auspicious Wind)
This shouldn't be.

506
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,519
(Auspicious Wind)

507
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,759
(Auspicious Wind)
Have you been practicing secretly?

508
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,160
(Auspicious Wind)

509
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,959
(Auspicious Wind)
How is it possible?

510
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,239
We've been together all the time.

511
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,519
I didn't have the chance to practice.

512
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Besides numbness,

513
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
what else do you feel?

514
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,920
The injury site

515
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,800
feels cool.

516
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,640
It has been raining recently

517
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,519
and we've been on the move.

518
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:25,800
It's possible that the coolness caused

519
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,600
poor blood flow.

520
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,479
That's the biggest taboo for fractures.

521
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,080
Let's find an inn to rest.

522
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,239
Okay.

523
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,239
May I know

524
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,080
where I can find an inn?

525
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,920
Junzilai Inn is over there.

526
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,080
Thank you.

527
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,479
Welcome in.

528
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,479
Sir,

529
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,600
we would like to have two rooms.

530
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,719
Sorry,

531
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,959
we only have one room left.

532
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,600
Really?

533
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,560
Yes.

534
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,600
Well,

535
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,279
one room is not good.

536
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,759
Is there anyone checking out?

537
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,439
The earliest one
will be tomorrow morning.

538
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:32,840
Let's go.

539
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:37,959
What's going on?

540
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,560
Nothing. It hurts a little.

541
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,279
Let's find another inn.

542
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,039
Sir.

543
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,160
We're the only inn

544
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,719
in this town.

545
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:51,880
There must be a way.

546
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,439
Forget it.

547
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:56,360
One room it is then.

548
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,999
We'll take

549
00:33:58,999 --> 00:33:59,640
this room.

550
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:00,840
Okay.

551
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,560
Waiter.

552
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,039
Take the guests to their room.

553
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,640
Sir, this way.

554
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,039
Follow me.

555
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:14,719
Here.

556
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,439
One, two, go.

557
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,479
One, two, go.

558
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:22,920
Let's drink.

559
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,120
Another one.

560
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,800
Drink.

561
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,840
Here. Drink.

562
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Good wine.

563
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,239
Brothers.

564
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:36,199
Fill your bowl with wine.

565
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,679
Toast to Old Master Feng.

566
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,600
-To Old Master Feng.
-To Old Master Feng.

567
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,999
Alright.

568
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,400
Brothers.

569
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:55,199
I've prepared

570
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,400
some taels.

571
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,840
Please accept them.

572
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,959
Thank you, Old Master Feng.

573
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,600
Hurry up.

574
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:19,600
Brothers.

575
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,039
Thank Old Master Feng.

576

Please distribute them.

579
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,920
Brothers, get your reward.

580
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:28,920
Okay.

581
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,800
Mine.

582
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,160
Mine.

583
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,039
Father, there's so much money.

584
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,239
Who's the leader?

585
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
Caoyun Wharf

586
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,840
is one of my businesses.

587
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,360
All these years,

588
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,479
it has been managed by Liu Zhiguo.

589
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,479
He made a lot of taels for me.

590
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,840
Even if you earned a lot,

591
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,800
you shouldn't give them so much.

592
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,200
Son.

593
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,959
Taels can be earned again.

594
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,639
We've fallen into this situation.

595
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,320
We can't lose face now.

596
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:12,760
Or else,

597
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,800
they won't work hard for you.

598
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,720
Liu Zhiguo must have found out

599
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,439
what happened to us in Foshan.

600
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:22,840
However,

601
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,159
he didn't expose us.

602
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:27,200
It's obvious that

603
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,240
he's still loyal to us.

604
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,039
This person

605
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,360
is a worthy friend.

606
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,439
Father, this is to you.

607
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:44,360
Okay.

608
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,119
-Thank you, Old Master Feng.
-Thank you, Old Master Feng.

-Thank you, Old Master Feng.

Old Master Feng.

611
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,800
You've domineered
Foshan for so many years.

612
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,280
You'll surely make a comeback soon.

613
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,479
Thank you.

614
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,360
Let's not talk about upsetting matters.

Lest whenever the weather is cool,

618
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,760
you'll suffer pain.

It hurts.

623
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,240
Get well soon.

624
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,360
I have a serious matter to attend to.

625

You're delaying it.

What do you want to do?

00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:21,519
I can come with you.

I don't need your company.

629

What do you mean?

630
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,599
That means as soon as my leg is healed,

631
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,159
you'll leave?
