=Episode 27=

3
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,000
Lingsu,

4
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:47,720
the capital is different
from where we've been.

5
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,839
There are plenty of things
I've never seen before.

6
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,199
There are more streets here

7
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,479
than any normal town.

8
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,400
Every street is crowded with people.

9
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,479
There is so much to see here.

10
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,279
We might even

11
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,959
run into the people we want to meet.

12
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:04,799
You mean Ziyi?

13
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
No way, that'd be too good
of a coincidence.

14
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,599
Fei, it's sugar painting.

15
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,840
Sugar painting!

16
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,920
Get your sugar painting here!

17
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,160
Lingsu, would you like one?

18
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:18,719
Here.

19
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,880
Thanks.

20
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,999
Would you stop eating?

21
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,719
Master sent us here to get things done.

22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,319
Martial Sister, you got it wrong.

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,399
I'm finally in the capital

24
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,599
and Master is busy with

25
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,079
curing the Old Madam's sickness.

26
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,599
Of course I must eat heartily

27
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,440
and have fun.

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,439
Martial Sister, you've changed.

29
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,560
What do you mean?

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,159
It's hard to put into words.

31
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,040
But ever since you sneaked off the mountain,

32
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,760
you've been different after I met you.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,200
Don't be silly.

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,719
I'm telling the truth.

35
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,999
You're aware of that too.

36
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:56,279
You used to tell me everything,

37
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,879
now you tell me nothing.

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,840
You're always in a daze

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,879
and spaced out.

40
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,200
Sugar painting!

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,079
Martial Sister, do you like this?

42
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:05,879
I'll buy one for you.

43
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,719
Never mind.

44
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,760
Masks!

45
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
Young lady, feel free to browse around.

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,519
Put it on.

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,200
You keep frowning
and putting on a long face.

48
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,560
You're like a gloomy old lady.

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,560
Excuse me!

50
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:00,720
Yeah!

51
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,200
Great!

52
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,359
Great!

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,399
Again!

54
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,320
Great!

55
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,399
Great!

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,880
Well done!

57
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,200
This show is awesome.

58
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
I just saw Ziyi.

59
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,519
Ziyi!

60
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,440
Is it you, Ziyi?

61
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,239
My name is not Ziyi.

62
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,839
People call me Caiyi,
Lvyi, and Fenhong Yi.

63
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,880
What's wrong?

64
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,480
Do all men in the capital

65
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,359
simply go after a girl without even

66
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,720
knowing her name first?

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,160
Sorry, I...

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I mistook you for someone.

69
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:33,559
Welcome back.

70
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,480
Your horses are well-fed.

71
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,079
Do you need any food?

72
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,280
Yes, give me two jin of hay.

73
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,480
He's tired.

74
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,559
Send the food to his room.

75
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,639
Yes, of course.

76
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,359
Fei, the hay you ordered

77
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,840
is too much for me alone.

78
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:10,840
Hay?

79
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:14,960
It was a slip of the tongue.

80
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,319
It must be embarrassing.

81
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,520
I don't mind if you misspeak.

82
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,999
But if you mistake someone for her,

83
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,679
people will certainly get upset at you.

84
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,439
Will you believe me, Lingsu?

85
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,160
I really did see her

86
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,319
at the juggling troupe.

87
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,720
But somehow...

88
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
Of course I believe you.

89
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,040
If a girl wishes to avoid you,

90
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,840
she has countless ways to do so.

91
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,879
Avoiding me?

92
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,400
Is it because she stopped me

93
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,600
from Killing Feng Tiannan?

94
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,199
I fought her,

95
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,439
that must be why she holds
a grudge against me.

96
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,879
Fei, at Hero Miao's home,

97
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,600
he admitted killing your parents.

98
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,439
Why didn't you take his life?

99
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,359
I...

100
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,520
You didn't kill him because
you didn't want to

101
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,119
murder an unarmed blind man.

102
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:07,920
But, there must be more to that.

103
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,280
Young Lady Yuan stopped you,

104
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,040
but she probably had
a good reason for doing so.

105
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,799
I don't resent her for stopping me.

106
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,720
I don't blame her for avoiding me.

107
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,879
But if she had her reasons,

108
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,879
why wouldn't she let me know?

109
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:26,960
Fei.

110
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,400
You miss her deeply,

111
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,119
you two will cross paths again.

112
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,439
I hope so.

113
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,559
Martial Sister.

114
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,960
What's on your mind?

115
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,439
I get it now.

116
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,520
You're thinking about

117
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,920
the guy we met at the market.

118
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,199
Who is he to you?

119
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,920
Did you meet him after you left?

120
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,359
You spent a long time in Foshan.

121
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,920
Something extraordinary
must have happened.

122
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,559
Am I right?

123
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,920
You got it all wrong.

124
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,400
If it's only a friend in the martial arts world,

125
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,400
you could have just said hello to him.

126
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,799
But you were avoiding him.

127
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,679
You even asked me
to change into your robe

128
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,359
so he could mistake me for you.

129
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,840
You went to such
an extreme length for that.

130
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:43,720
Martial Sister, is there a secret

131
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,520
between the two of you?

132
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:46,920
Nonsense.

133
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,679
We are in the capital.

134
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,799
There are eyes and ears everywhere.

135
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,480
I wanted to avoid trouble.

136
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I think something

137
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,799
is going on between you two.

138
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,280
I wonder why he's here?

139
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,359
He was with a young lady too.

140
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,600
Who do you think

141
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,199
that young lady is?

142
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:09,999
Martial Sister,
should I ask around for you?

143
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,400
No.

144
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,960
Master asked you to stay here

145
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:15,559
because you have a job.

146
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
If you fail your job

147
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,439
and ruin her plan,

148
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,920
how will you explain then?

149
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Fine, I'll stay.

150
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,439
It's not my worry anyway.

151
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,239
But someone here is keeping
all the frustration

152
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,520
to herself.

153
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,799
Chief Tang and Chief Feng.

154
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:41,239
Thank you for coming.

155
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,080
I apologize

156
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:45,080
for this late-night visit.

157
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,319
My third brother

158
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,840
spotted the man
Chief Feng was looking for.

159
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,799
We are here to report it.

160
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,239
He's really here?

161
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,480
We are absolutely certain of it.

162
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,679
I followed him a long way.

163
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,119
I saw him entering an inn.

164
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,520
I bet

165
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,319
he'll be staying in the capital
for quite some time.

166
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:06,520
He's actually here!

167
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,480
Chief Feng, calm down.

168
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,920
We'd discussed this matter

169
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,199
with the others.

170
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:14,000
As soon as he entered the capital,

171
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,040
we'd have him under our control.

172
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,199
Your feud with him

173
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,839
will finally be put to an end.

174
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:26,280
I'm counting on all three of you
to see to this matter.

175
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,079
Certainly.

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,079
In that case,

177
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,719
we shall proceed as planned.

178
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,880
Thank you.

179
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,719
Sure. Goodbye.

180
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,679
Congratulations, Mother.

181
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,599
You've made a full recovery.

182
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,280
You look as healthy as you were before.

183
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,160
Really?

184
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:56,400
I think

185
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,599
Mother is even more beautiful
and charming than before.

186
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,640
You outshine all of us.

187
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,240
How sweet of you.

188
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,640
You're always good with words.

189
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,520
I didn't do anything.

190
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,319
All credits go to the Reverend.

191
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,520
You two,

192
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,360
thank her for me.

193
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,599
Amitabha.

194
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:14,559
The medicine worked

195
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,120
because you are a blessed person.

196
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,120
I dare not take any credit.

197
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:20,719
You are too humble.

198
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,319
When Mother was ill,

199
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,959
the entire family was worried about her.

200
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:27,640
Officials were sent from
the palace to learn her condition.

201
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,079
Thanks to your miraculous medicine,

202
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:31,920
we can finally be relieved.

203
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:33,439
Indeed.

204
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,040
We must thank you properly.

205
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,959
You must be rewarded.

206
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,360
In the Buddhist teaching,

207
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,799
you see the Buddha's blessing
when the flower blooms.

208
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:48,520
Flowers in the garden are blooming.

209
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,240
It's truly a Buddhist paradise.

210
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,000
Please allow me

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,880
to enjoy this wonderful view.

212
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:57,199
That's all I ask.

213
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,880
Certainly.

214
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,559
Not only will I join you,

215
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,079
I'd love

216
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,439
to enjoy this view admired
even by a Buddhist.

217
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Amitabha.

218
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,760
It's your destiny to be enlightened.

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,959
You will find the answer you seek
in the sea of flowers.

220
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,839
What are we waiting for?

221
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,559
Mother, let's go there now.

222
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,559
Sure.

223
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,799
Let me handle it.

224
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,520
Even the flowers
have learned of your joy.

225
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,760
They are sending their blessing
with their blooming.

226
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,319
Greetings, Mother.

227
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,160
May you live well and prosper.

228
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
At ease.

229
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,000
You wish me wellness
and prosperity every day.

230
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,799
Today, I am truly

231
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,760
living well and prospering.

232
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:46,640
You are happy today.

233
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,439
I shall join you
on this walk in the garden.

234
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,719
According to the Reverend,

235
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,160
we see Buddha's blessing
within the flowers.

236
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,000
It's a great omen for us all.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,880
The flowers show us Buddha's
blessing and our eternal selves.

238
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,880
Faith is our companion.

239
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,920
You have faith in your heart.

240
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,799
You can sense the world.

241
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,479
Hence, all shall end well for you.

242
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,079
Mother, look.

243
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,079
That twins lotus is so beautiful.

244
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,040
The twins lotus in the pond

245
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:15,880
is almost impossible

246
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,839
to see one blooming.

247
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,679
But today, it's here to feel our joy.

248
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,040
You misunderstood, Commander.

249
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,719
Lotus is a majestic plant in Buddhism.

250
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,799
Two flowers bloom on one stalk,

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,280
it's heavenly protection by Buddha.

252
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,000
There is yet another blessing
coming your way, Commander.

253
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,760
It's certainly delightful

254
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,520
to see that Mother
has made a full recovery.

255
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,079
What more

256
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,679
can be just as great?

257
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,719
Perhaps Kang'an has performed so well

258
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,520
that His Majesty is rewarding him?

259
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,079
Congratulations, Mother.

260
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,199
I have found my two children

261
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:51,839
who were separated from me years ago.

262
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:55,559
These children shall
take great care of you.

263
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,479
Two children?

264
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:01,160
It's just like the twins lotus!

265
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,640
These children came out of nowhere.

266
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,880
We've heard nothing about that.

267
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,120
I hope you're not getting deceived.

268
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,760
Mother, it was a long story.

269
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
But the children

270
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,160
are indeed mine.

271
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,360
They are five years old now.

272
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,199
Wait, they are already five years old?

273
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,959
Did you hook up

274
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,880
with another peasant out there?

275
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,120
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

276
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,920
How could you make
the same mistake again?

277
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,240
Mother.

278
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:40,839
Those children are indeed mine.

279
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:42,559
Blood is thicker than water.

280
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,479
I can't abandon my own children

281
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,599
and leave them to their fate.

282
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,520
Amitabha.

283
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,839
Karma is eternal
and causality is a constant.

284
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,559
Your fate with others was
destined in your past life.

285
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,719
It's beyond us to alter fate.

286
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,199
You are well-versed in Buddhism,

287
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,839
you should know this.

288
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,000
Indeed, Mother.

289
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:07,880
Would you like to meet the children?

290
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,000
As for the details,

291
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,719
we can discuss them later.

292
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,920
(Tianlong)

293
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,760
Physician, how is she?

294
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:40,040
Well...

295
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,280
She is mostly well now.

296
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,760
I'll prescribe some medicine

297
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:48,959
for further nourishing.

298
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,599
I should see the physician off.

299
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,360
Please, come with me.

300
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,679
Here.

301
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,439
Was there something
you were keeping from her?

302
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,120
You may speak freely now.

303
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,280
Is there something wrong
with Lan's condition?

304
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,520
It's taken a toll on her body.

305
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,679
I'm afraid...

306
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,640
I'm afraid she can't
conceive another child.

307
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,120
Chief, I am a lowly apothecary.

308
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,079
Perhaps I could be wrong.

309
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,280
You should hire other
physicians to examine her.

310
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:00,439
This is...

311
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,559
It's very serious.

312
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,679
If Lan found out, she'd...

313
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,760
It'd be too much for her.

314
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,400
Do not tell anyone,

315
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,760
especially not Lan. Is that clear?

316
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes, Leader Tian.

317
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,240
I should go now.

318
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,260
(County King's Residence)

319
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,520
Mother, what is this place?

320
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,920
Why are we here?

321
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,880
Mother, I'm uncomfortable with this outfit.

322
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,439
I've told you many times.

323
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,040
Do not scratch your shirt.

324
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,479
When you see Old Madam,

325
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,439
you must behave.

326
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,000
Remember

327
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,319
what I told you.

328
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,599
Mother,

329
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,839
why are we seeing Old Madam?

330
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,400
The Old Madam

331
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,999
is your grandma.

332
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:43,320
Alright, please come in.

333
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,239
Wait here, Madam.

334
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,560
The Commander

335
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,759
wants to see the children first.

336
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,320
Mother...

337
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,360
No...

338
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:03,999
Don't worry.

339
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,439
I'll be right here waiting for you.

340
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,039
Let's go.

341
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:27,840
Pingping, An'an.

342
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,439
Greet your grandmother.

343
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,120
Go on, greet your grandmother.

344
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,160
-Nice to see you, Grandmother.
-Nice to see you, Grandmother.

345
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
They look healthy and strong.

346
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,479
They look quite similar
to the children

347
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,759
next to the Guanyin statue.

348
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,239
Mother, don't you agree?

Amitabha.

350
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:54,640
Children, go to your grandmother.

351
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,560
Go on.

352
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,039
Do you like pebbles too?

353
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,719
What do you mean?

354
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,239
Grandmother, let's play
together with pebbles.

355
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,279
I've lived decades,

356
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:17,199
this is the first time
anyone has invited me to play.

357
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:20,320
Children are often the most insightful.

358
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,679
You seem kind and friendly.

359
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,360
The children love you.

360
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,279
Are you saying

361
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,320
I'm an old kid to them?

362
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:35,479
One for you.

363
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:41,160
One for you. Take it.

364
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,959
Children, thank Grandmother for the gift.

365
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,999
Don't say that.

366
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,479
These are not gifts.

367
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,120
You heard what they said.

368
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,679
These are pebbles.

369
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,400
Have fun with them.

370
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:58,880
Congratulations, Old Madam.

371
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:01,600
A good deed has been fulfilled.

372
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,279
Thank you, Reverend.

373
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,640
Please accept this.

374
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,400
This is yours.

375
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,840
This is for you.

376
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,640
This is the land deed.

377
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,759
I'm counting on you
to take care of it tomorrow.

378
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,279
Chief Tang and Chief Feng.

379
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,479
I assure you,

380
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,320
this mission

381
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,039
shall be completed flawlessly.

382
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:42,719
Farewell.

383
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,840
Thank you.

Fei.

386
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,160
Maybe the lady we ran into

387
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,840
next to the troupe was Young Lady Yuan.

388
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,320
We should go there

389
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
and try our luck again.

390
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,239
Forget it.

391
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:17,479
We should focus on
searching for the villain.

392
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,800
The capital is only so vast,

393
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,080
it's not going to take too long.

394
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,039
I went after a lady,

395
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,999
but it wasn't her.

396
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,880
Perhaps I really did get it all wrong.

397
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,800
You went through life and
death with Young Lady Yuan.

398
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,840
You couldn't have been wrong.

399
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,039
We must find her

400
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,080
and get some answer.

401
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,959
You've been so thoughtful to me.

402
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,279
I don't even know

403
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,999
how to repay your kindness.

404
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,199
I am a healer, after all.

405
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:44,239
You couldn't eat or sleep
when thinking of her.

406
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,120
It's like you're sick.

407
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,679
I have to get you healed.

408
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,439
A troubled heart
required a special brew.

409
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,719
My treatment

410
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,999
will help you find Young Lady Yuan.

411
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,239
Brother Hu!

412
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:55,360
Brother Wang.

413
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,640
When did you arrive?

414
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:57,759
You should have come to me.

415
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,439
My sister and I arrived yesterday.

416
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,759
We didn't have the time
to pay you a visit.

417
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,880
Say no more.

418
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,999
Let's grab a drink together.

419
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:04,840
Brother Wang.

420
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,719
We have personal matters to tend to.

421
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,120
Personal matters?

422
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,439
You have plenty of time for that.

423
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,400
Besides,

424
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,840
you've traveled a long way.

425
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:13,439
As your brother,

426
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,840
I must give you a proper welcome.

427
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,640
Well...

428
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:17,759
You can decide.

429
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:20,199
Very well.

430
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:20,959
This way.

431
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,360
Thank you

432
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,999
for helping me out, Reverend.

433
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,439
Your kindness

434
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,679
will not be forgotten.

435
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:33,080
Monastics must be merciful.

436
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,999
I can't let you be separated
from your own children.

437
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,320
The deed has been fulfilled.

438
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,239
My mind is at ease.

439
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,320
When I return home,

440
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:45,679
I shall continue to pray

441
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,719
for you and your mother.

442
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,719
Are you leaving already?

443
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,759
As you must have heard,

444
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:56,239
World's Sect Leaders Gathering
is just around the corner.

445
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:58,279
Chiefs from different sects

446
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,800
have reached the accommodation.

447
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,640
The Tianshan Sect
has been a prominent sect.

448
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:05,640
You certainly must attend the council.

449
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:10,199
The Tianshan Sect practices Buddhism and
is not bothered by worldly conflicts.

450
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:13,239
We prefer not to get involved.

451
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,519
Perhaps you haven't heard.

452
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,360
This is a gathering

453
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,759
of different sects.

454
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,320
The Imperial Court will
select several sects

455
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,320
to lead the others in service
of the Imperial Court.

456
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,120
To be fair,

457
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,999
the Tianshan Sect is powerful.

458
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,519
You are respected.

459
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,199
On the personal side of thing,

460
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,999
you cured my mother.

461
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,759
You helped me reunite with my children.

462
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,679
One way or another,

463
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:45,719
I owe it to you to treat you
and the Tianshan Sect as my most

464
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:46,719
prestigious guests.

465
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,560
I saved one of the Dragon Cups

466
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,600
given by His Majesty for you.

467
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,759
You are too generous.

468
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,759
If I turned down the offer,

469
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,560
it'd be very rude of me.

470
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,959
This isn't because
of my generosity,

471
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,560
but because you're worthy of it.

The banquet is ready to go.

477
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,400
We have hot pot, fried squirrel fish,

478

sixi meatballs, and grilled shrimps.

479
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,279
Enough about that.

480
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,880
Bring me all the signature dishes

481
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,999
that you have here.

482
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,800
My brother has traveled a long way.

483
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,880
Do not leave him slighted,

484
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,479
or I'll smash your shop.

485
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,959
You can count on me.

486
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,360
Come on, Brother Hu.

487
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,360
Brother Wang,

488
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,600
it's just the three of us.

489
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,800
We can't finish that much food.

490
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,439
Brother Hu, you don't
come to this city every day.

491
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,920
I must give you a proper welcome.

492

The Juying Restaurant

493
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,080
has plenty of officials as its regulars.

494
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,840
The chef here

495
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,400
used to work in the royal kitchen.

496
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:51,999
All the dishes on the menu

497
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,719
are top-notched.

498
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,640
Be sure to try them out.

499
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,759
It must be expensive

500
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,039
to dine here.

501
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,880
It must pay well to be an official here.

502
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:05,679
With my salary,

503
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,479
I can't even afford this meal.

504
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,320
Are you going to

505
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,600
put it on a tab?

506
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,719
Brother Hu, I'll be honest with you.

507
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,560
With our meager salary,

508
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:18,320
we can barely provide for our families.

509
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,519
But why do people
want to become officials?

510
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,160
We'll sit down and talk over the meal.

511
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,400
Take a seat.

512
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:29,719
Young Lady Cheng.

513
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,479
Lingsu.

514
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,279
Brother Hu and Young Lady Cheng.

515
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,519
Come.

516
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:47,039
You asked why people
wanted to become officials.

517
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,999
An official has more than
one stream of revenue.

518
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,320
As long as you hold a title,

519
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,320
the people will rely on you
to get things done.

520
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,679
Hence, they must pay tribute to you.

521
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,719
As for the tribute,

522
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,920
it's up to you.

523
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
But,

524
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,719
how can the people afford to live?

525
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,800
Won't they file a report?

526
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Report to whom?

527
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,360
Do you think officials
only meddle with money?

528
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,279
Food and luxuries are not
the most costly aspect.

529
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:16,160
The most costly expenditure

530
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,080
is the money you need
for your network of associates.

531
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,719
Let's not talk about that.

532
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,320
Eat and drink heartily.

533
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,880
Try the best hot pot
in the capital.

534
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,080
Brother Hu?

535
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,479
Brother Hu,

536
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,360
I sent my man to invite my two brothers.

537
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,479
They wish to join us

538
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:37,679
for this banquet.

539
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:39,800
Brother Hu.

540
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:42,080
I heard you've come.

541
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:45,239
My brethren and I are here
for a drink with you.

542
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,640
- Brother Hu.
- Brother Hu.

543
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,840
Come, let's all sit down.

544
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:49,800
Come on.

545
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,920
This is all Shang Baozhen's fault.

546
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,199
He got all mysterious

547
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,279
just to make a fool out of us.

548
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:59,439
Otherwise, with our relationship
with Brother Hu here,

549
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:00,800
we wouldn't have made a move.

550
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,320
Well said, Wang.

551
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,920
Brother Hu, this is a fateful meeting.

552
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,800
Stay after the meal.

553
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:07,080
Let's gamble a little

554
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,959
and have some fun.

555
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,400
Gamble?

556
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:11,999
Have you not heard?

557
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,840
The bunch of us

558
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,999
love gambling.

559
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:17,120
The bet is but a small amount,
so we don't mind it.

560
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,600
And, no one would
cause us trouble.

561
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,560
It's just some friends

562
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,519
having fun together.

563
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:22,999
Yes, it's fun.

564
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,560
In that case,

565
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,800
I shall gladly join you.

566
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,759
Well said!

567
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:31,640
Brothers, raise a toast.

568
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,679
Come.

569
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:33,679
To Brother Hu's health.

570
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:34,400
Cheers.

571
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,959
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

572
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,679
Mother.

573
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,400
The children and the nun
have been settled down.

574
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,439
Yes.

575
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,400
Mother.

576
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,840
Dismissed.

577
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:18,759
Mother, officers from
the palace just came.

578
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,039
His Majesty has learned
of my two children.

579
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,600
He is overjoyed.

580
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,120
Do you find that worth celebrating?

581
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,560
I simply didn't
want to embarrass you.

582
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,360
That was why I let them stay.

583
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,719
This scandal is humiliating.

584
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:37,679
The whole city knows who you are.

585
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,479
Be mindful of your status.

586
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,160
No matter how strong
and healthy the kids are,

587
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,880
their mother

588
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:48,439
is still a peasant nonetheless.

589
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,279
Mother.

590
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,880
Do you wish to see my bloodline end

591
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,959
and me die in loneliness?

592
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,080
I know you feel sorry for me.

593
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,679
But regardless
of their mother's background,

594
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,080
they are still my children.

595
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,640
Yes, they are yours.

596
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,600
I'm not saying I don't want them.

597
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:12,640
Mother.

598
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:15,800
You haven't met Hua.

599
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,959
She is the mother.

600
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,840
She may be a commoner,

601
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:22,039
but she was raised well.

602
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:25,239
I've ordered the teacher
to teach her our rules.

603
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,320
I'll bring her here
when she finishes the lessons

604
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,400
so you two may meet.

605
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,959
Mother.

606
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
Think of her as another family
to take care of you.

607
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,880
Mother, come on.

608
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,120
Fine.

609
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,800
What's done is done.

610
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,640
Nothing I say can sway you.

611
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,439
I know you're the best.

612
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,519
Fine.

613
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,360
Tell the woman

614
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,400
I'll be keeping the children here.

615
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,880
I need to teach them the rules
and customs here.

616
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,600
If you see to that personally,

617
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,039
it will be a great relief.

618
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:12,160
Not so hard.

619
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,120
Yes.

620
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,039
A bunch of worthless fools!

621
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,400
Her children live here now!

622
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,080
It won't be long before
she takes my place!

623
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,999
Yet, I wasn't informed of anything.

624
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,640
You are all worthless to me!

625
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Alright.

626
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,759
Taking it out on the servants

627
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,640
won't change the fact
her children are here.

628
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,800
I should burn this place to the ground!

629
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:34,640
If I must,

630
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,120
I shall take my husband with me!

631
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,039
Silence.

632
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,080
You know how powerful Kang'an is.

633
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,999
You can't afford to hurt those children.

634
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,120
He'd execute your entire family

635
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,199
if you hurt them.

636
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:49,679
Leave.

637
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,479
Hailan,

638
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,600
what's done is done.

639
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:06,360
A royal decree was sent here just now.

640
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,880
His Majesty is
overjoyed by this reunion.

641
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,360
You're not powerful enough
to stand against them now.

642
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,959
Princess, what should I do now?

643
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:17,320
Are you out of your mind?

644
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:20,320
His Majesty approved
of your marriage with Kang'an.

645
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,999
No matter how many women he brings home,

646
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,880
you are the eldest sister.

647
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:25,880
Sister?

648
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:28,080
If she calls me that,

649
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,920
she's taking years off my life.

650
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,600
Hailan,

651
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,519
I've asked around.

652
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,640
That woman is Ma Chunhua.

653
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,160
She's from the martial art world.

654
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,120
She doesn't know
the rules of the palace.

655
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:48,800
She won't be able to stand it here.

656
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:03,999
Sorry.

657
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,560
Brother Hu.

658
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,800
Fortune is on your side today.

659
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,320
Within one hour,

660
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,920
you've won over 1,000 taels of silver!

661
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:18,120
Brother Hu, here's the money.

662
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,479
Qin,

663
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,600
did you deal the cards right?

664
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,600
Did you make me lose on purpose?

665
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,999
Brother Wang, what do you mean?

666
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,279
You can't take it out on
the dealer for your bad luck.

667
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:34,800
Brother.

668
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:35,600
Bring it here.

669
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,320
Brother!

670
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,080
Let go!

671
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,199
That's 200 taels.

672
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,800
All-in.

673
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,160
I won't lose it this time.

674
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:43,959
Deal the cards.

675
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:47,640
Raise your head!

676
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:50,039
Your steps must be straight and even!

677
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,840
Walk straight!

678
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,199
Pose the hands!

679
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,199
Straighten your back!

680
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,199
Pose the hands!

681
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:56,880
Straighten your back!

682
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,719
Mind the pacing!

683
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,279
Raise your head!

684
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:06,800
Just how dull can you be?

685
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,679
Pose the hands!

686
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,400
Raise your head!

687
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,320
Your steps must be straight and even!

688
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,439
Three for three.

689
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:18,719
Nine for nine.

690
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,640
Brother Hu, you won again.

691
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,759
This can't be a coincidence.

692
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,279
You may get lucky,

693
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,880
but not this lucky.

694
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,880
Is this game rigged?

695
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,560
Brother Wang.

696
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:39,999
What do you mean?

697
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,120
Don't be salty.

698
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,679
Brother Hu here is a friend.

699
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,880
You are only

700
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:45,239
embarrassing yourself.

701
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,400
Brother Zhou.

702
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:56,719
How much is this sword worth?

703
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,080
Appraise it for me.

704
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:04,999
This is Master Wang Chengyang's sword.

705
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,600
Yes.

706
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:10,519
It's worth at least 700 to 800 taels.

707
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,320
Very well, I'll pawn it for 500 taels!

708
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,199
Brother...

709
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,600
Brother!

710
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,199
Move aside.

711
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,479
Deal the cards.

712
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,519
A lucky hand.

713
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,880
Brother Wang,
fortune favors you this round.

714
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:13,840
You'll win this.

715
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,680
You won.

716
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,720
Heavenly Treasure!

717
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:26,200
Heavenly Treasure...

718
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,079
Brother Wang.

719
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,999
I'm not a sword wielder.

720
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:38,079
I don't need your sword.

721
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,959
I lost fair and square,
and I will own it.

722
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,840
It's not like I can't take a loss.

723
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:49,039
Brother Hu, I appreciate

724
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,039
your kind gesture.

725
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:52,840
Brother Wang.

726
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,959
Official Wang

727
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,240
is petty and salty.

728
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:58,959
Let's not invite him again.

729
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,159
Brother Wang,
this belonged to your father.

730
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,439
I won't take your precious sword.

731
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,439
Besides, we play for fun.

732
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:08,840
Don't take it too seriously.

733
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,720
You have my thanks.

734
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:14,400
I thank you on my brother's behalf.

735
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,999
Brother Hu, how generous of you.

736
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,479
Sit down.

737
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,200
How much did you win today?

738
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,439
Around 5,000 taels of silver.

739
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,559
Very well.

740
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,039
Let's play a round.

741
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,959
If I win,

742
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,959
the money goes to me.

743
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,880
If you win,

744
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,039
this letter goes to you.

745
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,360
Official Zhou.

746
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,079
What is in this letter?

747
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,639
Is it worth all the money on the table?

748
00:37:58,999 --> 00:37:59,800
Brother Hu.

749
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,119
It took a great deal

750
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,360
to win all the money here.

751
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,200
What if you lose everything

752
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,559
to my eldest brother here?

753
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,360
Why not?

754
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,599
Don't you want to know

755
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,880
what's in the letter?

756
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,800
Money lost can be retrieved.

757
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,840
I applaud your courage.

758
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:16,680
Please.

759
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:17,880
Open up.

760
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,519
Sure.

761
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,360
