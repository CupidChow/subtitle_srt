1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,759
Jin Feng.

3
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,280
Apologize to your dad.

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,160
Just go back to school.

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,039
Stop yelling.

6
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,960
No.

7
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,240
Why am I always the one apologizing?

8
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,840
Lin Jinlong came to our school first.

9
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,479
Kill me if you dare.

10
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,200
Okay.

11
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,200
Don't think you're a coward just because you've studied for a few years.

12
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,080
Let me tell you.

13
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,560
I raised you for nothing.

14
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,840
Don't talk back to me.

15
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,400
Get out!

16
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,520
Get out of my house!

17
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,560
Mom, get lost!

18
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,040
Get lost!

19
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,240
Stop!

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,600
How can you be a father?

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,000
Who are you?

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,400
This is my home.

23
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,560
Move!

24
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,440
Lin Jinfeng.

25
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,160
Come here.

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,200
Come here.

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,640
Come here!

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,040
Go!

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,920
Lin Jinfeng.

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,440
Uncle.

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,000
Sorry, uncle. Don't go.

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,360
Come back.

33
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,120
Li.

34
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,440
How about Ruotear?

35
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,800
Do you want me to buy you some water?

36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,160
Don't pretend to be nice.

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,480
She risked her life to save you.

38
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,880
Do you think this is a fake kindness?

39
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,720
Lin Ruotear.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,200
Do you have a conscience?

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,960
Am I wrong?

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
When you see me have such a scumbag father,

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,560
and a cowardly mom.

44
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,200
Seeing me living in such a shabby place,

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
and how miserable I was.

46
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,720
She was punished.

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,920
How dare you say you don't have such thoughts?

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Flying Apsaras is hopeless

49
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,280
Unbelievable!

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,240
Do you think this is the first time we know you live here?

51
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,440
You already knew.

52
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
So you've been laughing at me.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,760
Rammy.

54
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,520
No wonder you suddenly treat me so well.

55
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,240
You're so hypocritical and disgusting.

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,079
That's what you think of me.

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,360
Am I wrong?

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,120
You always pretend to be noble and kind

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,480
and make everyone happy?

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,520
Lin Ruotear.

61
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,440
Who is the hypocrite?

62
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,840
I thought

63
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,079
you were sincere to me.

64
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,680
Now I understand.

65
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,079
I fed the dog with all my heart.

66
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,760
Let's go.

67
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,000
Stop talking to her.

68
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,240
You...

69
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Let go of me!

70
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,960
Who does she think she is to blame me?

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,320
My dad left me when he was three.

72
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,480
My mom remarried to this man.

73
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,360
I have to match his preferences.

74
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,560
I'm not as good as her.

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,160
A lot of people like me without doing anything.

76
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,560
Ruo tears.

77
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,800
We like her.

78
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,480
and become good friends with her

79
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,480
not because of her background,

80
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,400
or how pleasing she is.

81
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,800
but because she's honest with people.

82
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,720
Everyone makes mistakes.

83
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,159
Not everyone is born perfect.

84
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,280
We can't choose our origin.

85
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,920
But we can choose

86
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,120
whether we should be sincere to others.

87
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,240
Do you think I don't want to?

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,760
Everyone just put it nicely.

89
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,920
Actually after they found out about my background

90
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,600
they hid me like a cockroach.

91
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,520
Who we are

92
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,920
depends on ourselves,

93
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,760
not others.

94
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,880
Don't mind what others think.

95
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,560
At least we never thought of you like that.

96
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,280
You're not alone either.

97
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,080
Wait for me.

98
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,360
Have some water.

99
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,320
Don't take it off.

100
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,480
Hurry up, you'll be late.

101
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,360
He doesn't look like a thief.

102
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,880
You can't judge a book by its cover.

103
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,480
Stop!

104
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,520
Is this how you talk behind your back?

105
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,560
Apologize to her.

106
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,160
How dare she steal from others?

107
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,080
Did you see her stealing?

108
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,040
If you have no evidence, apologize to her now.

109
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,240
Rammy.

110
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,280
Forget it. Let them talk.

111
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,680
Thank you

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,840
Thank you.

113
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
And...

114
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,200
Don't worry about it.

116
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,520
Rumors will pass soon.

117
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
Tell me if anyone bullies you.

118
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,600
I'll protect you.

119
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,920
I'm not afraid of anything with you.

120
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,920
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,480
We shouldn't skip class yesterday.

122
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,920
You're going to be a senior soon. Why are you skipping class?

123
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,000
Can you be more self-conscious?

124
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,159
Especially you, Lin Ruotear.

125
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,520
You said you would work hard to catch up with everyone.

126
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,280
I'm sorry, sir. It's all my fault.

127
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,360
I've been too nervous lately.

128
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,720
They didn't want my mood to affect my study,

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,159
so they went for a walk with me.

130
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,880
Come to me if you have any problem.

131
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,120
Don't think you can solve all the problems.

132
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,440
Please calm down.

133
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,680
We know we were wrong.

134
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,680
If there's anything,

135
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,400
we'll talk to you later.

136
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,280
Mr. Wang.

137
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,320
It's good to know your mistake.

138
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,000
These students are under great pressure.

139
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,480
It's understandable to be emotional.

140
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,920
Alright.

141
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
You four go back to the classroom first.

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,880
Mrs. Xie.

143
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,000
Ruoxi.

144
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,200
You two stay here.

145
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,240
What kind of story should I write?

146
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,760
Why do you think Mr Qiao keeps them?

147
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,680
Write a story about our deal.

148
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,520
I don't know.

149
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,880
It should be fine.

150
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,400
Xiammy.

151
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,040
What did Mr Qiao ask you to do

152
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,000
What did they ask you to do?

153
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,480
There's a school festival next month.

154
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,919
Our class plans to make a play.

155
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,760
Ms Qiao wants me to write a script.

156
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,720
Wow. Drama.

157
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,080
Great

158
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,440
I want to act with you too.

159
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,960
But we're not in the same class now.

160
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,680
What are you going to do in your class?

161
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,160
It's our class.

162
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,520
We haven't decided yet, right?

163
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,160
Mr. Wang is not interested in these.

164
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,360
Maybe just send someone to sing.

165
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,400
How about we play together?

166
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
We can sing together anyway.

167
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,280
Fan Yuan, what do you think?

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,360
Ruoxi, Xiammy.

169
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,320
The script will be harder if two classes work together.

170
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I can handle the script.

171
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,560
Are you sure you're going?

172
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,440
Rehearsal takes time.

173
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,600
I'm fine.

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,560
And I think time will be less when I'm in grade 12.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,480
I want to spend more time with you.

176
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,080
Okay.

177
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,960
As long as the teacher agrees, it's fine.

178
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,720
That's great.

179
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,560
Let's go to the base after class

180
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
after class.

181
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Let me know if you need any help.

182
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,480
Okay.

183
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,080
But you're so relaxed.

184
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,200
I can't even write it.

185
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Let me see.

186
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,840
What do you think?

187
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,840
Isn't this interesting?

188
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,080
Really?

189
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,880
Of course.

190
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,680
Although I don't know how to write,

191
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,960
but I have bad taste.

192
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,680
Don't you remember your first article?

193
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,840
I didn't hit it.

194
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,600
Yes.

195
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,520
Dear VIP users,

196
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,760
your exclusive karaoke player is online.

197
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,240
Will you choose

198
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,120
random mode or order songs?

199
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Then I want

200
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
random mode.

201
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,440
[Please tune in.]

202
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,880
I'm finally done.

203
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,200
It's so hard to be a scriptwriter.

204
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,520
That's all I can think of.

205
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,520
No.

206
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,320
We have to rehearse after finishing.

207
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
We need to buy props after rehearsal.

208
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,480
After buying props, you need to discuss the audition with your classmates.

209
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,560
It might not go well.

210
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,320
I have to hurry up.

211
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,000
Stop writing.

212
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,400
Go out with me.

213
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,640
The inspiration will come soon.

214
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,960
That's not good. The time is...

215
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,880
Should we call Ruotear and the monitor?

216
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,520
This place is so beautiful.

217
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,640
I think I've come to my senses.

218
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,920
I told you.

219
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,720
I'll write after class and after school these days.

220
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,680
My brain is full of thoughts.

221
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,400
It's time to relax.

222
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,920
Right. Let's not think about the script today.

223
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,400
Relax and you'll get inspiration tomorrow.

224
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,880
Ruotear, it's so beautiful here. Let's take a picture.

225
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,760
I told you to get changed.

226
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,160
Otherwise, it would be a pity

227
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,080
It's a pity not to wear beautiful clothes

228
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,120
It's pretty

229
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,560
The air is nice too.

230
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,080
Take a look.

231
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,560
I brought you out for fun.

232
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,040
Why didn't you bring me along?

233
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,320
That's too much.

234
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,440
Baa.

235
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,600
You came here by yourself.

236
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,360
BAUF.

237
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,120
Come on.

238
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,000
BAU.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,160
That's more like it.

240
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,960
Fan Yuan, why don't we take a photo together?

241
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,520
Sure.

242
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,680
Monitor Ruotear, let's take a photo together.

243
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,800
Let's take one together.

244
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,880
There's a boat.

245
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,440
I'm finally interested.

246
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
What a bummer.

247
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,240
What should we do?

248
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,720
Why don't we

249
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,960
do something else?

250
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,640
Ruoxi.

251
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,680
The boat is not locked.

252
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,520
What?

253
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,640
I think the ticket seller

254
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,080
went to the toilet.

255
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,200
Why don't we

256
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,440
get on the boat

257
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,280
and get the tickets back.

258
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,240
Ruoxi Zhang.

259
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Are you a pupil? Why did you sneak up on me?

260
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,080
Aren't you out of your mind?

261
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll cool you down.

262
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Xiammy. Ruoxi.

263
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,640
Stop.

264
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,240
Rammy.

265
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,600
Stop.

266
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,640
Ruoxi.

267
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,720
The boat is going to flip.

268
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,680
It's called being fair with rain and dew.

269
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,480
You guys!

270
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,760
Return the ship!

271
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,240
We're closed today.

272
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,240
Hurry.

273
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,640
Come on. Let's go.

274
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,880
I'm sorry.

275
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,360
We shouldn't have gotten off the boat and caused you trouble.

276
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,480
We're willing to write self-criticism.

277
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,600
Do you know how dangerous your behavior is?

278
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,320
Luckily nothing happened.

279
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,040
If something really happened,

280
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,840
your parents and teachers will be heartbroken.

281
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,440
How much responsibility will our park take?

282
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,640
Security.

283
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,680
This happened because of me.

284
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,640
I'm willing to take responsibility.

285
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,400
I'm willing to help the park pick up trash 29.

286
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,480
Can you forgive them first?

287
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,280
Me too.

288
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,839
I'm willing to do it too.

289
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,240
Alright.

290
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,839
For the sake of you actively apologizing,

291
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,760
Forget it this time.

292
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,079
Help pick up the trash.

293
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,560
Think of it as a lesson and reflect on yourself.

294
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,000
Don't do this again.

295
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,160
Thank you, Security.

296
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,000
We won't do it again.

297
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,160
Go.

298
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,960
These kids.

299
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,400
Okay.

300
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,400
Come on.

301
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,200
Let's get to work.

302
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,120
Let's get to work.

303
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,800
Let's go.

304
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,400
Ruo tears.

305
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,360
It's all my fault.

306
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,880
Give me yours. You can rest.

307
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,600
It's okay. I'm not tired.

308
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm actually quite happy today.

309
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Thank you.

310
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,640
You guys go and get some rest. I'll take care of the rest.

311
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,800
Ruoxi, give it to me.

312
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,320
Ruoxi, give it to me. Give it to me.

313
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,880
Give it to me.

314
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,320
It's okay.

315
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,880
Okay.

316
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,560
Let's go.

317
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,280
Give me some strength.

318
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,200
What's wrong? Are you still unhappy?

319
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,320
No, I was thinking about the script.

320
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,200
I thought I'd be inspired if I came out today.

321
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,800
But today

322
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,680
inspiration doesn't love me.

323
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,040
How about

324
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,080
you try to cover on the spot?

325
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,040
Let your protagonist pick up the trash too.

326
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,720
My protagonist is going to be a hero.

327
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,120
How can I pick up trash?

328
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,600
What are you thinking about?

329
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,040
What's wrong with picking up garbage?

330
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,280
Even a sweeper is so good, he still needs to sweep the floor.

331
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,440
Monk.

332
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,920
I got it.

333
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,760
You gave me a heart to cheer for you.

334
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,840
Now I'm giving you one.

335
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,480
Your play will be fine.

336
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,280
Okay.

337
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
With this cheering heart,

338
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,880
I'm sure I'll be able to write a good story

339
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,760
Okay.

340
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,600
Take it.

341
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,600
You can wipe it with this.

342
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,920
Thank you.

343
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,360
Fan Yuan.

344
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,320
Actually,

345
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,160
I, Monitor Ruotear

346
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,000
Are you thirsty?

347
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,560
There's a snack store over there. I'll buy you some drinks.

348
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,760
I'm fine with anything.

349
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,360
Hello?

350
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,840
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

351
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,520
What's wrong?

352
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,440
It's okay. My mom might not be feeling well.

353
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,280
I have to go home.

354
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,200
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,520
I can't send you home.

356
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,760
Go back and take care of her.

357
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,480
I'll explain to the security guard.

358
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,160
Ruoxi.

359
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,440
Call me if you need anything.

360
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,400
I'll go back now.

361
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,120
Miss Xiammy.

362
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,320
Miss Xiammy.

363
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,400
Did Ruoxi contact you?

364
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,240
He didn't reply my texts last night.

365
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
He didn't answer my calls either.

366
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,120
I asked him last night.

367
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,480
He told me not to worry about anything.

368
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,760
He replied yesterday.

369
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,120
Love before friendship.

370
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,360
That's good.

371
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,720
If he says he's fine, he'll be fine.

372
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,240
Maybe he can come back in the afternoon.

373
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,160
I'm leaving.

374
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,000
Class begins.

375
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,880
Hello.

376
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,920
Sit down.

377
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,200
In this class,

378
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,640
let's check the contents of the last class.

379
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,960
Monitor first

380
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,240
More heat can be trapped in the air

381
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,520
causing the global surface temperature to rise rapidly.

382
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,280
Not bad.

383
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,640
Next.

384
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,360
Xiammy.

385
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,680
Xiammy.

386
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,960
Xiammy.

387
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,880
Ruoxi Zhang.

388
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,000
Give it to me.

389
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,640
Grade 12 is coming.

390
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,560
You still play with your phone in class?

391
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,680
What are you doing?

392
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,720
Get out.

393
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Sir, I'll focus on my class.

394
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,800
Can you not confiscate my phone?

395
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,240
Get out.

396
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,840
Focus.

397
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,040
Focus on your class.

398
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,080
Natmmy, where are you going? Come back.

399
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,160
Do you need my help?

400
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,280
No, thanks.

401
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,440
Let me help you.

402
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,480
No, thanks.

403
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,360
Hey.

404
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,760
Let me help you.

405
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,560
Sorry.

406
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,480
Monitor, I'm sorry.

407
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,360
I was going to help you.

408
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,800
I didn't expect to trouble you.

409
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,280
I'm glad you're fine.

410
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,880
I don't want you to get hurt.

411
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,240
Let me wash it for you.

412
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,600
No.

413
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,040
Team A is cleaning today.

414
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,920
Go and study.

415
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,920
It's okay. I've finished my homework.

416
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,800
You've helped me a lot.

417
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,520
I want to do something for you.

418
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,200
No need.

419
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,680
Give it to me.

420
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,600
Tears.

421
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,720
Monitor.

422
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,240
Hello?

423
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,600
What's wrong?

424
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,560
Can you contact Zhang Ruoxi?

425
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,320
He didn't come to class today. Mr Qiao said he's on leave.

426
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,000
He didn't answer my call.

427
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,640
He turned it off right away.

428
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,600
He didn't come all day?

429
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,120
I called him this morning, but he didn't answer.

430
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,480
I'll try again.

431
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,160
[Hello, the phone is turned off.]

432
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,920
Did something happen to him?

433
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,120
Don't worry, Xiammy.

434
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,240
He might be busy.

435
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,600
He'll call you when he's done.

436
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm still worried.

437
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,240
It's okay, Xiammy.

438
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,160
Ruoxi might have run out of battery.

439
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,720
Let's go to his house later.

440
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,920
I'll go with you.

441
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,320
Okay.

442
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,200
I'll go with you.

443
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,200
Let's go.

444
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,600
He's not home either.

445
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,240
Where did she go?

446
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,160
Xiammy.

447
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,120
Maybe his phone died when he went out.

448
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,360
Don't worry too much.

449
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,720
Xiammy.

450
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,640
Fan Yuan.

451
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,400
Where have you been, Ruoxi?

452
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
You didn't come to class or answer your phone.

453
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,440
I thought something happened to you.

454
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,560
I'm sorry.

455
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,680
I was at the hospital all day.

456
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,320
My phone died.

457
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,480
How is she?

458
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,080
Did she get a check-up?

459
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,200
What did the doctor say?

460
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,680
The examination is still ongoing.

461
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,600
But it should be fine.

462
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,160
Don't worry.

463
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,120
My dad's classmate is in the provincial hospital.

464
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,040
I'll tell him.

465
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,360
Thank you.

466
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,720
It's okay.

467
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,560
Don't worry too much.

468
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,360
Have you eaten?

469
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,600
I have to go to the hospital later.

470
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,360
I came back to pack up.

471
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,520
Well...

472
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,240
I'll go in first.

473
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,320
Sorry.

474
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,520
Let me help you.

475
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,760
Ruoxi.

476
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,680
What's wrong?

477
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,680
My dad has an appointment with an expert for consultation.

478
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,520
The nurses will help in the afternoon.

479
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,040
Take a good rest for the time being.

480
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,120
Thank you.

481
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,320
You don't have to do that.

482
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,800
My aunt and aunt

483
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,160
have arranged someone to take care of my mom.

484
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,320
Okay.

485
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,440
But if you have any difficulties,

486
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,800
you must tell me immediately.

487
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,200
I really need your help.

488
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,080
I've finished the script for Natmmy.

489
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,880
You're the top student.

490
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,480
Please call everyone.

491
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,000
No problem.

492
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,200
I'll leave her to you.

493
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,600
I'm going to class.

494
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,720
Fan Yuan.

495
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,360
Congratulations on getting the admission invitation to Porn University in Germany.

496
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,600
When are you leaving?

497
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,120
Thank you.

498
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,280
I'm still thinking about it.

499
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,440
I understand.

500
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,880
Think about it.

501
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,600
But the admission date has been set.

502
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,920
You need to make a decision as soon as possible.

503
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,360
You'll feel better if you have a headache.

504
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,120
Thank you.

505
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,800
Are you worried about Ms. Jang?

506
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,080
You're a student too.

507
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,920
Actually, most of the time,

508
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,400
Ruotear.

509
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,200
After school,

510
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,360
let's summon an actor for her script.

511
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,560
Sure.

512
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,160
Let's go.

513
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,640
Go back to the classroom.

514
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,880
Really not.

515
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,720
Actually, I can...

516
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,240
Xiammy.

517
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,080
Ruoxi.

518
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,680
Monitor.

519
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,720
You're the best.

520
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,000
So many people are gathered.

521
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,200
I thought there were not many people

522
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,680
Not many people want to join.

523
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,240
Not really.

524
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Everyone is also looking forward to this festival.

525
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:56,920
By the way,

526
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,040
I haven’t seen Han all day.

527
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,840
Did she sign up?

528
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,000
What are you thinking?

529
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,000
She's going to the provincial Qingyun Games next semester.

530
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,400
She went to the swimming team for training.

531
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,600
I don't have time.

532
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,440
That's good.

533
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,080
Yes.

534
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,920
She said the training started too early.

535
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,920
It's our loss without her.

536
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,720
Let's do our best

537
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,480
so that we won't get the award.

538
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,480
Xia Mi, Ruoxi.

539
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,640
You're finally here.

540
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,360
Let's go.

541
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,280
Everyone is waiting.

542
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,400
I'm sorry.

543
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,400
I was delayed by printing the script.

544
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,160
Let's go there now.

545
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,680
Let's go.

546
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,680
Gather around.

547
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,400
First,

548
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,600
thank you very much

549
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,080
for participating in this festival.

550
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,960
I hope you can get along

551
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,120
during this period of time.

552
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,960
and create an excellent and wonderful performance together.

553
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,160
And...

554
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Thank you for responding to my call.

555
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,440
Thank you.

556
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,560
About the script,

557
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,720
has finished the script.

558
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,400
Now let her introduce

559
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,800
the general content of the story.

560
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,360
Welcome Mr. Xia.

561
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,920
Simply put,

562
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,560
it's a story about saving the princess.

563
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,200
But the protagonist of the story

564
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,240
is not a prince,

565
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,480
nor a knight.

566
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,720
but a heroine

567
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,040
Heroine.

568
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,280
The heroine and the princess are best friends since childhood.

569
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,480
When everyone is laughing at the dream of a heroine,

570
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,720
only this princess

571
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,440
Say it without hesitation.

572
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,880
you should chase your dream bravely.

573
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,720
Later,

574
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,920
the princess was kidnapped

575
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,760
she was kidnapped

576
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,240
in a tower.

577
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,880
In order to save the princess,

578
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,120
to save the princess.

579
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,640
During this process,

580
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,680
she met a master swordsman.

581
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,840
With the help of this swordsman,

582
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,280
the swordswoman beat the wizard and saved the princess.

583
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,720
If you want to know the story,

584
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,760
come and get the script from me.

585
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,480
I want it.

586
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,240
I want one too.

587
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,840
Give it to me.

588
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,120
There's no rush. We'll have everything.

589
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,199
Not bad.

590
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,199
It's really funny.

591
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,280
This princess is so funny.

592
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,040
The reason she refused the villain

593
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,760
The villain hates coriander.

594
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,080
Do you like coriander?

595
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,600
No.

596
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,800
The pair of swordsmen and swordsmen is so interesting.

597
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,040
She invited Zhuge Liang for three times.

598
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,800
She took me as her master for three times.

599
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,639
I thought there was a romantic development.

600
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,960
Romantic?

601
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,440
Even the moon is so mean in this story.

602
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,040
It has nothing to do with romance.

603
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,560
But it's really fun.

604
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,920
I told you it would be popular.

605
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,719
You didn't believe me.

606
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,440
Are you confident now?

607
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,760
Miss Xiammy,

608
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,400
Can you give me a role?

609
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,760
Anything.

610
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,080
I can play the moon too.

611
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,960
Ruoxi must be the male lead, right?

612
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,240
Who said he's the leading actor?

613
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,960
He's always on the stage.

614
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,240
I'm going to let someone else play the male lead.

615
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,240
Ruoxi is the leading actor of the promotional video.

616
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,360
Who else can do it if he doesn't?

617
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,560
I'll play the music for you this time.

618
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,240
Okay.

619
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,480
For the sake of fairness,

620
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
let's decide by drawing lots.

621
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,000
But Xiao Junyi,

622
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,000
you might really get the male lead.

623
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,360
Me?

624
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,480
I can't. I can't.

625
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,400
Do I deserve it?

626
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,040
Okay, everyone.

627
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,280
The characters are limited.

628
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,600
Let's decide the character by drawing lots.

629
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,080
Those who don't get it will be in charge of logistics.

630
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,280
Okay.

631
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,760
Draw lots.

632
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,280
Here.

633
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,600
This one.

634
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,520
It's okay. Take it easy.

635
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,240
Don't you think Ruoxi is weird?

636
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,440
There's something wrong with the way she looks at him.

637
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,440
It's normal.

638
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,840
I think you're the one who's not right.

639
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,000
Everyone, be in order.

640
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,840
Come to me in order

641
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,040
Don't push.

642
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,680
I'm the moon.

643
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,560
The least lyrics.

644
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,200
I'm a nanny.

645
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,160
What bad luck am I having?

646
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,760
I don't expect to be the male lead.

647
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,360
I can't even draw gender right now.

648
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,880
Give me a good role.

649
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,600
Princess Guard.

650
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,640
You again?

651
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
I was wondering why it's always you.

652
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,880
You're haunting me.

653
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,520
Who got the male lead and female lead?

654
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,680
Ruo tears.

655
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,360
What role did you draw?

656
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,920
I'm Maid A.

657
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,560
Who are you?

658
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,280
The last one left.

659
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,680
Hammy, haven't you drawn yet?

660
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,840
Then you must be a heroine.

661
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,360
Ruo tears.

662
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,520
Let's switch.

663
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,640
No, Xiammy.

664
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,240
You wrote the script.

665
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,840
You're also suitable to be a heroine.

666
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,000
I wrote this character

667
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,480
I wrote it because I thought of you.

668
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,800
You are the most suitable one.

669
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,720
Hey guys

670
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,000
The class monitor got that.

671
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,160
Swordsman.

672
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,120
Xia Mi is the leading man.

673
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,520
Xiammy.

674
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,960
Can I change my role?

675
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,920
I don't want to be friends with someone who takes my stuff.

676
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,520
But you don't look like a princess.

677
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,120
I'm not.

678
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,360
Just you.

679
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,960
Then you do it.

680
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,800
Monitor.

681
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,120
That's not what I meant.

682
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,840
How about

683
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,160
I should quit.

684
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,760
I think my presence will only make everyone unhappy.

685
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,120
Ruo tears.

686
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,360
Calm down.

687
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,160
The heroine in the promotional video

688
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
is experienced at least.

689
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
You can't be absent from this play.

690
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,720
We don't have much time to rehearse.

691
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,360
It's not the time to act on impulse.

692
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,080
Monitor Rong.

693
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,160
If you really don't want to act,

694
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,840
you can discuss with someone

695
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,760
Change roles.

696
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,720
I... I'm willing to change.

697
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,040
I'd rather be a princess.

698
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
than be a nanny.

699
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,040
Nanny.

700
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,120
I don't want to switch with you.

701
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,760
I'd rather be a villain

702
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,000
than be a nanny.

703
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,480
Zhao Rui,

704
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,560
What role are you drawing?

705
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,560
It's my first time being so lucky.

706
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,800
to get such an important role.

707
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,400
I won't change.

708
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,120
Well,

709
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,160
do you want to be a guard?

710
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,520
I think

711
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,760
the princess was very cool when she was against the villain.

712
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,720
I want to do it.

713
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,280
Me too. Me too.

714
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,400
What are you still dissatisfied about?

715
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,360
Our logistics team didn't get anything.

716
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,160
Right.

717
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,880
There are so many characters in Class 6.

718
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,480
I suspect you did something to them.

719
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,920
Who did?

720
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,120
What do you mean?

721
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,240
Yeah.

722
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,880
Who did it? What do you mean?

723
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Since you are not satisfied,

724
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,120
let's draw again.

725
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,160
Good idea.

726
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,520
Draw again.

727
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,920
Be quiet.

728
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,240
To be honest,

729
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,320
I'm happy and touched

730
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,320
I'm happy and touched.

731
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,160
But that's all the characters in the drama.

732
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,000
It's the most fair and reasonable way

733
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,200
is the fairest and reasonable way we can think of.

734
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,760
I hope you won't hurt each other.

735
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,920
Let's work together.

736
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,200
OK?

737
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,160
You're right.

738
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,320
The school has high hopes for our collaboration.

739
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,680
We don't want to let you down, right?

740
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,600
Don't worry about that.

741
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,600
The most important thing now is to get the stage ready.

742
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:03,880
Okay.

743
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,200
Let's start the rehearsal.

744
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,480
The logistics team will have a meeting with me later.

745
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,600
The actors team should get familiar with their roles.

746
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,480
You can ask her if you have any questions.

747
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,960
Let's show the whole school

748
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,440
what a strong combination is.

749
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,680
Yes.

750
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,960
A strong team.

751
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,840
Let's go.

752
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:34,760
Ruoxi Zhang, Tian Hongjie,

753
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:03,880
and actors.

754
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,000
The audition team.

755
