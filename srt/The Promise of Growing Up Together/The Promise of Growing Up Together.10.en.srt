1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,080
Xia Mi.

3
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,479
You're here. You're here. You're here. I'm here.

4
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,280
You are...

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,920
Didn't I run out of cream?

6
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
Xiao Yu said this brand is very useful.

7
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,720
I'm going to buy the same one.

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,400
And we're shooting a promotional video tomorrow.

9
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,280
I want to buy it outside.

10
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,440
It's quite troublesome.

11
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,200
Don't bother.

12
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,120
Use mine for the next two days.

13
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,840
Mine is good too.

14
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,160
It's okay.

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,720
Thank you.

16
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,880
I have to buy it anyway.

17
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,760
Come and get it when you need it.

18
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,560
By the way,

19
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,960
How was your meeting with the director today?

20
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,480
Today?

21
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,120
I think it's nice to meet the director.

22
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,520
And the director is nice.

23
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,520
I was a little nervous.

24
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,960
Luckily Ruoxi is more professional.

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,400
He helped me in time.

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,400
Really?

27
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,720
The sun is rising from the west.

28
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,079
He can still say good things?

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:46,960
Yes.

30
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,200
He also taught me a lot of professional knowledge.

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,880
He took care of me.

32
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,079
I was thinking if the male lead wasn't him,

33
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,440
I would...

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,600
A little.

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Forget it.

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
I'll read the lyrics first.

37
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,920
Have faith in yourself.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,520
Come on.

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,480
If you need a dialogue,

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,120
if you need any help.

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,120
You're so nice, Natmmy.

42
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,000
Come on.

43
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,800
The achievements of science are gathered little by little.

44
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,480
Only long-term accumulation

45
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,840
the ocean.

46
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,840
Hey,

47
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,160
What do you think?

48
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,400
Stop.

49
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,080
Lin Ruotear.

50
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,880
Your smile is too stiff.

51
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,000
We're shooting the school's promotional video.

52
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,560
You have to remember who you are.

53
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
You're a student.

54
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,400
I don't want a dignified smile like that.

55
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,680
Can you relax?

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,000
Sorry, director.

57
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,920
I was really nervous just now.

58
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,680
It's okay.

59
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,920
Just relax.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,680
Get ready.

61
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,200
Come on.

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,399
Three, two, one, go.

63
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,480
The achievements of science are accumulated by little.

64
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,440
Only long-term accumulation

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,240
the ocean.

66
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Hey,

67
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,159
What do you think?

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,760
Stop.

69
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,520
Relax.

70
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,240
Well,

71
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,159
Yes, like this.

72
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,560
OK. One more time.

73
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,440
Hey.

74
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,040
What do you think?

75
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,400
It's okay. Let's do it again.

76
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,840
Hey,

77
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,760
What do you think?

78
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,440
Cut.

79
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,040
Cut.

80
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,360
Cut.

81
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,000
Well...

82
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,160
Let me think about how to tell you.

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,800
Ruo tears.

84
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:31,960
Ruo tears.

85
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
That girl with short hair.

86
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,360
I mean the girl in front.

87
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,720
Rammy.

88
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm talking to you.

89
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes.

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,560
It's you.

91
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,360
Come here.

92
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,640
Hello.

93
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,000
Your smile just now

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,840
was very good.

95
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,600
and sunny.

96
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,320
How about this?

97
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,920
Can you show him?

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,920
Thank you.

99
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,360
Give me another machine.

100
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,520
Okay, get ready.

101
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,440
Three, two, one, go.

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,120
Cut.

103
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,520
This is what I want.

104
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,480
This is a very young and sunny smile.

105
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,680
Look how nice this smile is.

106
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,760
It's very appealing.

107
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,520
Right?

108
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,320
It makes people happy to see it.

109
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Did you get it?

110
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,760
Yes, director.

111
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,760
Okay.

112
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,440
Everyone should go to the bathroom.

113
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,280
Go to the bathroom.

114
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,640
You can digest it yourself, okay?

115
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,160
You look good together.

116
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,800
Miss,

117
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,360
You have a good sense of camera.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,320
But compared to this boy,

119
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,520
your talent is still not good enough.

120
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
Thank you for the compliment.

121
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,160
You have good taste.

122
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,120
He's very professional.

123
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,320
It's good that we know how good I am.

124
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,960
You're so narcissistic.

125
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,040
Don't reveal it.

126
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
It's good to be young.

127
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,920
Since you like acting so much,

128
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,960
and talented,

129
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,680
I'll call you if I have any scenes.

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,960
Give me your number later.

131
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,520
Thank you, director.

132
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,640
Thank you, director.

133
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,200
Class, our rest room is next door.

134
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,640
You can take a rest there.

135
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,240
You did a good job.

136
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,640
Director, I want to see

137
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,120
The photographer replays it.

138
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,560
Director, do you think I have the potential to be the film queen?

139
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,880
Best Actor?

140
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes.

141
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,120
Your teeth are all yours.

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,760
Can we see what we just took?

143
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,440
I can act. I have potential too.

144
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,160
Be careful. Don't break my machine.

145
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,240
One by one.

146
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,160
Sure.

147
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,640
As expected from

148
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,920
Oscar's Best Actress.

149
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,000
Lower your voice. It's embarrassing to be heard.

150
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,280
The director said you have a sense of camera.

151
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,320
Don't be shy.

152
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,120
I'll ask the director to get the camera.

153
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,559
I'll put them in my phone and appreciate them.

154
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,919
Ruoxi Zhang.

155
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
The director will be here soon. Don't bother him.

156
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,600
You...

157
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,320
Be careful not to pick it up.

158
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,680
Ruo tears.

159
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Are you okay?

160
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,280
Does it hurt?

161
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,480
Don't step on it.

162
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,320
Leave me alone.

163
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,960
Are you okay? Do you want some water?

164
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,200
I'm fine.

165
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,160
It's just a bandage.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,960
Don't delay the shoot.

167
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,440
I think we should take care of it.

168
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
to avoid infection.

169
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,600
I'll buy a band-aid.

170
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,720
Wait, Xiammy, I'll go with you.

171
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,840
Ruoxi.

172
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,200
The shoot is about to start.

173
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,240
I heard that you look 3 kg fat on camera.

174
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,280
Ruotear, why don't you look fat at all?

175
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,640
Your skin is so fair that it glows.

176
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,360
What brand do you use?

177
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,400
I don't wear sunscreen usually.

178
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,240
Because my skin is sensitive.

179
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,200
It's all basic skincare products.

180
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,080
Really? Have you never done sunscreen before?

181
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,920
No.

182
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,240
I still use an umbrella in summer.

183
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,640
I'm so jealous.

184
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,080
You're born pretty.

185
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,440
Your skin is really good.

186
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,520
No way.

187
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,520
Why is it so white without sunscreen?

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,680
Here comes the male lead of the idol drama.

189
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,960
Ruoxi.

190
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Your eyes are so greasy.

191
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,160
Is it true?

192
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,680
Yes.

193
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,440
You're so serious, Xi.

194
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,520
Don't talk nonsense.

195
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,560
Ruoxi is good at acting.

196
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,880
He can even act like this in front of the pillar.

197
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
Let's go. Stop looking.

198
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,240
Are you a fool?

199
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,840
Your hands are like BBQ pork.

200
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,080
My skin is thick, I'm not afraid of the heat.

201
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,240
You're smart.

202
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,560
The pig skin is thick

203
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,800
It's still barking when it's hot

204
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,000
Let me do it.

205
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
Why are you here

206
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Why are you here?

207
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,400
I mean your promotional video is good.

208
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,680
I'm going back to the classroom.

209
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,160
Z.

210
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:06,960
Well...

211
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,040
You know the separation of human scenes, right?

212
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,600
A professional actor

213
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,800
usually doesn't bring dramas into reality.

214
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,600
Really?

215
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,600
You know a lot.

216
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,480
No wonder you acted so well.

217
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,960
Look how pretty the heroine is.

218
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,480
She's good at acting.

219
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,560
I don't want to see Oska without her this year.

220
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,840
Don't be angry, heroine.

221
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,200
Who is your female lead?

222
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,480
You think too much.

223
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,600
What do you think?

224
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,840
I told you I'd come to you.

225
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,960
Why did you come to school?

226
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,840
You talk nonsense all day. Who would believe you?

227
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,960
Cut the crap. Where's the money?

228
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,680
I've given you the money.

229
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,440
I'm leaving.

230
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,320
Wait.

231
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,080
How about a beggar at 20?

232
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,280
Let go of me!

233
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,600
I have no money now.

234
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,320
Bullshit!

235
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,040
I saw my dad give you 200 yuan.

236
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:38,760
Give it to me.

237
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,920
That's the money I need to eat.

238
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,280
How can I eat if I give it to you?

239
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,880
Who are you?

240
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,040
Why are you bullying me?

241
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,520
I gave you the money. Leave now.

242
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,880
If the school notifies your parents,

243
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,720
you'll suffer.

244
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,480
Let's go.

245
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
I'll do you a favor.

246
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,120
Ruotear.

247
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,000
Are you okay?

248
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,200
Stop!

249
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,760
Xiammy.

250
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,880
I'm fine.

251
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,480
No.

252
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,200
If we don't catch him, we'll teach him a lesson.

253
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,920
If he dares to...

254
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,080
I'll call the security guard.

255
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,800
Rammy.

256
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,400
I said I'm fine.

257
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,760
You're so nosy.

258
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,520
Xiammy.

259
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,600
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

261
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,520
That's not a gangster.

262
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,760
He was my classmate.

263
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
We were just joking.

264
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,080
I just don't want to cause any misunderstanding.

265
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,680
I was impulsive.

266
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,080
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,360
Ruo tears.

268
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,160
If someone bullies you, don't hold back, okay?

269
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,880
I know.

270
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,080
I know you're the best to me.

271
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,960
Are you going home today?

272
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,080
Just go.

273
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,440
I need to get something from school.

274
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,200
I'm leaving.

275
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,920
Bye.

276
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,040
Who did this?

277
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,760
Oh my god.

278
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,720
Rammy.

279
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,840
Let's go together.

280
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,080
Sure.

281
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,960
What are you looking at?

282
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,840
Let's go.

283
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,880
You're just a kid.

284
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,080
I'll buy you ice cream.

285
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,960
What trick?

286
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,880
I can't watch it.

287
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,560
I want to see it.

288
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,320
Natmmy, come and take a look.

289
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,720
I don't know who's messing with your photos.

290
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,880
It's not a prank anymore.

291
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,200
This is too much.

292
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,000
You have to hate someone

293
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,640
to draw people's faces.

294
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,920
That's too much.

295
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,320
Go find the teacher.

296
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,640
Let me check it for you.

297
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,320
Xiammy,

298
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,680
Did you offend someone?

299
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,160
No.

300
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,840
Is there any CCTV nearby?

301
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,920
I'll ask the teacher to check.

302
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,320
No need.

303
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,720
Maybe someone put it on for fun.

304
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,120
It may not be because of me.

305
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,400
Could it be Jiang Li from Class 7?

306
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,160
She's the only one who can have conflicts with you.

307
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,360
It'll be fine if it's her.

308
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,760
She likes to play this kind of trick.

309
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,320
Don't worry.

310
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,960
Let's go back to the classroom.

311
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,840
Let's go. There's nothing to see.

312
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,040
Go back to the classroom.

313
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,200
Go back.

314
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,960
I won't look.

315
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,880
Who could it be?

316
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,560
Division is very important to your future.

317
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,360
There's no rush to fill in this form.

318
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,360
Think about your goal during this time.

319
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,200
Think about it with your parents.

320
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
After the division exam

321
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,080
Hand over the form to the monitor

322
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,720
Is there any problem?

323
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,280
No.

324
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,640
Class dismissed.

325
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,320
Stand up.

326
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,280
Thank you.

327
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,520
Liberal arts or science?

328
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,520
I...

329
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,240
Guess.

330
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,960
I guess you choose liberal arts.

331
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,480
I'll reward you with a generous bonus.

332
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,400
Thank you.

333
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,560
It's a bonus question, right?

334
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,160
You didn't guess it right either.

335
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,520
I don't want to play such a childish game with you.

336
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,400
Who are you calling childish?

337
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,400
Who did you say? Say it again.

338
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,120
You're childish.

339
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,840
You're childish.

340
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,640
You think I'm childish?

341
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,680
You're childish.

342
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,680
Put my pen down.

343
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,040
Okay.

344
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,000
Alright, stop fighting.

345
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,680
Enough.

346
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,280
Ruoxi.

347
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,160
Alright, stop fighting.

348
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,040
Haven't you decided which subject to choose yet?

349
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,600
Me too.

350
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,120
Division is quite important.

351
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
I think

352
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,000
think about it carefully.

353
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,920
Ruotear,

354
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Don't you want to choose liberal arts with me?

355
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,640
Of course I do.

356
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,960
I just want everyone to stay together.

357
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,600
Ruoxi.

358
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,680
Do you choose science too?

359
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,720
I don't know.

360
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,040
If you're in a dilemma,

361
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,200
you can talk to me anytime.

362
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,400
I sigh because I'm worried.

363
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,360
If I can't be in the same class with Ruotear,

364
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,840
we won't have any stories in the future.

365
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,680
Are you sighing?

366
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,680
Why are you laughing?

367
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,760
You think too much, friend.

368
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,960
Even if you and Lin Ruotear are in the same class,

369
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,120
you don't have a story.

370
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,520
You're right.

371
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,640
Take this!

372
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,840
Wing Chun, Xiao Junyi.

373
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,640
We're dividing the subjects.

374
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,240
but we still fight here.

375
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,080
After division, Class 1 is no longer the same class

376
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,320
If we were in different classes,

377
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,360
if Ruoxi and I are not in the same class,

378
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,880
then our class

379
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,880
in our class.

380
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,920
Tell me.

381
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,400
Qin Zeyang.

382
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,160
When a peacock opens its tail,

383
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,400
He wouldn’t ride on our head to poop.

384
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,040
Qin Zeyang won’t.

385
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
He is just a wolf.

386
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,640
He always barks.

387
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,440
In any way,

388
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,760
in any way.

389
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
You seem to learn it.

390
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,040
Come on, compete with me.

391
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,760
Come on!

392
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,360
Wait and see.

393
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,080
You learned it so well.

394
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,200
Of course.

395
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,720
You...

396
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,760
I...

397
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,360
Peacock.

398
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,160
Cinderella.

399
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,480
I can't beat Fan Yuan.

400
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,240
Brother.

401
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,520
We're not talking about you.

402
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
We're talking about

403
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,280
We're talking about the hygiene sheep.

404
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,360
Yes, hybrid sheep.

405
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,320
I'm not deaf.

406
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,280
They're right.

407
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,280
You're just a wolf.

408
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,200
That's right.

409
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,600
You can never beat Fan Yuan.

410
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,520
You...

411
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,000
What?

412
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,800
Fight?

413
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,200
[He's so stubborn.] [He's so stubborn.]

414
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,400
Stubborn.

415
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,240
Take care of your face first.

416
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,560
I don't think I can use my brain during the college entrance exam.

417
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,480
And you.

418
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,960
You...

419
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,400
Wait and see.

420
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,360
Wait and see.

421
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,600
Look, you're just barking.

422
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,640
Challenge letter.

423
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,920
To all students of Class 1 of Grade 1,

424
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,080
Although your class won the first place in the last monthly exam,

425
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,360
but glory doesn’t mean the future will be bright.

426
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,120
Your class is strong and strong.

427
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,360
but our Class 2 is brave and invincible.

428
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,200
The division is coming.

429
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,040
I challenge your class.

430
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,840
The brave will win in a narrow road.

431
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,720
Do you have the guts to fight?

432
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,440
Class 2 is so arrogant.

433
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,000
What do you mean by lucky?

434
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,760
When did you pass the monthly exam?

435
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
That's right.

436
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,880
You're bragging.

437
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,640
Monitor

438
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,160
We can't let them be so arrogant.

439
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,640
We have to teach them a lesson.

440
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,640
Yes, monitor.

441
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,880
Of course we should fight in front of our house.

442
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,160
Not only that,

443
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,280
but also pretty.

444
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:37,960
Right?

445
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,480
Great writer.

446
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm counting on you.

447
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,920
I'll write the letter of challenge.

448
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,360
Challenge letter?

449
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
Everyone in Class 1-2,

450
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,840
The glory of the past can continue the bright future.

451
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,160
Even if you have the courage to shake a tree,

452
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,040
our class is not tolerant.

453
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,200
In the battle of division,

454
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,800
I will surely accept it.

455
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,840
War songs are everywhere

456
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,760
Writing Spring and Autumn

457
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
All the heroes

458
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,520
Don't let the vassals

459
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,320
How dare you!

460
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,320
You're so domineering.

461
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,560
You have guts.

462
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,000
Since you accepted the challenge,

463
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,040
let's meet in the test.

464
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,520
Say no more.

465
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,320
Talk with your grades in half a month.

466
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,720
What are you guys doing together?

467
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,480
A group fight.

468
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,400
Don't move.

469
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,520
Don't you dare move.

470
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,360
Move.

471
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,720
Five thousand words self-criticism.

472
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,520
You've read quite a lot of martial arts novels.

473
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,560
You even know how to write a challenge letter.

474
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Not bad.

475
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,680
The various lords

476
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,320
You're full of spirit.

477
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,400
Who wrote this?

478
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,600
It's you.

479
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Come out.

480
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:50,920
Come on.

481
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,760
So proud, right?

482
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,760
Don't think I'm praising you.

483
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,520
You can compete,

484
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,080
but you have to be kind.

485
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,560
It's like a fight.

486
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,040
What?

487
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,600
Learn to reflect on yourself, understand?

488
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,360
Other schools

489
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,920
Between class and class

490
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,480
are friendly.

491
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Communication

492
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,960
and help each other.

493
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,440
You...

494
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,120
Sir.

495
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,480
We're sorry.

496
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,560
I'm sorry.

497
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,440
Sorry.

498
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,760
We should help each other.

499
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,600
Friendship competition.

500
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,120
As the monitor of Class 1,

501
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,520
I didn't do a good role model.

502
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,440
OK.

503
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,640
It's good that you're prepared.

504
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,840
Do the others hear me?

505
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,040
Yes.

506
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,040
Louder.

507
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,640
Yes.

508
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,640
All of you.

509
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,280
Reflect on yourself in class.

510
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,080
Thank you.

511
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,600
You look like me when I was young.

512
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Not bad

513
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,680
You sit so neatly before class

514
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,640
You look good.

515
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,720
Sir.

516
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,160
Is this class an exam?

517
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,760
Yes, Miss Xiammy.

518
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,240
We are going to take the exam this time.

519
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,440
But I can't believe I saw

520
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,280
looking forward to the exam.

521
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,560
This is so rare.

522
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:19,960
Thank you.

523
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,360
Sir.

524
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,760
Are we taking the same test with Class 2?

525
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,280
Yes.

526
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,680
The same one as us.

527
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,360
Their class will take the exam after the exam.

528
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,160
Hurry up and hand out the paper.

529
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,400
Please hand out the paper.

530
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,360
OK. OK. Come on.

531
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,600
Yuhan, hand out the paper to everyone.

532
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,080
Share your seats.

533
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,680
How did it go?

534
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,800
Let me ask you.

535
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,040
What do you choose for the last two choices?

536
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,520
Choose A for question 11.

537
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,080
Oh no.

538
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,760
My heart is cold.

539
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,720
I'm so miserable.

540
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,560
How could I be so miserable?

541
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,960
I have no regrets.

542
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,880
Mr. Wang's topic this time is quite difficult.

543
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,640
He wants to stimulate you.

544
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,920
It's not that difficult to take the division exam.

545
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,480
Don't be too discouraged.

546
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
No.

547
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,400
I can't drag you down.

548
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,600
and let Class 2 stand out.

549
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,840
No.

550
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,720
I have to study every second.

551
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,600
You go first.

552
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,720
Rammy.

553
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,520
Ruoxi/Fan Yuan This is my mathematics key notes/I updated the error points and difficult notes.

554
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,200
If I had known you did mathematics,

555
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,720
I would have done geography and biology.

556
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,680
It's okay.

557
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,680
We can add each other.

558
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,920
More perspectives and more insurance.

559
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,760
Thanks.

560
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,200
By the way, Natmmy,

561
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,120
This is the key point of English language I've been sorting out.

562
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,240
You can take a look if you need it.

563
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Thank you, Ruotear.

564
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,160
It occurs to me that

565
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,880
I even took my Chinese notes.

566
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,720
Look.

567
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,440
Nice, Rammy.

568
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,800
Great!

569
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,440
Now I have four secret books.

570
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,880
I don't have to worry about getting more points.

571
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,600
What?

572
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
Is there something wrong with the notes?

573
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,880
I'm thinking

574
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,400
it's a pity

575
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,800
Isn't it a pity?

576
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,880
I have an idea.

577
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,040
Would you mind?

578
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,360
Rammy.

579
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,440
Do you want to share the notes with everyone?

580
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,720
It's better to enjoy alone than everyone else.

581
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,320
We have such good stuff.

582
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,040
If the whole class sees it,

583
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,360
we'll be more confident to leave Class 2 behind.

584
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,080
Right?

585
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,840
If we can improve our grades,

586
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,200
I'm fine.

587
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,480
Miss Xia, you're so kind.

588
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,320
to help you.

589
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,760
I don't mind.

590
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,320
Besides,

591
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,520
I can see Ruoxi and the class monitor's notes.

592
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,200
I'm the one who earned it.

593
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,520
That's great.

594
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,120
Let me thank you on behalf of everyone.

595
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,520
I'll make a copy later.

596
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,840
Students in the first row, take your notes.

597
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,080
You and the monitor are really loyal.

598
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,240
You just dedicated your wisdom.

599
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,080
If I improve in the division exam,

600
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,400
I'll definitely invite you to play games.

601
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,480
You don't have to thank me.

602
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,040
You should thank Miss Xia.

603
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,120
She advised me to print out the notes for you.

604
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,400
Thank you for your notes.

605
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,280
Thank you, Miss Xia.

606
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,520
You're indeed a heroine.

607
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,600
If we win Class 2,

608
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
you'll be the greatest contributor.

609
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,520
Best contributor?

610
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,800
Actually, I'm just here to show my gratitude.

611
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,360
I should thank the monitor

612
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,400
and monitor Rong and Zhao Rui.

613
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,280
provided geography and biology notes.

614
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,640
I hope these notes will help you.

615
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,040
Of course.

616
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,920
I have the first and second notes.

617
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,080
Is it still scientific if you don't win?

618
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,200
Yes, it's not scientific even if we don't win.

619
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,160
Quiet, everyone.

620
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,280
The result of our math elementary exam is out.

621
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,920
Class 2 is also out.

622
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,960
How did they do?

623
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,240
The average score of our class

624
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,000
is lower than Class 2.

625
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,400
How could this happen?

626
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,680
Just get a few more points.

627
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
Mr. Wang said

628
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,840
the main reason

629
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,760
because there are too many people who got 60 to 70.

630
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
to 70.

631
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
To be honest,

632
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,480
the students in Class 2 did work harder than us.

633
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,800
Every evening self-study class, the whole class stayed.

634
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,880
and never missed a day.

635
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,000
Reflect on yourself.

636
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
You three help me hand out the test papers.

637
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,320
I'm a drag after all.

638
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,920
Let me see.

639
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,480
It's just math now.

640
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,880
You're disappointed so early.

641
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,200
It's not the final exam yet.

642
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,880
We just need to catch up.

643
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,719
That's right.

644
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,400
You have to pull yourself together.

645
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,679
Be timid before fighting.

646
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,159
Military is a taboo.

647
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,199
Monitor.

648
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,880
Didn't you say Class 2 goes to night study every day?

649
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,719
Yes.

650
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,760
They even listed a duty schedule.

651
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,960
They pick one every night

652
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,120
to be a little teacher.

653
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,920
to answer questions.

654
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,360
We can do it too.

655
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,040
We have notes now.

656
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,520
We can also answer each other's questions.

657
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,639
more efficient.

658
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,320
Yes.

659
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,760
If you want to study together tonight,

660
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,840
welcome

661
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,840
My class monitor

662
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,360
Your class is better than the tutoring class

663
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,440
Yes, Monitor, why don't you start your class?

664
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,520
I made progress because of you last time.

665
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,000
I want to make some progress

666
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,120
and have a good summer vacation.

667
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:59,520
Yeah let's start a class

668
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,480
Last ten days

669
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,760
Let's work hard together.

670
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,160
Get Class 2 out of the galaxy.

671
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,120
Okay, good luck.

672
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,640
Monitor

673
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,800
What's our strategy this time?

674
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,360
We usually take 45 minutes.

675
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,680
I ask you to finish it in half an hour.

676
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,400
Half an hour.

677
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,720
Monitor

678
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,960
But I can't even finish a class

679
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,400
Now only 30 minutes

680
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,080
Will the score be lower?

681
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,840
It doesn't matter if the correct rate is not high at first.

682
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,520
The most important thing is to improve the speed.

683
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,920
We don't have much time to prepare for the exam.

684
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,080
It's not enough

685
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,000
It's not enough to just improve your learning interest.

686
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,280
It has to be a test tactic.

687
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,720
When you finish the questions,

688
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,720
the speed will go up.

689
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,080
It goes up.

690
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,680
We can have more time to calculate in the exam.

691
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,720
and improve the accuracy rate.

692
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,560
I see.

693
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,520
Practice makes perfect.

694
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,200
Okay.

695
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,080
We'll do the test paper in the first class.

696
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,720
For the remaining 15 minutes, we will exchange reviews.

697
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,080
In the second class, answer and review freely.

698
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
Any questions?

699
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,640
No.

700
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,120
Cheer up, everyone.

701
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,400
Good luck.

702
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,400
Would you like to beg me?

703
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,880
I have a way to show you.

704
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,440
Ruoxi.

705
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,880
Please.

706
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,200
Stop.

707
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,920
Let me help you.

708
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,920
What are you doing?

709
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,040
I'll help you. You can't see.

710
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,480
You can see if I lift you up.

711
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,080
Forget it.

712
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,960
I'll watch it after we're done.

713
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,600
Come up.

714
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Do you still want to see it?

715
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,680
Sure.

716
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,400
Okay, I'll buy you ice cream later.

717
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:55,760
Here.

718
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,520
See?

719
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,400
I saw it.

720
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,560
Our class won.

721
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,200
You and the monitor are the top two.

722
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,800
Qin Zeyang has become the third in ten thousand years.

723
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,680
So heavy.

724
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,600
I'll get down.

725
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,320
Our class lost this time.

726
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,520
We admit it.

727
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,360
But in the next exam,

728
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,560
in the next exam,

729
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,000
Qin Zeyang will never give up.

730
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,600
Why are you being unreasonable?

731
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,960
What do you mean?

732
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,080
Fan Yuan got the first place with his skills.

733
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,640
Our class wins with skills.

734
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,520
Next time.

735
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,200
our class won’t lose.

736
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,960
Qin Zeyang is no match for Fan Yuan.

737
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,440
Just like the Math Olympiad competition,

738
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,920
Fan Yuan won the first prize.

739
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,720
Where is Qin Zeyang?

740
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,680
He doesn’t even have the qualification.

741
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,240
Do you think he gave up?

742
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,040
Why are you so late?

743
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,240
Blow the water.

744
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,200
Blow the water.

745
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,560
Let's go.

746
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,920
Bye. Bye.

747
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,120
Did you see their faces?

748
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,000
I think they can be angry for a year.

749
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,400
It feels so good.

750
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,160
This is the best day I've ever had.

751
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,480
Monitor and Ruoxi.

752
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,080
The Team of Bomb is well-deserved.

753
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,600
Bomb! Bomb!

754
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,800
Alright.

755
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,120
Go back to the classroom.

756
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,160
Keep a low profile.

757
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:23,760
