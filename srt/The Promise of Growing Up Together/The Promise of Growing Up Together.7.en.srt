1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on

2
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,720
Let go of me.

3
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,400
If you continue, you'll be disqualified.

4
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:42,960
Let's go.

5
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,600
The cheerleaders go back to the arena.

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,640
The game continues.

7
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,600
I'm fine.

8
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,560
I don't care about him.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,800
Focus on the game in Grade 1.

10
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,880
Class 1, Grade 1.

11
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,480
Class 1 is the best.

12
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,040
Class 1 is the best!

13
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,640
Beat the tiger.

14
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,240
Keep going up.

15
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,680
Class 1 is the best!

16
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,240
Class 1 is the best!

17
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,920
Class 1 is the best!

18
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,440
Class 1 is the best!

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,880
Beat the tiger.

20
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,480
Go up.

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,920
Oh, no! There's less than a minute left!

22
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,960
We won't lose, right?

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,320
Don't be discouraged. They will win. I believe in them.

24
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,240
We have to overwhelm them in momentum.

25
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:54,120
Go Class 1!

26
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,760
Sung.R.

27
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,000
[18]

28
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,079
18.

29
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,560
13.

30
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,600
Ruoxi is the best in the game.

31
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,960
Any objections?

32
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,720
No.

33
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:54,760
You're the best, Ruoxi.

34
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,440
Ruoxi Zhang.

35
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,520
You're the best, Ruoxi.

36
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,160
Ruoxi Zhang.

37
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,320
Xiammy, what's wrong?

38
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,240
Let me take you to the infirmary.

39
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
Let me.

40
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,880
I can do it myself.

41
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,480
Your ankle

42
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,720
is so swollen.

43
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,920
Don't go to the class exercise and game this week

44
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,760
Can't you watch the game?

45
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,159
Doctor.

46
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,360
My ankle is always red.

47
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,680
Not this time.

48
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,640
Little girl.

49
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,920
Your feet are red.

50
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,480
How could it not be sprained?

51
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,040
You're lying for fun.

52
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,320
Rammy.

53
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Grade 1 (1), listen to the doctor.

54
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,240
You can watch the basketball game again.

55
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,200
Class 1, Grade 1.

56
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,760
The most important thing now is to heal your leg.

57
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,440
Yeah, Natmmy.

58
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
If you want to watch it, I can record it for you.

59
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,440
No.

60
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,520
Grade 1. It's boring to be alone in the classroom for one coin.

61
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
Grade 1 (I'm bored in the classroom alone at noon)

62
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,880
It's boring to be alone in the classroom at noon.

63
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,680
Yes, doctor.

64
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,680
I can guarantee

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,040
You...

66
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,440
Stop talking.

67
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,320
Why didn't you come earlier

68
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,920
Why didn't you come earlier?

69
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,920
No, I...

70
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,880
Basketball is common.

71
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
It's fine.

72
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,960
Nothing serious.

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,400
Have you heard of a minor injury that can't be cured?

74
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,120
How can you put a bandage on such a big wound?

75
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,000
Does it make sense?

76
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,760
It's a Band-Aid from cartoon.

77
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,040
It's from your female classmate.

78
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,960
Why are you still standing here?

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
Go back to class.

80
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,720
Do you think I'm going to skip class?

81
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,080
Class 1, Grade 1.

82
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,680
We didn't want to skip class.

83
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,400
If we leave,

84
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,560
what about them?

85
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,200
Go back and ask for leave for them.

86
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,200
When I'm done with the wound,

87
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,000
he sent this girl home.

88
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,080
He carried her back anyway.

89
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,480
Okay, let's go.

90
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,120
I'll get you some medicine.

91
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,080
Thank you.

92
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Does your foot still hurt?

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,120
It's not that serious.

94
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,720
I hurt my foot before.

95
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,160
My ankle has been swollen.

96
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280
But the doctor didn't believe me.

97
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,280
I want to spend the whole afternoon alone in the classroom.

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
I wish I could buy a wooden fish to knock.

99
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,600
I have a way to let you watch the basketball game in the classroom.

100
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,520
What is it?

101
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,200
It's a secret.

102
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,680
Just wait for me in the classroom tomorrow.

103
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,440
Xiammy.

104
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
Xiao Yu asked me to give this to you.

105
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,560
She said she didn't want you to be bored.

106
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,720
so she allowed you to watch as much as you want this time.

107
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,600
At least she has a conscience.

108
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,280
Ruotear, thank her for me.

109
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,720
Can you stay in the classroom alone?

110
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,920
Why don't I stay with you?

111
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
No need.

112
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,480
I can't drag you to suffer with me.

113
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,480
And we can't lose more cheerleaders.

114
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
You need to make up for the oil I need.

115
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,880
Call me if you're bored.

116
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
I'll be back anytime.

117
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,320
Monitor.

118
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,200
Do you have something for me too?

119
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,960
I've prepared a week's test paper for you.

120
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,880
Make one every day.

121
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,240
Then you won't be bored at noon.

122
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,480
Okay.

123
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,800
Since everyone is watching the game,

124
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,840
I can overtake the car by bending.

125
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,360
Give it to me now.

126
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,040
Sorry.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,600
I should have prepared the test paper for you.

128
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,040
It's snacks.

129
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,520
So many snacks

130
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Thank you monitor

131
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,320
You have to make up for your absence.

132
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,040
Good luck in the game.

133
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,640
Rest well, Grade 1.

134
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,000
Class 1, Grade 1.

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,760
Gao, wait for our good news.

136
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,440
Gao.

137
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,040
Let's warm up.

138
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,120
Class monitor

139
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,400
Let's go.

140
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
We can watch the game this way.

141
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,520
Why didn't I think of that?

142
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,800
What else can you think of

143
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,560
what else can you think of?

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,800
Ruoxi.

145
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
Why does a good person have a mouth?

146
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,080
I bought it at the stationery store yesterday.

147
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,960
You can have it.

148
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,920
Thank you.

149
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,040
You're welcome.

150
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,680
I saw it with this.

151
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,280
Just watch how I win the game.

152
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,920
I can really see it.

153
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,960
What did you see?

154
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,360
I saw

155
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,200
So many students.

156
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,280
So small.

157
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,960
Natmmy.

158
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,200
Am I like a matchman?

159
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,200
Grade 1 (1)?

160
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,000
How small is it?

161
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,440
The telescope you gave me is quite useful.

162
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,560
I'll take it seriously later.

163
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,680
Just a look?

164
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,200
Don't you have anything else to say?

165
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,280
What?

166
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,680
You want to cheer up too?

167
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,800
Of course.

168
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,160
As a cheerleader, you can't treat each other unfairly.

169
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,800
I'll pay you back for today.

170
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,400
I wish you

171
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,880
the God of Balls.

172
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,160
You hit the target.

173
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,200
Okay.

174
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,680
That's enough.

175
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,040
Wait for my good news.

176
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,440
This guy...

177
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,480
What a hand.

178
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,760
Come on!

179
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,520
Why are you so late?

180
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,880
It's because I don't want to leave her.

181
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,240
You talk too much.

182
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,000
Go warm up.

183
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,680
Hurry up.

184
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,000
Class 1.

185
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,000
Gao.

186
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,720
Gao...

187
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,880
Ruoxi.

188
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,920
Do your best in today's game.

189
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,320
and win this game.

190
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,440
Come on, Class 1!

191
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,800
Come on, Class 1!

192
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,640
Class 1 is the best.

193
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,400
Come on, Class 1.

194
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,920
Come on! Come on!

195
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,680
Come on, Class 1!

196
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,160
Come on, Class 1!

197
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,800
Class 1!

198
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,360
Goal!

199
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,680
Come on! Come on! Class 1, come on!

200
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,640
Come on! Come on!

201
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,720
It's in! Class 1 is the best!

202
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,760
Raise your youth and go up!

203
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,920
The first-year basketball match

204
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
[The game ended successfully.]

205
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,280
In this competition,

206
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,640
Class 1 of Grade 1

207
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,320
and won the championship.

208
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,440
Why are you back so soon?

209
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,200
I wanted to bring you good news.

210
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,680
You scored 20 goals today.

211
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,120
I'll give you half of the credit.

212
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,560
You don't have to rush back to tell me.

213
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,920
The competition?

214
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,720
It's not like I haven't seen it.

215
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,600
Is my gift so precious?

216
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
No.

217
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,120
It's because I cherish it.

218
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,280
and the good memories in basketball.

219
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,480
It has nothing to do with you.

220
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,320
Yes.

221
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,200
It has nothing to do with me.

222
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,520
Right?

223
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,840
It doesn't matter at all.

224
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,680
All right.

225
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,280
This award

226
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,560
is the result of our classmates working together.

227
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,000
Just put it in the class.

228
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:55,920
Come on.

229
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,120
Let me remind you again.

230
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,800
Don't slack off on your studies.

231
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,080
I'm happy,

232
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,560
But only by working hard

233
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,840
to win more.

234
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,000
But to reward you,

235
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,760
I applied to the school

236
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,080
to allow you not to study at night.

237
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,600
Great!

238
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,680
You can move freely.

239
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Okay.

240
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,080
Thank you, Ms Qiao. Thank you, Ms Qiao.

241
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
Goodbye, Ms Qiao.

242
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,480
First,

243
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,640
What's wrong?

244
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,280
Okay.

245
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,440
Congratulations.

246
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,960
Your sweat this time.

247
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,400
The hard work is yours.

248
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,160
The credit is yours too.

249
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,920
I'm not used to

250
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,160
I'm not used to it.

251
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,800
Why are you trying so hard to butter me up?

252
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,200
Are you plotting something against me?

253
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,680
Ungrateful.

254
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,000
I do.

255
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,320
If I win the game,

256
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,280
if I win the game?

257
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,480
What do you want?

258
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,280
Buy me a meal.

259
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,520
There's no one at home next week.

260
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,160
I have no food to eat.

261
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,040
But I can only cook one dish.

262
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,599
Mo Braised Pork.

263
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,079
That's it.

264
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,480
Perfect.

265
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,280
You asked me to cook for you.

266
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll poison you?

267
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,840
We people

268
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,720
don't care about trifles.

269
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,120
I'll be a good man after 18 years.

270
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,800
Okay.

271
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,760
Okay.

272
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,600
Amy.

273
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,880
Here, here, here.

274
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,960
So heavy

275
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,800
Give it to me.

276
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,080
Let's go.

277
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,640
This way, please.

278
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,040
The slippers are here

279
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,840
Excuse me.

280
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,400
Welcome, Chef Xia.

281
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,720
Welcome to my humble house.

282
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,560
Take a look.

283
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
How is my house?

284
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,720
Not bad.

285
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,480
The fridge is here.

286
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,160
I'll take you there.

287
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,560
This way, please.

288
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,000
You prepared so many ingredients.

289
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,960
But I only know how to make braised pork.

290
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,440
Make something else if you want.

291
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,840
Don't try to slave me.

292
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,200
I can't cook anything

293
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,760
I can only help the chef

294
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,160
Cut the meat and wash the vegetables.

295
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,800
Suit yourself.

296
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Help me cut the meat

297
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,480
into a square.

298
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,280
Get me some sugar.

299
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,320
Yes.

300
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,880
Ruoxi Zhang, where's the oil?

301
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
It's in that cabinet.

302
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,120
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960
Stop pretending.

304
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,080
I'm not that heavy.

305
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,600
Don't try to blackmail me.

306
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,160
It's internal injury.

307
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,360
I need someone to help me.

308
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,160
Okay, I'll help you.

309
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,440
Give me your hand.

310
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,160
I knew you were pretending.

311
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,560
Watch out for oil.

312
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,920
Ruoxi.

313
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,360
Is there something on your nose?

314
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,160
You just finished drawing your eyebrows.

315
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,720
Done.

316
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,400
It's done.

317
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,960
Please.

318
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,800
Fine.

319
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,960
I'll forgive you this time.

320
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
What do you mean?

321
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,800
It wasn't the one who spilled the oil

322
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,800
I'm the chef I'm the boss

323
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,560
Okay

324
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Chef you're the boss

325
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,880
Whatever you say

326
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,360
I'll go get some sugar.

327
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,520
What's wrong?

328
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,600
Chef!

329
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,760
Shouldn't you put sugar first

330
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,800
Yes.

331
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,280
I almost forgot.

332
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Go back to your work.

333
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,880
What's wrong?

334
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,800
I cut my hand.

335
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,760
Which hand?

336
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,120
It hurts. Which hand?

337
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,400
Right hand.

338
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,080
Right hand.

339
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,080
Aren't you cutting vegetables with your right hand?

340
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,960
That's this hand

341
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,360
Let me see.

342
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,800
Where is the wound?

343
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,720
Didn't you see this?

344
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,120
This...

345
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,280
Zhang Ruoxi.

346
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,520
The wound on your fingers

347
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,400
will heal in two minutes.

348
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,560
I'm injured too.

349
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
Young Master.

350
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,080
You're really delicate.

351
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,080
It hurts.

352
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,720
Is it soaking or soaking water?

353
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,000
Just put it now.

354
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,120
You don't know how to cook.

355
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,120
Did you burn yourself?

356
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,320
I forgot to pour hot water.

357
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,920
It's okay.

358
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,920
It's just a little explosive.

359
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,080
It doesn't affect the food.

360
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,360
It's okay.

361
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,040
Look, it's nothing.

362
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,160
Didn't you say you can't cook?

363
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,600
You're so good at it.

364
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,600
You're lying.

365
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,360
I... I saw my parents too much.

366
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Actually, I won't.

367
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,240
I know.

368
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
You're cheating.

369
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,240
Why are you cheating?

370
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,280
You're cheating. Let me be your servant.

371
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,360
I'm a master of theory.

372
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,840
I just want to see how good you are.

373
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,560
Who wants to show you?

374
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,760
I just want you to test the poison for me.

375
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,600
Stop pretending.

376
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
You think I can do it twice?

377
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,520
Do you think I'm stupid?

378
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,480
No.

379
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,560
It really splashed on me.

380
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,960
My hand.

381
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,840
Can you stop exaggerating?

382
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,080
More exaggerated.

383
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,800
I'll take you to the hospital to get a cast, okay?

384
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,920
It's not impossible.

385
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
You deserve it.

386
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,720
You lied to me and asked me to cook for you.

387
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,480
I deserve it.

388
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,120
Are you smelling the chemistry reagent here?

389
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,160
Smelling?

390
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,920
I'm here to taste

391
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,560
with a very scientific attitude.

392
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,400
Don't waste time.

393
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,200
Come on.

394
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,760
Try it.

395
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,840
It smells good.

396
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,120
What's that look?

397
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,360
Is it not good?

398
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,840
I think it's good.

399
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,240
It's just

400
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,600
Too much sugar.

401
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,200
This meat should only be in heaven.

402
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,560
It's rare to taste it in the mortal world.

403
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,400
Come on, cheers.

404
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,760
Cheers.

405
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,840
Ruoxi.

406
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,080
Are you praising me

407
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,840
so that I can get meat to eat?

408
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,360
Confucius said

409
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,200
food and sex...

410
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,400
It depends on your performance.

411
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,960
Go through fire and water

412
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,240
I'm willing to do it.

413
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,440
Mom.

414
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,440
When you arrive,

415
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,000
go inside the door.

416
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,600
I'll pick you up.

417
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,360
Wait.

418
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,440
Auntie is here.

419
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,120
I'll pick her up.

420
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,920
Ruoxi Zhang, my mom is here to pick me up.

421
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,280
Hello, aunt.

422
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,360
Xianbing.

423
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,960
Yes.

424
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,960
Hello

425
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,680
I am...

426
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,800
I know you are her mother.

427
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,080
She mentioned you in front of me.

428
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,880
She said you were the best mother in the world.

429
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,960
The greatest mother

430
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,680
She's a good cook.

431
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,400
I'm sure she learned this from you.

432
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,840
All you know is sweet talk.

433
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,080
Why am I sweet when I tell the truth?

434
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,720
Aunt, you don't know

435
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,440
the braised pork made by Xiammy today

436
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,880
is very authentic.

437
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,040
I knew it must be you.

438
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,360
Is this how you use it?

439
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,720
You're talking nonsense again.

440
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,080
Okay.

441
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Thank you for your compliment.

442
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,880
I'll take her home first.

443
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,560
Okay, I'll give you a ride.

444
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,400
No need.

445
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,280
It's just a small road.

446
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,160
I know how to go

447
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,480
This is basic manners.

448
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,520
Right?

449
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,160
To thank Mr Fan Yuan for his hard guidance and encouragement,

450
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,080
I've decided

451
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,320
to invite you to the real CS War in three days.

452
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,360
This looks nice too.

453
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,320
Sure.

454
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,440
Look

455
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,640
You have good taste.

456
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,440
You chose the same style as me.

457
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,240
Not bad.

458
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,760
You have good taste.

459
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,120
No.

460
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,760
You're just praising yourself.

461
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,800
Okay.

462
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,480
Take a look.

463
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,040
Isn't it really pretty?

464
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,280
Yes.

465
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,440
Boss.

466
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,560
Do you still have this bracelet?

467
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,640
There are only a few left

468
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,200
Pick whatever you want.

469
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,360
Thank you.

470
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,440
Ruo tears.

471
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,280
It will look good on you.

472
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,240
It's nothing.

473
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,400
But, Xiammy,

474
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,000
your hands are thin and white.

475
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,240
It'll look good on you.

476
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,200
I said it's nothing.

477
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,920
Let's go and pay the bill.

478
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,600
Do you need me to wrap it up for you?

479
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,320
No.

480
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,200
Let's go.

481
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,920
This is so cute.

482
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,000
So pretty.

483
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,120
Actually,

484
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,280
I haven't been out shopping

485
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,600
since they treated me like that.

486
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,800
I can only see it myself.

487
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,440
Ruo tears.

488
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,080
Thank you.

489
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,080
You're so nice to me.

490
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,000
That's because you deserve others to treat you so well.

491
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,480
You're moved to tears.

492
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,320
If I spend more time with you,

493
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,800
will you cry like a sea?

494
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,640
You hate me being sincere here.

495
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,880
You're laughing at me.

496
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,640
Fine.

497
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,840
I won't tease you anymore.

498
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,480
How about this?

499
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,240
When we grow up,

500
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,160
we'll travel all over the country.

501
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,600
What do you think?

502
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,800
You said

503
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,280
Then we...

504
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,920
pinky swear that you will never change.

505
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,120
Seal.

506
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,440
Let's go over there.

507
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,120
Let's buy whatever we want.

508
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,080
Let's go here.

509
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,640
Rammy, what are you doing?

510
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,760
Coming.

511
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,880
Doesn't this look like me?

512
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,200
This is you.

513
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,040
The pins are all the same.

514
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,240
So beautiful like a fairy.

515
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,600
Rammy.

516
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,640
Here.

517
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,800
Thank you, Ruotear.

518
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,360
These shops are so beautiful.

519
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,760
This suits you.

520
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,520
I think my head is too big.

521
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,840
That looks good.

522
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,160
Give it to me when you have money.

523
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,160
Okay.

524
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:54,960
How about

525
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,240
let's take photo stickers later?

526
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,920
Sure.

527
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,400
Wait.

528
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,480
I forgot my bag.

529
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,200
Wait for me.

530
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,000
Lin Jinfeng is you, right?

531
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,360
Come out.

532
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,960
Rammy.

533
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,640
Sorry.

534
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,120
I'm here.

535
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,840
You don't have to come.

536
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,720
I brought it.

537
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,760
Wait for me there.

538
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,640
I'll be right out.

539
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,520
Okay.

540
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,160
Smile.

541
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:57,480
Smile

542
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:57,760
Smile.

543
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,320
Lovelyth.

544
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,440
The Blown.

545
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,000
Tears

546
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,000
Sky

547
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,600
OBLYTE

548
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,400
What took you so long?

549
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,160
Are you okay

550
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:04,800
It's okay.

551
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,280
Let's go inside.

552
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:20,840
No.

553
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,000
This is so ugly.

554
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,120
What are you doing?

555
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,960
It's always boring to compare with Yetao.

556
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,440
More expressions are more fun.

557
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,800
Let me teach you.

558
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,239
I can't.

559
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,639
This is too ugly.

560
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,560
Xiammy.

561
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:36,960
Look.

562
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,560
Rammy, why are you doing a surprise attack?

563
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,360
Isn't this pretty?

564
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,600
Look how cute your goldfish face is.

565
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,560
The essence of a beauty is to make a funny face.

566
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,480
Take another one.

567
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,040
Are you angry?

568
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,400
Look at this photo.

569
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,880
15 photos.

570
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,320
16 photos are all dark history.

571
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,880
No.

572
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,240
This photo can only be stored under the box.

573
