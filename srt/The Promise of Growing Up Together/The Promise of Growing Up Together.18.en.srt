1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,000
Fan Yuan.

3
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,680
Why don't we go inside for a rehearsal?

4
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,960
Let's go somewhere else, right?

5
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,120
Xiammy and Ruoxi are rehearsing the script inside.

6
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,120
Let's go to the secret base.

7
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,920
Sure.

8
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,760
Let's go.

9
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Great writer.

10
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,079
The script is done.

11
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,760
Yes.

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
Do you want braised pork?

13
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,240
Or...

14
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,240
do you want to hear?

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,760
Or

16
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,079
Do you have anything you want to do?

17
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,280
Anyway,

18
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,840
I'll make an exception

19
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,040
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Did I scare you?

21
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,880
No.

22
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,160
Can I borrow your hand?

23
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,800
What's wrong?

24
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The shining sun.

25
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,880
Can I borrow

26
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,480
your endless energy?

27
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,680
Start charging mode.

28
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,840
20 percent.

29
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,480
Charging mode speeds up.

30
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,760
Fifty percent.

31
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,680
Faster, faster, faster.

32
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,960
Speed up.

33
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,960
The power has reached 90.9 percent.

34
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,440
That's all for today.

35
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,000
All at once.

36
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,960
It'll explode.

37
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,160
Thank you for charging my phone.

38
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,440
I'll pay you back

39
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll pay you back.

40
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,120
Ten summon!

41
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,640
Just ten times.

42
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,680
We agreed to hold a horse and accompany the world.

43
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,080
I was wrong.

44
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm willing to do anything for you.

45
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,720
Be on standby.

46
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,880
Okay.

47
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,720
I'll give you two days off.

48
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,400
I'll keep the role of Pilma Oni for you.

49
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,480
I'll be waiting for you.

50
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,800
Thank you, heroine.

51
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,159
Well,

52
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,360
Can I use it just once today?

53
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,840
I want to hear a beautiful Twinkle Twinkle little star.

54
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,160
Play it for me.

55
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,160
OK?

56
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,320
Let's do it together.

57
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,000
Zhang Ruoxi.

58
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,200
The 50th anniversary of the establishment of No.1 High School of Luxiang City.

59
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,680
It’s the 50th Anniversary of No. 1 Middle School.

60
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,960
The festival is about to begin.

61
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,040
Please be disciplined.

62
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,000
Sit in the order of class.

63
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,800
Did you contact Lin Ruotear?

64
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,560
Why did you fail at the critical moment?

65
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,440
Forget it. Time is running out.

66
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,080
Tian Jiarong.

67
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,400
Come and be the lead singer.

68
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,600
Me?

69
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,440
Yes.

70
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,640
Practice first.

71
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,120
Mr. Dai will come to check later.

72
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,320
Get ready.

73
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,240
Get ready.

74
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,640
The five-star red flag is flying in the wind.

75
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,320
The song of victory is so loud

76
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,120
Sing our dear country

77
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,360
From now on, we will be prosperous

78
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,480
Singing our dear country

79
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,600
From now on, we will be prosperous

80
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,640
Over the mountains

81
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,560
Over the plains

82
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,720
Cross the running river

83
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,600
The vast and beautiful land

84
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,320
Our dear hometown.

85
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,400
The heroes are standing up.

86
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,280
We are united, love, and strong.

87
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,600
Class 1 and Class 6

88
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,720
are really nice.

89
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,360
I heard that two classes have prepared a show, right?

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Yes.

91
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,160
They rehearsed a play.

92
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,280
Xia Mi wrote the script herself.

93
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,040
Xiammy?

94
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,960
She's the girl who always causes trouble, right?

95
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
She is more lively.

96
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,360
In our class,

97
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
Tian Jiarong is also the lead.

98
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,520
The music is Ruoxi Zhang.

99
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,440
He played the piano very well.

100
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,320
Not bad.

101
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,720
It's really nice.

102
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,960
Our school

103
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,720
is to cultivate talents in many aspects.

104
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,760
Thank you for your hard work.

105
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,800
You taught me well.

106
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,120
What should I do?

107
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,360
What's wrong with Ruotear?

108
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,760
Yes.

109
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,960
She didn't come

110
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,520
She didn't come when we were singing.

111
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Right.

112
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,680
You can't be like this.

113
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,560
Still can't get through?

114
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,240
No one answered. I was worried if something happened to her.

115
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,960
The school anniversary has started.

116
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,960
Don't worry.

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,640
I've told Ms Qiao about the situation.

118
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,240
The most important thing now is to finish the performance.

119
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,840
Swordswoman.

120
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Why don't you do it?

121
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,640
You're familiar with this story.

122
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Me?

123
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,400
Yes.

124
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,960
No.

125
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,840
You're not familiar with the sudden change of actress.

126
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,120
I'll go to her house.

127
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,280
It takes more than an hour

128
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,400
It takes more than an hour.

129
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,640
It's too late.

130
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,120
The show is over.

131
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,760
Yes.

132
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,560
We only have

133
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,880
to practice again.

134
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,640
It's too late.

135
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,560
What about my narration?

136
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,760
I can read the narration.

137
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,600
I can recite the narration while playing the music.

138
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,640
Then...

139
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,920
No.

140
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,200
What should I do?

141
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,040
I'm going to memorize the lines now.

142
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,280
No.

143
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,320
There are so many narrators.

144
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,960
You can't take care of it alone.

145
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,720
Simin,

146
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,560
Can you

147
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,960
as the narrator?

148
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,840
No one is more suitable than you now.

149
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,840
I...

150
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
But I've never rehearsed.

151
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,280
You're a member of the radio station.

152
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
You have a good accent.

153
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
Plus when we rehearse,

154
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,720
when we rehearse.

155
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,560
You can't do it unless you're familiar with the script.

156
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,480
I believe you can do it.

157
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,960
Okay.

158
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Since you trust me,

159
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,640
I'll give it a try.

160
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,640
Come on.

161
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,480
OK.

162
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,640
Now the problem is solved.

163
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,400
There's no time to lose.

164
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,840
Let's rehearse again.

165
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,520
Okay.

166
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,200
Move.

167
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,040
Don't worry.

168
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,080
I'll keep in touch with Lin Ruotear.

169
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,320
Just focus on your performance.

170
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,880
Thank you.

171
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,200
Monitor

172
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,040
Let's rehearse.

173
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,560
Okay.

174
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,880
Let's practice the swordsmanship first.

175
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,600
Like this.

176
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,760
Let me demonstrate it to you.

177
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,480
No need.

178
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,400
I think Ruotear has practiced many times.

179
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,960
Just do it.

180
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,480
Three, two,

181
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,040
Lin Jinlong, give me back my phone.

182
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,160
You have so many friends.

183
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,480
You always answer calls.

184
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,360
The notes are quite special.

185
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,560
Boyfriend?

186
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,240
Should I answer it?

187
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,920
No.

188
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,640
Give it to his future brother-in-law.

189
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,560
Lin Jinlong, don't answer.

190
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,040
Give me some money.

191
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,720
Lin Jinlong, I have a performance this afternoon.

192
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Yes.

193
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Isn't that better?

194
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,520
You'll be embarrassed if you go like this.

195
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,040
I'm helping you.

196
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,080
Brother.

197
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,560
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,280
I won't talk back to you again.

199
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,640
I won't let you get hit.

200
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,920
Can you give me back my phone?

201
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,040
I beg you.

202
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,720
Brother.

203
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,280
Brother.

204
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,000
May all students of No.1 High School

205
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,680
learn to sail

206
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,200
Catch the wind

207
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,960
May you plant your perseverance and courage

208
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,840
To harvest dreams and love next year

209
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,200
Flowers bloom to the sky

210
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,920
I wish you good luck in the future.

211
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Life is not simple

212
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,840
Studying is infinite.

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,160
Time is worth it.

214
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,440
The future is yours.

215
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,320
Don't forget to love yourself

216
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,760
don't forget to love yourself.

217
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,680
Come on.

218
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,600
Let me teach you a way not to be nervous.

219
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,040
What is it?

220
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,680
When you act later,

221
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,880
you have to treat them like pigs.

222
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,920
as pigs.

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,200
Sit where you can play the piano.

224
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Play well.

225
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,400
Yes, sir.

226
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,200
Writer Han.

227
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,200
Thank you, monitor.

228
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,560
Come on!

229
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,440
Come on!

230
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
Come on, let's cheer up together.

231
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,360
Next program

232
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,560
is a drama performance

233
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,400
from Class 1-2 and Class 6.

234
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,240
The Princess Saving Plan

235
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,320
[A long time ago,]

236
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,760
a girl named Xiao Xue

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,720
wants to be the best swordswoman in the world.

238
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,640
But everyone thinks she's not that material.

239
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,960
and laughed at her.

240
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,440
The princess who grew up with her believes her.

241
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,840
Why is he so funny?

242
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,160
Why is he dressed like this?

243
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,080
The first one is

244
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,440
Princess.

245
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,680
I'm going to explore the world.

246
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,880
When I'm away,

247
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,240
[take care of yourself.]

248
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,560
Seol.

249
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,600
When will you come back?

250
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,400
After you leave,

251
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,120
no one will eat hot pot with me.

252
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,640
I'll come back

253
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,840
I'll be back.

254
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,320
Really?

255
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,560
Then swear to the moon.

256
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,360
I swear.

257
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,720
Princess,

258
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,520
I think you should change another hot pot partner.

259
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,240
She can't come back without a hundred years.

260
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,800
A roll of paper for a student spot.

261
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,920
Got it?

262
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,840
Middle School.

263
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:28,920
Middle!

264
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,160
Princess.

265
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,480
I've decided to eat coriander.

266
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,800
Aren't you going to change your mind?

267
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,480
You cunning man.

268
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,760
Don't think I don't know your real purpose.

269
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,360
You don't really like coriander.

270
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,000
It's all your fault.

271
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
If anything happens to the princess,

272
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,640
I'll punish you for a year.

273
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,480
Don't drink milk.

274
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,839
No, Dad!

275
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,960
I'd rather die than drink milk.

276
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,440
What about you?

277
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,599
No.

278
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,840
It's our fault.

279
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,840
No, no.

280
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,640
My face is about to get stiff.

281
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,720
It's too late.

282
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,920
Princess! Princess!

283
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,800
Princess!

284
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,160
Princess, why can't I open it?

285
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,000
Princess!

286
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,080
Idiot! Get us out of here!

287
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,120
What did the princess say?

288
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,200
Princess.

289
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,400
Princess!

290
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,160
I will use my ultimate skill!

291
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,360
You two idiots, get us out of here!

292
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,320
You idiots!

293
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,360
Did you find the secret drug?

294
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,240
Request backup.

295
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,320
No milk.

296
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
Those two idiots. I'll do it myself.

297
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,520
Rebellion curse.

298
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,200
This is good.

299
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,400
Great

300
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,640
Great

301
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,640
It was really great just now.

302
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,720
Xiao, you and Xiao Yu have great chemistry.

303
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,920
Yeah, we just...

304
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,520
I forgot the lyrics.

305
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,440
But you two are connected. Yeah.

306
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,240
Did you see the audience’s reaction?

307
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,400
Mr. Dai laughed so hard.

308
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,720
We are really good.

309
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,680
Don't flatter yourself.

310
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,000
If she's good, she's the creator of our script.

311
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,560
Rammy is the best.

312
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
Don't say that.

313
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,520
It's all because we worked together.

314
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,960
I didn't do it alone.

315
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,440
Don't be modest.

316
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,840
I announce that you are the MVP today.

317
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,320
And our monitor Young and Simin.

318
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,040
If it weren't for them,

319
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,640
we would have become the laughing stock of the whole school.

320
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,600
Yes.

321
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,400
But

322
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,680
I have something to say.

323
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,320
I think everyone here is a MVP.

324
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,040
Yes.

325
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,360
Yes.

326
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,520
Everyone except Xiao Junyi.

327
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,640
Why do you always pick on me?

328
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,840
Xiammy.

329
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,800
Ruotear, you...

330
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,120
Who are you?

331
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,880
What's wrong?

332
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,360
If something happens to her...

333
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,440
What's going on?

334
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,320
Don't worry.

335
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,440
If you go there recklessly,

336
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't you know how others treat you?

337
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Ruoxi is right.

338
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
We've met her family last time.

339
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,400
We should inform the teacher first

340
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,240
and then think of a plan carefully.

341
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,560
So many people came at once.

342
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,040
Jin Feng is quite popular.

343
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,320
Cut the crap.

344
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,480
Where is he?

345
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,160
Jin Feng.

346
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,760
Your friends are here.

347
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,480
I guess this high school is worth it.

348
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,760
You have so many loyal friends.

349
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,520
Is that you, Rammy?

350
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,120
Ruotear, I'm coming to save you.

351
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,560
What are you doing?

352
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,520
It's about money.

353
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,880
Do you know the rules?

354
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,560
The teachers and the police are on their way.

355
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,160
Let him go.

356
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,640
Stop bluffing.

357
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,400
I told you our lock is broken.

358
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,800
I need some money to fix it.

359
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,280
If you are her friends,

360
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,280
I'll let her out.

361
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,480
If you don't want to borrow it,

362
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
just leave.

363
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,720
What are you doing?

364
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,240
Do you want to fight?

365
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,640
You want to talk about the rules?

366
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Brother.

367
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,640
Someone borrowed money from us.

368
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,000
Are we going to borrow it or not?

369
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,520
Who dares to borrow money from me?

370
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,360
How dare you borrow money from me?

371
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,080
Who are you?

372
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,760
How dare you break into my house?

373
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,600
Who are you?

374
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
How dare you call yourself your father in front of my brother?

375
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,360
Are you blind?

376
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,880
Exactly.

377
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,600
What do you mean?

378
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
Which school?

379
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,960
Who's the boss?

380
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,400
What's your phone number?

381
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,960
Here.

382
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,960
Tell me.

383
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,120
Brother, stop talking to him.

384
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,720
He's blind.

385
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,360
Just hit him.

386
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,960
Bro.

387
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,440
Do you want to hit the white eyes or this stinky mouth?

388
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,800
Don't hit me.

389
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,280
Brother.

390
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,840
I don't want the money.

391
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,920
Take him away.

392
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,440
Hurry up.

393
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,160
Jin Feng. Jin Feng.

394
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,720
Your friends are here.

395
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,800
Your friends are all here.

396
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,440
Ruo tears.

397
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,320
It's okay.

398
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,680
It's okay.

399
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,360
Remember.

400
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,320
She...

401
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,680
I'll cover her.

402
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,720
I'll chop off

403
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,280
I'll chop off the hand.

404
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,960
Do you hear me?

405
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,680
Which hand will you chop off?

406
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,560
Do you hear me?

407
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,400
Yes.

408
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,920
Get lost!

409
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,360
Get lost!

410
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,320
Okay.

411
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,360
Brother.

412
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,720
This seems to be my home.

413
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,320
Your house?

414
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,000
Brother.

415
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,400
Please have a seat.

416
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:52,840
Okay.

417
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,680
I'll take care of it.

418
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,440
Brother.

419
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,520
Calm down.

420
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,240
We'll take care of him.

421
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
I can walk on my own.

422
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Are you okay?

423
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,080
Are you hurt?

424
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,440
I didn't expect that, Liu Dayou.

425
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,080
You're good at acting.

426
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,200
No, no, no.

427
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,840
I can't hold on any longer.

428
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,680
I didn't expect the leading role to be so difficult.

429
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,400
I'll never steal the lead again.

430
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,760
I'm sorry for today.

431
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,240
for causing you so much trouble.

432
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,000
Don't say sorry.

433
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,160
It's not your fault.

434
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,080
Right.

435
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,000
And we don't know

436
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,240
OD

437
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,600
Your family?

438
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
I heard the rumors at school.

439
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,040
Anyway,

440
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,480
I'm sorry.

441
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,520
Sorry.

442
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,320
It's okay.

443
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,440
Wipe it.

444
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,600
It's swollen

445
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,280
Thank you, monitor.

446
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
Don't thank me.

447
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,160
You should thank Rammy and Fan Yuan.

448
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,640
It was their idea.

449
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,040
If something happens to tear,

450
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,840
What's wrong?

451
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,320
Don't worry.

452
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,520
You went there recklessly.

453
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,080
Don't you know how others treat you?

454
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,640
Yeah, Xiammy.

455
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,760
Ruoxi is right.

456
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,240
We met her family.

457
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,120
If there's a first time, there'll be a second time.

458
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,840
I think we should come up with a solution first.

459
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,720
I do have an idea.

460
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,440
I just proposed a idea.

461
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,320
Or did she write this script?

462
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,040
Everyone is amazing.

463
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,040
I memorized the lines without preparation.

464
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,920
and completed the performance successfully.

465
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,160
Everyone is amazing.

466
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
Zhao Rui, good for you.

467
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,360
You like studying so much.

468
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:09,840
Now,

469
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,600
Tears. Tears.

470
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,400
Let's go to the hospital.

471
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,000
Tears

472
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,200
OFENSIVE

473
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,800
Are you feeling better?

474
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,200
Don't worry. When we return to school on Monday,

475
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,840
we'll clarify it for you.

476
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,640
Ruotear,

477
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,600
Lin Jinlong is not your brother, is he?

478
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,800
Ruotear,

479
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,240
If you have any difficulties,

480
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,440
you can tell us directly.

481
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,600
We'll help you.

482
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,280
You can also tell Mr. Wang.

483
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,360
Although he looks strict, he's a nice guy.

484
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,040
Help me apply for food allowance every month.

485
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,960
You can try it too.

486
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,880
Here's some water.

487
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,640
Here you go.

488
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,040
Here.

489
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,120
Thank you.

490
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,600
It's okay.

491
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,160
I was wrong before.

492
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,400
Especially for Yuhan and monitor Rong.

493
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,240
Sorry, monitor Rong.

494
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,640
I didn't mean it.

495
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,560
It's okay.

496
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
I was wrong before.

497
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,680
And you already paid me back.

498
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,280
Don't take other people's things anymore.

499
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Alright, let's not talk about this.

500
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,720
Let Ruotear drink some water first.

501
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,200
You've worked so hard today.

502
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,360
I'll buy you ice cream.

503
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,160
What do you want to eat?

504
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,960
Okay.

505
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,080
I want that.

506
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,520
I'm fine with anything.

507
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,000
How was your performance?

508
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,920
Sorry for the trouble.

509
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,120
Don't worry.

510
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,560
I played the heroine for you.

511
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,520
The response is great.

512
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,760
We did it perfectly.

513
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,920
Yes, it's funny.

514
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,040
His nanny is very funny.

515
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,960
The wig is a little hot.

516
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,440
Natmmy is really suitable to play a heroine.

517
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,280
Don't worry about the past.

518
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,760
Worry about the next exam.

519
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,320
Yes.

520
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,560
The college entrance exam is coming up.

521
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,360
The teacher might be afraid that we'll slack off.

522
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,040
It will take us a lot of time to practice.

523
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,440
I heard in the teacher's office that

524
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,400
before the college entrance exam,

525
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,760
we'll have a class called building activity.

526
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,400
Every class will cheer for

527
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,200
for seniors in grade 12.

528
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,760
Shout building activity.

529
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,520
It sounds powerful.

530
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,040
It will be lively then.

531
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,960
But

532
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,800
We'll be in grade 12 after the college entrance exam.

533
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,720
We'll be under a lot of pressure from studying.

534
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,800
Fan Yuan.

535
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,800
Shall we go to the secret base to study?

536
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,520
The class is always noisy.

537
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,680
It should be more efficient to go there.

538
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,800
Are you all going?

539
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,560
No problem.

540
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,160
Of course.

541
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,560
I'll go.

542
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,880
No problem. I can do it.

543
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,720
I like to study alone.

544
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,160
But we can study together sometimes.

545
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,360
I've been busy lately.

546
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,960
You can go.

547
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:16,960
Excuse me.

548
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,000
I... I need to take this call.

549
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,840
Don't worry.

550
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,720
I'll go check on him.

551
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,480
Hello?

552
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,840
Hello.

553
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Yes, I am.

554
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,320
I'll be there in half an hour.

555
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,960
Please wait a moment.

556
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,440
Okay, thank you.

557
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,160
Are you okay?

558
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,520
What's wrong?

559
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,040
Nothing.

560
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,920
Is it because

561
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,960
I called my dad.

562
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,320
I heard you're selling the company.

563
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,120
Is that true?

564
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,160
Can you not tell her?

565
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,920
But is it really okay to keep it from her?

566
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,240
If she knows,

567
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,520
she'll think too much.

568
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,240
Maybe she can't even read.

569
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,160
I don't want to affect her now.

570
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,280
Don't worry.

571
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,760
Everything will be solved.

572
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,560
I'll tell her myself.

573
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,920
Okay.

574
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,200
I have to go.

575
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,880
Please

576
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,520
tell her for me.

577
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,240
Call me.

578
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,880
We've found the buyer.

579
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,920
This is the contract.

580
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,360
Please

581
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,720
take a look.

582
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,880
You can sign it if there's no problem.

583
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,840
Okay.

584
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,040
My dad is still working outside.

585
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,480
or

586
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,880
I can send it to you tomorrow

587
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,800
I'll send it to you tomorrow, okay?

588
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,800
No need.

589
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,120
I'll pick it up at this time tomorrow.

590
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,640
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

591
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,160
Take care.

592
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,040
Okay.

593
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,080
Let me give you a ride.

594
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,040
No, no, no.

595
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,800
Sit down.

596
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,760
You should study.

597
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,200
Dad.

598
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,400
Dad.

599
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,400
The wound on your face...

600
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,960
I'm fine.

601
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,440
I had a few more drinks with your uncles.

602
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,120
I accidentally fell to the ground.

603
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,120
Don't worry.

604
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,880
Ruoxi.

605
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,160
Don't worry about

606
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,680
Don't worry.

607
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,920
I can take care of everything.

608
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,080
Your mom will get better.

609
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,840
You...

610
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,840
Just focus on your studies.

611
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,120
Okay.

612
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,120
We have all the money we can get now.

613
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,960
Give it to Zhang tomorrow.

614
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,199
It must be hard for you.

615
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,719
Why?

616
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,480
The most difficult thing now is Mr. Jang.

617
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,159
Hye-fen suddenly fell sick.

618
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,960
and something happened to the company.

619
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
What did your lawyer student say?

620
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
Can you get the money back?

621
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,640
It's not a big chance. It's not a big deal.

622
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
But we have to

623
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
give it a try.

624
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,000
Dad.

625
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,000
Mom.

626
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,440
Are you talking about Ruoxi's house?

627
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,800
Why are you still up?

628
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,240
I'll sleep later.

629
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,360
So what happened to Ruoxi's house?

630
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,440
Is it serious?

631
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,160
Don't worry.

632
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,320
Your dad hired a lawyer immediately.

633
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Don't worry about it.

634
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,680
Go to sleep.

635
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,280
Qinyuan.

636
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,080
Your mom and I will do everything we can.

637
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,320
Just worry about going to Germany.

638
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,640
You should book a flight in a few days.

639
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,520
Okay, Dad.

640
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,000
Go.

641
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,360
Mom and Dad.

642
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,280
Can you postpone

643
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,840
Can you postpone it until summer vacation?

644
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,800
You left without telling me.

645
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,000
He didn't even reply my texts.

646
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,120
What is he doing?

647
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,400
[If you don't reply today,]

648
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
I'll never text you again.

649
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,000
Don't you think

650
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,080
a little too much?

651
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,200
Take that back.

652
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,400
Hello?

653
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,680
What are you doing? Why aren't you replying?

654
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,560
Pull the curtains.

655
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,720
You finally smiled.

656
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,800
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,480
for making you worry about me.

658
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,320
I'm fine.

659
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,720
Why did you come to my house in the middle of the night?

660
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,320
Did something happen to your family?

661
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,560
Do you miss my family that much?

662
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,680
Of course not.

663
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,640
I'll be back soon.

664
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,680
Don't worry.

665
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,400
What do you think

666
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,880
that I can't solve?

667
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,120
Fine.

668
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,280
Ms. Zhang Ruoxi is the best in the world, okay?

669
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,280
What's wrong?

670
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,000
You didn't tell the truth.

671
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,840
I'm leaving.

672
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,680
Xiammy.

673
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,680
To be honest,

674
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,920
the moon is so beautiful today.

675
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,080
If I don't remind you,

676
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,200
you'll miss it.

677
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,360
Do you know Natsume Soseki?

678
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,440
I know.

679
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,240
The one that says I'm a cat.

680
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,360
Why do you ask?

681
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,360
Nothing.

682
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,720
Talk later.

683
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,320
Look.

684
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,440
You'll miss it if you don't.

685
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,840
Okay.

686
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,160
Let me see.

687
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Let me see.

688
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,960
What wish will you make this time?

689
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,080
Don't ask.

690
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,520
It won't work if I tell you.

691
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,600
What's wrong?

692
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,120
Open your hands.

693
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,120
This is my wish.

694
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,680
I'll leave it with you.

695
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,520
When your wish comes true,

696
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,160
you can return the stars to me.

697
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,800
Sure.

698
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,000
Your wish will come true.

699
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,200
No.

700
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,560
It's our wish.

701
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,960
Ruoxi.

702
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,000
Let's go to the film academy together.

703
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,400
What did you say?

704
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,600
Didn't you hear me?

705
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,040
Forget it.

706
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,120
I heard it.

707
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,160
You said you wanted to go to the film academy together,

708
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,480
right?

709
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,520
I'm glad you know.

710
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,760
It's getting late. I'm going back.

711
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
You too.

712
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,320
