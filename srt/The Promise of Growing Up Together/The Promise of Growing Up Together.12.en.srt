1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,479
Okay. Okay.

3
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,200
Ruoxi, you did a great job. Okay.

4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,600
This is what I want.

5
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,240
Come on. One more time. Keep one safe.

6
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,360
This is for you.

7
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,840
Thank you.

8
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,039
Cut.

9
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,240
Ruoxi.

10
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,479
You did a great job.

11
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,039
Let's change the camera.

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,400
One more shot for girls.

13
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,680
It's good to be young.

14
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,400
Go Go Go

15
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,520
Let's get ready for the next scene.

16
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,040
Let's take a break.

17
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Take a break and get ready to shoot.

18
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,960
Okay, thank you, Director.

19
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,880
Kitten.

20
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,840
Why are you following me?

21
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,840
Don't bite me.

22
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,560
What's wrong?

23
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,360
You came at the right time.

24
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,920
It doesn't seem to be able to find its owner.

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,480
Help it find its owner.

26
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,280
I'm scared.

27
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,640
Are you scared of cats?

28
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,920
No.

29
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
Because I was born in the year of rat.

30
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,760
and I'm the king.

31
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,640
It's the vice director's cat.

32
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
It's not scary.

33
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,079
It's just a surgery.

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,280
I'm just a little scared.

35
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,440
It looks cute.

36
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,960
Touch it.

37
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
I found your cat.

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,840
Coming.

39
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,360
Where did you go?

40
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,920
You must be tired.

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,320
Yes.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,520
Why are you here?

43
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,200
Did I disturb you?

44
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,040
No, it's my problem.

45
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,240
It's my first time acting with a stranger.

46
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,240
It's a bit awkward.

47
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,680
Unnatural.

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
I don't know much about acting,

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,520
but I think I should be serious about work.

50
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,880
No matter who your opponent is,

51
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,680
you have to do your best.

52
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,320
That's what a professional actor should do.

53
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,520
I believe you can do it.

54
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,880
Take this heart.

55
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,480
you will overcome all difficulties.

56
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,360
Okay.

57
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,240
With this heart,

58
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,640
I can act as a rival with the director.

59
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,560
Are you kidding me?

60
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,720
You hit me!

61
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,840
What if you break the best actor?

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,120
Well...

63
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
I'll call 120 for you.

64
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,680
But before that, you have to sign with me first.

65
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,920
When you become famous, I can make a fortune.

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,360
You're really scheming.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,159
You want me to sign it?

68
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,360
What if I don't?

69
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,920
You've received my heart.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,320
That's a different matter. Why must I sign it with you?

71
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,960
Ruoxi.

72
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,080
Ready.

73
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,360
Get ready.

74
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,200
Let's go.

75
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:56,600
Come on.

76
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,560
Get ready.

77
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,800
Cut.

78
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,400
Very good.

79
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,280
Come on, let's go to that position and fix the camera.

80
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:16,920
Ready.

81
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,640
It's so pretty!

82
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,360
Namida, you went to Hainan?

83
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,480
Why don't you take some photos?

84
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,720
Beautiful people take beautiful pictures.

85
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,120
Is there justice?

86
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you.

87
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,000
My selfies are so ugly.

88
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,920
Let's just take a photo of the scenery.

89
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,360
Is Kainan fun? Where have you been?

90
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,080
It's okay. Those hot spots.

91
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,720
or beach.

92
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm tired of staying here for too long.

93
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,440
I'd rather stay home and play with you.

94
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,680
Let's go out

95
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
we can go out together.

96
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,880
Are you that happy?

97
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,040
Maybe.

98
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,880
Namida has returned from Kainan.

99
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,640
Did she come back by rocket?

100
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,320
Maybe she has her reasons.

101
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,920
Let's help her in the future.

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,440
Let's go.

103
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,720
Mom, give me the money.

104
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,880
Don't waste your time.

105
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,760
I have something urgent.

106
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,520
right?

107
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,120
Listen to me.

108
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
You only have me. Who else can you give me the money?

109
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,960
Besides, who will support you in the future?

110
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,040
I'll take care of you.

111
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,480
Jin Long, why do you need money?

112
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,840
Be good. Stop it.

113
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,800
Cut the crap and give me the money.

114
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
My friend is waiting for me at the internet cafe.

115
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,600
Jin Long, listen to me.

116
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Don't hang out with them.

117
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,280
They made you fight.

118
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,360
and wrote it down.

119
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,960
They are not good people.

120
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,640
Leave them alone.

121
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,200
Lin Jinlong, what are you doing?

122
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:47,800
Sister.

123
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,520
It's useless to save the money at home.

124
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,440
Why don't you save it for your brother?

125
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,400
When I get rich,

126
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,200
I'll pay you back with interest.

127
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
I told you not to call my name again.

128
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,280
Can you give me back my cash bank?

129
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,040
I'll teach you a lesson.

130
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,360
So what?

131
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,880
Lin Jin.

132
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,720
Lin Jinfeng.

133
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,040
Are you crazy?

134
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,520
Stop crying.

135
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,520
Why are you crying?

136
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,600
Don't hit her.

137
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
All you do is cry.

138
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,240
She cried and ran away.

139
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,120
The goods for compensation.

140
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,520
You are biased.

141
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,200
Lin Jinlong is a high school student.

142
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,640
He fights or fights every day.

143
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,080
You gave him so much money.

144
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,160
I've already done enough homework.

145
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,440
You still want me to do so many housework?

146
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,800
How dare you talk back?

147
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,840
Listen,

148
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,920
I give you food, drink, and study.

149
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,480
You even confessed your problem, right?

150
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,120
Let me tell you.

151
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,320
Blame your cheap father for dying early.

152
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,880
Jin Feng, stop it.

153
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,120
You still want to hit me?

154
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,680
I'll teach you a lesson.

155
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,280
Honey.

156
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,080
Don't be angry.

157
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,080
She has always been stubborn.

158
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Ignore her.

159
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,960
I'll make you some snacks.

160
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Don't let me hear you cry again.

161
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
or never come into my house again.

162
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,720
This is my home.

163
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,560
All right.

164
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,800
Come down. I'll wait for you downstairs.

165
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,600
Sure.

166
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,960
Nice hairstyle.

167
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,280
Don't mess it up.

168
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,720
I'm going to win the first semester.

169
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,160
I'm so happy.

170
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Good luck.

171
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Feed regularly.

172
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,160
Little Fragrant Pig, get in the car.

173
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,560
Who are you talking about?

174
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,640
You. Who else could it be?

175
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
You're the pig.

176
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,680
Morning.

177
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,840
Long time no see.

178
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,840
Rammy.

179
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,160
Ruo tears, long time no see. I miss you so much.

180
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,200
You two are magnets.

181
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,520
You meet each other.

182
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,800
Shell, Natmmy.

183
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,920
This is the shell I brought back from Kainan.

184
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,360
I made it into three paintings.

185
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,000
for you.

186
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,880
Hope you like it.

187
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Thank you, Ruotear.

188
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,600
Monitor

189
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,320
Thank you.

190
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,560
Okay, thank you.

191
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,960
You're welcome. As long as you like it.

192
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,080
Xiammy.

193
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,240
What did you do during summer vacation?

194
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
I watched a lot of TV dramas this summer.

195
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,560
and wrote a lot of scripts.

196
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm quite happy.

197
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,720
By the way,

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,080
I've read two manuscripts.

199
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,720
The editor will send me the payment right away.

200
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,640
Tell me what you want to eat.

201
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,440
I'll buy it for you.

202
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,200
Xiammy.

203
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,640
Ruoxi.

204
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,840
I need to go to class.

205
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm leaving.

206
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,360
See you after class.

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,320
Goodbye, monitor.

208
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,480
Xiammy.

209
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Zeyang asked me to tell you this.

210
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,160
He knows your goal is to study in Germany.

211
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,640
He's in Germany now.

212
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,480
He won this time.

213
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,600
When you go to Germany,

214
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,280
after you go to Germany.

215
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,960
What?

216
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,880
Qin Zeyang is in Germany.

217
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,760
How could he win?

218
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,720
Is he afraid of losing and running away?

219
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,680
That's right.

220
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,120
What is he doing?

221
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,000
He's so arrogant.

222
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,640
Why is he so arrogant?

223
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,120
Yeah.

224
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,720
Qin Zeyang went to Germany.

225
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,600
Please take care of him.

226
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,480
You're in Class 1 too.

227
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,360
Monitor.

228
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,680
If you get one point out, my heart will be empty.

229
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,080
as if I'm missing a piece.

230
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Dayou.

231
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,120
You're disgusting.

232
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,840
Zhao Rui is also in Class 1.

233
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Why didn't you tell me?

234
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,440
I just need two pieces.

235
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay?

236
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,560
Yes.

237
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
Then don't.

238
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,320
You'll have a heart problem if you need two pieces.

239
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,960
Don't be sad.

240
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,960
I told you not to break up.

241
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
We can look for it together.

242
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,560
Monitor, play with Zhao Rui.

243
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,600
I'll lead.

244
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,600
Do I need you to lead?

245
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,600
Don't forget that a lady hasn't come yet.

246
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,000
If she arrives,

247
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,480
she'll be the first to go up.

248
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,760
Right, Fan Yuan?

249
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,640
Zhao Rui and I

250
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
will come to you.

251
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,520
We still have a secret base.

252
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,600
Let's go for the new semester!

253
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,920
Come on.

254
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,920
Let's go.

255
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,280
Look at the position.

256
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,680
Break the curse and sit wherever you want.

257
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,480
Maybe we can be deskmates.

258
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,960
Take a look.

259
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,480
Who?

260
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,120
Lin Ruotear.

261
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,360
Ruoxi.

262
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
I see your location.

263
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,440
The second and third row.

264
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,600
She is her deskmate.

265
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,920
Ms. Qiao is so generous.

266
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,480
He asked those who got into top ten to choose their seats.

267
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,560
He really gave way.

268
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
I'll be in the top ten next time.

269
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,920
Give me that bag.

270
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,720
I'll put it with you.

271
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,840
No.

272
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,080
I can do it myself.

273
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,920
Ruoxi Zhang.

274
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,920
Congratulations.

275
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,400
Do you want to play a firecrackers to celebrate?

276
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,880
Yes.

277
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,160
More.

278
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,560
Hello deskmate.

279
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,800
Hello.

280
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,720
Is everyone here?

281
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,800
Sit tight. Get ready for class.

282
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,520
Hello, everyone.

283
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,520
It's an honor to be the head teacher of this new group.

284
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,640
Whether it's the students from Class 1

285
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,680
or from other classes,

286
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,000
From now on,

287
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,119
we are all members of Class 6.

288
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,280
OK, as usual.

289
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,119
I'll pick the monitor first.

290
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,880
The male class monitor.

291
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,839
Ruoxi Zhang.

292
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,119
Ruoxi.

293
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,520
You're the class monitor.

294
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,280
With such a cruel deskmate like you,

295
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,480
Ruoxi Zhang.

296
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,920
Are you not satisfied with your deskmate?

297
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,800
No.

298
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,320
I'm very satisfied.

299
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,320
Although it's just a class meeting,

300
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,400
but you get distracted on the first day of class.

301
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,760
It'll be hard to convince the other students.

302
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,200
You can be the class monitor.

303
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,080
That's right.

304
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,520
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,120
I'll set an example from now on.

306
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,720
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,520
Okay, it depends on your performance.

308
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,120
Have a seat.

309
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,960
Next, I'll appoint other class committee members.

310
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,200
Female monitor.

311
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,920
Tian Jiarong.

312
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,640
Xiao Junyi, PE Committee.

313
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,520
It's me again.

314
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,880
Wang Xiao Yu, the art committee.

315
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,840
Do you want to...

316
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,680
Ruo tears.

317
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,680
Do you want to eat?

318
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,440
My treat.

319
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,040
Let's go.

320
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
You guys go eat.

321
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,040
I'm not going.

322
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
I have a cold.

323
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,880
Natmmy.

324
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,520
Monitor.

325
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,080
I need to take care of Ruotear.

326
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,480
Go to the canteen with Zhang Ruoxi.

327
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,400
Ruoxi.

328
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,560
Amy...

329
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,480
You're her deskmate this semester.

330
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,800
For her?

331
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,320
Yes.

332
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,960
Give it to me first.

333
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,920
I'll give it to her then.

334
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,600
I suddenly remembered that I haven't written a chapter.

335
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,960
I'll give it to her later.

336
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,200
Sure.

337
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,000
Let's go.

338
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,640
Let's go.

339
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,320
Let's go.

340
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,640
What's in the canteen today?

341
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,680
Ruo tears.

342
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,960
I finally found you.

343
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Xiammy.

344
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,840
Why didn't you have dinner with Ruoxi and the others?

345
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,480
I want to eat with you.

346
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,680
I'm not feeling well today.

347
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,040
I have no appetite.

348
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,600
You need to eat to get better.

349
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,240
Right?

350
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,160
I really don't...

351
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,960
Come on. Let's go.

352
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,280
I didn't mean it.

353
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,880
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,960
I'm in a bad mood because I caught a cold.

355
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,400
I can't focus in class.

356
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
That's why.

357
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,400
You almost tripped me.

358
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,720
So you're going to eat with me.

359
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,560
I was just kidding.

360
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,720
When I was passing the notice board,

361
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,000
I saw the news station recruiting.

362
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,040
This year...

363
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,880
The broadcaster is recruiting.

364
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,400
Don't be upset.

365
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,040
You've always wanted to be an announcer.

366
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,480
You can take this opportunity to sign up.

367
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,080
right?

368
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,320
Come with me.

369
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,440
Then you have to eat with me first.

370
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,880
Now,

371
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,080
let's welcome Miss Lin Ruotear

372
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,560
to the canteen.

373
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,160
Just like you, copy and lift your head.

374
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,800
You wiped it off before you finished copying the blackboard.

375
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,560
You're so fast.

376
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,880
faster than you.

377
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,480
Xiammy.

378
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,560
Ruoxi.

379
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,240
Can I copy this?

380
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,200
Here.

381
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,040
Thank you.

382
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,120
Remember to pay it back.

383
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,160
Got it.

384
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,800
Rammy.

385
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Monitor.

386
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,520
Why are you here?

387
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,640
This is my summer vacation

388
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,320
during summer vacation.

389
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,760
I hope it can help when I'm not around.

390
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,880
You weren't here last time.

391
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,520
I took it back and added some.

392
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,240
Monitor, you're so thoughtful.

393
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,640
I don't know how to repay you.

394
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,640
I thought you would say

395
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
To repay the hero's life,

396
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,160
I can only do anything in my next life.

397
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,720
Ruoxi.

398
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,520
Can you teach me

399
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,400
I don't understand it. Can you teach me?

400
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,280
You'll understand it in a simple way.

401
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,640
And this.

402
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,360
This is about the changing lines of two dates.

403
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,280
One is the International Japanese line and the middle of the night

404
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,880
They are

405
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,920
The time is 24 and 0

406
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,400
The monitor is so careful

407
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,960
But it's different each time

408
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,800
Sit down.

409
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,000
I have good news to tell you.

410
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,040
There will be an expedition group visiting our school by the end of this month.

411
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,160
There will be a dance performance.

412
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,600
From this week, Mr. Yang will take time to teach you.

413
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Social dance.

414
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,360
Let's dance. Let's dance.

415
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,560
Mentor.

416
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Is it a waltz dance?

417
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,080
A boy and a girl dance together.

418
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,360
Almost.

419
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,880
The teacher can't dance either.

420
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,760
I really don't know what type it is

421
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,520
But it's a boy and a girl.

422
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Can we choose our partner?

423
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,320
It depends on Mr. Yang's arrangement.

424
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,080
How about this?

425
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,840
Lin Ruotear.

426
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,680
Yes.

427
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,000
You usually get in touch with Mr. Yang.

428
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,080
You can communicate with Mr. Yang

429
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,760
and take care of it.

430
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,920
OK.

431
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,520
Don't cry.

432
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,000
Don't let us be a group.

433
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,520
Don't.

434
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,040
Quiet.

435
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,480
You can learn dancing,

436
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,400
But learning is the most important.

437
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,920
Take out your books.

438
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,720
Time for class.

439
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,840
Mr. Yang.

440
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,920
I've finished my English homework this weekend.

441
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,240
Okay, put it here.

442
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,960
Thank you.

443
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,760
Sir.

444
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,240
Are you assigning the list of the dance?

445
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,520
Good.

446
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,640
you are more familiar with your classmates.

447
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,800
Give me some advice.

448
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,720
Sir,

449
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,560
If you're busy, I can help you.

450
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,360
Besides,

451
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,440
my classmates were asking about the list.

452
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,640
Sure.

453
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,200
I'll leave this event to you.

454
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,720
We're working with Class 1 this time.

455
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,160
There are many boys in Class 1.

456
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Class 6 is less.

457
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,920
After you decide on the matching quota,

458
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,240
check it for me before afternoon.

459
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,800
Okay?

460
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,600
Okay.

461
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,640
Take it.

462
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,360
Goodbye.

463
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,760
Gather around.

464
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
Turn left and right.

465
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,280
Look forward.

466
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,480
You've learned the basic steps.

467
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,320
Let's follow this formation.

468
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,320
Don't forget to form a group of four.

469
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,680
and exchange partners according to the music festival.

470
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,440
Understand?

471
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,880
Yes.

472
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,680
Sir.

473
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,040
Can't we exchange partners freely?

474
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,320
I've learned too much in this class.

475
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,160
We don't have enough time.

476
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,160
Keep this formation and don't move.

477
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,680
I knew she was going to do something.

478
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,040
Get ready.

479
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,200
Ruoxi.

480
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,600
Please do me a favor.

481
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,560
It's okay.

482
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,440
I'm not good at it either.

483
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,400
Just don't worry that I'll step on you.

484
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,120
Monitor.

485
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,600
Be careful.

486
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,200
I'm not good at dancing.

487
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,280
Don't get yourself into trouble.

488
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,280
Don't worry.

489
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,200
You can jump freely.

490
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,880
I'll take you

491
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,840
Music, go.

492
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,040
Five, six, seven, eight, exchange partners.

493
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,720
You are too impatient.

494
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,520
You dragged me here all of a sudden.

495
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,480
What are you two doing?

496
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,560
Dancing seriously.

497
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,120
Ruoxi.

498
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,520
Why did you drag me here? I'm not your partner.

499
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,680
I don't want to dance with her.

500
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,840
If you don't want to, then don't.

501
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,040
Just make up for it.

502
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,360
I don't want to be criticized by the teacher anyway.

503
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,480
You too?

504
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,440
I don't care.

505
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,320
Anyway, we must switch back later.

506
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,680
Ruoxi.

507
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,520
What?

508
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,720
Sir.

509
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,600
What's wrong?

510
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,640
Ruo tears.

511
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,480
What's wrong?

512
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,000
Are you okay?

513
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,920
Are you okay?

514
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,680
Are you hurt?

515
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,720
Sir.

516
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,040
I sprained my ankle

517
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
I sprained my ankle.

518
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,080
Can you hang in there?

519
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,440
Yes, sir.

520
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,680
Back to the initial formation.

521
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,280
Time is tight and mission is heavy.

522
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,120
Remember all the steps and formation.

523
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,880
Go back and practice by yourselves.

524
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,640
Speed up.

525
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,760
Hurry up.

526
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,840
Are you sure you can do it?

527
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,280
Are you ready?

528
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,120
Start.

529
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,240
Give me one.

530
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,360
Ruotear.

531
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,040
Why are you running so fast? You disappeared after class.

532
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
You want ice cream?

533
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,400
I'll buy it for you.

534
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,520
Excuse me.

535
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,240
Sorry.

536
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,280
Amy.

537
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,360
Here.

538
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,320
It's delicious.

539
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,960
Summer without ice is incomplete.

540
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,840
Tears

541
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,040
Are you unhappy?

542
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,600
I'm a little unhappy.

543
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,920
Since I came back from summer vacation,

544
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,360
Ruoxi has been acting strange towards me.

545
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,240
Do you think he hates me?

546
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
No way.

547
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,280
You're nice and pretty.

548
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,520
How could I hate you?

549
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,960
Don't comfort me.

550
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,160
If he doesn't hate me,

551
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,440
why did he only want to dance with you?

552
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,920
He probably wants to see me embarrass myself.

553
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,000
Nothing else.

554
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,440
Amy,

555
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,600
How do you feel

556
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Ruoxi?

557
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,520
How do you feel?

558
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,400
Just like how I treat you and the monitor.

559
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,640
We're friends.

560
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,520
Really?

561
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,880
Yes.

562
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,880
That's great, Xiammy.

563
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,880
I'm really worried that all of you will abandon me.

564
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,760
You are really my best friends

565
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,800
since childhood.

566
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,480
I really don't want to lose you.

567
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,680
Don't worry.

568
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,480
You will never lose us.

569
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,840
Well,

570
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,600
can you ask Ruoxi out for a dance practice?

571
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,360
I really want to get close to Ruoxi.

572
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,360
But I'm afraid if I ask him out,

573
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
if I ask him out.

574
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,480
Amy,

575
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
okay?

576
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,280
Please.

577
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,640
Don't mention it.

578
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:28,960
How about this?

579
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,880
I'll ask him for you.

580
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,920
But I don't know if he agrees.

581
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,760
Great, Rammy. I knew you would agree.

582
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,560
You're here.

583
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,679
Why do you look so pale?

584
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,520
Are you sick?

585
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,280
Or did someone upset you?

586
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,199
No.

587
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,719
I just want to ask if you are free after school.

588
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,159
after school?

589
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,760
Ruotear and I are not familiar with the dance.

590
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,920
Are you really not afraid of wasting my time?

591
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,880
I have an appointment with Xiao Junyi after school.

592
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,639
I'm busy.

593
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,440
Forget it if you don't want to.

594
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,680
Did she ask you to come?

595
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,400
No.

596
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,960
It's my idea.

597
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,560
Can you not do whatever others ask you to?

598
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,040
Can you be smarter?

599
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,160
You're the smartest in the world.

600
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,240
Okay?

601
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,120
Are you

602
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,240
so happy?

603
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
It's none of your business.

604
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,920
It's you Monitor

605
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,280
Who are you texting? You're distracted.

606
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,280
With the editor of the magazine.

607
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,600

608
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,880
Congratulations, Xiammy.

609
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,760
You are really talented in writing.

610
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,000
This is just a small magazine.

611
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,360
Compared to your math competition,

612
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,920
I'm just a child's play.

613
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,880
No.

614
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,040

615

when they first submit their drafts.

616
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,520
Not only did you publish your first manuscript,

617
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,680
but also a regular author.

618
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,600
You're amazing.

619
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,600
No.

620
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,840
It's all luck.

621
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,960
Someone said

622
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,440
you'll buy me a meal when you get paid?

623
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,120
Why are you going back on your word now?

624
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,040
I didn't say I wouldn't.

625
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,400
I just received the payment.

626
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,400
Yes. Let me remind you.

627
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,840
Because you were born in the year of goldfish.

628
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,440
You're the goldfish.

629
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,760

630
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,800

632

634
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,520
I forgot it.

635
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,160
We've been in different classes for over a month.

636
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,880
I'm not used to not being in the same class with you.

637
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:07,920
It's okay.

638
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,920
Get back to work.

639
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,920
