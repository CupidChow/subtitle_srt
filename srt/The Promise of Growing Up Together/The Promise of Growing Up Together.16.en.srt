1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,680
Come on.

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,360
What's wrong?

4
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,680
Xiao Junyi.

5
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,360
Have you seen Xie Yuhan?

6
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,320
I saw her

7
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,640
carrying a bag.

8
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,680
Maybe he went to the swimming pool for training

9
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,240
Thank you.

10
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
Xiao Junyi.

11
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,800
What did Ruotear tell you?

12
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,240
She asked me where she was.

13
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,320
I said she went to the swimming pool.

14
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Oh no!

15
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,560
This pose...

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,760
Mars will hit the earth.

17
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,720
Only you have a mouth.

18
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,160
I...

19
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,840
There's nothing between Lin Ruotear and me.

20
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,600
Calm down.

21
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,920
What's wrong?

22
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,079
What are you talking about?

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,760
What's wrong?

24
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,200
Something happened to Lin Ruotear.

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,440
Everyone is

26
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,880
talking about her.

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,560
What will happen to Tear?

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,120
Monitor!

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,079
Bad news.

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,720
Ruotear went to the swimming pool to find Xie Yuhan.

31
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,120
Do you think they will fight?

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,200
Ruoxi.

33
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,840
What's wrong?

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,320
Lin Ruotear went to the swimming pool to find Han.

35
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,120
I'm afraid they'll fight.

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,640
Let's go.

37
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,720
Xie Yuhan.

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,680
Where did you steal my student ID?

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,400
How much do you know now?

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,680
How much do you know now?

41
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,640
Are you crazy?

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,560
You took my student ID form.

43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,320
What are you doing with my student ID?

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,880
It's you.

45
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,480
It's you.

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,120
BEY OND.

47
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,920
Xie Yuhan.

48
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,760
I knew you hated me.

49
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,600
But I never thought you were such a person.

50
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,600
Isn't that enough?

51
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,920
I pushed you.

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,840
I pushed it, OK?

53
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,520
Thank you, Yuhan.

54
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,080
You went too far this time.

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,960
Apologize to her.

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,120
She deserved it.

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,560
Why should I apologize?

58
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,760
Let's go.

59
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,079
I'll take you to the infirmary.

60
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,800
Yuhan, you...

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,840
Don't be angry.

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,680
Fan Yuan is worried that you'll be held accountable.

63
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,960
You'll be fired if you're in the swimming team.

64
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,520
Fine.

65
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
None of your business.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,640
BEY

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,960
BEY OND

68
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,520
Baby

69
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,560
Why are you crying?

70
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,720
I thought Lin Ruotear

71
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,520
a gentle and lovely cotton coat.

72
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,920
It turns out to be a pile of cotton.

73
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,520
A black-hearted cotton.

74
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,800
Mom, I don't want to believe this world anymore.

75
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,680
But Han, you are more miserable.

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,640
Don't worry.

77
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,080
I'll clarify it for you.

78
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,080
I don't care.

79
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,159
It's not a misunderstanding. It's a misunderstanding.

80
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,320
Sister Han,

81
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,200
Do you want me to lend you my shoulder?

82
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,800
Just cry.

83
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,240
Sister Han.

84
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,320
Don't go.

85
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,960
We're both in the same boat.

86
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,880
Let's discuss our current experiences together.

87
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,800
Sister Han.

88
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,520
Sister Han.

89
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,560
Sister Han.

90
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,760
Ruoxi.

91
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,320
Xiammy.

92
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
Please take care of Han for me.

93
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,040
I was a bit impulsive just now.

94
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,440
I don't know what she's thinking.

95
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,320
I'm afraid she'll do something impulsive.

96
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,520
Don't worry.

97
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,760
She will be fine.

98
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,480
Although she's a little willful,

99
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,000
she's not someone who can't tell right from wrong.

100
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,480
Please.

101
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,520
I'll take her to the infirmary.

102
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,040
Go ahead.

103
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,520
She didn't push her down.

104
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,400
I know.

105
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,400
I thought

106
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,640
she was mad at me and you.

107
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,320
I didn't know.

108
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,240
So,

109
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,760
she doesn't deserve you to be so sad.

110
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
Fan Yuan is sober.

111
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,840
He can tell who is right from wrong.

112
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,960
I'm not sad.

113
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,200
Since this is her choice,

114
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,120
let her be.

115
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,640
Let's go.

116
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,800
Thank you, Young Lady.

117
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,120
Thank you.

118
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,800
It's okay.

119
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,240
Take a good rest here.

120
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,360
I'll ask for leave for you.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You...

122
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,040
stay with me?

123
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm a little scared.

124
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,440
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I may have gone too far.

126
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,720
It's okay.

127
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,600
Go back to class.

128
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,800
Don't mention it.

129
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,920
The doctor is outside.

130
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Call her if you need anything.

131
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,800
Bye.

132
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,440
Watch where you're going.

133
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,920
Do you want to sit in a wheelchair in your next life?

134
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,920
I told you he's not worth it.

135
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,560
I didn't. I...

136
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
Okay.

137
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,800
What are you doing?

138
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,640
It's safer to tie you up.

139
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,040
in case something happens again.

140
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,360
What do you mean?

141
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,600
Do you think I'm a puppy?

142
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,840
I didn't say that.

143
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,280
Don't take your seats.

144
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,000
Hit me.

145
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,000
How could you hit me?

146
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,880
Qinyuan.

147
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,520
Here.

148
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,480
Here.

149
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,960
Your dad has contacted your language school.

150
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,000
Take a look at the information.

151
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,520
The boarding family was a good friend of your dad when he studied abroad.

152
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,000
and a math professor at Porn University.

153
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,360
Don’t worry.

154
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,480
Thank you, mom.

155
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,200
No matter what it is,

156
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
since we've made the decision,

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,480
let's do it firmly.

158
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,080
Don't leave any regrets.

159
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,320
Rest early, mom.

160
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,680
As long as I eat enough,

161
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,320
no one will look down on me.

162
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Nuwa smiled while pinching people.

163
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,200
I don't understand why Pangu is smiling.

164
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,440
Nuwa said

165
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,480
happiness is the most important thing in life.

166
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,480
Bye.

167
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,080
Boss.

168
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,360
Hey.

169
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,120
Excuse me.

170
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,200
We're off work.

172
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,440
I want milk tea. Please come early tomorrow.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,600
No, boss.

174
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,600
Aren't you looking for a part-time job?

175
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,280
Can I do it?

176
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,080
No.

177
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,040
What do you do for a high school student?

178
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,920
You should go back and study.

179
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,440
No.

180
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,280
Why did you come in alone?

181
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,640
You didn't do it on purpose?

182
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,160
Boss.

183
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,640
I'm not making trouble.

184
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,240
Here's the thing.

185
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,200
Next week,

186
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,880
I have a very important friend.

187
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,680
Her birthday.

188
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,800
She likes your signature milk tea.

189
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,680
I just want to learn this milk tea.

190
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,720
Like this.

191
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,840
I won't charge you for the part-time job.

192
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,000
That's not part-time work.

193
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,360
I swear.

194
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,880
I will never reveal the formula.

195
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,840
What kind of friend?

196
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,800
A very important girl.

197
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,720
Boss.

198
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,360
I'll take it as a yes.

199
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,640
First of all,

200
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,320
we fry the sugar and tea

201
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,960
together.

202
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,720
Just fry it until it turns yellow and bubbles.

203
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,240
Soon.

204
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,760
See?

205
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
The sugar has turned yellow.

206
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,360
At this time,

207
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,840
we'll add 200 ml of boiling water

208
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,160
and turn it on small fire.

209
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,640
Three minutes.

210
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,760
You must boil water, right?

211
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,720
Yes, that's right.

212
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,640
Try it yourself.

213
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,480
Mix it evenly in one direction.

214
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,920
Slowly.

215
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,880
Hello?

216
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,440
Happy birthday.

217
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,440
Am I the first one to send wishes?

218
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,000
Why are you still up so late?

219
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm afraid

220
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,160
someone would wait for my blessing to fall asleep.

221
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,280
So narcissistic.

222
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,960
Who's waiting for your blessing?

223
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,840
Wait for me after school tomorrow.

224
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,560
Surprise.

225
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,160
Surprise or surprise?

226
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,400
Of course it's a surprise.

227
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,720
You...

228
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,000
What's wrong?

229
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,040
Natmmy.

230
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm hanging up.

231
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,520
See you tomorrow.

232
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,840
Mom, what's wrong?

233
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,960
Nothing.

234
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,440
My chest hurts.

235
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,400
I just need to lie down for a while.

236
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,200
Okay.

237
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,760
I'll get my dad to take you to the hospital.

238
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,480
No.

239
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,520
Your dad is very busy recently.

240
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Don't disturb him.

241
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,600
I just didn't sleep well.

242
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,640
Don't worry too much.

243
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,640
I'll call the ambulance.

244
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,320
I'll take you to the hospital.

245
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,160
Son.

246
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,240
I'm really fine.

247
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,560
I'm much better.

248
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,240
Don't you know

249
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,440
Don't you know?

250
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,160
It's late. Don't bother.

251
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,640
You have class tomorrow.

252
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,720
Go.

253
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,360
Go to sleep.

254
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,400
I'll get you some water.

255
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,320
Okay?

256
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,320
Okay, go ahead.

257
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,720
Did something happen?

258
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,000
Ms. Jang.

259
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,240
Why didn't you come for a morning run?

260
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,040
You didn't reply to my messages last night.

261
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,160
I have dark circles under my eyes.

262
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,120
I'm sorry.

263
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,079
What's wrong?

264
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,760
Nothing.

265
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,800
I fell asleep because I was too sleepy yesterday.

266
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,680
As compensation, I'll bite you.

267
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,760
Jin Feng.

268
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,480
Good morning.

269
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,600
Ruo tears.

270
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm fine.

271
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,440
Jin Feng.

272
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,600
It's tacky. That's right.

273
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,160
Monitor

274
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,040
Are you sick?

275
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,480
Why didn't you come for a morning run today?

276
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,800
Nothing.

277
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,760
My nose is itchy.

278
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,640
By the way,

279
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,080
[Happy birthday, Rammy.]

280
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,240
Happy birthday.

281
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,400
Thank you.

282
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,120
Those who haven't entered the teaching building please go in

283
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,960
Grade 12 is coming

284
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,600
Self-awareness, hurry up.

285
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,400
Don't let the teacher follow us every day.

286
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,440
Let's go inside.

287
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,360
If he catches you, you're going to read sutras again.

288
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,000
Hurry up.

289
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,880
In this class,

290
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,600
the guidance of all probability formula.

291
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,840
Here's the topic.

292
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,000
There is a red ball and a blue ball in a bag.

293
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,920
Every time you touch a ball randomly,

294
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,880
When you touch the ball,

295
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,600
I won't put it back in the bag.

296
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Let's calculate

297
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,240
What's the probability of touching the red ball for the first time?

298
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you know?

299
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,960
A plus a.

300
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,600
Yes.

301
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,040
A plus a.

302
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,520
The red ball is touching.

303
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,200
I won't put it back

304
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,720
What's the probability of touching the red ball for the second time?

305
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,560
Today's lesson

306
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,680
That's all for today.

307
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,400
Class dismissed.

308
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,240
Stand up.

309
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,280
Thank you.

310
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,120
May, can you come to the study room?

311
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,480
I have something for you.

312
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
Fan Yuan, go to my office later.

313
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,440
OK.

314
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,520
Chief Guardian.

315
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,280
This is my new novel.

316
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,760
It's your birthday present.

317
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,840
Happy birthday.

318
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,920
Thank you, Grandmaster.

319
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,880
You're welcome.

320
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,000
Be careful.

321
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,560
Just don’t be found by Mr. Dai.

322
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,440
Where’s the gift?

323
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,600
What gift?

324
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,080
Okay.

325
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,560
Wait for me in the classroom for ten minutes.

326
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,480
I'll be right back.

327
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
What's going on?

328
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,520
So mysterious.

329
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,280
May, can you come to the study room?

330
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
I have something for you.

331
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,480
Okay.

332
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,760
Do you see a glass can in my drawer?

333
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,400
No.

334
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,560
Impossible.

335
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,400
Have you seen a glass can?

336
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,040
About this big.

337
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,760
There are colorful candy inside.

338
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,160
Have you seen it?

339
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,840
No.

340
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,440
Monitor.

341
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,680
Did you lose something?

342
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,960
Do you want me to help you find it?

343
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,320
I'm sorry.

344
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,120
Thank you.

345
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,200
Monitor, where have you been?

346
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,320
Why didn't you come to the evening study?

347
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,880
Where have you been?

348
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,680
I told you to wait for me in the classroom.

349
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,480
I'm in the study room.

350
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,600
Wait for me.

351
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,520
I'll be right there.

352
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,720
Monitor, I'm sorry.

353
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,480
I have to go.

354
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,720
If it's a birthday present...

355
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,120
Monitor I'm sorry

356
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,880
I have to go.

357
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,560
Here.

358
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,320
You promised to surprise me.

359
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,400
just to watch a movie.

360
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,120
It's so boring.

361
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,200
You're sentenced to death

362
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,320
before you read it.

363
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,800
You're too anxious.

364
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,040
What?

365
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,920
Not interested?

366
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,120
Forget it.

367
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,000
Hey.

368
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,480
I didn't say I wouldn't watch it.

369
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,200
Come on.

370
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,760
Let's watch a movie.

371
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,760
There's no popcorn.

372
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,080
You want popcorn?

373
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,720
Give me your bag.

374
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,520
I want popcorn too.

375
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,120
What movie?

376
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,760
So ugly.

377
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,440
It's not ugly.

378
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,040
This one is not bad.

379
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,800
This one is ugly.

380
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,760
Okay, I admit.

381
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,960
Maybe I really need to improve

382
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,800
photography level.

383
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,920
When did you do it?

384
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,720
I've been doing it for a long time.

385
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,280
But

386
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,280
the previous photos

387
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,560
I don't have enough songs.

388
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,600
I just finished it recently.

389
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,680
What do you think of this idea?

390
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,280
How many points

391
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,600
on this birthday surprise?

392
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,960
Well...

393
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,080
Well...

394
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,680
I guess you passed.

395
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,720
Pass.

396
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:15,960
This...

397
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,360
At least 90 points.

398
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,720
You took so many ugly photos of me,

399
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,360
and you made every picture into a pig.

400
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,760
You want 90 points?

401
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,120
I'm kind enough to let you pass.

402
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,560
Why aren't you saying anything?

403
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,040
Are you angry?

404
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,840
How about this?

405
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,920
I'll give you 20 more points.

406
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,280
80 points will do, right?

407
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,520
Zhang Ruoxi.

408
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,880
Are you really angry?

409
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,800
I...

410
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,040
I'm just kidding.

411
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,520
You're so young.

412
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,920
I'll have a bucket of popcorn.

413
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,960
and a movie you like.

414
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,360
And this baby.

415
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Can you give me 20 points?

416
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,880
Baby?

417
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,360
I knew you lied to me.

418
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,120
Does it hurt that much?

419
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,880
Stop pretending.

420
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Please forgive me.

421
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,080
You know what?

422
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,160
There's no second one.

423
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,280
Unique

424
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
What treasure?

425
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,880
Show me.

426
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,120
Show me.

427
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,560
Alright.

428
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,280
To tell you the truth,

429
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,160
I made this myself.

430
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,160
I told you there's no second cup.

431
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,040
You made it yourself?

432
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,480
Try it.

433
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,720
Can it taste good

434
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,880
PORN CORN

435
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,520
Don't drink.

436
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,600
I'll drink.

437
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,760
How is it?

438
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
It tastes like...

439
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,680
How do you know how to cook?

440
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,800
Of course it's because I'm good at everything.

441
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,520
Aren't you afraid

442
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,560
you won't be able to drink it.

443
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,480
Thank you.

444
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,080
What do you think?

445
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,200
Can I get full marks this time?

446
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,320
Lin Jinfeng, you're good at hiding.

447
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,400
You didn't answer my calls or reply my home.

448
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,240
How did you get in?

449
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,040
How can a wall like yours stop me?

450
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,640
Did you write a report letter to our school

451
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,680
and beat me up?

452
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

453
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,360
I didn't write any letter.

454
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,720
Hide.

455
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,640
Hide!

456
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,480
Lin Jinlong, give it back to me.

457
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,840
So many fancy things.

458
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,600
So precious.

459
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,760
Who do you want to catch?

460
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,640
Give it back.

461
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,840
Here.

462
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,880
Give it back to me, Lin Jinlong.

463
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,200
Take this as compensation.

464
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,560
Stop playing tricks.

465
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,480
Otherwise, it's not just your real name.

466
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,160
You don't want your classmates

467
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,720
to let your classmates know, right?

468
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,480
It's you.

469
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,360
Ruotear, are you okay?

470
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,560
Who is he?

471
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,880
Should I tell the teacher?

472
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,400
Go away. I don't need your help.

473
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,680
What are you doing?

474
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,880
A dog bites Lü Dongbin.

475
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,120
You don't know what a good person is.

476
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,480
Such a bad temper.

477
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,760
He pretends to be gentle.

478
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,240
but he's got hooligans.

479
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,960
You don't know a person's face. You don't know his heart.

480
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,440
Ma'am.

481
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,320
Please check the consumption record of this card.

482
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,120
It often shows insufficient balance.

483
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
Okay, I'll check it for you.

484
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,160
Wait here.

485
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,960
Okay.

486
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,160
Thank you.

487
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,320
Five bucks were deducted last weekend.

488
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,520
Last weekend?

489
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,719
I went home last weekend.

490
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,560
No, someone used my card.

491
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:14,840
Yes.

492
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,560
You said you watched that movie many times.

493
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,560
Why are you crying?

494
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,280
Can't I cry after seeing it many times?

495
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,639
Is that really tragic?

496
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,040
Lu Xiaoyu was so miserable.

497
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,000
Luckily, Ye Xianglun came back.

498
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,520
Otherwise,

499
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,040
I don't want to listen to Jay Chou's song anymore.

500
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,239
Why are you laughing?

501
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,239
I'm laughing at you for being cute.

502
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,560
No, you're laughing at me for being childish.

503
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,320
Little turtle,

504
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,600
Can't you trust me?

505
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,960
Or do you think you're not cute at all?

506
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,840
I envy Jay Chou.

507
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,280
You can be a director

508
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,680
You can sing and be a screenwriter.

509
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,920
If only one day,

510
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,080
I can also put my story on the screen.

511
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,560
It's not impossible.

512
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,240
You can be a screenwriter.

513
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,320
Writer?

514
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,080
Don't you like writing stories?

515
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,840
Why don't you learn opera?

516
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,640
Then we can go to the same university.

517
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,400
We don't have to be apart anymore.

518
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,400
It's not enough to go to the same city and go to the same university.

519
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,800
Don't push your luck.

520
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,560
I'm serious.

521
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,840
Let's go to the film academy.

522
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,560
I learn acting and you learn creation.

523
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,040
We can work together in the future

524
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,760
and become the sculpture Hero in the industry.

525
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,920
That's too far-fetched.

526
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,960
I don't know anything yet.

527
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,080
What do you want to know?

528
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,960
Drama major or Film Academy, I have information for you.

529
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,280
I'll take that as a yes.

530
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,000
Hold this for me.

531
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,280
What are you doing?

532
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
What are you writing?

533
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,800
I won't show you.

534
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,640
What?

535
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,240
The Wall of Wish has accepted our wishes.

536
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,600
You have no chance to regret.

537
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,840
I didn't say I would.

538
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,440
I heard it.

539
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,640
I’ll prepare the materials for you tonight.

540
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,800
Hello, Mr. Dai.

541
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,960
Hello, Mr. Dai.

542
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,840
Don’t play ball.

543
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,520
Hello, Mr. Dai.

544
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,560
Hello.

545
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,400
What?

546
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,680
I found it for you.

547
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,160
You collected so much all night.

548
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,120
Did you stay up all night?

549
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,440
No. I saved them before.

550
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,680
Take a good look.

551
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,040
You can ask me anytime if you have any questions.

552
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,840
I'll solve your confusion 24 hours a day.

553
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,320
Why are you in such a hurry?

554
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,600
I'll try it at home.

555
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,800
Wait.

556
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,280
Get in.

557
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,680
Get in.

558
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,680
Slow down. What's the rush?

559
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,840
Of course.

560
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,360
This concerns our marriage.

561
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,800
What marriage?

562
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,000
Nonsense.

563
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,160
Really?

564
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,560
Xiao Junyi.

565
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,400
What's wrong?

566
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,080
What happened?

567
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,400
Just say it. Don't talk nonsense.

568
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,080
Don't be angry, Miss Natmmy.

569
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,640
They said the rogue last time

570
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,000
was in cahoots with Lin Ruotear.

571
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,600
She said she often stole things.

572
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,760
Rammy.

573
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,680
I heard from monitor Rong that

574
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,360
Namida kept using her meal card.

575
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,480
Is this real?

576
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,600
I'm not wrong this time.

577
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,200
I've printed out the consumer list of my meal card.

578
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
Xiao Yu and I went home this weekend.

579
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,000
She's the only one in the dorm.

580
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,080
And Xiao Yu's skin care products were also secretly used.

581
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,240
It must be her.

582
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,680
Your skin care products are also used.

583
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,400
Natmmy.

584
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,720
You're back.

585
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,160
You are...

586
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,960
Didn't I run out of cream?

587
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,600
Xiao Yu said this brand is very useful.

588
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,920
I'm going to buy the same one.

589
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,400
I'll follow him out.

590
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,200
Let's go.

591
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,480
What happened?

592
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,520
What happened?

593
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,080
It's hard to explain.

594
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,440
Anyway, something happened to Lin Ruotear.

595
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,840
I heard she was blackmailed by some thugs outside.

596
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,840
Really?

597
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,440
I heard that

598
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,640
she and that thug are a couple.

599
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,800
She often stole things for that thug

600
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,200
All her roommates were stolen

601
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,720
But it was a mess yesterday

602
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,600
Then she must have stolen

603
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,280
was stolen by Fan Yuan.

604
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,680
Are you done?

605
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,080
Why are you so anxious if you haven't done it?

606
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,400
What's wrong?

607
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,240
Fan Yuan, didn't you lose something yesterday?

608
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm sure she took it.

609
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,360
Did you take my stuff too?

610
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,360
Ruo tears.

611
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,000
I didn't.

612
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,680
How dare you slander me?

613
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,280
Who saw me stealing?

614
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,640
I saw it.

615
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,120
When you went to the office with Mr. Wang yesterday,

616
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,240
I saw her put a glass can in her bag.

617
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,040
I don't know whose it is.

618
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
I didn't. You were mistaken.

619
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,760
Namida.

620
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,720
I didn't expect you to be like this.

621
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,800
I hit Han in the swimming pool.

622
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,720
You fell into the pool on purpose.

623
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,000
Why are you so dirty?

624
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,840
I knew it.

625
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,800
It must be her.

626
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,560
Be careful.

627
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,640
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

628
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,480
Yes, she came to class during the day. Don't worry.

629
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,120
No.

630
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,880
She left in a hurry after school.

631
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,080
I called her and heard her screaming.

632
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,680
I was worried she might get scolded.

633
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,160
Am I not good enough to you?

634
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,520
What's there to complain about?

635
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,880
How dare you talk back?
