1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,920
Then we broke up.

3
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,640
You gave me your favorite hairpin as a gift.

4
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,840
You said you'd come back to play with me after the trip.

5
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,400
Brother, what's your name?

6
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,600
Lu Xiang.

7
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
I'll keep that in mind.

8
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,920
I'll visit you next time.

9
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,360
Don't forget me.

10
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,520
Do you remember something?

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,160
I think I went to Guilin that time.

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,440
But his name is Lu Xiang.

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
I never gave him a hairpin.

14
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,640
Monitor

15
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,760
Is this the hairpin

16
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,120
Is this it?

17
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,520
Stop joking.

18
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,320
Although your story is good,

19
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,560
but I grew up with idol dramas.

20
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,320
Forget it.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,840
When I go home and get the album,

22
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,360
you'll know if I lied to you.

23
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,840
Fine.

24
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,079
I'll wait for your evidence.

25
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,760
There are 12 books in total.

26
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,160
How many books do each of you need?

27
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,160
Ruoxi.

28
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,520
Where are you going?

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,480
Ms Qiao asked us to move new textbooks.

30
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,840
Let's go together.

31
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,320
Why are you moving books?

32
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,200
Do you have strength?

33
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,160
Why do you have it if I don't have the strength?

34
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
What else?

35
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,280
Really. Let's go.

36
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,520
I didn't expect you to be a strong man.

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,160
You ran so hard this morning.

38
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,440
I thought you couldn't pick up your shoulders.

39
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm hypoglycemia, not weak.

40
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Besides, I'm not like someone.

41
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,440
I can only lift two bundles when I look tall.

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,520
Who said you can give me yours?

43
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,200
I can give it to myself.

44
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,440
I don't want someone to say I didn't do anything.

45
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,120
Give it to me.

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,760
No.

47
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,480
Hey.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,000
No.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,320
Hey.

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,200
No.

51
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,960
Hey.

52
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,640
Ruoxi, stop it.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,280
Everyone is waiting for the new textbook.

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,120
Go back to the classroom.

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,160
Let's go.

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,520
Let's go, Xiammy.

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,120
Can you do it?

58
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Okay, that's all for today.

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,920
Later, put the math homework

60
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,840
on the stage.

61
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,360
The monitor will send me to my office later.

62
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,440
Class dismissed. Stand up.

63
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,959
Thank you.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,520
Dali, you first.

65
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,240
Fan Yuan.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
Let me help you.

67
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,760
Thank you, Han.

68
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,800
It’s OK.

69
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Put it here. Okay.

70
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,880
Let me do it.

71
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,720
Xiammy.

72
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,600
Are you sure you handed in your math homework?

73
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,240
I didn't see the homework when the teacher reviewed it.

74
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,240
No way. I did submit it just now.

75
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,800
Check the drawer or bag.

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,680
It can't be here. I just handed it in.

77
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,600
I'll hand it in first.

78
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,920
Did I hand in my homework book?

79
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,920
Someone must have done it on purpose.

80
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,720
Rammy.

81
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,760
I heard about it.

82
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you think someone is messing with you

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,760
and hid your notebook?

84
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,920
Forget it.

85
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,880
Don't talk nonsense until there's no evidence.

86
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,960
I think...

87
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,120
I'm leaving.

88
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,040
Class begins.

89
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,680
By the way,

90
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,760
I'll take a few minutes before the self-study class.

91
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,640
Write down the movie you like and give it to me.

92
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,320
In the movie class,

93
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,200
in the movie class.

94
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,080
And movie class.

95
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,240
Just hand it over here.

96
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,960
Why do you want to plagiarize?

97
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,400
I'm done.

98
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,040
So weird.

99
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
No ghost.

100
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,800
Okay, thank you for your cooperation.

101
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Be quiet and study.

102
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,200
Monitor.

103
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,640
I'm speechless. Can you stop?

104
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,040
How about we play basketball after class?

105
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,760
Why don't you switch seats?

106
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,920
I don't want to change with him.

107
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,800
I was wondering why it hurts so much.

108
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,720
Who is it?

109
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,440
Can't you guys meet after school?

110
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,559
It's not like we can't meet. It's so annoying.

111
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,280
Why are you so angry?

112
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,200
Are you jealous that we can go out after school?

113
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,840
Jealous? Are you kidding me?

114
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,000
Go out and have fun.

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,520
Just cry if the exam is too bad.

116
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,040
You're just jealous of me.

117
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,680
What's wrong?

118
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
I won't be worse than you no matter what.

119
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,440
If you're worse than me, learn your Mandarin first.

120
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,360
What's wrong with my Mandarin?

121
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,720
Your Mandarin sucks.

122
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Stop arguing.

123
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,280
Give the monitor some face

124
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
Mind your discipline.

125
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,320
Don't send any more messages.

126
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,920
It's time for the teacher to write a self-criticism.

127
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,240
Tears

128
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
What does this mean

129
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,520
It means what to eat today.

130
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,640
Thank you for helping me.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,520
Just tell me what you want to eat.

132
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,640
It's okay. Don't mention it. Thank you for helping her.

133
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,440
Are you teasing me?

134
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,640
Okay, I'm leaving.

135
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,440
Go.

136
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,000
I...

137
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,200
How about dinner together?

138
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,440
Sorry.

139
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,240
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,520
Let's go.

141
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,920
Miss Xiammy,

142
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,920
You're visiting too early.

143
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,800
It was an accident.

144
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,360
You'd better forget it quickly, otherwise...

145
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,480
What happened?

146
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
I didn't see anything.

147
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,000
You're smart.

148
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,480
Hey.

149
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,960
What's up?

150
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,600
Did you hide my homework

151
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,400
Did you hide my homework book?

152
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,720
Of course not. Am I that boring?

153
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,240
So natural.

154
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,280
Did I misunderstand?

155
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,400
It's okay then.

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,760
Bye.

157
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,240
Do you want to have dinner together?

158
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,680
Sure, we can.

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,200
Don’t go with him.

160
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,880
Or we'll lose points again.

161
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,800
You're three feet away from me. I'll be unlucky to see you.

162
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,120
Let's go.

163
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,640
Do I look like a mold?

164
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,360
Not bad.

165
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,240
Excuse me.

166
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,600
We're in a hurry.

167
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,080
Boss, give me one.

168
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,680
A pancake fruit with steak

169
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,600
And chicken willows and fried dough sticks

170
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,560
And one with bacon hot dog floss and spicy strips

171
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,280
Thank you.

172
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,480
Excuse me.

173
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,840
This is mine, right?

174
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,240
Add two more rice rolls for me.

175
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,600
One wants green onions, not vegetables.

176
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,520
One is vegetable no green onion

177
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,600
Put more meat for me

178
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,560
Put more eggs for me

179
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,640
Boss, one more steamed dumplings and steamed dumplings

180
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,080
Okay.

181
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,560
I'll put the money on the table.

182
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,480
Okay, I've ordered. You order.

183
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,720
Boss.

184
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,280
Excuse me.

185
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,480
OK.

186
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,120
Boss, are the two ribs ready?

187
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,960
Is he done?

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,960
We're going to be late.

189
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,120
Give it to me.

190
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,600
Do you want people behind us to buy it?

191
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,000
Are we in a hurry too?

192
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,760
Right?

193
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,120
Thank you, bro.

194
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,920
Boss, are you ready?

195
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,480
Zhang.

196
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,400
Zhang.

197
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
It’s me.

198
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,840
Why do you help me?

199
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,040
You ride fast and send me to the classroom.

200
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,360
It'll be too late for morning jogging.

201
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,120
Thank you, Zhang Tong.

202
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,160
No, Xi.

203
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,680
You're my brother from now on.

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,080
Let's go.

205
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,000
Let's go, Xi. Let's go.

206
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,400
You two.

207
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,320
What's going on?

208
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,360
You're one minute late.

209
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,000
Just one minute.

210
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,560
I thought it was ten minutes.

211
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,160
It's an honor to be one minute late, right?

212
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,520
Do you want me to give you an award?

213
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,080
Friend,

214
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,040
Can you be more sensible?

215
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,320
This is called taking turns.

216
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,360
I was caught by Dinosaur.

217
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,880
You deserve it.

218
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,320
Dinosaur.

219
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,840
That nickname?

220
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,960
Haven’t you heard of it?

221
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,040
Mr. Dai, dinosaur.

222
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,560
Isn’t it image?

223
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,160
And all of you are lazy.

224
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
I've been teaching in Yi Zhong High School for so many years.

225
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,280
You're the worst students I've ever taught.

226
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,080
All of you.

227
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,600
One more lap.

228
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
What's your name?

229
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,960
You two come back.

230
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,640
We agreed to take turns.

231
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,040
It's not my fault.

232
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,160
It's all his fault.

233
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,960
Why did he have to run away today?

234
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,000
Ruo tears.

235
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,600
Are you okay?

236
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,280
Let me help you.

237
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,840
What are you two doing over there?

238
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,320
The others can keep up, but you two can't.

239
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,080
Right?

240
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,960
Run!

241
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,200
It's okay, Natmmy.

242
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,000
You go first.

243
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,480
Shut up. I'll push you faster.

244
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Thank you, Class Rep.

245
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
I'm exhausted.

246
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,400
How are you?

247
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Don't worry. He's still alive.

248
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,000
Just now.

249
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,720
Thank you.

250
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,760
What?

251
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,360
Thank you.

252
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,600
You're welcome.

253
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,520
It's not necessarily a bad thing to stick to me, right?

254
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,560
You're really brilliant just because you give me some sunshine.

255
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,760
We wouldn't have been punished if you weren't late.

256
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,440
After all, it's your fault.

257
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,160
Ruotear, let's go.

258
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,440
I'll be unlucky if I stay with him for too long.

259
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,120
Come on.

260
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,600
Did you pay?

261
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,320
Wow Xiao, so much breakfast.

262
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,240
How did you bring this breakfast in?

263
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,600
I want a spicy hot pot and fried rice.

264
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,320
Spicy hot pot is three yuan for fried rice.

265
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,560
One yuan for running errands.

266
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,160
Eight yuan in total.

267
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,760
Thank you.

268
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,440
Why didn't you tell me you were going to pay for your errand yesterday?

269
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,240
Each?

270
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,920
Yeah.

271
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,680
Do you want it or not?

272
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,599
The breakfast in the canteen isn't as good as this.

273
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,720
Okay.

274
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,640
Give me money

275
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,359
Give me the money.

276
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,800
This is yours, right?

277
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,839
Take it and give it to me.

278
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,040
I've given you all the good money.

279
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
This spicy hot pot is not hot anymore.

280
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,119
No.

281
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,240
I only want one fried rice, four yuan, right?

282
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,520
I don't want you to bring breakfast anymore. Are you full?

283
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,319
I'm full.

284
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,319
Spicy hot pot

285
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,600
Spicy hot pot is 5 yuan per portion.

286
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,760
I can't afford to be cheated.

287
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,960
It's not that hot. Do you want it?

288
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,880
I want it.

289
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,200
Give me money. Five yuan.

290
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Five yuan.

291
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,120
It's only four yuan for spicy hotpot at the school gate.

292
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Do you have a conscience?

293
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,880
You're cheating your classmates.

294
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,760
Why are you everywhere, Wang Xiao Yu?

295
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,560
It takes time and effort to bring breakfast in.

296
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,120
It's only right to ask for a reward.

297
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,320
If you think it's a trap, I can eat it myself.

298
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,160
I want it.

299
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,560
I'll get you the money.

300
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,320
Here.

301
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,200
I'll bring you something warm tomorrow.

302
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,480
Monitor Xiao Junyi brought breakfast without paying.

303
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,480
Is it against the rules?

304
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,280
Hey, no way.

305
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,560
Which class rule forbids you to bring breakfast for your classmates?

306
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,520
Am I right, monitor?

307
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,400
It’s true that we can’t.

308
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,360
But Xiao,

309
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,360
selling breakfast and bringing breakfast are different.

310
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,960
I remember the school rules

311
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,520
that students are not allowed to trade goods.

312
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,400
You should return the extra money to everyone.

313
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,160
And Natmmy.

314
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,360
It's all my hard work. I won't pay it back.

315
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,320
Okay, I'll pay you back.

316
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,480
I did.

317
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,920
I'll give you yours after class.

318
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,320
19405.

319
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,520
You deserve it.

320
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,520
Hey.

321
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,840
Natmmy.

322
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,160
Let's eat later.

323
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,520
The teacher will come to check later.

324
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,160
OK.

325
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,320
All right, get ready for self-study.

326
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,800
A wife at three.

327
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,440
I've been working hard.

328
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,360
I've been working hard.

329
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,800
and will have a bright future.

330
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,360
Since that's the case,

331
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,000
As for the tyranny,

332
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,920
I don't know.

333
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
Why are you here?

334
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,000
I came here to tell you

335
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,560
you can hide this from the front but not the back.

336
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,600
You'll be in trouble if the teacher comes from behind.

337
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,440
Independent winter

338
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,600
Go to Xiangjiang North. Go.

339
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Mr. Dai is here.

340
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,320
Tangerine Zhou.

341
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,720
Look at mountains and mountains

342
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,240
The forest is dyed

343
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
The river is clear.

344
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,120
Baili's dispute.

345
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,160
Eagle hits the sky.

346
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,640
The fish flows down

347
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,040
All kinds of frost compete for freedom.

348
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,280
I don't know. I'm laughing.

349
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,560
Monitor

350
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,960
You're my lifeline.

351
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,360
I'm doomed without you.

352
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,760
Rammy.

353
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,880
Give me the spicy hot pot.

354
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,640
No food is allowed during the morning reading.

355
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
It's everyone's duty to abide by the rules.

356
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,960
Don't imitate me.

357
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,000
That's right.

358
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Wipe the oil on the corner of your mouth.

359
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,440
Go to the morning reading, Ruoxi.

360
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,000
Go back to your seat.

361
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,360
Don't change your seat during the morning reading.

362
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,480
Hurry up.

363
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,440
Sorry.

364
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,000
Rammy.

365
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,080
I was too fierce to you.

367
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,040
I'll buy you another bowl of spicy hot pot.

368
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,400
It's okay.

369
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,360
It's my fault.

370
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,840
It's your duty as the monitor.

371
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,240
No, I just went there.

372
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,200
Are you angry?

373
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,320
I'm not.

374
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,760
You didn't do it on purpose.

375
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,760
Unlike someone.

376
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,400
Let's go play basketball.

377
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,600
Let's go play basketball.

378
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,600
Go play basketball.

379
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,800
No, I can't always suffer.

380
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,160
I have to find a way to let him experience the danger of the world.

381
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,400
Rammy.

382
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,200
Are you really not angry?

383
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Ruoxi.

384
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,200
Why did you suddenly buy me Coke?

385
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,480
I thought about it again and again today.

386
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,560
Luckily you came to remind me this morning.

387
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,400
Otherwise, Mr. Dai will catch me and write a self-criticism letter.

388
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,280
So this is a thank you gift.

389
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,000
I thought you would blame me.

390
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,240
Thank you.

391
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,920
You're welcome.

392
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,440
You...

393
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,800
You're not drinking now?

394
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,240
Do I have to drink it now

395
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,800
No.

396
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,160
You don't even want to drink.

397
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,320
Are you still blaming me for my bad attitude this morning?

398
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,680
Miss Xiammy,

399
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,560
Did you add something in it?

400
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,240
How can you think of me like that?

401
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,280
Give it to me if you don't want it.

402
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,800
You still want to return what you gave me?

403
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,200
No.

404
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,680
Drink it now.

405
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
Amy.

406
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,920
I just finished playing. The player is a bit dirty.

407
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,800
Can you open it for me? Thank you.

408
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,680
Of course.

409
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,800
My hands are sweating. It's slippery.

410
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,160
Yes, my hands are sweating after the game.

411
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,200
Okay.

412
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,800
It's normal that girls can't open the bottle cap.

413
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,320
It's okay. I'll ask someone to open it.

414
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,560
I'll help you.

415
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,600
It's mainly because their family has a winning event.

416
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,480
If I win, I...

417
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,960
I...

418
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
You were just pretending.

419
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,200
Didn't you just pretend?

420
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,320
You're so good at acting. Why are you going to school?

421
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,920
Just join Oska.

422
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,080
I'll consider your suggestion.

423
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,720
Before you go to Oska,

424
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,440
before you go to Oska?

425
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,400
the victim?

426
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,680
I'm sorry.

427
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,480
Here, wipe it.

428
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,880
Good. From now on,

429
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,440
your name is officially on my notebook.

430
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,680
Oh no.

431
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,800
I overdid it.

432
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
High school math is too hard.

433
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,360
It knows me. I don't know it.

434
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,280
You're right.

435
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,200
But I can't hold it anymore. I need to go to the toilet.

436
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,600
I'll tell you when I'm back.

437
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,040
Let's go.

438
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,200
What's wrong, Xiammy?

439
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,240
I met a problem in math.

440
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,600
Math is too difficult.

441
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,200
I feel dizzy when I see the topic.

442
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,000
Even a roller coaster doesn't work.

443
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,040
Look at this question.

444
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Why do I remember the teacher said this question before?

445
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,640
Are you absent-minded in class again?

446
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,280
Don't rush when you do the exercises. We have to review the questions first.

447
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,400
You have to think clearly.

448
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,200
Isn't there a prerequisite?

449
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,960
When 2 is a or a,

450
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,600
One plus one x minus one is also a

451
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,440
We just need to bring this 2 into X

452
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,720
we can ask for one.

453
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
Right? Wait.

454
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,720
You even remember the subject the teacher taught in class.

455
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,200
Why don't I remember anything?

456
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,080
Aren't you serious?

457
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,600
Are you a goldfish?

458
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,800
Memory only lasts seven seconds.

459
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,200
What about you?

460
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,840
Are you a parrot? You talk too much.

461
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,960
Ignore him, monitor. Let's continue.

462
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,520
OK

463
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,800
Then we bring the one

464
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,680
into the second number.

465
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,600
you will know

466
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,040
1/2 right?

467
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,520
A assembly is all the numbers we just got.

468
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,640
I didn't expect that not only your story is good,

469
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,200
but also good at teaching questions.

470
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,920
Please accept my knees

471
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,320
Wow monitor

472
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,440
I didn't expect that not only your story is good

473
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,000
but also a good question.

474
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,440
Please accept my knees.

475
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,520
Do I look like one?

476
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,080
Ruoxi Zhang.

477
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,440
I'll pull out the fur of a parrot today.

478
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,400
Stop!

479
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,240
What are you doing?

480
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,840
Don't pretend. It's fine to hit you on the head.

481
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,440
Ruoxi, you're done for.

482
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,040
Okay.

483
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
It's done.

484
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,840
Come here.

485
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,040
Stop, stop, stop. We need to go to class.

486
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,000
Stop, Xia Mi, Xia Mi, calm down.

487
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,280
Calm down.

488
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,000
Lunch break is over.

489
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,360
Please go back to your classroom and get ready for class.

490
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,680
Who threw trash at someone else's desk?

491
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,760
It must be their doing.

492
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,360
Who ate on her desk?

493
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,240
Do you have any moral conscience?

494
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,160
You don't even take the garbage.

495
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,360
What are you doing?

496
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,640
Can anyone tell me what happened?

497
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,160
Monitor doesn't know

498
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,720
which student ate on her desk at noon.

499
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,080
and left a table of garbage.

500
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,600
Leave them alone.

501
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,480
our classroom will become a pile of garbage.

502
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,880
Wang Xiao Yu needs evidence to speak.

503
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,520
Which eye did you see that we did it?

504
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,160
You did it?

505
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
No.

506
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,200
All our boarders went back to the dorm at noon.

507
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,680
Only you left.

508
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,040
Who else could it be?

509
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,040
Why did you say it was us?

510
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,800
Why did you say it was us?

511
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,200
You boarders are bullying us.

512
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,960
I'm not convinced if I don't make it clear.

513
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,520
Why can't I answer it?

514
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,440
That's right.

515
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,800
It's your fault for running away this morning.

516
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,960
You left without paying attention to hygiene.

517
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,200
You messed up the classroom at noon.

518
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,280
You are free and free.

519
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
You lodgers sleep so late.

520
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,400
The class is slower than us.

521
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,080
You accommodates love hugging.

522
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,000
They don't fit in.

523
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,760
What are you doing?

524
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,080
Let's distribute the trash.

525
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,920
You said you didn't do it.

526
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,400
I can't bear the pain alone.

527
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,320
Half for each.

528
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,120
It's fair.

529
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,720
Childish.

530
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,080
You should be the judge.

531
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,280
They're bullying us.

532
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,280
Good job.

533
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,280
What does that mean?

534
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,440
Who are you helping?

535
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,040
Which sect are you from?

536
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,200
Are you a man?

537
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,000
If you're bullied, go back by yourself.

538
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,840
Do you understand?

539
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,120
Alright.

540
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,480
Calm down, everyone. I'll find out the truth.

541
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,440
Class is coming.

542
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,360
Go back to your seat.

543
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,520
Don't worry, Rammy.

544
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,640
I'll ask him to apologize to you when I find him.

545
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,040
It's okay. I didn't take it to heart.

546
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,880
It's okay.

547
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,320
Is it him or not?

548
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,680
The health evaluation in our class has been lagging behind recently.

549
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,600
I hope you can take every cleaning seriously.

550
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,920
So to be fair,

551
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,360
I made a note of your cleaning project.

552
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,000
Now come up one by one to draw your own cleaning project.

553
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,280
This is good.

554
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,760
I'll go first.

555
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,440
Anyone else hasn't got it?

556
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,760
Wow.

557
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,920
The bonus is so high.

558
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,000
Number 30, it's not too late to prepare.

559
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,120
What do you mean?

560
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,560
It's none of your business.

561
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,760
Why are you so mysterious?

562
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,400
How are you going to make fun of me this time?

563
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,680
Don't you think you've misunderstood me too much?

564
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,400
I came to tell you

565
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,640
I didn't do anything at noon.

566
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,600
I swear.

567
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,760
I have something to tell you.

568
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,160
If vows are useful,

569
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,920
half of the people in the world will be struck by lightning.

570
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,600
I have to teach Xiao Junyi and those students a lesson.

571
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,520
Wake up and play.

572
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,160
Sweep the floor.

573
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,320
You got us punished again.

574
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,000
and the accommodation.

575
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,600
Now you don't even care about cleaning.

576
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,360
Xiao Yu.

577
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,239
Don't tell them they left.

578
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,639
I'm afraid they'll misunderstand us and think we're in a group.

579
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,679
They're the ones who started it.

580
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,480
They dirty her table first.

581
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,239
They still won't admit it.

582
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,719
It's not a guilty conscience.

583
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,600
Right, Rammy?

584
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,719
You're right.

585
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,960
If he's not guilty, why did he come to me?

586
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,960
Who is he?

587
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,360
These girls.

588
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,800
They never change.

589
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:48,600
OK.

590
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,920
Let's do it together.

591
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,159
From today on,

592
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,760
we'll call it

593
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,400
boarding group.

594
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,880
It doesn't sound good.

595
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,920
Amy.

596
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,280
You speak the best language.

597
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,120
Please give us a nice name.

598
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,160
Okay.

599
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,920
Isn't it called "sect" in martial arts novels?

600
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,480
How about

601
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,200
we call it boarding party?

602
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,960
This is good.

603
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,720
Boarding party.

604
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,680
Then I’m the founder

605
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,960
of the boarding sect.

606
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,840
You are my Chief Guardian.

607
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,000
You are my second guardian.

608
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,520
You’d better give up now.

609
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,360
Division class is a serious crime.

610
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,800
How serious is it?

611
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,040
The kind of death?

612
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,840
Yes, Grandmaster.

613
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,120
Okay, Master.

614
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,600
Let's clean up first.

615
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,880
Or we'll be late.

616
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,080
There's no good food in the canteen.

617
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,880
Okay.

618
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,720
It's settled then.

619
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,680
Let's get to work.

620
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,000

I won't swear this time. Let's talk about evidence.

623
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,320
Class is over.

624
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:21,960

625
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,360
Let's go back to the dorm.

626
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,680
I suspect someone wants to discuss how to mess with me.

627
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,640
