1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,479
Net, strength is fair, not fair. It's just that

3
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,000
There's a kind of happiness called waiting. There's a kind of wisdom called low-key.

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,440
There's a kind of people who are destined to fail. If you don't work hard, you'll regret it.

5
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,240
Work hard for everything, calm down, and work hard, Endure.

6
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,320
Wish you good luck.

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,320
I can do it this time.

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
Wisdom

9
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm sure this exam will work.

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,240
Ten minutes left.

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,000
Those who haven't finished, hurry up.

12
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,120
Please, Junyi.

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
Please save me.

14
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,920
No way.

15
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,040
How could it be?

16
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,079
Xiammy.

17
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,480
Don't do anything stupid.

18
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,480
Rammy.

19
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,400
What are you doing?

20
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,240
Stand up!

21
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,120
What's in your hand?

22
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,680
It's a misunderstanding.

23
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,760
This isn't mine.

24
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,720
Give it to me.

25
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,240
Who sent it to you?

26
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,520
The school told me not to cheat.

27
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,800
How dare you!

28
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,720
Sir.

29
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,000
I've never seen this.

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,760
I don't know who sent it.

31
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,040
I'll confiscate the test paper.

32
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
We'll talk in my office later.

33
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,200
The rest of you continue your exam.

34
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,720
Sit down.

35
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,240
Sir.

36
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,320
I've never seen this paper ball.

37
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
If you don't believe me,

38
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,440
you can compare this note

39
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,600
with my test paper.

40
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,560
It must be different.

41
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,360
Xiammy,

42
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,800
I want to believe you too.

43
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,840
I just compared the test paper.

44
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,440
and the blank answer of the choice questions.

45
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,720
are basically right.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,720
You mean I'm right with both the answers and the blank questions?

47
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
No not teacher

48
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
The monitor has been tutoring me recently

49
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,120
So I've improved a lot

50
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,840
How about this?

51
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,920
Lend me the paper and pen.

52
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,760
I'll solve the question in front of you.

53
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,360
You should trust me now.

54
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,680
Hey, hey! Hey!

55
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,120
Come on.

56
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,680
Try this one.

57
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,520
Sir.

58
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,400
Will you trust me

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,280
just trust me.

60
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,240
You do it first.

61
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,480
We'll talk after you finish.

62
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,480
Are you upset?

63
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,920
Why is she so unlucky?

64
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,120
Why did she hit the gun?

65
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,920
I was unlucky.

66
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,440
Did I get it wrong?

67
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,880
No way.

68
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
What a jinx!

69
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,920
She didn't do it.

70
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,320
We saw how hard she worked these days.

71
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,040
Someone must have thrown the wrong one.

72
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,560
and hurt her.

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,640
Right.

74
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,400
Normally, she doesn't need to cheat

75
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,000
she doesn't need to cheat.

76
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,920
Xiao Junyi.

77
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,040
Calm down.

78
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,800
The monitor said that if you encounter problems you haven't done before

79
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,840
Analyze the test first

80
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,840
Sir.

81
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,920
Sir.

82
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,360
She didn't cheat.

83
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,040
I can prove it.

84
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,200
Monitor.

85
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,240
Teacher, look.

86
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,960
If she copied the answer,

87
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,360
she would never write such a complete solution.

88
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,720
Am I right?

89
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,720
I know the situation.

90
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,560
Let her finish this question first.

91
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,680
Sir.

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,159
This question is more difficult than the exam.

93
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
Are you giving her a hard time?

94
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
This question is a bit overruled,

95
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
But she can solve it.

96
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,360
Well,

97
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,360
you can hint her.

98
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,600
But she has to finish this question herself.

99
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,920
This question is still about function images.

100
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,720
Do you remember the steps I taught you?

101
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,840
Yes.

102
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,560
Draw first, then find the coordinates.

103
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,640
and then set functions for solutions.

104
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,880
But there seems to be one condition missing.

105
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,440
Look.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,720
Let's find the symmetrical axis of this picture

107
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,320
and then fill its function image.

108
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,640
Then we can find its hidden condition.

109
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,920
Try it.

110
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,240
Sir.

111
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,440
I'm done.

112
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,720
Fan Yuan.

113
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,240
You're really a good potential.

114
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,600
Not only do you have good grades,

115
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,920
I also tutor my classmates.

116
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,800
No teacher.

117
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,520
In fact, it's her who is proactive.

118
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,000
I didn't do much.

119
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,919
I just played a role to attract the ladder.

120
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,360
Sir.

121
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,559
You should trust me now.

122
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,600
Actually, when you first did the test,

123
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,240
I knew you didn't cheat.

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,920
I have a stereotype of you.

125
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,360
In such a short time,

126
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,560
in such a short time.

127
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,520
Really amazing.

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,920
Keep it up.

129
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,240
Thank you.

130
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,720
I will study hard

131
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,640
and improve every day.

132
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,080
Sir.

133
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,600
They want to apologize to you.

134
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,280
Sir.

135
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,040
Sir.

136
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,760
We were wrong.

137
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,880
We know we were wrong.

138
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,320
Xiammy.

139
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,400
How were you just now?

140
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,680
I was so worried.

141
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:15,840
Do it.

142
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,200
I dare not go in and disturb you.

143
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,160
Don't worry. I'm fine.

144
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,400
Thanks to the monitor,

145
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,640
I passed.

146
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,080
No.

147
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,040
You proved it with your own strength.

148
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,920
Don't thank me.

149
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
Without your tutoring,

150
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,200
I wouldn't have improved so fast.

151
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,600
But when you came in,

152
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,080
when you came in.

153
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,600
Just like the hero of Liangshan.

154
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,800
He shouted when he saw injustice.

155
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
You should do it when it's time.

156
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,960
Have you forgotten someone?

157
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,560
Why didn't you thank me?

158
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,840
I didn't say I wouldn't thank you.

159
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,400
Thank you for catching the criminal at the critical moment.

160
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,520
Please accept my bow.

161
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
I don't think you're being sincere.

162
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,120
How can I be sincere?

163
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,600
You should treat us to...

164
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,360
Let's go back to the classroom.

165
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,360
Let's go, Xiammy.

166
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,160
Cheapskate, drink cold water.

167
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,920
Ruoxi, stop it.

168
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,280
Ruoxi.

169
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,600
Let's go. Let's go.

170
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,520
Stop it.

171
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,840
Enough, Ruoxi.

172
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,080
Miss Xiammy.

173
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,160
Miss Xiammy.

174
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,840
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,600
I got you into trouble this time.

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,760
It's okay.

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,240
But this midterm exam

178
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,160
You guys lost.

179
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,480
Have the results come out?

180
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
You cheated.

181
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,840
It's not fair to win.

182
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,080
Losing the dignity of a scholar.

183
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,840
So even if the result is not out,

184
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,960
you will lose.

185
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,960
Okay.

186
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,760
We lost.

187
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,280
Miss Natmmy.

188
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,520
Sorry.

189
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,000
This time...

190
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,720
Tree

191
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,440
is sincere.

192
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,960
You can change if you know your mistake.

193
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,280
You can turn back now.

194
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,840
You're a lucky man.

195
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,160
Thank you.

196
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,200
Are you bored?

197
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,160
Play this.

198
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,840
Ms Qiao is here.

199
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,760
Please be quiet.

200
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,560
Get everyone out here.

201
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,760
I have something to say.

202
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,520
Class begins.

203
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,200
This midterm exam

204
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,720
my classmates

205
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,600
did very well.

206
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,080
The first place in the grade.

207
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,800
Here,

208
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,120
I want to praise you.

209
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,920
especially you.

210
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,800
You've improved a lot this time.

211
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
I hope you can keep working hard

212
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
and make greater progress next time.

213
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
One more thing.

214
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,560
From tomorrow on,

215
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,680
we'll hold a class basketball match in our first year.

216
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,280
The top three

217
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
can get extra points in the final evaluation.

218
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,960
Xiao Junyi, PE Committee.

219
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,440
organize a basketball team.

220
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,880
Commissioner of Culture and Entertainment, Wang Xiao Yu.

221
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,240
I'm here.

222
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,600
organize a cheerleader.

223
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,400
No problem.

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,600
Class begins.

225
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,440
Stand up.

226
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,640
Hello.

227
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,680
Please sit down.

228
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,560
Everyone, shout with me.

229
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,880
Go, Class 7!

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,560
Come on, Class 7!

231
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,320
Tell me.

232
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
what slogan should we give them?

233
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,560
Class 1 is the best!

234
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,440
Class 1 is the best.

235
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,240
Look at that mushroom head. It's so funny.

236
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,440
Don't they laugh?

237
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,480
Is she targeting our new strategy?

238
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,760
Xiammy.

239
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,960
Don't listen to them.

240
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,600
I think your hair is cute.

241
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,600
I think so too.

242
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,200
I've evolved into a metal bone.

243
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,960
I think these words are not lethal enough.

244
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,400
Our little Xiammy is so powerful now.

245
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,920
Fan Yuan.

246
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,520
Come on.

247
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,760
Look at that.

248
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,760
It's funny.

249
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,840
Look at that one.

250
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,560
Look at the last one.

251
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,560
How about this?

252
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,720
None of the boarding party got chosen.

253
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,800
What's there to see?

254
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,480
That's right. What's there to see?

255
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,400
Come on, this move.

256
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,520
Stand straight with me.

257
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,320
Then

258
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,400
You need to scream to feel it.

259
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,080
Xiao Junyi.

260
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,800
What are you doing?

261
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,080
I told you

262
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,520
Fan Yuan is a good player too.

263
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,000
How can we win in this formation?

264
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
I think

265
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,680
it's easier for us to communicate.

266
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,280
Why are you assigning me now?

267
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,760
I'll go get Fan Yuan and Liu Dayou.

268
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,640
At least Liu Dayou can play basketball.

269
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,440
Don't.

270
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,280
Don't.

271
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,960
Listen to me.

272
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,360
If you call them now,

273
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Wang Xiao Yu will laugh at us.

274
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,200
You're good at basketball.

275
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,440
I'm sure Class 7 can win.

276
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,600
Go, go, go!

277
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,360
Guys.

278
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,320
Go! Go!

279
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,000
It's okay.

280
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,520
Zhao Rui.

281
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,080
Come on.

282
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,640
This way.

283
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,080
Zhao Rui! Zhao Rui!

284
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
What are you doing?

285
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,800
It's okay. Let's go back.

286
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,520
It's okay

287
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,480
Come on! Come on! Come on!

288
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:14,240
Come on! Come on! Come on!

289
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,120
What are you looking at?

290
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,040
That's right.

291
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,720
Let's go.

292
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,320
Let's go.

293
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,080
It's okay.

294
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,160
We can't lose the spirit of cheerleaders.

295
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,920
Keep it up.

296
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,080
Go! Go!

297
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
What's going on?

298
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,080
Didn't they say Class 1 is amazing?

299
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,480
I think Ruoxi is in the school team.

300
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,320
This won't do either.

301
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
What's the use of being good alone?

302
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,920
My teammates are lame.

303
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,440
The rocket can't carry the tractor.

304
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,960
Listen to me.

305
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,960
We can't go down now.

306
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,680
Pick me up in the jersey.

307
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,080
I'll do it.

308
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,920
Come on, Ding. Come on.

309
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,600
Take off your clothes. Hurry.

310
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,760
He's better at coordinating with Ruoxi than you.

311
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,840
Give him the clothes.

312
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,240
What are you thinking? Hurry up.

313
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,840
Ding, hurry up.

314
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,040
I usually give you milk.

315
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,560
Hurry up.

316
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,680
Come on, Class 1!

317
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Xiao Junyi, do you know how to play?

318
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Go ahead if you can.

319
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,280
Class 1, Grade 1.

320
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,920
Xiao Junyi.

321
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:04,720
Class 1, Grade 1.

322
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,599
Referee, time out.

323
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,720
Why did you waste one time?

324
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,119
Don't move.

325
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
I'll get some water.

326
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,880
Does it hurt?

327
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,600
Oh no.

328
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,720
Our class will lose for sure.

329
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,880
Not to mention the top three,

330
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,000
It's going to be a round.

331
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,720
They are not good at reading.

332
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,400
This formation is unreasonable.

333
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,880
This is not the time.

334
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,560
You boarding sects are still sarcastic.

335
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Who said that?

336
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,960
Go ahead if you can.

337
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,800
Let me see how you are doing.

338
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,560
It's not the time to decide whether you're good or not.

339
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,640
Someone is injured.

340
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,080
It's not like I'm assigning them.

341
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,120
If it weren't for you two,

342
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,840
would he get hurt?

343
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,360
Who's causing trouble?

344
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,200
You made the dishes yourself.

345
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,320
You were shouting just now.

346
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,120
Okay, who shouted?

347
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,800
Stop arguing.

348
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,280
What's the point of you fighting like this?

349
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,200
Can the game continue?

350
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,760
Guys, can you do it?

351
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,640
Do you want a replacement?

352
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,720
Yes, I can do it.

353
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,600
No.

354
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,200
You're badly injured. You need to see a doctor.

355
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,520
Stop persuading him.

356
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,520
He's stubborn every time he plays basketball.

357
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,920
He was badly injured last time.

358
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,760
I didn't see him play.

359
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,600
You can play basketball.

360
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,280
Take me with you.

361
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,640
Okay.

362
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,600
Don't drag me down.

363
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,480
Don't just say you won't do it.

364
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,400
Watch your legs, Ruoxi.

365
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,360
Watch your leg.

366
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,200
38.

367
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,280
12

368
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:13,800
13.

369
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,360
Class 1 will win!

370
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,480
The first half is over. Ten minutes break.

371
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,760
Monitor.

372
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,440
Fan Yuan.

373
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,720
Have some water. Thank you.

374
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,360
Got it. Thank you.

375
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,440
Thank you.

376
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,760
Thank you.

377
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,200
Thank you.

378
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
I'll do the second half.

379
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,720
I'm not good at it,

380
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,120
but I have enough physical strength.

381
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,640
You've narrowed the gap.

382
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,920
We can't give up.

383
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,960
I can do it.

384
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,120
Me too.

385
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,200
I can guard.

386
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,560
We can do it too.

387
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,160
Yes.

388
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,600
Okay.

389
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,960
We can't decide the result until the last moment.

390
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,120
Let's team up again.

391
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,440
Shame before bravery.

392
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,800
Let's win the second half together.

393
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,040
Class, come on!

394
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,920
Class 1 will win!

395
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,400
Ruoxi is so handsome.

396
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,080
So many fans.

397
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,680
So you're not looking at me.

398
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,800
Ruotear, I'm going to buy something.

399
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:13,920
Grade 1 (Class 1).

400
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,640
Gao (Class 1).

401
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,240
How is it?

402
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,000
Is your foot okay?

403
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,080
I'm fine.

404
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
This is nothing

405
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,640
is nothing.

406
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,040
But we can't play like today tomorrow.

407
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,040
I’ll play Class 2 tomorrow.

408
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,280
But Qin Zeyang knows our tactics.

409
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,160
I think you can give me more offensive class

410
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,760
to confuse him.

411
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,520
That's what I thought.

412
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,240
Xi,

413
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,040
Your three-pointer today

414
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,080
Amazing!

415
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,760
We'll continue to watch you and the monitor tomorrow.

416
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,560
Of course.

417
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,400
And me.

418
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,120
Do you want to take a rest?

419
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,120
No.

420
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,480
Let's go.

421
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,600
You don't want to rest?

422
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,200
Champion! Champion!

423
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,040
Be careful.

424
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,440
The champion is home.

425
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,040
Here.

426
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,040
Let me loosen your shoulders.

427
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,160
Harder

428
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,920
Thank you.

429
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,440
I bought you ice cream.

430
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,120
Thank you. Thank you, Rammy.

431
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,560
Thank you.

432
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,320
Thank you.

433
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,600
Thank you, Xiammy.

434
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,440
What if it gets inflamed tomorrow?

435
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,520
I mean we can't affect the next day's game.

436
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,800
If we lose to Class 2,

437
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,720
we will lose face.

438
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,440
All right.

439
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,720
For your sake,

440
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,880
I will win tomorrow.

441
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,800
Natmmy.

442
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,720
You're here.

443
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,880
There's one more.

444
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,000
I need to go back to my dorm.

445
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,240
Why?

446
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,760
Let me help you.

447
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,560
We're leaving.

448
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,240
Hurry up. Don't disturb us.

449
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,080
Let's go.

450
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,400
Where did you come from?

451
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,800
Class 1, Grade 1.

452
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,920
This is for you.

453
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,240
You ran so fast to get this for me?

454
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,880
It's not for you.

455
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,000
I prepared it for you.

456
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,320
What if someone gets hurt?

457
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,040
It's for the whole basketball team anyway.

458
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,480
I'll give it to them later.

459
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,240
But

460
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,040
This is too ugly.

461
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,560
How do we divide it?

462
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,520
This is all I have in my medicine box.

463
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,560
Give it to me if you don't like it.

464
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
I'm not that particular.

465
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
As long as I can use it.

466
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,880
It's up to you.

467
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,480
Class begins. I'm leaving.

468
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,320
I'll use it well.

469
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,640
Thank you.

470
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,160
Slow down.

471
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,000
Look.

472
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,440
The cheerleaders of Class 2.

473
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,480
The dance is so powerful.

474
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,680
Class 2, Class 2.

475
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,400
I've decided.

476
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,000
Let's dance.

477
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,960
This one.

478
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,640
This is so evil.

479
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,560
No, no, no.

480
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,600
I think this is great.

481
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Let's do this.

482
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,040
This is inspiring and energetic.

483
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,840
That's it.

484
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,600
It's decided.

485
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,280
Let's practice well tomorrow morning.

486
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,560
And then I'll do the cheering banner.

487
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,680
We must make it vigorous.

488
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,320
Okay.

489
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,000
Amy.

490
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,080
What's wrong?

491
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,600
I'm thinking

492
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,120
Should I cover my hair?

493
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,560
I don't mind being embarrassed,

494
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,120
but I don't want to embarrass our class.

495
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,040
Of course not.

496
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,920
You...

497
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,080
Actually,

498
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,760
I...

499
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,920
Well...

500
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,960
Let me see.

501
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,000
I have an idea.

502
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,920
So cute.

503
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,120
Rammy, you're so cute.

504
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,840
It's really pretty.

505
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,760
Look in the mirror.

506
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,000
Class 2, Class 2, Tiger comes out.

507
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,720
to win the championship.

508
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,400
Momentum.

509
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,800
Class 2, Class 2, Tiger, come out.

510
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,320
to win the championship.

511
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,080
Momentum.

512
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,280
Class 2, Class 2, Tiger, come out.

513
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,880
to win the championship.

514
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,920
Class 2 is so fierce.

515
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,600
Why isn't everyone in our class here yet?

516
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,680
Zhang Ruoxi got hurt when she fought with Class 7 yesterday.

517
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,360
I don't know if it will affect his performance.

518
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,280
Am I seeing things wrong?

519
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,600
Is that Rammy?

520
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,280
Now I understand

521
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,320
It's like a new hairstyle.

522
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah.

523
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,000
Come on.

524
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,960
Today is the test result of our special training.

525
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,560
Let those in Class 2 see what cheering is.

526
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
No.

527
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,120
You have such a good body. You must dance with us.

528
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,400
I practiced for the swimming competition.

529
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,200
I didn't practice this weird dance.

530
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,920
Then...

531
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,000
The tiger comes out

532
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,440
to win the championship.

533
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,920
The monitor must be looking forward to

534
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,680
our cheerleaders this time.

535
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,720
He's going to be disappointed this time.

536
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
I won't dance again.

537
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,720
Sisters.

538
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,120
Ready?

539
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,920
Ready. Ready.

540
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,160
They seem to have a show.

541
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,600
Interesting.

542
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,720
Our cheerleaders are quite interesting.

543
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,320
It shocked everyone.

544
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,360
The girls in our class danced really well.

545
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,440
Wang Xiao Yu.

546
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,120
Stand here and feel it.

547
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,520
Wang Xiao Yu, do you know how to do lala?

548
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,920
Xiao Junyi, I...

549
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,240
Who did you learn this dance from?

550
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,360
Let me learn from you.

551
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,960
You look like the balloon man in front of the supermarket.

552
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,600
Class 1 is the best.

553
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,000
Class 1 is the best.

554
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,040
Please be a human.

555
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,200
I know it looks a bit watery,

556
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,840
but at least it worked.

557
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,160
I have something to tell you.

558
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,280
I used my creativity

559
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,800
with my creativity yesterday.

560
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,560
Help me.

561
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,960
What do you think of this X painting?

562
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,120
Is it okay?

563
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,600
Xia Mi.

564
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,360
Class 1.

565
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,680
Your new style is cute today.

566
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,600
Class 1, Grade 1.

567
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,240
Fan Yuan, how was my dance today?

568
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,840
Class 1, Grade 1.

569
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:27,720
You danced well, Class J.

570
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,280
You danced well.

571
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,960
It's my first time dancing today.

572
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,440
I'll dance better later.

573
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,800
We've received your encouragement.

574
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,760
Thank you.

575
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,000

Keep it up.

578
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,400
Can't you guys

579
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,200
Can't you find some pretty girls?

580
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,320
She dances so ugly.

581
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:47,960
What?

582
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,200
13

583
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,360
I learned it from a square dancer in the middle of the night.

584
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,960
You can donate your eyes if you don't want to see it.

585
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,960
Stop nagging like a hen.

586
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,960
Look at your head.

587
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,680
Hands off.

588
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,760
Let's settle it on the court.

589
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,320
Okay.

590
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,440
Let's see how we can defeat you.

591
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,639
You want to defeat me?

592
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,800
Practice for 100 years before you reach higher.

593
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,199
Class 1 is the best.

594
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,960
Class 1 is the best.

595
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,639
Beat the tiger.

596
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,360
Keep going up.

597
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,840
Class 1 is the best!

598
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,320
Class 1 is the best.

599
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,639
Beat the tiger.

600
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,239
All the way up.

601
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,360
Are you avoiding me?

602
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,159
Are you afraid of me?

603
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,320
Basketball is team sport.

604
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,440
Score is the way.

605
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
Let's work together. Me too.

606
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,080
Well done!

607
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,480
Class is the best!

608
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,040
Class 1 is the best!

609
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,640
Beat the tiger.

610
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
Keep going up.

611
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,240
What are you doing?

612
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,880
You hit me on purpose.

613
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,360
What are you talking about?

614
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,360
It's normal to bump into each other on the basketball court.

615
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Besides, he's weak. Who's to blame?

616
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,400
What did you say?

617
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,440
I saw it just now.

618
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,640
It's your little trick.

619
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,600
You tripped his leg

620
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,720
and hit him on his shoulder.

621
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,360
And you made our monitor's chin.

622
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,160
Apologize to us

623
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,320
Apologize!

624
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,760
Do you have proof? What are you talking about?

625
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,080
You want evidence?

626
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,880
My classmates recorded it for you.

627
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,200
I just took a picture.

628
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,440
You hit Fan Yuan's chin on purpose.

629
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,440
Ball or hit someone to apologize?

630
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,560
Apologize.

631
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,440
Apologize!

632
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,040
Stop!

633
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,760
What are you doing?

634
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,120
Let go of me.

635
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,920
Stop it.

636
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,720
Are you done?

637
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,120
If you continue, you'll be disqualified.

638
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
And Class 2.

639
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
You went too far just now.

640
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,720
Especially you, Qin Zeyang.

641
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,840
Do you think it’s glorious

642
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,560
to win the game?

643
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,360
If you don't want to be suspended,

644
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,920
just follow the rules.

645
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,400
You will be punished to clean the basketball court for a month.

646
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,600
Let's go.

647
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,760
How is it? Can we still compete?

648
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,640
It's okay.

649
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,760
Okay.

650
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,160
The cheerleaders go back to the field.

651
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,040
The game continues.

652
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,960
I'm fine.

653
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,000
