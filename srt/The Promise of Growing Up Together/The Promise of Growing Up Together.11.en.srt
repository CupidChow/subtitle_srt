1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on!

2
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,440
Thanks to that ridiculous challenge,

3
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,400
my math grades improved so quickly.

4
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:49,960
Xiammy,

5
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,240
If you want to improve faster,

6
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,800
you can make more mistakes during summer vacation.

7
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,080
I'll lend you my notes later.

8
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,039
Thank you, monitor.

9
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,120
Yeah.

10
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,400
I think the monitor will treat her well.

11
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,760
Thanks to you,

12
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,520
Otherwise, my grades wouldn't have improved so quickly.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,320
Don't say that.

14
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,000
You've helped us a lot.

15
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,200
It's my duty.

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,920
By the way,

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,760
I suddenly remembered

18
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,640
That punk hasn't come to see you lately, right?

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,040
Why?

20
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,079
Do you want some water?

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,280
It's okay.

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm going to buy some drinks.

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,480
What would you like to drink?

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,600
You're welcome.

25
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,400
What did you say about that punk?

26
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,800
He didn't tell us.

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,120
The last time you filmed the promotional video together,

28
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,520
If Namida was stopped by a thug at the door.

29
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
and asked her for money.

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,120
She is timid.

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm afraid she won't dare to tell the teacher that she'll be bullied.

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,040
In the future, when something like this happens,

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,640
when something like this happens.

34
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,079
You have to tell Fan Yuan.

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,480
Don't worry.

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,320
Although you always call me stupid,

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,560
but I'm not really stupid.

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,480
It's not true.

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,400
Enough, Ruoxi.

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,520
She has thought it through.

41
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,480
She won't lose anything.

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,440
You know me well.

43
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,600
Monitor

44
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,600
You almost got a perfect score for this exam.

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,240
Are you a monster?

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,640
You're good too.

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,120
Look at you. You've improved ten places than last time.

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,320
You did a great job

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,079
you did very well.

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,400
Mr. Dai

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,000
praised the learning spirit of our class.

52
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,640
Give yourselves a round of applause.

53
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,240
Come on.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,480
I've told you before

55
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,000
this exam

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,560
is one of your reference.

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Tomorrow is the last day to hand in the division form.

58
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,440
I believe you have made your own decision.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,720
Today, confirm with your parents

60
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,040
Hand over the form to the monitor tomorrow

61
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,520
Okay

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,640
I know

63
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,440
you will feel sad

64
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
because of the coming farewell.

65
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,400
But it's not time yet.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,560
Think about the group photo tomorrow.

67
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,880
Are you happy?

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,680
Yes.

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,520
We can meet after division.

70
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,960
We're still friends.

71
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,480
Let's cheer up.

72
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,400
Class begins.

73
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,040
Stand up.

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,440
Hello.

75
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,040
Class is over.

76
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Thank you.

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,840
Fan Yuan.

78
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,680
Can you pick a place

79
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,960
Can you pick a place?

80
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,200
I don't think it works.

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,560
Because the school rules

82
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,200
we can only take photos in front of the teaching building.

83
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,440
But this is our last group photo.

84
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,040
Can't you be more special?

85
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,480
Yes.

86
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,040
Monitor

87
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,640
can we take photos in our favorite clothes?

88
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,240
Yes.

89
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,400
Xiammy is smart.

90
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,000
We can choose clothes if we can't choose the address.

91
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,720
Why don't we have a dressing meeting?

92
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,040
Good idea, monitor

93
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
Will it work, monitor?

94
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,400
Yes

95
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,040
Can you do it, monitor?

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,760
Monitor

97
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,640
Be quiet

98
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,040
Other classes were all taken in school uniforms.

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,960
You know Mr. Dai is here too.

100
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,440
So...

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,640
Mr. Dai, why are you so busy?

102
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
What should we do?

103
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,080
Just wear what you like.

104
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,440
I'll take care of the rest.

105
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,080
How about this?

106
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,920
I'll talk to the teacher again.

107
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,600
No matter what,

108
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I'll try my best to fulfill your wishes, okay?

109
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,280
Okay.

110
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,200
Can I look cool in the group photo?

111
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,960
depends on you.

112
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,080
You have to work hard.

113
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,120
Liu Dayou.

114
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,240
You don't look in the mirror.

115
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
It sounds like you can be handsome without school uniform.

116
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,360
As the saying goes,

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,680
Why can't I be handsome?

118
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,800
I'll make you blind.

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,200
Dayou.

120
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,600
Did you wash your hands

121
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,880
Did you wash your hands?

122
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,520
Fan Yuan's clothes are dirty because of you.

123
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,040
I'll wash it now.

124
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,440
Okay.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,360
Just do what you should do.

126
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,240
I'll talk to the teacher.

127
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,760
Okay?

128
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,560
Okay, thank you, monitor.

129
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,280
Ruoxi, do you choose liberal arts or science?

130
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
Cool.

131
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,320
Where did you dye it? I want one too.

132
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,280
The barber in front of my house.

133
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,679
The price is fair. I'm not lying.

134
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,040
Why are you here?

135
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,280
It's a wig.

136
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,880
I thought it was dyed.

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,000
Isn't it pretty?

138
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,640
I saw your post,

139
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
I rushed over.

140
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,680
Why did you dye your hair all of a sudden?

141
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,840
I know.

142
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,200
Is it for tomorrow's photo?

143
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,680
How do you know?

144
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,560
I just want to

145
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,600
in the end.

146
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,720
But my dad...

147
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,120
I don't care.

148
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,160
The more he doesn't let me do anything,

149
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,120
the more I have to do.

150
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,280
Do I look stupid?

151
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,280
No.

152
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,160
Just kidding.

153
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,120
Have you figured out how to get in tomorrow?

154
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,200
Mr. Dai will check at the school gate.

155
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Really?

156
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,440
What should I do?

157
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,880
I finally made up my mind.

158
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,080
It's okay.

159
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,160
You see, wearing a wig is quite nice.

160
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,960
You don't have to ruin your hair

161
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,560
because you were angry with your dad.

162
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,080
Right.

163
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,760
With this wig,

164
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,560
I can go to school tomorrow.

165
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,680
I'll take it off after I take a picture.

166
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,640
But

167
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
I want a more amazing color.

168
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,840
No problem.

169
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,640
I'll arrange it for you.

170
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,240
Boss.

171
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,480
Is this disposable dye spray?

172
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,560
Yes.

173
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,600
After taking the photos,

174
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,080
you can wash it after a quick shower.

175
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Okay, thank you.

176
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,200
If you don't go crazy, you're wasting your youth.

177
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,680
I'll go crazy with you.

178
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,240
No, Xiammy.

179
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,760
Ruoxi.

180
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,880
You two should dye it back first.

181
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,080
Change your clothes and take photos.

182
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,280
Ms Qiao can also help to plead for him.

183
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,440
But dying hair is against school rules.

184
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,520
If Mr. Dai catches you,

185
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,480
you may be recorded, you know?

186
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't want to.

187
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,360
I won't back down!

188
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,880
And this is just a wig.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll take it off after the photo.

190
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,200
It's not against the school rules.

191
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,560
Don't worry.

192
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,320
No.

193
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,240
What are you up to?

194
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,200
It's fine if you mess around alone,

195
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
but you still brought her along.

196
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,200
Well...

197
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,800
First of all,

198
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
she was the one who brought me into this mess.

199
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,920
Secondly,

200
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
I'll take it off after taking the photo.

201
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,080
Rammy.

202
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Why didn't you ask me to wear a wig?

203
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,280
Amy.

204
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,000
Now I announce that you and Ruoxi are my idol.

205
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,360
I wanted to wear a wig too.

206
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,400
But I was afraid that my mom's feather duster

207
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,280
So I got scared.

208
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,160
He's generating power for love.

209
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,440
Brave.

210
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,800
You're just following the wind.

211
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,440
Power for love.

212
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm just angry with my dad.

213
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,160
Childish.

214
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't you want to know what subject I'm assigned to?

215
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,400
Let's go.

216
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,600
Go away.

217
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,720
Don't surround the superstar.

218
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,480
What superstar?

219
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,000
Xia Mi.

220
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,600
Monitor.

221
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,480
Can I interrupt you?

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,640
Go ahead.

223
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,480
My physics and chemistry have been unstable.

224
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,880
Although I did well this time,

225
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,440
but I'm afraid I'll make the difference in science class.

226
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
Is it really good for me to choose science?

227
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,080
I chose science because I like science.

228
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,680
What about you?

229
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,720
Do you really like it?

230
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
If you like it,

231
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,200
just stick to your choice.

232
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,080
No matter the difference or not,

233
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
So what?

234
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
We can just catch up.

235
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,680
Xiammy,

236
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,160
You must choose liberal arts.

237
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,640
What about you?

238
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,000
I choose liberal arts too.

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,200
I hope we can be in the same class again.

240
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,280
Of course.

241
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,560
I know.

242
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,560
Thank you, monitor.

243
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,800
As for the division form,

244
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,280
I'll put it back once I'm done.

245
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,120
Good luck.

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,080
Dayou.

247
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,680
Xiammy.

248
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,960
Monitor.

249
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,960
You must choose science.

250
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,000
Looks like we can't be deskmates anymore.

251
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
Thinking about this,

252
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,800
I feel like I lost 5 million.

253
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,800
Actually,

254
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,160
it's not completely impossible.

255
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,120
We still have a secret base.

256
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,720
If you want,

257
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,000
if you're free,

258
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,840
you can come and study with me anytime.

259
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,240
You can be my deskmate.

260
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,520
Yes.

261
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,240
Why didn't I think of that?

262
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,360
Ruoxi.

263
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,080
I've decided to choose liberal arts.

264
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,200
Have you decided which subject to choose?

265
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,920
It's a deal.

266
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's meet often at the secret base.

267
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,920
What are you talking about so happily?

268
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,920
About division.

269
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,360
What about you?

270
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,520
choose science?

271
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,600
Liberal arts?

272
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,960
You got good grades in science.

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,520
Why did you choose liberal arts?

274
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,440
No.

275
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,160
All three of you are liberal arts.

276
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm the only science student.

277
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,400
Monitor.

278
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,960
Didn't we just say we won't break up?

279
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,520
How about this?

280
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,920
We can go to the secret base after school.

281
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,680
We'll still be in the same class.

282
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,800
Don't break up.

283
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,720
Okay.

284
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,560
Get ready. Time is running out.

285
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,680
Xiao Junyi.

286
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,320
Come here.

287
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,800
What are you doing?

288
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,440
Ruoxi, where are you going?

289
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,000
We’ll deal with Mr. Dai.

290
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,280
Get changed first.

291
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,320
Let's go.

292
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,520
Boss

293
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,360
Here we go.

294
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,960
Say, Dayou.

295
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,360
Dayou!

296
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,880
Hi. Hi.

297
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,880
Student Council.

298
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,920
Do you want to be alone?

299
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,960
Miss Natmmy, I want stickers too.

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,280
Give it to me.

301
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:23,960
I have it myself.

302
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,760
Here.

303
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,640
My photo.

304
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,160
So pretty.

305
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,560
So pretty.

306
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,400
Isn't this texture?

307
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
It's so cool.

308
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,040
Thank you.

309
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,440
You're the first one

310
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,760
You're the first one to have it.

311
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,640
You look so pretty today.

312
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,920
Like a princess.

313
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,080
You look pretty today.

314
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
And very handsome.

315
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,440
It's perfect for a martial drama.

316
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,320
Why aren't Ruoxi and the class monitor here yet?

317
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,320
Yes, where did they go?

318
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,160
Did you forget?

319
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,240
He said he'll be here soon.

320
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,720
Still changing

321
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Monitor

322
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,400
Monitor.

323
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,440
You're always so honest, but today...

324
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,840
Is it weird?

325
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,600
No no no

326
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,480
Monitor

327
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,120
I didn't expect

328
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,560
you would change.

329
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,760
Stop pretending.

330
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,920
We share weal and woe together.

331
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,920
Since we're going to be punished together,

332
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,400
as the monitor,

333
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,960
as the monitor.

334
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,640
Good monitor.

335
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,000
You're so loyal.

336
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,840
Yes, the monitor is so loyal.

337
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,160
So cool

338
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,680
Monitor.

339
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,040
Did you make a deal

340
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,160
in front of me?

341
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,680
You can go downstairs first.

342
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,400
Magic takes time.

343
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,560
Before Mr. Dai arrives,

344
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,480
let’s take a good seat.

345
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,920
Okay, let's go.

346
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,720
Are you out of your mind?

347
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,600
Who allowed you to take photos in this dress?

348
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,800
Look at you.

349
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,240
is not only disrespectful to the teacher,

350
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,600
How dare you laugh?

351
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,080
I'll teach you a lesson later.

352
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,640
You

353
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
lazy

354
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,680
and disrespect discipline.

355
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,840
That makes sense.

356
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,320
Is this the magic you mentioned?

357
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,520
How did you do it?

358
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,600
Thank you, Director.

359
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,400
Yang.

360
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,680
Have a cup of milk tea.

361
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,320
Let me open it for you.

362
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,040
I'll open it for you.

363
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,560
Thank you.

364
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,520
We

365
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,200
just gave him some drinks.

366
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,440
How dare you!

367
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,200
Besides,

368
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,040
why would Mr. Yang cooperate with you?

369
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,560
Mr. Dai has a bad stomach these days.

370
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,800
and constipation.

371
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,120
The school doctor didn't take the medicine.

372
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,360
I didn't want to delay my class.

373
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,680
Mr. Yang couldn't persuade him.

374
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,160
So we asked the school doctor

375
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,960
and added some nutritious bacteria in milk tea.

376
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,920
A little

377
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,280
It's okay.

378
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,120
So,

379
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,240
Mr. Yang doesn’t want to see Mr. Dai

380
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,160
So he cooperated with us.

381
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,280
Ms Qiao.

382
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,760
Let's take a photo first.

383
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,600
Otherwise, we'll waste the time for this class.

384
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,480
That's right, Ms Qiao.

385
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,600
You go first.

386
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,440
We'll come back later.

387
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,280
Okay, let's take some photos first.

388
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,800
Come on.

389
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,600
Look at the camera.

390
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,560
I'll count to three

391
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,520
SCHOOL

392
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,440
I don't want to be apart from you

393
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,040
Me too.

394
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,800
I want to be her best friend forever.

395
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,840
forever.

396
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,720
CHOUK

397
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,840
Otomo.

398
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,720
Are you going to be an artistic prince charming today?

399
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,520
Childhood paper planes

400
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,440
Fly with childhood dreams

401
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,920
It's said that if you write your dream into a paper plane,

402
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,760
and fly it out.

403
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,520
You're disgusting.

404
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,280
Dayou.

405
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,160
I didn't expect you to believe

406
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,920
to believe such a childish legend.

407
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,200
It works if you are sincere.

408
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,120
I want to be able to

409
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,320
can hear

410
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Become

411
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,800
close friends.

412
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,360
I didn't expect you to be Ruotear's best friend.

413
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,400
Otomo.

414
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,320
I'm sorry.

415
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,760
Should I fold one for you?

416
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,400
It's okay.

417
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,600
I can fold one myself.

418
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,520
Make a wish with paper planes.

419
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,920
It's fun. I'll make one too.

420
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,320
Rammy.

421
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,080
I want my paper plane to fly to the sky and never look back.

422
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,120
Can you teach me?

423
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Okay, I'll teach you.

424
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,040
Like this.

425
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,760
make a wish for others.

426
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,400
If it weren't for her,

427
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,360
we wouldn't have had a chance to take a photo in disguise.

428
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,760
I'm making a wish for her.

429
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
to thank her.

430
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,000
Can't I?

431
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,800
No, no, no.

432
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,120
You can say anything.

433
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,600
Miss Xiammy,

434
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,400
I also want to make a wish for you.

435
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,560
Why are you laughing?

436
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,120
Show me.

437
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,560
Here.

438
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Can I say that?

439
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,440
Of course.

440
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,720
I hope her wish can come true.

441
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,280
I hope to be in the same class with Ruoxi.

442
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,440
[I hope we can come late on the day we part.]

443
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,280
so that we have more time to cherish.

444
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,080
I hope I can be in the same class with all my friends.

445
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,000
I wish all your wishes come true.

446
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,280
I'm so tired.

447
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,520
My hand hurts.

448
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
The more people ask you to write alumni records,

449
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,360
the more it proves that Ruotear is so beautiful.

450
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,800
But I don't know many people.

451
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,320
They look familiar but can't call their names.

452
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,760
You don't even know them.

453
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,280
Why did you write them a souvenir book?

454
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,680
We're all in the underworld.

455
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,920
Maybe we'll know each other tomorrow.

456
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,520
Right?

457
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,880
Since you're so busy,

458
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,320
to write for me.

459
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,400
Xia Mi, write it for me first.

460
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,760
I can write it now.

461
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,760
Ruo tears.

462
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,680
So you live in Hubin Community.

463
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,680
The house in that community

464
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,160
is very unique.

465
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,600
Building 9, Hubin Community, 201.

466
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,400
My aunt lives in Building 10.

467
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,160
I go to my aunt's house for dinner every holiday.

468
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,520
Why haven't we met before?

469
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,800
who works so hard like Ruotear.

470
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,600
must study at home during holidays.

471
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,320
I'm sure you don't have time to go out.

472
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,840
Right?

473
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,880
Yes.

474
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,880
And it's only a few days off.

475
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,320
I've been sleeping at home.

476
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,760
But if it's summer vacation,

477
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,480
I'll go on a trip with my parents.

478
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,680
Natmmy.

479
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,320
Where are you going during summer vacation?

480
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,760
I'm probably reading and writing at home during summer vacation.

481
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,680
By the way,

482
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,240
there seems to be a nice night view at the Ferris wheel park.

483
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Do you want to go with me?

484
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,280
I can.

485
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,520
Ferris wheel Park.

486
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,880
It's nice.

487
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,120
I've always wanted to go.

488
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,720
What a pity.

489
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,840
My parents signed me up for many tutoring classes.

490
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,200
I have no free time at all.

491
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,240
All right, Xiao Yu.

492
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,160
Thank you.

493
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,640
Follow me.

494
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,360
What's so mysterious?

495
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
Have a seat.

496
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,720
What is it?

497
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,600
Swordswoman fights with her sword.

498
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,680
Ruoxi leads the horse to the world.

499
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,120
You're the little turtle.

500
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,360
Our memories

501
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,200
broke the laws of the Ebinhos memory

502
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,840
and eternal universe.

503
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,720
What do you think?

504
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,360
You make me look ugly.

505
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,840
How am I ugly?

506
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,040
Isn't it cute?

507
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,880
Natmmy, where can make you happy?

508
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,680
I can take you there right away.

509
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,120
I'm busy studying.

510
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,160
and growing up.

511
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,280
Missing Performance

512
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,320
Busy having fun

513
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,280
This is the secret to the delicious food.

514
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,520
Braised Pork Braised with Swordswoman Braised Pork.

515
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,520
There's no branch in this restaurant.

516
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,040
I'm really good today.

517
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,720
You're so narcissistic.

518
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,240
Who took this photo?

519
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,320
So childish.

520
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,440
Do you think I'm a pupil?

521
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,600
Are you trying to fool me with this?

522
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,640
You don't like it?

523
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,920
Forget it.

524
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,680
Zhang Ruoxi.

525
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,160
Give it to me.

526
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,280
Give it to me.

527
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,520
You don't like it.

528
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,440
You gave it to me. How can I take it back?

529
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,720
Give it to me.

530
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,560
Give it to me.

531
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,480
I don't want it.

532
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,440
Okay, I'll give it to you.

533
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,440
Okay.

534
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
That's more like it.

535
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,040
There's no way you can go back.

536
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,440
There's no window.

537
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,920
My heart hurts.

538
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,080
I worked so hard to make a commemorative album.

539
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,280
Now people call me a pupil.

540
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,000
Out of battery.

541
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,640
Jang Ruoxi.

542
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,000
Don't beat around the bush.

543
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,880
All right, let me ask you.

544
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,320
When you saw the ferris wheel amusement park,

545
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,960
when you saw the Ferris wheel amusement park?

546
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,760
It's you

547
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,040
I'll think of you first.

548
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,280
Get up first, okay?

549
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,320
Really?

550
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,400
Yes

551
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,280
And Ruotear and monitor

552
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,520
Okay.

553
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,600
Sure.

554
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,480
Good.

555
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,880
Why are you laughing?

556
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,760
You have a temper to hold a horse.

557
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,880
Forget it.

558
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,840
I won't argue with you.

559
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,280
I'm going to travel the world with a sword.

560
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,159
Wait for me. I'm going too.

561
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,600
This place is so beautiful.

562
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,800
Let's go inside.

563
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,080
Rammy.

564
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,480
The Ferris wheel can only take two people at once.

565
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,440
After the result of the division,

566
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,400
the monitor seems unhappy.

567
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,840
Do you want to chat with him?

568
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,800
The monitor is actually emotional.

569
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,040
No wonder Ruoxi always says I'm stupid.

570
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,000
If you didn't tell me, I wouldn't have noticed.

571
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,360
Monitor.

572
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,520
I want to ride a Ferris wheel with you.

573
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,840
Okay.

574
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,880
Let's go.

575
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,520
Meteor.

576
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,560
What have you been eating lately?

577
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,240
You've suffered a lot.

578
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,320
What do you want this time?

579
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,240
Monitor!

580
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,120
Shush!

581
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,200
Stop shouting.

582
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,680
No one will save you even if you shout.

583
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,440
What are you talking about?

584
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,600
Yes.

585
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,520
I'm not as heartless as someone.

586
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,480
I thought of my best friend first

587
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,200
The second one comes to mind is the monitor

588
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,120
He never thought of me

589
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,440
I'm so angry that my heart hurts.

590
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,600
Here.

591
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,240
You even brought chocolate with you?

592
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,000
You only know how to make girls happy.

593
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,840
Of course not to make girls happy.

594
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,320
Are you happy now?

595
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,080
You said I'm not a girl?

596
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,920
So vicious.

597
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,920
Don't you all want to know

598
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,840
why I chose liberal arts?

599
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,640
Why?

600
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,560
Because I want to go to the film academy.

601
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,760
You want to be an actor.

602
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,480
I like acting.

603
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,920
But I never wanted to be an actor.

604
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,280
Until that time,

605
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,000
I went home with you to the barber shop.

606
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,600
I don't know why,

607
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,600
I felt a voice kept talking in my ear.

608
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,800
telling me not to give up my dream.

609
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,240
I'm so jealous

610
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,920
Ruoxi.

611
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,400
In the future,

612
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,440
you'll be a great actor.

613
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,000
Because

614
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,320
Your acting almost fooled me.

615
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,960
I...

616
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,040
What did I lie to you?

617
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,640
You said your chocolate

618
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,120
to coax girls?

619
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,520
Of course not.

620
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,640
It's to make you happy.

621
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,760
You're so cute today.

622
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,000
By the way,

623
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,080
I have good news for you.

624
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,880
My manuscript has been approved.

625
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,080
That's our great writer.

626
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,240
Aren't you a big star too?

627
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,480
You're not even even a star yet.

628
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,320
But someone said

629
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,480
I'll buy you a meal when I get paid. Okay.

630
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,120
Sure.

631
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,160
Let's go together after school starts.

632
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,480
Can't it be just the two of us?

633
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,560
What's your plan for the holiday?

634
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,640
I'm waiting for you to visit me.

635
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,800
What?

636
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,720
You're shooting a drama?

637
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,520
I have to go to the wholesale market and buy some notebook.

638
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,800
You'll write down

639
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,200
in every notebook.

640
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,960
When you become a superstar,

641
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,760
I'll be rich lying down.

642
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,240
Money maniac.

643
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,200
You broke my brain.

644
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,120
What if I can't write in the future?

645
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,840
Where are you?

646
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,320
Why aren't you saying anything?

647
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,720
Natmmy, what happened?

648
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,000
I'm fine.

649
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,120
I just passed Cheongsu Station.

650
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,720
I know this road well.

651
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,440
Don't worry about me.

652
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,200
You won't let me see you off.

653
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
Of course I'm worried about you.

654
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,480
It's late. If you give me a ride,

655
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,720
your parents will worry about you.

656
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,520
Then don't hang up.

657
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,560
Let's talk.

658
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,360
Ruoxi Zhang.

659
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,600
I'm not a kid anymore.

660
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,480
I'm a kid. I'm scared.

661
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,200
Just do a good deed that day.

662
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,080
and chat with me.

663
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,080
Well...

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,320
