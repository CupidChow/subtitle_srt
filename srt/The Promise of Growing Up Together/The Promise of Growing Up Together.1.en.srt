1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,360
Everyone's youth

3
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,440
may have a brilliant dream.

4
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,479
To chase our dreams,

5
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
We'll cry. Okay.

6
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,840
Okay. Okay.

7
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,360
You fall.

8
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,400
and stupid.

9
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,480
But no matter what happens,

10
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,480
we always have the courage

11
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,360
believed in miracles.

12
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,400
We were so cute

13
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,200
It's just yesterday.

14
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,680
Li.

15
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,600
Xia.

16
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
I don't want to cut my head.

17
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,680
No.

18
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,600
According to the admission letter of Yi Zhong High School,

19
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,040
girls can't cross their shoulders.

20
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,000
This is the rule.

21
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,760
Rules and rules.

22
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,200
Notice is not an imperial edict.

23
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,040
It's not the truth yet.

24
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,120
Natmmy.

25
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,920
You got into City No.1 High School.

26
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,280
You made it!

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,560
Yi Zhong High School is a key school in the city.

28
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,040
Many people can't get in even if they want to.

29
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,160
Listen to Uncle Li.

30
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
You have to follow the rules.

31
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,600
That's right.

32
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,680
Li,

33
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,120
Cut her head.

34
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,800
Okay.

35
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,280
Just cut it.

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,560
Just cut it like this

37
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,880
This is good.

38
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,400
We have our own rules.

39
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,200
The school has rules. I cut it.

40
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,000
TWBEAR

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,520
Lee

42
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,760
You're a good cook.

43
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,960
My daughter feels much better now.

44
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,360
That's good.

45
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
That's good.

46
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,120
Hello.

47
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
When will you pick me up?

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,280
I've been waiting for half an hour.

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,240
I'm at the parking lot.

50
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,960
Brother.

51
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,040
Your wallet is so pretty. Where did you buy it?

52
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
I want one too.

53
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,600
Who are you?

54
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,560
I don't know you at all.

55
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,000
Give it to me.

56
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,600
You don't know who I am,

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,680
but I know who you are.

58
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,800
Your name is Thief.

59
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,320
You...

60
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,520
That's my wallet.

61
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,480
Help! Help!

62
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,440
Someone catch the thief!

63
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,560
Stop!

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,000
Stop!

65
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,880
Little girl.

66
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,640
Thank you.

67
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,760
You're welcome.

68
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,280
Confucius said

69
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,760
there's no courage to see justice.

70
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,240
This is what I should do.

71
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,560
You're quite brave.

72
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,840
Yes, you're not only brave,

73
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,080
but also smart.

74
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,120
It's really good.

75
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,280
You're the new era Little Mu Lan.

76
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,160
Thank you for your compliment.

77
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,760
Dismiss

78
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,200
Let's go.

79
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,720
Thank you.

80
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,240
Thank you.

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,120
Mimi.

82
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,640
Why are you so arrogant?

83
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,480
What if something happens?

84
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,920
What if you get hurt?

85
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,520
You should've called me.

86
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,840
Li, I'm leaving.

87
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,960
Next, before the final result comes out,

88
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,520
let's welcome our youth professional judges

89
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,080
to cheer for the two of us.

90
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,360
TWBEAR

91
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,760
NBEAR.

92
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,800
Your brain is very fresh.

93
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,120
Xia.

94
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,720
Mom.

95
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
You should have another child as soon as possible.

96
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,640
You'll lose your daughter from today on.

97
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

98
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,200
Xia.

99
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,040
What are you doing?

100
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,480
I told you to listen to her.

101
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,160
If you listen to her, you'll be useless.

102
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,400
Mimi, have some fruit.

103
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,600
Look how cute the fruit is.

104
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,760
It’s a pity if you don’t eat it.

105
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,400
Don't be upset.

106
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,640
Look at your mouth.

107
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,720
How about I help you?

108
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,280
I'm hopeless.

109
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,920
I was tricked by Tony too.

110
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,200
She's experienced.

111
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,840
Trust me.

112
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,520
I'll make you pretty.

113
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,760
Mom.

114
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,400
You said you were experienced and beautiful.

115
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,200
Don't worry, Mimi.

116
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
Since the admission notice has rules,

117
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360
we'll do it together.

118
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,440
You won't be the only ugly one.

119
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,240
I'm going to cook.

120
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,159
Help!

121
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,920
I don't want to become popcorn.

122
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,800
We should get the materials.

123
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,840
How would I know?

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,520
We did it according to the school rules and regulations.

125
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,520
Mi.

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,840
Line up here.

127
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,440
Your mom and I will go get daily necessities.

128
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,720
Report to the register.

129
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,840
Thank you.

130
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,560
You're welcome.

131
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,600
Excuse me.

132
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,960
11306127.

133
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Please bless me to be possessed by a koi.

134
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,040
and be in a good class.

135
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,840
Excuse me.

136
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,480
Fan Yuan.

137
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,280
This class is so sharp.

138
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,600
With Fan Yuan as the ace,

139
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
won't win the first place in the future.

140
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,080
Liu Yifan.

141
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,120
Qin Zeyang is in Class 2.

142
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,360
It’s hard to say.

143
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,400
Hard to say?

144
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,880
Qin Zeyang is in Class 2.

145
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,280
There's also Ruoxi Zhang in that class.

146
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,480
In junior high,

147
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,080
he and Fan Yuan were a pair of superstars.

148
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,400
He's so good too.

149
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
I'm in the same class as him.

150
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,240
I'll be half the king then.

151
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,920
Humph.

152
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,480
Which class are you in?

153
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm in the same class.

154
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,040
Class 1.

155
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,520
We know each other.

156
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm in Class 1 too.

157
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,880
The boy in front.

158
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,800
Stop!

159
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,280
You can't ride your bike into the teaching area today.

160
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,680
Excuse me

161
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
Excuse me.

162
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,440
Who are you?

163
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,000
Why are you so careless?

164
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,440
Mi.

165
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,000
Dad, mom.

166
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,920
I have good news.

167
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,640
I'm assigned to Bomb Class.

168
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,840
Go to report.

169
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,960
Mi,

170
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,960
Do you want us to send you to the dorm?

171
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,080
No, I can do it myself.

172
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,480
I'm already in high school.

173
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,160
I'll do my own thing.

174
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,240
Oh no.

175
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,600
Xia must have forgotten to take the banquet before he left.

176
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,640
He said I was forgetful.

177
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,240
You are also forgetful.

178
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,760
It's him.

179
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,480
Cut.

180
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:53,760
ROCKETS

181
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,520
So handsome.

182
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,960
Handsome, are you still going to fight?

183
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,120
No.

184
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,920
I'm going back to class.

185
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,760
Let's play together next time.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,120
Okay, bye.

187
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,240
Be careful

188
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,080
Happy

189
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,640
I'm sorry

190
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:03,560
KETS

191
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,720
RCKETS

192
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,280
KETS

193
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,720
I'm glad I ran fast.

194
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,160
I shouldn't have meddled.

195
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,560
He's a good player. He can definitely dodge it.

196
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,680
We're in the classroom. Let's go.

197
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,120
Let's talk after class.

198
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,160
I'm smart.

199
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,440
Strange.

200
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,680
There's nothing to block.

201
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,200
Could it be...

202
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,920
a legendary barrier?

203
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,680
You again?

204
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,960
Why are you laughing?

205
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,800
It's me.

206
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,320
Which sect are you from?

207
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,080
You can't break the barrier.

208
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,640
You're not good at learning.

209
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,360
It's none of your business.

210
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,360
You haven't paid for the hit-and-run.

211
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,320
I was just being brave.

212
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,320
I just made a little mistake.

213
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,360
I didn't mean it.

214
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,600
I haven't got even with you yet.

215
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,680
You're rude.

216
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,040
How dare you laugh at me?

217
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,240
I'll break the barrier for you.

218
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,160
Isn't it super simple?

219
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,560
Mind your own business.

220
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,320
I can come in myself, okay?

221
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,320
Smile.

222
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
The foolish sons of the landlord always laugh.

223
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,240
The hypothesis proposed by the German mathematician, Poynhad Leman.

224
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,320
It's an American Clay Mathematics Institute.

225
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,440
In the Millennium,

226
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,120
in the Millennium.

227
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,400
Fan Yuan.

228
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,680
Fan Yuan.

229
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,599
I lost to you in the entrance exam.

230
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,880
That's because I didn't do well.

231
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,319
Do you dare to compete with me again?

232
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,599
You've lost to Fan Yuan

233
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,440
You've lost to Fan Yuan so many times.

234
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,640
Why don't you give up?

235
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,480
What?

236
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,720
The invincible Qiang.

237
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,160
What?

238
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,240
You're not convinced?

239
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,480
Come on.

240
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,040
One on two.

241
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,000
Then tell me.

242
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:27,920
What?

243
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,440
Let's compete with Sudoku.

244
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,280
What do you think?

245
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,000
Anything.

246
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,160
Did you just provoke the top student in our class?

247
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,480
We have to watch it.

248
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,320
Let's go.

249
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,600
The top student.

250
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,320
One of the Bomb.

251
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,400
And...

252
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,720
The class meeting is in 15 minutes.

253
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,360
Whoever answers correctly wins.

254
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,400
OK?

255
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,840
It won't take 15 minutes.

256
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,200
I can finish it in ten minutes.

257
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,240
Fan Yuan.

258
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,720
I'll beat you today.

259
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,080
Okay.

260
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,240
Three.

261
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,160
Two.

262
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,440
The game begins.

263
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,320
So fast?

264
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,400
This Sudoku

265
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,960
can you write the answer directly

266
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,040
Just write the answer like this?

267
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,960
He can do it.

268
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,440
I didn't understand the question but they solved it.

269
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
A straight A student's brain is indeed different from ours.

270
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,800
Oh no.

271
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,960
Fan Yuan's distraction has fallen behind several planks.

272
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Will he lose?

273
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,120
Fan Yuan.

274
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,120
I'm going to win this game.

275
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,160
Three, three, seven, nine, X.

276
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,480
29.

277
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,400
He won't lose.

278
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,040
Here he comes.

279
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,000
Fan Yuan won the national champion

280
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,800
in junior high.

281
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,280
You can easily catch up with this question.

282
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,240
Right?

283
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,320
You're right.

284
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,840
Look.

285
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,600
Fan Yuan caught up with Qin Zeyang.

286
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,960
What happened?

287
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,000
So unlucky.

288
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,760
Let God do the calculation.

289
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,360
After all, fate is better than fate.

290
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,720
Fan Yuan.

291
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,160
Game over.

292
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,880
The answers on both sides are correct.

293
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,000
Wow.

294
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,000
My little shrimp

295
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm really swimming to the sea now.

296
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,600
Are we even in this round?

297
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,480
I don't accept a draw.

298
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,320
This round

299
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,240
you win.

300
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,440
If Fan Yuan hadn't dropped his chalk,

301
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,760
you would have won.

302
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't want a tie like this.

303
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
Not bad. You even won.

304
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,240
But you have to give me half of the result.

305
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,800
Sure. Play two rounds with me this weekend.

306
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,320
You can have all the results.

307
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,320
OK. You can play all night.

308
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,720
Look.

309
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,480
The teacher is here.

310
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,400
Run!

311
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,520
Let's go.

312
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
What did you do this morning?

313
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,760
I was playing basketball.

314
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,080
Did you choose a seat?

315
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,120
It's in the back.

316
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,160
See you.

317
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:36,680
Ruo tears.

318
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,000
Yun Jin.

319
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,360
Dada.

320
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:37,680
Chae Ok.

321
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,000
Henqi.

322
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,840
Hello.

323
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,800
Excuse me.

324
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,760
for taking your seat.

325
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,120
It's okay.

326
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,080
Thank you.

327
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,640
Excuse me.

328
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,000
Can I interrupt you?

329
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,520
Let's discuss something over there.

330
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,320
This is out of print.

331
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,480
I can't even borrow it from the library.

332
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,000
Where did you find it?

333
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,280
This is for you.

334
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,160
But I won't accept any reward without contributions.

335
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,280
This is too valuable.

336
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't want it.

337
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Don't be nervous.

338
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,840
I used to sit by the window when I was in junior high.

339
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Let me discuss with you.

340
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,040
Change seats.

341
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,080
I'll change with you.

342
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,280
Thank you.

343
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,240
Hello. Hello.

344
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,520
I'll change my seat.

345
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,280
What's wrong with the king bomb?

346
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,640
Why did he suddenly change his seat?

347
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,720
Is he blaming me for disturbing him during the game

348
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,240
for bothering me during the game?

349
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,960
Hello.

350
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,920
My name is Fan Yuan.

351
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,880
Do you remember me?

352
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,320
Yes.

353
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,800
You were the top student in that grade.

354
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,760
Is there anything else?

355
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,720
Do you know how miserable I am?

356
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,240
Nine years of obligation education.

357
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Nine years.

358
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,760
I haven't even met a female deskmate.

359
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,640
I swear

360
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,440
I will break this curse in high school.

361
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,000
Hello.

362
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,960
I have a seat here.

363
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,200
Please be quiet.

364
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,040
It's a class meeting.

365
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,520
Hello, everyone.

366
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,000
My name is Qiao Yun.

367
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,440
I’ll be your head teacher in the next year.

368
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,240
This is also my first time to lead a class.

369
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,360
I hope in the next year,

370
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,640
in the future.

371
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,040
These three pictures

372
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,440
represent three key words.

373
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,120
It represents that I teach Chinese.

374
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,680
Magazines and scenery photos

375
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,360
represent my hobbies.

376
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,760
I like traveling and writing articles.

377
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,400
What do you think?

378
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,040
Do you have a preliminary understanding of me?

379
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,120
Sir.

380
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,920
Did you publish all these magazines?

381
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,720
Yes.

382
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,200
Wow.

383
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,840
New literature is amazing.

384
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,120
Alright.

385
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,400
I'm not the lead of today's class meeting.

386
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,640
but you.

387
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,000
to get familiar with each other as soon as possible.

388
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,400
everyone needs to

389
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,920
with three key words.

390
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,120
What do you think?

391
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,440
Who comes first?

392
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,000
Looks like everyone is a little shy.

393
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm quite shy.

394
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,120
How about this?

395
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Next, let's play a dragon catching game.

396
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,040
I'll order a student first.

397
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,960
And then, this student

398
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,560
to pick the next trainee.

399
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,880
Fan Yuan.

400
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,760
Yes.

401
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,920
Come up.

402
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:23,840
Dust. Dust.

403
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,960
Hello, I'm Fan Yuan.

404
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,840
from Luxiang City.

405
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,280
As for the keyword,

406
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,760
I think...

407
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,480
I know.

408
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,760
You're the top student in that grade.

409
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,280
or the math industry?

410
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,400
Rukawa.

411
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,080
That topic was so cool.

412
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,240
Anyway, he's a straight A student.

413
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,600
Thank you for the keyword.

414
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,680
Rukawa from math.

415
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,080
I don't know if I'm good enough.

416
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,840
But I really like math.

417
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,600
I hope you can discuss math with me.

418
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,720
No, no.

419
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,040
We don't deserve it.

420
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,080
You don't have to be so serious.

421
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,600
As the saying goes,

422
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,640
"No noble, no lowly."

423
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,440
with no age or age.

424
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,400
The Tao exists.

425
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,360
The master exists.

426
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,440
Everyone is equal in front of knowledge.

427
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,560
Thank you.

428
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,760
Fan Yuan is right.

429
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,120
As the saying goes,

430
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
If you don't learn,

431
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,320
Everyone should learn from Fan Yuan.

432
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,640
Next one is...

433
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,080
The one in blue and white.

434
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,640
Hello.

435
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,720
My name is Zhang Ruoxi.

436
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,680
I only have one keyword.

437
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,320
Cool.

438
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,200
Very handsome.

439
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,080
Very handsome.

440
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,080
Very handsome.

441
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,080
OK.

442
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,840
Good. Everyone has good taste.

443
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,320
But let's keep a low profile.

444
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,200
This is the second king bomb.

445
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,360
So narcissistic.

446
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,440
Actually, my keyword is basketball.

447
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,000
If there's anyone who likes to play basketball with me,

448
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,520
That's Ruoxi Jang.

449
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,160
Is he good at basketball?

450
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,280
He's good at playing basketball.

451
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,160
or pray

452
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,920
or pray?

453
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,880
Anyway, we can

454
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,560
kill each other.

455
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,400
That's all for my introduction.

456
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,320
The next one I want is

457
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,280
The girl in green

458
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,960
The girl in green leaning on the window.

459
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,600
Natmmy.

460
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,320
This guy is so annoying.

461
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,720
Let's give him a round of applause.

462
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,800
Hello, everyone.

463
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,320
My name is Xiammy.

464
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,320
Summer of spring and summer.

465
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,720
Rice from the countryside of fish and rice.

466
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,720
In three words,

467
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,920
it should be writing.

468
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
I'm a TV fan.

469
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,120
And

470
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,200
Mushroom head.

471
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,360
He's also a mushroom head.

472
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,840
Okay, be quiet.

473
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,760
Stop laughing.

474
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,480
Miss Xiammy has strictly followed the image rules of admission notice.

475
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,640
Everyone should learn from her.

476
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,520
Let's give her a round of applause.

477
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,160
That's all.

478
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,160
Rammy.

479
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,520
I think your mushroom head is pretty.

480
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,600
Thank you.

481
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,840
I'm not comforted at all.

482
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,560
Hello, I'm Lin Ruotear.

483
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,680
I'm Yuhan.

484
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,360
My name is Siu Junyi.

485
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,440
I'm Wang Xiao Yu.

486
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
My name is Zhao Rui.

487
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,720
My name is Liu Dayou.

488
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,120
I'm Tian Jiarong.

489
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,880
My key word is my friend's study and travel.

490
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,560
The keyword is swimming.

491
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,040
My first keyword is Hong Kong film.

492
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,000
My idol is

493
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,640
Bruce Lee.

494
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,720
I like spicy food.

495
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,920
You can call me if you want spicy crayfish.

496
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,600
Besides milk,

497
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,080
there's one more word to describe me accurately.

498
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,960
That is...

499
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,280
Handsome.

500
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,120
My second keyword is basketball.

501
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,080
I've always been the class committee.

502
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,120
I hope I can have the honor

503
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,880
to continue to serve you.

504
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,160
I love math.

505
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,600
I like Sudoku too.

506
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,480
I hope I can

507
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,640
with Fan Yuan.

508
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,240
OK.

509
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,880
You all did very well just now.

510
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,920
Now I'll choose two monitors.

511
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,360
Fan Yuan will be the class monitor.

512
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,200
Tian Jiarong will be the monitor.

513
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,040
During the military training,

514
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,280
Can you two take care of the boys and girls?

515
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,480
Yes, sir.

516
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,280
Next is the class representative.

517
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,720
Our language class representative will be taken by Xiammy.

518
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,760
I...

519
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,600
I'm acknowledging you.

520
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,040
Okay.

521
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,720
Tomorrow at 6:30 a.m.,

522
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,040
at the central square tomorrow morning.

523
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,080
Remember to wear military uniform.

524
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,920
Especially the onlooker.

525
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,360
Remember.

526
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,280
Don't be late for the first time.

527
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,160
Got it?

528
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,040
Got it.

529
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,880
Class is over.

530
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,120
Goodbye.

531
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,200
I haven't been to the dorm yet. Why don't you take me there later?

532
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,320
It's totally fine.

533
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,960
I'll wait for you.

534
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,480
Okay.

535
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,880
Fan Yuan Fan.

536
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,120
Congratulations on becoming the monitor.

537
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,600
Thank you, Yuhan.

538
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,000
We seem to be in the same dorm.

539
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,440
You're so pretty.

540
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,080
Let's go recharge our campus card.

541
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,760
This is the canteen. I'll take you there.

542
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,640
Okay.

543
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,840
This is it.

544
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,040
We can put the card and money on the window later.

545
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,280
Xiao Yu.

546
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
You seem to know a lot about this place.

547
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Of course. I came up from junior high.

548
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,880
You can ask me if you have any questions.

549
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,840
Wang Xiao Yu.

550
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,840
How much do you usually charge?

551
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,080
Whatever

552
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,360
I'm a parent anyway

553
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,920
I can use credit cards at the canteen, bathhouse and snack stores.

554
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Just save some money to go home on weekends.

555
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,920
Lin Ruotear,

556
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,120
You may not have enough money to recharge.

557
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,760
Just call me Ruotear.

558
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,440
I don't eat much

559
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,040
I don't eat that much

560
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,480
And I don't like meat and fish.

561
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,280
This is enough.

562
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,240
No wonder you have such a nice body.

563
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,000
There's a reason why a beauty can become a beauty.

564
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,160
No.

565
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,560
You're pretty too.

566
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,560
Next.

567
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,800
It's our turn.

568
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,640
Walk faster

569
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,880
You're so slow.

570
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,480
Line up.

571
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,040
Everyone, gather around.

572
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,160
Line up by number.

573
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,560
Forward and back.
