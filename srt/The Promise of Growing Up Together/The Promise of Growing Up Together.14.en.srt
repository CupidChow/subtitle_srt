1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on!

2
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,320
See? I told you they're up to something.

3
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,720
Ruoxi is so sweet.

4
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
I wish I could have such a good friend.

5
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,440
Amy.

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,680
Help me check the lines for the New Year's Eve Gala tomorrow.

7
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,600
I'm a little worried about my poor writing.

8
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:06,840
Then...

9
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
I think it's well written.

10
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,720
It's a festival atmosphere.

11
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,360
Really?

12
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
That's a relief.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
Thank you.

14
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,640
I have to clean the stairs tomorrow morning.

15
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
I don't know if I can deliver it in time.

16
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,320
Wait for me in the classroom tomorrow morning.

17
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
Don't take other people's cards first.

18
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,200
I won't accept it if you tell me not to.

19
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,160
So domineering.

20
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,280
Ruo tears.

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,840
How are you?

22
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,800
Are you feeling better?

23
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
I'm much better.

24
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,400
Don't worry.

25
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
What about you? Are you done?

26
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,160
Me too.

27
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,320
Let's go back to the dorm.

28
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go. Okay.

29
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,920
Ruoxi.

30
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,480
Why are you here?

31
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,560
I wanted to ask you.

32
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,960
Why are you here so early?

33
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,240
You're smiling so brightly.

34
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,200
No.

35
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,760
What is this?

36
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,640
Nothing.

37
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,360
Miss Xiammy, why are you here so early?

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,240
Happy New Year, the star of the literary world.

39
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,880
[Happy New Year]

40
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,160
It's funny.

41
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,720
Don't get it dirty.

42
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,320
How will you pay for it?

43
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,040
No, my hands are clean.

44
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,680
Good handwriting.

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,840
Morning.

46
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,480
Class begins.

47
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,880
I didn't mean it.

48
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,000
This is...

49
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,560
Zhao Rui stepped on it just now.

50
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:37,960
I'm making porridge now.

51
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,080
How can I give it to someone?

52
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:42,240
I'll buy you another one that looks exactly the same.

53
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,640
Do you think you can buy it anywhere?

54
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,320
I bought it in the city center.

55
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,080
Go and buy it now. I...

56
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,760
They've already collected a lot.

57
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,520
What's the point of giving this to her?

58
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,440
You want her to be the first one to receive it?

59
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,280
Yes.

60
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,280
Let's go. Okay.

61
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,600
Happy New Year.

62
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,720
You can open it and have a look.

63
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,360
Thank you.

64
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,720
I've designed it carefully.

65
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,440
Let me see.

66
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,200
Let me see.

67
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
This is for you.

68
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,600
This is your old deskmate.

69
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,200
It's so good.

70
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,840
Take a look

71
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,160
So pretty.

72
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,120
I like this.

73
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,080
Thank you, Dayou.

74
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,120
[Ruoxi.] [Happy New Year.]

75
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

76
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,960
This is my card.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,360
Thank you.

78
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Hasn't she come yet?

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,840
Just give me her.

80
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,680
I'll take it for her.

81
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,680
Why?

82
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,640
She went on duty this morning.

83
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,080
I'll give it to her later.

84
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,240
Okay.

85
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,400
Here you go.

86
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:58,880
Thank you.

87
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,640
I thank you for her.

88
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,360
It's okay.

89
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,000
Ruoxi, happy New Year.

90
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,120
Thank you. Happy New Year.

91
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,040
Just give me Natmmy's.

92
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,600
You want it?

93
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
Yes, just give it to me.

94
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,760
I'll give it to her. Yes.

95
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,040
Thank you on her behalf.

96
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,200
Ruoxi, happy New Year.

97
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,920
Thank you.

98
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,920
You're happy too.

99
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,560
Just give me Natmmy's.

100
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:28,960
Thank you.

101
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Happy New Year.

102
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
Yours. Thank you.

103
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,600
Happy New Year.

104
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,159
Happy New Year, Ruoxi.

105
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,040
Happy. Happy.

106
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,720
Where is Xiammy?

107
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,480
Why do you have dark circles under your eyes today?

108
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,120
Really?

109
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,680
Yes.

110
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,200
You didn't rest well?

111
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,800
No.

112
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,880
I didn't stay up late

113
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,560
last night.

114
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
How long will she be back?

115
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,440
Don't come back now.

116
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,960
I'm not sure.

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,600
Fine.

118
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,200
I'll go back first.

119
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:23,920
Okay.

120
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,680
Happy New Year.

121
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,480
Happy New Year.

122
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,919
Why did you send them so pretty?

123
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,160
Z.

124
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:45,800
Yes.

125
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,040
Why isn't he back yet?

126
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,960
The cabbage is getting cold.

127
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
You're welcome

128
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,960
Thank you.

129
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,720
You're welcome.

130
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,360
Thank you.

131
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,280
So beautiful.

132
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,160
It's just a little something from me.

133
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,480
And it's really not expensive.

134
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,400
Really? Let me see what it says.

135
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,880
CATCH DREAM

136
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,480
CATCH DREAM

137
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,800
You wrote well too

138
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm the only one who has nothing.

139
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,560
You said you'd give me a greeting card first.

140
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
He's not here.

141
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,960
I gave it to him last night.

142
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:35,960
Amy.

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,760
Monitor.

144
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,720
Did you see the greeting card I gave you?

145
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,680
I put a card on your desk.

146
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,320
Right here.

147
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,520
Didn't you see it?

148
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,240
There's nothing on my desk.

149
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,440
Did it fall?

150
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,760
Did someone take it?

151
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,120
Dayou,

152
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,720
Did you see anyone touch my card?

153
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
I don't know.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,160
You can ask Ruoxi.

155
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,560
He's been on the spot.

156
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,960
Where is he?

157
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,360
Xiammy.

158
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,560
Fan Yuan.

159
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,560
I got you.

160
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,440
Happy New Year.

161
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,160
Happy New Year.

162
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,120
Thank you.

163
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,920
You're welcome.

164
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,360
I don't know how to solve a math problem.

165
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,760
What a coincidence.

166
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,120
Give me some guidance.

167
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,560
This question.

168
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,040
Here we are.

169
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,200
Did you take my card?

170
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,400
I can't hide anything from you.

171
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,920
Why did you take my card?

172
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,320
Don't get me wrong.

173
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,720
I'm not trying to mess with you.

174
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,000
I just want to be the first person to give it to you.

175
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Then give it to me.

176
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,880
My card

177
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,080
got dirty by Xiao Junyi.

178
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,920
It's just a card.

179
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,880
It's dirty if it's dirty.

180
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,440
It's understandable that my card is dirty.

181
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,360
What about yours?

182
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,320
I've been waiting for you here early in the morning.

183
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,360
I gave it to you a long time ago.

184
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,560
Some people are blind.

185
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,080
Forget it if you can't see it.

186
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,920
Excuse me.

187
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,040
Hee-chun is bright.

188
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,280
Summer is shining.

189
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,640
Hee and Ha.

190
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,080
This is your card.

191
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,120
I made this just now.

192
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,640
It's a bit rough.

193
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,880
You can throw it away

194
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,280
Throw it away.

195
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:43,880
Hands.

196
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,600
Hee Ra Byul.

197
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,760
Form.

198
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,760
Yes.

199
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,240
From Hee.

200
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:12,800
From Hee.

201
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,000
Trom match.

202
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:13,680
From Hee.

203
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,520
I can give you a whole star

204
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,440
I can give you a whole star.

205
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,640
How did you know I like meteors?

206
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,880
Because of a pig.

207
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,560
He said it when he was lazy and sleeping.

208
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,280
Meteor.

209
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,800
I want to see meteors.

210
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,960
I can't see it.

211
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,120
From Hee.

212
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,760
Thank you.

213
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,880
I like it.

214
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,480
Who is this?

215
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,840
Xiao Junyi.

216
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,120
No wonder you didn't come to the morning study.

217
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,400
You were caught climbing over the wall.

218
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,560
This human-shaped sign

219
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,720
is really good.

220
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,360
Mr. Dai is so wise.

221
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,240
Wang Xiao Yu.

222
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,680
Don't be so rude.

223
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,520
You might be next time.

224
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
Natmmy.

225
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,240
I was caught because I went to buy you a birthday card.

226
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,200
You must put in a good word for me in front of Ruoxi.

227
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,120
He only listens to you now.

228
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,960
Who said he only listens to me?

229
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,079
What card?

230
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,680
Mr. Dai asked you to stand still.

231
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,800
Why are you talking to others?

232
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,839
If you talk to others now,

233
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,319
you'll be fined for more than ten minutes.

234
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,560
Enough.

235
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,480
Stop standing here.

236
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,839
Hello, Mr Qiao.

237
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,200
Let’s go eat.

238
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,280
I’ve told Mr. Dai that I won’t punish you.

239
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,200
Really?

240
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,840
Ruoxi, I'm really tired.

241
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,240
Let's go eat.

242
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,720
I'm really hungry.

243
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,840
I'm exhausted.

244
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,600
Xiao Junyi, what have you been eating lately?

245
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,160
You're so fat.

246
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,560
You crush him to death.

247
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,360
It's nice.

248
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,080
Ruoxi is so cool.

249
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,800
One more.

250
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,520
Ruoxi, I love you.

251
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,840
So cool.

252
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,000
Thank you for your wonderful performance.

253
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,560
Next, let's welcome Liu Dayou and Xiao Junyi

254
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,760
to bring you a crosstalk novel. It's worth a lot.

255
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,640
Let's welcome him.

256
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,040
Come on.

257
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
We gather here tonight

258
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,040
besides celebrating New Year's Eve together,

259
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,240
and to celebrate

260
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,880
for the super handsome guy in our class.

261
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,600
Enough.

262
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,080
The party is about to end.

263
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,360
We're running out of time.

264
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,760
Very B.

265
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,760
Let's wish Ruoxi

266
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,840
Happy birthday.

267
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,000
Let's work hard together next year.

268
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,680
Birthday girl.

269
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,440
It's rare for us to gather together.

270
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,000
Do you want to play a game and have fun?

271
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,200
Sure.

272
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,560
Sure, no problem.

273
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,760
What do you want to play?

274
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,320
Let's play

275
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,720
Truth or Dare.

276
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,480
Do you dare?

277
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,520
Okay.

278
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,280
Why not?

279
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,320
Bring it on.

280
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,000
You're a birthday girl.

281
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,640
I'll ask you the first question.

282
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Excuse me.

283
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,000
Among the cards you received today,

284
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,120
whom do you like the most?

285
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,680
It's such a simple question.

286
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,240
You don't have to think so long.

287
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,520
Tell me.

288
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,400
Actually,

289
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,480
my favorite

290
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,400
is Dare.

291
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,920
It's really boring.

292
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,760
If you don't answer such a simple question,

293
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,240
I...

294
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,040
I think adventure is actually good.

295
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,200
Here, draw the question.

296
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,560
Draw.

297
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,440
Return the Rubik's Cube in one minute.

298
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,920
Take off your clothes and run naked outside the auditorium.

299
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,600
It's so cold running naked

300
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,880
You'll freeze if you go out in your clothes.

301
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,240
Isn't this adventure too much?

302
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,840
Yeah.

303
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,920
It's okay.

304
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,760
It's okay.

305
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,080
The third-stage magic cube.

306
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,200
It's very vivid.

307
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,200
I've been bored since elementary school

308
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,800
It's not hard for me

309
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,720
STARTON

310
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,040
I remember

311
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,120
the fastest record of Ruoxi's third-level magic cube was 15 seconds, right?

312
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,160
Elementary school records?

313
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,000
Really? Yes.

314
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,920
OK.

315
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,640
Three, two, one.

316
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,920
Bite.

317
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,920
LICIOUS.

318
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,240
ELICIOUS L

319
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,200
Awesome. Was it ten seconds just now?

320
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,600
Why do I feel it's only five seconds?

321
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,680
I'm sorry.

322
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,080
I made you feel bad watching the show.

323
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Okay, thank you.

324
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,080
Congratulations.

325
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,720
Happy birthday.

326
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,840
What?

327
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,040
Don't you have anything to say on my birthday?

328
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
I did.

329
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,960
I did.

330
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,200
Didn't I give you the card?

331
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,320
You just gave me a card?

332
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,000
Are you kidding me?

333
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,800
No.

334
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,760
Let me see.

335
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,280
No.

336
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,960
What's my gift?

337
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,760
Who prepared a gift for you?

338
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,680
What is it?

339
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,000
Ruoxi.

340
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,080
Happy birthday.

341
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,960
Here's your present.

342
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,000
Thank you.

343
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,920
Open it.

344
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,600
This is my first time weaving a scarf.

345
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,880
Please forgive me

346
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,800
please forgive me.

347
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,680
Ruoxi.

348
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,920
You promised me.

349
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,800
Thank you.

350
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,400
You're welcome.

351
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,960
I'm glad you like it.

352
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,120
What about my new year gift?

353
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,600
Sorry.

354
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,400
I didn't prepare anything.

355
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,480
I forgot.

356
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,760
I'll give it to you next time.

357
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,200
It's okay.

358
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,280
Then...

359
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,520
In the future,

360
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,840
in the future.

361
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,840
Xiammy.

362
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,800
Come here.

363
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,880
Come on.

364
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,520
Interior basketball court annual card.

365
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,360
You're welcome.

366
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,760
That's my lady.

367
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,240
You're so generous.

368
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,520
Happy birthday.

369
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,920
What is this?

370
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,920
How did you know I wanted this?

371
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,320
The evaluation of the watch that I share every day.

372
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,760
It's hard not to see it.

373
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,360
Am I the only one who can see it?

374
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,720
Thank you.

375
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,520
Is there anyone who hasn't given me a gift?

376
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,440
Brother.

377
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,000
I finally got you.

378
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,760
I need to use the bathroom.

379
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,280
I'll go with you.

380
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,760
Mine is here.

381
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,760
Here, birthday girl.

382
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,480
Thank you, everyone.

383
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,080
Thank you.

384
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,560
I'll put it on the top.

385
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,440
Why are you pressing me?

386
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,200
All right.

387
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Let's go back.

388
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,600
Xiammy.

389
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,880
Do you think

390
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,360
Ruoxi, will he dislike the scarf I knit?

391
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,320
It's my first time knitting it.

392
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,000
I didn't knit it well.

393
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,040
I should have

394
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,360
I would have bought him a ready-made gift.

395
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,520
I don't know if he'll like it.

396
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,800
Ruotear.

397
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,240
Do you have feelings for

398
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,680
The first time I saw him,

399
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,480
I thought he was shining like the leading man in the movie.

400
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,440
Until one time I was in a promotional video with him,

401
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,920
to be the male lead,

402
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,280
to know how I feel about him.

403
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,480
But it's too early to say this.

404
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,680
We need to focus on study.

405
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,440
I don't know

406
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,080
if he will wear it tomorrow.

407
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,480
He just looks mean.

408
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,120
but he's actually very gentle inside.

409
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,560
He should be...

410
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,120
Amy.

411
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,600
What's wrong?

412
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,640
Am I nagging too much?

413
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,480
Without me,

414
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,520
I suddenly have a headache. I'm going back to my dorm.

415
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,120
Have fun.

416
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,840
Ruo tears.

417
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,400
What's wrong with her?

418
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,440
Monitor.

419
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,360
She thinks it's too noisy upstairs.

420
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,280
so she wants to go out for a walk.

421
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,160
Monitor,

422
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,480
Why don't you go and chat with her?

423
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,560
Okay.

424
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,200
Hello. Hello.

425
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,800
Monitor.

426
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,640
I received the greeting card you gave me.

427
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
I like it very much.

428
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,800
Thank you.

429
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,880
So,

430
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,920
Did you really see

431
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,160
Did you really see it?

432
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,560
It's okay.

433
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,800
You received so many cards anyway.

434
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,160
It's normal that you didn't see them.

435
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,200
I'm fine.

436
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,440
Are you feeling unwell?

437
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,720
No.

438
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,840
I just

439
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,320
a little tired.

440
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,400
I can't walk.

441
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,840
If you feel uncomfortable,

442
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,920
just cry out loud.

443
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,760
It's okay.

444
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,080
I'm here.

445
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:04,360
Z.

446
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,400
Ruoxi.

447
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,200
Are you going to find her?

448
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,600
I saw her going out with Fan Yuan.

449
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,160
Fan Yuan seems to have something to say to her.

450
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,720
Let's not disturb them.

451
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,240
You sent me a scarf

452
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,600
in front of Xiammy?

453
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,920
You asked me

454
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,680
in front of her.

455
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,240
Right?

456
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,400
I didn't.

457
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,320
I saw that she didn't prepare a gift for you.

458
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,960
I was afraid you would be unhappy.

459
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,400
so I gave you the scarf.

460
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,160
I've received your gift.

461
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,440
This pen

462
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,720
is a gift in return.

463
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Xiao Junyi chose it.

464
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,320
I don't mean anything else.

465
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,640
Please stay away from me.

466
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,360
Thank you.

467
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,440
Ruoxi.

468
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,080
Did you misunderstand me?

469
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,840
Lin Ruotear,

470
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,760
Please don't use others' kindness.

471
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,640
She's neither a fool nor a fool.

472
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,920
She just doesn't want you to be so bad.

473
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,640
She doesn't know how to protect herself.

474
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,120
That's all.

475
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,560
It looks like two people are getting wet outside.

476
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,080
That girl kept crying.

477
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,240
It seems to be Fan Yuan and Xia Mi.

478
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,440
Did they quarrel?

479
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,600
I don't know.

480
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,080
Amy.

481
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,040
Let's go back to the dorm.

482
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,760
You'll catch a cold.

483
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,880
Monitor

484
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,040
I'm sorry.

485
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,760
for causing you trouble.

486
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
I never thought you were a trouble.

487
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,600
Go upstairs.

488
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,640
Take a hot bath.

489
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,680
Don't think about anything.

490
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,800
Let's go.

491
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,719
Go back to the dorm and get changed.

492
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,040
Look at you.

493
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,639
We can pick you up if you don't have an umbrella.

494
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,640
Run back alone.

495
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,480
What if you catch a cold in the rain?

496
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,680
Yeah.

497
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,720
I'm fine.

498
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,160
Get some rest.

499
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,280
Ruo tears.

500
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,920
What's wrong with her?

501
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,320
Happy birthday.

502
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,400
Your birthday present.

503
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,360
Thank you.

504
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,840
Please don't use others' kindness.

505
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,200
She's neither a fool nor a fool.

506
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
She just doesn't like to think bad about others.

507
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,200
and doesn't know how to protect herself.

508
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,000
That's all.

509
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:26,600
