00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,160
Xia Mi, look at the hot search.

195
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,880
Ruoxi is on the hot search.

196
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,160
Change her name.

197
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:40,680
More.

198
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,080
Three minutes.

199
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
I want all the scenes he's done.

200
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,880
Let's watch his road show today.

201
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,280
Zhang is not a rookie.

202
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,440
He's a drama actor.

203
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,880
He's really good at acting.

204
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,680
He's handsome too.

205
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,120
I think he's handsome as a man.

206
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,520
Next,

207
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,080
I'd like to interview our leading actress, Ruoxi Zhang.

208
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,840
Mr. Zhang.

209
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,120
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

210
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,880
Hello.

211
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,160
I heard you've been in the drama troupe.

212
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,360
It's your first drama.

213
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,640
Why did you suddenly decide to be in a drama?

214
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,320
It wasn't a sudden decision.

215
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,240
I've been trying many different roles.

216
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,160
but I didn't have a good chance.

217
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,640
It's a great drama

218
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,080
such an excellent drama

219
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,000
thanks to Director Wu.

220
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,240
Thank you for giving me such a precious opportunity.

221
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,680
Don't mention it.

222
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,360
Ruoxi is a treasure actress.

223
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,880
I worked with him ten years ago.

224
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,200
At that time, I found

225
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,600
he was very talented.

226
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,440
So,

227
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,800
He deserves to be seen by more people.

228
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,520
Thank you.

229
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,680
I didn't expect you two to be so close.

230
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,600
The spring breeze ferry is still on air.

231
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Your performance is also popular

232
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,520
Many audiences are very concerned about you.

233
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,880
Can you tell us

234
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,040
Can you tell us a little?

235
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,320
Actually,

236
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,960
I'm trying to get the lead role of a drama.

237
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,800
This drama

238
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,160
is a promise

239
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,200
in my life.

240
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,000
Let's make a ten-year promise.

241
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,040
What is it?

242
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,640
Ten years later,

243
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,920
you write our story.

244
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,120
I'll be the male lead.

245
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,400
Then we're a match made in heaven.

246
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,600
We promised to go to the film academy together.

247
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,240
to work hard for each other's dreams.

248
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,640
But I was absent for ten years.

249
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,600
In the past ten years,

250
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,720
she was very strong.

251
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,280
and came this far with our dream.

252
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,880
I want to take this opportunity to tell her

253
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,640
I didn't forget our promise.

254
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,360
I...

255
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm back.

256
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,200
Hello, Susu.

257
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,800
Xia Mi, good news.

258
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,880
Our male lead has been decided.

259
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
Hello, Xiammy.

260
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,960
Are you listening?

261
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,040
Hello?

262
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,800
You're awake.

263
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
Mimi, you're finally awake.

264
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,360
Do you have a headache?

265
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,600
Do you want me to make you some hangover soup?

266
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,800
Hello, Susu. I have something to do. I'll talk to you later.

267
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,360
Mom, why did you come back with him?

268
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,480
I went to buy groceries.

269
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
I saw Ruoxi downstairs when I came back.

270
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,040
so he picked it up for me.

271
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,200
Ruoxi, thank you.

272
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
You're welcome.

273
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,080
Call me if you need anything.

274
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,960
I'll be there anytime.

275
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,920
Get out!

276
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,560
We don't need your help.

277
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,800
Get out! Go!

278
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,200
I'm sorry.

279
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,560
It's all my fault.

280
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,160
Mimi.

281
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,680
Don't cry, Mimi.

282
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,360
I'm sorry.

283
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,400
I saw him drive you home yesterday.

284
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,720
I thought you two...

285
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,080
I'm fine, mom.

286
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,440
I don't feel well.

287
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,680
I'm going back to rest.

288
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,680
I know I can't change the past.

289
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,440
I don't expect you to forgive me now.

290
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,400
I just hope you can give me another chance to make up for it.

291
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,520
I will always wait for you.

292
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,920
You said you would wait for me.

293
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,360
It's all a lie.

294
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,320
Fan Yuan, she abandoned me.

295
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,000
Ruoxi Zhang.

296
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,320
This punch

297
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,320
for her.

298
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,600
Who promised me to take good care of her here?

299
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,160
Who promised me

300
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,240
that you won't give up easily.

301
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,920
You're just going to do that?

302
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,320
Look at me, Ruoxi.

303
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,520
You're just a jerk.

304
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,440
Luckily, you're fine.

305
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,080
If anything happens to you,

306
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,280
I will never forgive you.

307
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,040
The food abroad is so good.

308
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,560
You've become stronger.

309
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,120
You deserve it.

310
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,560
Who told you to disappear for so long?

311
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,960
Apply it yourself.

312
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,760
When she comes down,

313
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,880
she thought we colluded.

314
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,320
Don't worry.

315
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,800
She won't come down.

316
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,760
She doesn't want to see me now.

317
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,560
She waited for you for ten years.

318
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,520
It's reasonable to blame you and resent you.

319
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,040
You have to bear all this yourself.

320
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,040
I know.

321
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,240
Okay.

322
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,160
Don't be too discouraged.

323
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,880
She's angry because

324
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,000
because she loves you.

325
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,120
Find a chance to apologize to him.

326
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,600
and resolve the misunderstanding.

327
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,920
Sooner or later, she will forgive you.

328
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,440
No matter how long it takes,

329
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,360
no matter how long it takes.

330
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,560
I won't give up.

331
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,000
Stop fighting.

332
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,080
Forget it.

333
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,400
Why did you suddenly disappear?

334
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,280
How are your parents?

335
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,440
Where do you live recently?

336
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,880
Dr. Fan.

337
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,680
You asked so many questions at once.

338
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,600
Which one should I answer?

339
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,560
Talk nicely. I'm not joking.

340
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,800
Don't worry.

341
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,680
My parents are fine.

342
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,240
Me too.

343
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,360
Anyway, everything is fine.

344
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,520
Really.

345
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,600
I didn't.

346
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,200
You haven't watched the news recently?

347
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,360
Me?

348
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,960
a little red now.

349
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,720
Be good to her.

350
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,400
Don't let me down again.

351
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,280
and don't make her sad.

352
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,240
Okay?

353
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,720
I will.

354
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,680
Fan Yuan.

355
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Thank you.

356
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,760
If you want to thank me,

357
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,080
live happily with her.

358
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,520
Don't make me worry about you abroad.

359
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,360
This place is as beautiful as before.

360
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,320
Good morning. I'm here for a breeze.

361
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,360
Why are you here?

362
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,200
Oh, me.

363
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,040
What happened to your face?

364
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,880
You care about me?

365
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,560
You think too much.

366
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,200
It has nothing to do with me.

367
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,320
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

368
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,440
I'm never the one who goes back on my word.

369
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,360
Stop following me.

370
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,240
Ruoxi, what are you doing? Are you kidnapping me?

371
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,080
It's not easy to get a taxi here.

372
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,040
Four wheels are faster than two legs.

373
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,200
No.

374
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,720
Stop! Stop!

375
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,840
Don't move.

376
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,960
I'll kiss you if you move.

377
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,880
Ruoxi, you...

378
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
You're a pervert.

379
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,280
I'm not the one who started it.

380
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:11,760
Upfist.

381
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,000
Ruoxi Zhang.

382
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
I was drunk and lost my mind.

383
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,480
Don't threaten me with this.

384
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,400
Rammy.

385
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,400
I'm also here to work.

386
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,200
Please cooperate.

387
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,840
Your job is to memorize the script at home.

388
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,160
What does it have to do with me?

389
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,360
To deepen my understanding of the character,

390
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,240
it's very necessary to communicate with the scriptwriter in advance.

391
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,560
For our

392
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,960
for our project.

393
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,800
If you're free these days,

394
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,840
help Ruoxi get familiar with the roles.

395
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
How did you know my schedule?

396
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,160
Which side is Sue from?

397
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,800
What?

398
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,640
You can't even talk about work?

399
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,360
Who said that?

400
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,480
Of course we can talk about work.

401
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,840
but not private matters.

402
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,360
Okay.

403
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,440
Where should we go next?

404
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,240
Mr. Han.

405
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,840
Let's go to the Ferris wheel park. I'm going to see the view.

406
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,760
Okay.

407
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,760
You sit next.

408
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,360
Why can't two people sit?

409
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,120
I just want to sit alone.

410
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,400
Sure.

411
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,120
But how do we talk about work later?

412
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,840
Sing a mountain song across the sedan.

413
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,560
You...

414
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:52,960
Whatever.

415
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,560
Do you remember

416
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,720
you asked me to buy some books for me at the wholesale market?

417
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,360
Then I have to go to the wholesale market to buy some notebook.

418
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,960
You'll write down "Zhang Ruoxi" on every notebook.

419
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,560
When you become a superstar,

420
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,200
I'll be rich lying down.

421
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,160
You money maniac.

422
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,080
You broke my brain.

423
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,040
What if I can't write in the future?

424
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,000
Some people are a big star now.

425
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,760
I didn't make any money.

426
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,040
If you're willing,

427
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,240
I'll go to the wholesale market to buy a book.

428
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,240
Let's set up a stall to sell autographs.

429
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,000
to make you rich.

430
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,400
No.

431
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,800
It was just a joke when I was young.

432
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,160
Don't take it seriously.

433
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,840
Ruoxi.

434
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,400
What are you doing?

435
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,520
Make a wish.

436
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,280
What wish?

437
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,000
Haven't you heard of a legend?

438
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,639
When the Ferris wheel reaches the top,

439
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,320
make a wish and be with the one you love,

440
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,600
we will never be apart.

441
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,560
How old are you?

442
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
how can you believe such a thing?

443
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,239
I don't care if it lies to adults or kids.

444
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,320
as long as it can come true,

445
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,639
I'm willing to make it 10,000 times.

446
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,159
Artistic common sense.

447
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,200
I hope I get good grades tomorrow.

448
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,760
I hope I can write a good script.

449
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,120
[Jang Ruohee.]

450
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,560
Will you really come to me?

451
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,440
There's no eternity in this world.

452
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,640
I don't believe in these.

453
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,040
Natmmy, we...

454
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,200
What's wrong?

455
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,880
It's going to rain.

456
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,000
Let's go.

457
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,520
Let me.

458
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,040
Should I take you to the hospital?

459
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,360
I'm fine.

460
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,320
Just take me home.

461
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,240
Sleep if you're tired.

462
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,240
Don't be afraid.

463
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,720
Are you okay?

464
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Let's stop here.

465
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:55,640
Rammy.

466
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,480
Wait.

467
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,720
Where are you going tomorrow?

468
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,360
Should I pick you up?

469
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
Tomorrow?

470
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,680
tomorrow.

471
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,680
We can talk about work on WeChat.

472
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,880
Don't worry.

473
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,400
I'm a professional.

474
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,760
I'll cooperate if you're the male lead.

475
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,160
But outside of work,

476
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,200
I don't want to see you.

477
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,120
What can I do

478
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,240
to give me another chance?

479
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,320
Ruoxi Zhang.

480
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,560
I've given you a chance every day for the past ten years.

481
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,720
Have you given me a chance?

482
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,680
You ignored me for ten years.

483
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,040
Now that you're back, you want to start over without explaining.

484
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,400
Do you think I won't be sad or hurt?

485
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,920
I don't think so.

486
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,880
I just think

487
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,760
no matter how I explain it,

488
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,920
I can't make up for the trauma I caused you.

489
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,040
Is that the reason why you didn't say anything?

490
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,920
You left without saying a word ten years ago.

491
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,640
Now you're back without explaining.

492
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,160
Do you know

493
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,040
all these years,

494
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,200
what I fear the most is not that you forget our agreement.

495
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,200
but that you already...

496
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,800
Mom.

497
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,760
You don't have to cook for me for lunch.

498
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,200
I'm going out to write.

499
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,480
What about dinner?

500
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,400
Your grandma gave me a chicken.

501
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,680
Do you want some chicken soup?

502
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,600
Okay. Thank you, mom.

503
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,000
Hello.

504
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
One double espresso, please.

505
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,120
Okay.

506
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,360
Hello your Americano

507
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,440
Thank you.

508
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,640
Xiammy.

509
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,600
I just heard an explosion gossip.

510
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,360
So Lin Ruotear and Fan Yuan broke up long ago.

511
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,320
And because Lin Ruotear cheated on her.

512
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,240
No wonder they seemed strange

513
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,120
I thought they were weird.

514
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,520
She can even pretend to be affectionate for a whole year on Moments.

515
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,000
I have to say one word. Awesome.

516
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
Xia Mi.

517
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,160
Sorry, Ms Cheng.

518
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,400
I met a friend.

519
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,480
Can we talk?

520
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,280
Okay.

521
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,560
I heard that Ms. Jang is back.

522
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
and became an actress.

523
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,640
Are you going to keep working together?

524
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,240
Congratulations.

525
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,680
It's finally time to see the moon.

526
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,600
Now I can rest assured.

527
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,000
What are you trying to say?

528
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,040
Rammy.

529
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,600
Don't be so hostile to me.

530
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,920
I'm truly happy for you.

531
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,920
I hope you and Ruoxi can grow old together.

532
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,240
That's all I want to say.

533
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,440
I'll leave you alone.

534
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,960
Ruo tears.

535
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,600
I've never been your enemy.

536

If you really love the monitor,

537
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,800
I hope you can cherish it.

538
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,360
