1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,759
I said after dinner,

3
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,960
after dinner.

4
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,160
So you went to collect the payment.

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,759
I earned this on my own.

6
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,360
It's more fulfilling to hold it.

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,160
It's nice.

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,800
Ruotear.

9
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,080
Please pay the fee.

10
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,840
Only yours is left.

11
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,479
30 yuan.

12
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,200
Okay.

13
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,360
Monitor.

14
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,240
I forgot to withdraw the money.

16
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,920
Can I give it to you tomorrow afternoon?

17
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,680
I told you a few days ago.

18
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,840
Why haven't you withdrawn money these days?

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,440
You were dilly-dallying for the medical fee last time.

20
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,200
I don't know if you really forgot or not.

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,920
Monitor.

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
I'll pay for her. Okay.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,920
Okay.

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,720
Amy.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,800
Thank you.

26
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,360
You're really my good friend.

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,280
You're welcome.

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,880
Why are you thanking me?

29
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,880
I said I have no money.

30
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,400
I can't even afford my tuition.

31
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,520
How dare you talk to me like that?

32
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,560
What's wrong?

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,160
Do you want to get beaten again?

34
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,480
What happened?

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,160
I'm at the Internet cafe.

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,880
Send me money.

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,720
Your mom will pay you 50 yuan more this month.

38
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,120
If you don't come,

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,160
I'll go home and tell my dad.

40
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,920
and let him beat your mom up.

41
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,839
Darn it.

42
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,440
Why is my face cream so small?

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,880
Did you use my cream?

44
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,040
Don't ask me.

45
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
I don't have the habit of touching others' things.

46
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,760
Then Ruotear and Xiammy won't use my face cream.

47
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,280
They must be sleeping outside.

48
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,040
Ruo tears.

49
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,560
Let me ask you something.

50
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,800
You've been at school these weekend.

51
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Let me ask you something.

52
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,000
Did you see any strangers come into our dorm?

53
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,360
I don't know which ghost dug my face cream like this.

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,640
Could it be a misunderstanding?

55
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I don't think anyone would be so bored.

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,680
like this.

57
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,960
No way.

58
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,880
I thought I was mistaken.

59
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
But today,

60
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,360
this is the end.

61
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,960
Someone must have used it secretly.

62
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,440
Help me think

63
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,440
if anyone entered our dorm.

64
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,080
Sorry.

65
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,120
I've never seen anyone come in.

66
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,680
Why are you laughing?

67
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,880
I'm laughing at you for being silly.

68
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,920
Who else?

69
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,080
When she was in middle school, she liked stealing from others.

70
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,920
I remember you.

71
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,120
You're from Class 7.

72
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,840
She said you liked bullying her in junior high.

73
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,960
We don't believe you.

74
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,360
Who bullied her?

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,880
Let me remind you.

76
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,920
Believe it or not.

77
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,120
I'm not the one who will suffer anyway.

78
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,640
You...

79
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,640
She's not that kind of person.

80
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,080
Yeah.

81
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,600
Everyone is here.

82
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,280
Rammy.

83
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,159
I don't know which one used my cream secretly.

84
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,680
Did you see someone open my cabinet?

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
It's normal to open the wrong cabinet.

86
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,800
I didn't notice that.

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,560
I'm really angry.

88
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,440
Who is it?

89
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,840
You can't even afford daily necessities?

90
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,400
I must catch the thief.

91
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,080
Calm down.

92
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,080
Let's go.

93
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,360
Who took my class fee?

94
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,080
Rammy.

95
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,040
Did you take the class fee in my bag?

96
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,640
What are you talking about?

97
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,160
Why would I take your class fee?

98
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,720
I heard that

99
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,960
you have 1,020 yuan.

100
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,880
The class fee I put in my bag is exactly 1,020 yuan.

101
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,320
What a coincidence.

102
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,680
Monitor.

103
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,920
You misunderstood.

104
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,560
The money for her is...

105
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,960
No one was there just now.

106
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,080
Anyone could have been here.

107
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,720
Isn't it inappropriate for you to blame her?

108
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,680
Well,

109
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,560
You are all her friends.

110
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
Of course we'll help her.

111
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,440
Rumor has it in the dorm that

112
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,520
it was Xiammy who secretly used Wang Xiao Yu's face cream.

113
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,320
Who else could it be?

114
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,080
I heard that her hands and feet were dirty in junior high.

115
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,559
Really? It must be true.

116
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,159
Who said my hands and feet are dirty?

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,679
Were you in my class in junior high?

118
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,880
Did anyone see me take someone else's stuff?

119
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,920
If not,

120
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,560
why do you think I did it?

121
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,160
My money

122
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,920
was paid for this new literature magazine.

123
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,560
My article is on page 20.

124
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,960
The author's name is my real name.

125
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,840
I have a chat history with my editor on my phone.

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,120
These can prove

127
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,520
my money comes fair and square.

128
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,520
I've never taken anything from anyone before.

129
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,280
I won't ever...

130
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,880
I don't know who

131
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,200
made such a boring prank.

132
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,680
But I hope she can return the money to Tian Jiarong as soon as possible.

133
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,000
I can pretend it never happened.

134
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,240
I'll go to the teacher to check the CCTV

135
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,720
and see who took the class fee.

136
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,000
Hey.

137
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,120
But...

138
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,280
Will it be bad for her if it gets bigger?

139
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,240
What if she hates her?

140
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,640
right?

141
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
What's going on?

142
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,520
Sir.

143
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,040
The class fee I just received is gone.

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,960
No way.

145
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,320
Have you looked carefully?

146
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,040
It's true that she received the payment.

147
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,120
It's a misunderstanding.

148
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,560
Then who took the class fee?

149
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,720
So much money.

150
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,760
I...

151
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,400
Don't worry.

152
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,400
If you can't find the class fee,

153
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,680
you can pay first.

154
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,880
There's a solution to everything.

155
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,720
But

156
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,920
it's wrong to accuse

157
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,640
That's not right.

158
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,240
Rammy.

159
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Sorry.

160
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,600
Sir.

161
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,680
Yes.

162
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,480
A good word makes you warm in winter.

163
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,280
Bad words hurt people. It's cold in June.

164
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,120
I hope you can think about it

165
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,840
when you hear the rumors.

166
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
Don't follow the flow.

167
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,080
Besides,

168
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,960
I believe our classmates

169
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,480
won't take things casually.

170
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,880
If someone really took it by accident,

171
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,520
I hope she can correct her mistake.

172
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,640
Okay?

173
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,840
Okay.

174
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,320
Go back first.

175
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,240
Class begins.

176
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,280
Amy.

177
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,080
The article is well written.

178
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,320
Keep up the good work.

179
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Thank you.

180
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,120
Go.

181
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,920
Okay.

182
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,120
That's why I'm here to catch up.

183
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,560
Record what he said.

184
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,480
Although things are different,

185
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,840
So I'm excited.

186
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,280
It means one.

187
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,680
The readers later

188
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,880
will be refined.

189
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Give me one more minute.

190
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,680
Come with me after class.

191
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,520
Read the book.

192
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
In the ninth year of Yonghe,

193
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,240
[I'm still ugly.]

194
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,680
At the beginning of spring.

195
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,040
At the beginning of spring,

196
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,680
will be at the pavilion in the Yin Mountain of Hui Kui.

197
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,520
The renovation

198
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
All the talents are here.

199
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,160
Young Masters gather salty.

200
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,680
There are mountains and mountains here.

201
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,800
There are mountains and mountains here.

202
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,680
What?

203
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,040
Close your eyes.

204
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,840
I have a gift for you.

205
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,760
Childish.

206
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,480
Don't open your eyes.

207
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,560
Zhang Ruoxi.

208
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,080
Why are you so mysterious?

209
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,800
I have a bad feeling.

210
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,120
Are you going to sell me?

211
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,720
According to the market price of pork, you're worth hundreds of yuan.

212
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,480
Do I have to?

213
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Pork is worth more than ten yuan a catty.

214
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,360
I have over 100 kilograms.

215
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,760
I should at least...

216
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,120
How much?

217
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,920
Are you kidding me?

218
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,840
God of Post.

219
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,320
These...

220
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,720
When did you draw these?

221
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,960
How do you feel?

222
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,680
Do you feel better now?

223
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,480
Mr. Writer.

224
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,080
I'm not in a bad mood.

225
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm just wondering

226
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,960
who played such a prank.

227
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,600
Could it be

228
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,840
Jiang Li?

229
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,040
Who else knows

230
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,800
except Fan Yuan and me?

231
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,800
Ruo Yuan.

232
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,320
Don't you think these two things are coincidental?

233
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,880
Stop.

234
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,440
Are you suspecting Ruotear?

235
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,600
Xiammy.

236
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,320
Ruoxi.

237
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,600
What a beautiful blackboard poster.

238
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Who drew this?

239
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,720
Ruoxi?

240
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,520
Yes.

241
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,240
I drew it.

242
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,840
Ruo tears.

243
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,400
Monitor, don't run so fast.

244
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:11,880
Rammy.

245
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,640
Wait for me.

246
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,760
You ran so fast.

247
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Why are you here?

248
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,440
Are you okay?

249
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,920
Don't take these rumors to heart.

250
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,600
You should know that everyone trusts you.

251
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,600
Don't worry.

252
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm fine.

253
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm not afraid of shadows.

254
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,760
I'm innocent.

255
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,480
Yes.

256
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,680
Yes.

257
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,560
You are upright.

258
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,480
But I can't stand people talking.

259
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,600
I think we should find the real culprit.

260
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,240
Monitor Tian.

261
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,480
Can I interrupt you for a few minutes?

262
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,440
Sir.

263
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,320
Sir.

264
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,800
The principal wants you to go to the office.

265
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,880
The principal wants me.

266
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,240
Yes.

267
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,800
Are you sure?

268
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,360
Yes.

269
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,080
He said the CCTV in that office was broken.

270
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,400
so he asked you to check it.

271
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,680
I think I lost something.

272
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,640
Class dismissed.

273
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,400
Stand up.

274
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Thank you.

275
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,960
Who's playing a prank?

276
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,840
Oh.

277
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,480
Rammy.

278
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,480
Where did you go?

279
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,320
I was looking for you, but I couldn't find you.

280
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,880
We went to the surveillance room.

281
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,240
We saw something unexpected.

282
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,440
Really?

283
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,760
What did you see?

284
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,560
After Tian Jiarong left,

285
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,080
you were in the corridor.

286
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,560
Then you can't see anything.

287
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,760
What's going on?

288
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,520
Why is it dark?

289
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,280
Maybe the CCTV is broken.

290
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,520
or the battery died.

291
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,920
Almost.

292
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,640
Ruotear.

293
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,280
Have you seen anyone

294
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
before the PE class?

295
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,080
No.

296
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,520
I left right after I went to the bathroom.

297
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,520
I didn't notice.

298
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,680
Oh.

299
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,920
Class monitor Rong has got the class fee back.

300
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Really?

301
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,400
That's great.

302
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,880
I heard from Tian Jiarong

303
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,280
that she has 1,020 yuan.

304
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
You told her.

305
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,440
I got the class fee back anyway.

306
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,800
It's just a misunderstanding.

307
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,800
Let's go back to the classroom.

308
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:40,920
Let's go.

309
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,720
She abandoned you first.

310
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,880
You still want to go to her?

311
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,480
You're the one who got abandoned.

312
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,240
Ruotear must be afraid that we might hate her.

313
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,240
because she didn't want us to hate her.

314
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,160
You were too fierce just now.

315
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,800
Why are you blaming me?

316
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,800
Who am I doing this for?

317
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,600
Forget it.

318
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,480
I'm not blaming you.

319
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,560
If you really want to go, go.

320
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,320
You're so nice.

321
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,880
I'll go buy some food.

322
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,400
Okay, Ruoxi.

323
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,320
Xiammy cherishes her friend very much.

324
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,800
After all, it's normal that

325
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,160
It's normal for her to care.

326
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,680
I know.

327
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
But I'm just afraid that

328
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,040
Mr. Dong Guo met a wolf.

329
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,520
Tears.

330
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,640
The aunt in the canteen is trembling today.

331
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,080
She gave me a leg.

332
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,960
Here.

333
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,760
No.

334
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,040
Eat up.

335
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,840
I can't eat either.

336
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,760
Good sisters share weal and woe together.

337
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,240
Please help me.

338
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,800
It's delicious.

339
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,680
Try it.

340
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,440
Rammy.

341
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,880
I'm sorry.

342
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
I didn't mean to tell her.

343
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,240
I was so happy for you.

344
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,240
So,

345
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,080
I didn't know

346
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,360
would bring you so much trouble.

347
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
Of course I know you didn't mean it.

348
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,200
It's already settled anyway.

349
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,200
Don't cry.

350
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,080
Didn't I say

351
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,720
to go out together after I get the money?

352
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,680
How about we go to karaoke during the holiday?

353
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,920
Why didn't you invite me?

354
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,680
Trying to cheat?

355
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,720
Didn't you hear it?

356
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,960
Even if I didn't call you,

357
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,840
even if I didn't call you.

358
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,720
Monitor.

359
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,440
Are you free?

360
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Of course.

361
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,280
Just tell me when you have time.

362
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,200
Okay.

363
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,880
Thank you.

364
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,960
Don't cry.

365
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
If you don't sing, enjoy yourself.

366
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,080
No one is allowed to leave.

367
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,280
Dayou, Xiammy.

368
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,640
Is this your karaoke?

369
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,480
Yes.

370
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,000
Before my mom married my dad, she was a singer.

371
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
She loved singing with her friends.

372
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,240
So my dad

373
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,200
prepared this karaoke room for her.

374
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,720
Ruo tears.

375
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,440
What do you think of this place?

376
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,560
I think this place is great.

377
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,680
And I think uncle and aunt are very close.

378
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,320
Hey.

379
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,760
This is what you said

380
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,400
to Dayou's karaoke?

381
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:35,960
Yes.

382
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,640
Can't I?

383
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,920
Who's buying?

384
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,360
It doesn't matter.

385
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,080
Don't stand there. Sit down.

386
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,640
Sit down

387
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,840
Having fun is the most important.

388
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,520
Put your bag down.

389
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,400
Rammy.

390
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,800
Sing your best song.

391
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,120
Shake up

392
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,360
up.

393
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,120
Sing with me.

394
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,360
Rammy.

395
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,360
Drink some milk before you sing.

396
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,600
Have some watermelon.

397
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Mai Ba,

398
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
Take a rest.

399
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,360
You've sung five songs in a row.

400
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,400
You're risking your life for others' singing.

401
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,960
If you think my singing is bad, go ahead.

402
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,040
Go back and sit down.

403
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,480
I'll sing the next song for you.

404
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,000
Rammy.

405
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,360
Shall we sing a song together?

406
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,440
You sing so well.

407
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,080
I won't ruin the atmosphere.

408
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,080
I'm tired too.

409
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,600
Monitor

410
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,840
Is there any song you want to sing?

411
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,480
I won't sing.

412
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,240
I'm not good at singing.

413
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,400
Oh.

414
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,200
You can sing worse than me.

415
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,120
I'm the last.

416
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,720
I know.

417
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,080
Compared to her, we're all cosmic stars.

418
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,400
That's it.

419
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,120
I'll order a song that everyone can sing.

420
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,160
OK.

421
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,920
Hello, Mr. Dai.

422
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,080
Mr. Dai.

423
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,800
Don’t play ball.

424
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,600
Hello, Mr. Dai.

425
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,680
Good morning, Mr. Dai.

426
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,640
Xiammy, Ruotear.

427
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,440
Come here.

428
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,200
Help me.

429
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,000
Gosh.

430
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,000
Xiao Yu.

431
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,640
Are you setting up a stall?

432
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,880
You bought so many things.

433
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,600
Don't set up a stall.

434
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,560
These are all decorated in the class.

435
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,160
The New Year's Eve is in a few days.

436
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,240
Ms Qiao said

437
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,240
we have a new year theme

438
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,000
for the new year.

439
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,160
I can't decorate it all by myself.

440
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,080
Can you help me?

441
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,120
Sure.

442
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,720
I know you are the most loyal.

443
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,440
Let's go.

444
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,200
Let's go out for a walk.

445
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,560
What are you doing?

446
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,800
I'll sell you off. Do you dare?

447
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,640
Fine.

448
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,800
I'm not afraid.

449
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,160
Let's go.

450
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,320
Why are you so mysterious?

451
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,680
My first card the day after tomorrow.

452
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,720
I don't want anyone else's.

453
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,200
Oh.

454
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,480
And then?

455
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,640
Stop poking my head.

456
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,000
Can't you just say it?

457
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,600
Don't you know what day the day after tomorrow is?

458
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,240
The day after tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

459
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,800
What else can it be?

460
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:50,720
Two.

461
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,440
What a coincidence.

462
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,520
The day after tomorrow is also my birthday.

463
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,680
You said New Year's Eve is your birthday.

464
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,200
Really?

465
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,840
My QQ signature says

466
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,880
my birthday is December 31.

467
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,360
These words have been hung up for almost a week.

468
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,600
Haven't you noticed?

469
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,800
I've been busy reviewing

470
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,160
I haven't checked my phone much.

471
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,640
I'm sorry.

472
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,760
Now you know.

473
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,600
And then?

474
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,840
All right.

475
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,600
I'll give you the card, okay?

476
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,040
Your first card

477
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Slide.

478
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,560
Hurry up.

479
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
What?

480
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,120
It’s been a long time.

481
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,760
You said this is Slide?

482
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,520
Yes.

483
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,680
Let me show you.

484
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,320
It's fun.

485
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,560
Come and join us.

486
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,400
Are you scared, Ruoxi?

487
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,120
Go ahead and play.

488
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,480
Come with me.

489
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,160
Hurry up.

490
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,760
Why are you still...

491
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,560
Hurry.

492
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,880
Ms. Zhang Ruoxi.

493
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,600
Please.

494
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,200
You first.

495
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:35,840
Please.

496
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,760
I'll go first.

497
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,240
Okay.

498
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
One, two, three.

499
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,120
You pushed me.

500
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,400
What's wrong?

501
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,240
Are you hurt?

502
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,240
What's wrong?

503
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,440
What's wrong?

504
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,320
My pants.

505
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,520
a hole in my pants.

506
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,240
Laugh if you want.

507
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,000
I couldn't help it.

508
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,400
I have long johns inside.

509
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,920
What are you doing?

510
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,080
You've been careless all day.

511
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,000
You can even break your slippers.

512
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,600
Nothing is impossible.

513
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,120
Right?

514
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,400
Where are you going?

515
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,920
to help you solve this problem.

516
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,160
Ruoxi Zhang.

517
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,160
This is the ladies' room.

518
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,880
It's not good if no one is here.

519
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:26,920
It's okay.

520
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,960
What are you doing?

521
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,400
Hello, Ruoxi Zhang.

522
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,920
What are you doing, Ruoxi?

523
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,920
Put it on.

524
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,880
I'll go out soon.

525
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,720
Forget it.

526
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,120
My pants are too small for you to wear.

527
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
It's okay.

528
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,800
Aren't you afraid of the cold?

529
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,840
No.

530
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,520
You'll be embarrassed.

531
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,120
It's okay. I'm thick-skinned. I'm not afraid of being embarrassed.

532
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,960
If you keep dawdling,

533
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,280
That's not a matter of shame.

534
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,040
Someone will think I'm a pervert.

535
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,880
Hurry up.

536
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,840
Hurry up.

537
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,840
How about

538
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,480
we switch back?

539
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,560
We've changed.

540
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,639
Do you really want me to be treated as a pervert?

541
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,440
But...

542
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,120
I feel comfortable wearing this.

543
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,280
It's comfortable to breathe.

544
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,360
Maybe we can create a storm in fashion.

545
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
Really, look.

546
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,560
Don't...

547
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,880
Also,

548
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,880
You...

549
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,480
How about I cut one for you next time?

550
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,159
No.

551
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,920
You don't have to cut it down there.

552
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,920
It's so comfortable.

553
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,840
To be honest,

554
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,120
we should go back now.

555
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,320
The light will be out soon.

556
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,159
Okay let's go

557
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,960
Don't go back to the dorm during bedtime

558
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,640
Two people secretly

559
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,200
What are they doing?

560
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,640
Come on.

561
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,160
Tell me the truth.

562
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,200
Are you in love?

563
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,760
No.

564
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,960
It was a misunderstanding last night.

565
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,120
I can write a guarantee.

566
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,040
Now you're scared.

567
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,800
Don't worry.

568
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,280
No one can escape the guarantee.

569
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,680
2,000 words start.

570
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,880
Reflect on yourself.

571
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,080
Sir, we are not in a relationship.

572
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,720
because she's been under too much pressure lately.

573
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
She likes to go jogging in the playground after night study.

574
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,720
I followed her because I was worried.

575
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,360
Yes, sir.

576
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,360
I fell down when I was running last night.

577
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,240
There's a hole in my pants.

578
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,000
Ms. Jang was afraid I'd be embarrassed in my pants.

579
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,240
so she gave me her pants.

580
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,920
It's a waste of time to go back to the dorm.

581
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,800
Come on.

582
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,440
You stay out all night.

583
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,000
Puppy love.

584
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,240
You lied to me.

585
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,520
If everything is settled,

586
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,720
it won't be easy to write a guarantee.

587
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,200
You have to invite your parents to school.

588
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,680
Mr. Dai.

589
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,280
Mr. Dai, we really didn’t talk.

590
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,720
Shut up.

591
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,600
It's not true.

592
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,520
I beg you.

593
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,120
Mr Zhou Chuan.

594
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,160
What's wrong?

595
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,240
Ruotear.

596
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,960
My stomach hurts.

597
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,440
Sir.

598
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Can you send me to the infirmary?

599
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,480
Sir.

600
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,280
Can we take her to the infirmary first?

601
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,160
Health comes first.

602
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,040
Hurry up.

603
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,040
Thank you.

604
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,640
Be careful.

605
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,480
Ruoxi, you're a man. Carry her.

606
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,720
Slow down, Ruoxi Zhang.

607
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,400
We're almost there, Ruotear.

608
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,120
Xiammy.

609
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,360
Xia Mi, what's wrong?

610
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,440
Doctor.

611
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,200
Is she okay?

612
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,240
You don't need to take her to the hospital, right?

613
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,640
I'm much better, monitor.

614
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,240
Thank you.

615
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,720
She doesn't have to go to the hospital.

616
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,040
Her condition

617
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,640
Initial judgment is gastroenteritis caused by food allergy.

618
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,840
You can eat more light food these days.

619
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,760
Can we have some porridge?

620
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,440
Sure

621
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,880
You can have porridge and noodles.

622
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
I'll get you some medicine.

623
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,080
Thank you, doctor.

624
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,560
What did you eat?

625
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,080
Why are you suddenly allergic to food?

626
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,520
Maybe it's because of soy milk

627
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,960
Soy milk?

628
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,040
You know you're allergic to soy milk, but you still drink it.

629
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,520
Do you want to die?

630
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,760
I thought if I were better,

631
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
Mr. Dai can leave you alone.

632
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,440
Don’t eat greasy and spicy food these days.

633
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,280
I'll bring you some porridge back to the classroom.

634
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,000
Thank you, Ruoxi.

635
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,480
How about this?

636
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,560
Come to me if you need anything.

637
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,680
Are you cold?

638
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,840
I'll get you another quilt.

639
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,400
I'm fine. I'm much better.

640
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,120
Lin.

641
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,200
Thank you.

642
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Do you need help?

643
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,000
Please.

644
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,520
See?

645
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,920
Ruoxi is so sweet.

646
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,840
I want a good friend like her too.

647
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,000
Lin,

648
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,280
I came to help you because you helped me and Xia Mi once.

649
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,560
We owe you.

650
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,680
Ruoxi.

651
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,640
You don't have to be so polite to me.

652
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
I think it's better

653
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,320
to make things clear.

654
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,560
I don't want unnecessary misunderstandings.

655
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,360
Ruoxi.

656
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,640
If you have to cut ties with me,

657
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,160
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

658
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
Give me a New Year gift.

659
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,880
I'll give you one too.

660
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,560
No need.

661
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,680
You owe me this.

662
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
I can't refuse.
