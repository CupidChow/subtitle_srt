1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on

2
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,280
Can you pretend like this?

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,600
Why?

4
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,320
Fan Yuan.

5
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,320
Let's team up.

6
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,200
I want to team up with you.

7
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,720
Xiammy.

8
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,640
Ruoxi.

9
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,440
Let's team up.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,560
Sure.

11
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,960
Ruotear will join us.

12
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,280
It's not fair.

13
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,479
The five of you are a group.

14
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
None of us is a girl.

15
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
It's too sunny

16
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,520
And the monitor looks like a master

17
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,600
He can't win.

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,479
Liu Dayou.

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,479
What do you mean?

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,440
I'm not a girl.

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,800
What kind of girl are you?

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,080
Aren't you a man-in-law?

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,160
You...

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,880
Okay.

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,200
Can we do it with our hands?

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,320
The back of the hand.

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,120
Okay.

28
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,560
Okay. Okay.

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,000
[SO Ruoxi]

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,280
Ruoxi.

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,760
Didn't you see the lunar calendar today?

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,240
Team up with a rookie.

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,880
Don't drag us down.

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Who's holding us back?

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,640
I might be the best.

36
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,000
Be modest.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,320
You can hit one of them.

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,280
if you can hit one of them.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
Who are you looking down on?

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,280
Rookie.

41
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,720
Rammy.

42
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,320
Ruoxi.

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,200
You're too arrogant.

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,120
Do you really think our people are just decorations?

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,840
We're not vegetarians.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Fan Yuan is not qualified to shoot.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,079
So serious.

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
Don't blame me for not showing mercy later.

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,120
Of course I have to be serious in the game.

50
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,680
If you dare to go easy on me,

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,680
I'll tell everyone about your embarrassing childhood.

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,600
What embarrassing thing?

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,800
Tell us to make us happy.

54
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,640
Okay.

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,920
Let's have a serious battle later.

56
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,200
Bring it on!

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,600
Go.

58
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,240
Go.

59
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Let's go get the equipment.

60
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,320
We have no advantage in numbers.

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,640
So we need to take the lead.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,480
Xiao,

63
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,800
Be the vanguard later.

64
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,480
Amy.

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,400
Lin.

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,600
Follow us.

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,880
Aim as hard as you can.

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,600
Each of us can only get 20 bullets.

69
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,560
Protect your bullets and don't waste them.

70
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,000
Just call me

71
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,840
just call me Ruotear.

72
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,560
Ruo tears.

73
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,960
Stay behind me and I'll protect you.

74
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,800
I'll leave her to you later.

75
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,200
Am I a good friend?

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,520
What are you talking about?

77
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,880
Nothing.

78
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,840
will follow him

79
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,480
and let him protect you.

80
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
I don't need his protection.

81
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,280
I don't need to.

82
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
I've never played this game,

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,160
I'll try not to hold you back.

84
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,880
Okay.

85
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Let's go.

86
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,360
Listen.

87
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,000
We have the upper hand now.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,880
With Ruoxi's personality, he'll definitely attack first.

89
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,560
Yihang.

90
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,320
You're in my team.

91
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:08,760
Okay.

92
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,960
Together.

93
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,920
The other three

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,920
guard ahead.

95
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,080
When we get the fire,

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,920
you can come out and attack.

97
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,840
OK.

98
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,120
Let's go.

99
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,280
Are you okay?

100
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,200
Yes.

101
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,560
Surround!

102
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,440
Xiao Junyi.

103
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,240
Ruotear.

104
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:58,600
Let's split up.

105
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,240
Okay, I'll go that way.

106
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,040
Go.

107
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,680
Monitor!

108
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,760
Are you going to kill me from the start?

109
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,640
Are you okay?

110
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm fine.

111
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,080
I surrender.

112
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,800
Surprised?

113
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,159
Surprised?

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,880
Run! I'll cover you.

115
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,880
Lin Ruotear is out.

116
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,280
Fan Yuan.

117
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,280
Should we chase after Zhang Ruoxi?

118
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,760
Forget it.

119
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,640
Let's eliminate the others first.

120
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,120
Okay.

121
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,440
Wang Xiao Yu.

122
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,080
I lost to you in the midterms.

123
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,720
I won't lose to you.

124
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,640
Surrender if you know your place.

125
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Xiao Junyi.

126
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,080
You didn't rinse your mouth?

127
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,000
You talk big.

128
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,880
Liu Dayou.

129
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,960
Are you still alive?

130
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,280
Help me out.

131
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,000
Grandmaster.

132
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,920
I'm here.

133
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,080
Who's there?

134
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,800
Let's go.

135
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,120
Liu Dayou is out.

136
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,040
Grandmaster,

137
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,080
Is this how you treat your comrade?

138
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,720
Don't you feel cold?

139
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,080
I was in a hurry.

140
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,800
I'll take it as you did a good job protecting His Majesty.

141
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,920
I'll avenge you.

142
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,520
Revenge?

143
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,960
Mind your own business.

144
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
Xiao Junyi, are you a man?

145
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,960
There is no gender in war.

146
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,120
All is fair in war.

147
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,159
Come here.

148
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,360
Monitor, hit him.

149
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
Xiao Junyi is out.

150
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,280
No.

151
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,640
You're out. Why are you pulling me?

152
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,680
Who's pulling you?

153
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,960
I was beaten by my own people.

154
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,320
We're not eliminated.

155
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,880
If you didn't catch me just now,

156
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,240
they would have been eliminated.

157
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,680
Xiao Junyi, are you reasonable?

158
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,120
You were eliminated first.

159
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,000
I saw someone coming.

160
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
What should I do?

161
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,400
Come here.

162
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,760
Lower your voice.

163
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,040
You threw the gun away.

164
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,720
It's already dangerous.

165
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,559
What if I don't do it

166
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,360
It's cold.

167
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,200
Keep quiet.

168
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,080
There's a bug.

169
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,240
What?

170
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,920
Take it away. Don't laugh.

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,480
You really believe it?

172
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,880
You believe that?

173
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,600
Are you stupid?

174
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,360
Someone's here.

175
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,520
A bug!

176
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,720
Stop it.

177
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,680
There are really bugs.

178
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,840
Are you afraid of bugs?

179
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,040
No, I just hate them.

180
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,720
Really?

181
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,000
Such a poor acting.

182
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,600
Look how cute it is.

183
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,040
Such a poor acting.

184
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,680
Ruoxi Zhang is out.

185
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,720
Ruoxi, you're out.

186
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,680
Fan Yuan is out.

187
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,840
We won.

188
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,320
I was careless.

189
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,840
Rammy is out.

190
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,640
It's too early to be happy.

191
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,720
Forget about us.

192
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,880
Fan Yuan, we won.

193
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,640
What's wrong with you guys?

194
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,280
Especially Wang Xiao Yu. Why are you walking so slowly?

195
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,120
It doesn't matter.

196
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,560
You lost.

197
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,960
We agreed

198
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
You'll be on duty for a week.

199
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,640
What's wrong with you?

200
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,840
We put all our hopes on you.

201
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,960
What?

202
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,680
Are you acting?

203
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
So many bags.

204
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,480
Who did this?

205
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,640
Who else could it be

206
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,560
who else could it be?

207
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,600
You really don't show me any mercy.

208
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,320
Didn't you say

209
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,200
there are no brothers on the battlefield.

210
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,600
You have no mercy either.

211
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,400
Does your back really hurt?

212
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,960
Yes.

213
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,600
I think I need a human crutch.

214
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,840
I'll ask you more.

215
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,400
You're exaggerating.

216
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,920
Fan Yuan was hit too. It's not like you.

217
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,520
But it still hurts

218
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,800
it still hurts.

219
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,800
It's all to save us.

220
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,080
I'll buy you safflower oil later.

221
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,880
It's okay.

222
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,560
I'm used to bruises.

223
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,680
I'm used to it.

224
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,440
Ruo tears.

225
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,440
I think you should go back and apply it.

226
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,120
Sorry.

227
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,200
I was too serious and too fierce.

228
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,920
It was a bit fierce, monitor.

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,720
Do you think you're a pea princess?

230
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,680
It's better than me.

231
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,880
I didn't shoot a single shot.

232
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,000
Can you please care about me?

233
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,880
I was caught as a human sandbag.

234
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,920
I'm the miserable one.

235
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,600
Let's go.

236
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,680
Let's go.

237
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,200
Let's find another place to compete, okay?

238
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,240
No, no, no.

239
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,040
I'll go too.

240
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,240
Don't be a coward.

241
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,920
Come on. One more round.

242
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,400
Sure. Let's go.

243
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,520

SNIPER ELITE

246
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,840
Left. There's something weird on the left.

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,320
Up there.

248
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,480
[SNIPER ELIT]

249
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,640
Good luck, Ruoxi.

250
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,160
Good luck, Class Rep!

251
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160

3,600 points.

254
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
What do you think, handsome?

255
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,440
Monitor, you're amazing.

256
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,680
You're a marksman.

257
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,400
Someone will buy the milk tea.

258
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,080
I think Ruoxi is amazing.

259
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,680
Of course.

260
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,680
You were talking just now.

261
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,000
That's why I lost this game.

262
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,040
It's all your fault.

263
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,200
Let's play again.

264
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,240
You're not as good as others. You still don't admit you're cheating?

265
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,720
What do you mean?

266
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,000
Fan Yuan won 49.

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,760
You lost one more game than my 50 wins.

268
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,360
Really?

269
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,760
I remember I won this round.

270
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,200
It's about 50 rounds.

271
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,120
No way.

272
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,080
Did you forget we played water gun in the water park during summer vacation?

273
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,240
I was already 50 then.

274
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,200
Ruoxi Zhang.

275
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,600
If a water gun can be counted,

276
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,960
shouldn't the real CS

277
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,080
Should I count it in?

278
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,000
If that's the case,

279
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,320
You're attacking me.

280
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,600
You can't do that.

281
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,600
Wait.

282
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,040
You've played 100 rounds together.

283
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,320
Have you been fighting since elementary school?

284
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,240
You really knew each other in elementary school?

285
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,000
I was in the same hospital as him.

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
But when we were really close,

287
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,360
when we were in the first grade.

288
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,400
How did you get close?

289
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,080
Because of a blanket, because of a nickname

290
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,760
Isn't it because

291
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,440
when I was taking a nap?

292
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,680
He was very helpful at that time.

293
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,600
He shared a blanket with me during lunch break.

294
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,920
I reluctantly accepted him.

295
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,440
Someone gave me a nickname then.

296
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,000
[Jang Ruoxi beat him up without saying anything.]

297
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,640
You must've been beaten up by your dad a lot.

298
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
Of course.

299
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,320
You told me that a gentleman shouldn't fight.

300
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,880
But you just stood up and punched others for nothing.

301
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,560
I'm teaching you how to be a human.

302
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
At that time,

303
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,560
I did get a little higher than you.

304
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,920
So I think I should take care of you.

305
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,800
You said I can give it for free.

306
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,080
But I was the first in the mid-term exam.

307
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,720
You were in your 20s.

308
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,080
How could you do that?

309
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,360
I ranked 20th in my class.

310
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,120
Your first place is the first in the class.

311
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,960
Are you not convinced?

312
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,760
Of course not.

313
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm not convinced.

314
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,920
Show me the basketball player. Go.

315
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Right away.

316
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,640
Let's go.

317
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,680
Xia.

318
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,440
Don't pick me up.

319
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,520
I'll be home soon.

320
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,120
I'm not a three-year-old.

321
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,360
I'm hanging up.

322
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,680
Alright.

323
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,160
Where do you live?

324
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,280
I'll take you home by taxi.

325
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,400
I'm fine. I'll take the bus soon.

326
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,680
Ruo tears.

327
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,520
Where do you live?

328
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,680
I'm fine.

329
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,440
I might go to my aunt's house today.

330
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,760
At school.

331
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,760
School?

332
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,680
You and the monitor are on the way.

333
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,800
You can ride together.

334
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,080
We're in the opposite direction.

335
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,640
I can take a taxi.

336
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,320
Okay.

337
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:48,840
Ruo tears.

338
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,120
Let me send you back.

339
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,840
Okay.

340
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,600
Let me know when you get home.

341
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,080
You go first.

342
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,760
I'll take the next one.

343
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,720
Tell me when you get home.

344
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,200
Bye.

345
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,800
Tell me when you arrive.

346
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,560
Bye.

347
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,480
Be careful.

348
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Bye.

349
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,040
Let's go our separate ways

350
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,480
Let's go home and find our own moms.

351
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,480
Why are you...

352
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,280
What?

353
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,560
You're the only one who can get on.

354
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,840
Thank you for your kindness.

355
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,160
But there are many people on the road. It's safe.

356
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,560
You don't have to send me home.

357
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,599
Don't flatter yourself.

358
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,520
I'm afraid you'll make others unsafe.

359
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,319
I'm here to protect others.

360
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,440
Who will protect you?

361
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,160
You can donate if you can't use your mouth.

362
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,000
See? I told you.

363
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,400
I'm glad I followed you.

364
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,480
Otherwise, I don't know who's the unlucky one.

365
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,880
I was just kidding.

366
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,840
Don't be so petty.

367
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,480
Which station are you at?

368
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,960
Nanmen Old Alley Station.

369
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,120
What station?

370
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,800
Nanmen Old Alley Station.

371
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,000
There are more than ten stops left.

372
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,240
Let's listen to some music and take a break.

373
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,480
Xiang V 5H379.

374
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Actually,

375
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,840
I lied to you

376
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,880
was a lie.

377
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,280
Are you sure?

378
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,360
Do you want me to take you downstairs?

379
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,520
No, monitor.

380
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,720
This is my aunt's house.

381
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,680
Okay.

382
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,040
Monitor.

383
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,720
Can you pay first?

384
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,920
I'll pay you back after school.

385
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,080
It's okay.

386
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,000
It's on the way.

387
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,680
It's a lot of money for me to go home alone.

388
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,040
Thank you, Class Rep.

389
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,640
Bye.

390
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,680
Tell me when you arrive.

391
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,240
Okay.

392
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,000
Good night.

393
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,400
Bye. Bye.

394
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,760
Let's go, sir.

395
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,960
Hello, Mom.

396
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
I'll go home tomorrow.

397
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,520
I said I have something to do.

398
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,680
Someone is in the dorm.

399
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,640
Don't worry.

400
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,080
Ruotear, are you at your aunt's house?

401
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,840
It seems to be windy tonight.

402
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,280
Remember to wear thicker tomorrow. Don't catch a cold.

403
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,120
Okay, you should wear more.

404
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,040
Cheer up, everyone.

405
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,040
Next, please answer

406
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,440
the last line of the lyrics.

407
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,200
The love is deep

408
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,640
The deep mountains shine on the deep autumn rain

409
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,160
in the deep mountains?

410
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,720
What trick did you use?

411
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,480
Fan Yuan.

412
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,400
Answer me.

413
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,040
What's your last sentence?

414
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,600
It's

415
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,160
the whole word.

416
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,920
to express your feelings.

417
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,120
How deep is your love?

418
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,200
Ask with love

419
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,920
In the deep mountains, the sun shines deep in autumn and rain

420
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,760
Answer with the view

421
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,760
Two landscapes exuded a sad atmosphere.

422
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,760
The lyrics are comprehensive.

423
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,400
The feeling of loneliness.

424
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,440
Good answer.

425
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,160
Sit down

426
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,080
Monitor

427
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,240
Pull yourself together in class.

428
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,520
Sorry, teacher.

429
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
You just promised me

430
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,360
to protect the momentum of the red flag.

431
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,000
It's only the first class. How can you be so relaxed?

432
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,680
Focus and cheer up.

433
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,920
Mr Qiao.

434
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,360
Liu Dayou farted.

435
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,920
Open the window.

436
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,800
Don't exaggerate.

437
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,280
Liu Dayou, you're so wicked.

438
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
Are you trying to poison me

439
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,880
and inherit my position?

440
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,240
I just want to cheer you up

441
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,560
so I wanted to cheer you up.

442
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,320
Mr Qiao.

443
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,680
Are you all awake?

444
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,600
Liu Dayou.

445
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,680
You're more shameless than the wall.

446
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,520
Mr Qiao.

447
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,000
Kick him out.

448
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,400
It stinks.

449
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,120
Don't fan me.

450
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
Liu Dayou,

451
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,640
I appreciate your kindness.

452
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,440
But if this happens again,

453
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,280
you can say hello

454
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,680
and prepare yourself for your classmates.

455
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,840
OK.

456
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:53,960
Two.

457
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,280
Okay, let's continue.

458
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,480
Class dismissed.

459
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,160
Stand up.

460
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,280
Thank you.

461
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,320
Okay, let's go.

462
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,920
Fan Yuan.

463
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,520
Come to my office.

464
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,320
Okay.

465
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,840
Monitor.

466
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,760
Xiammy.

467
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,960
Are you not feeling well?

468
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,560
No.

469
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,200
I just feel a little hot.

470
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,120
Just ice it.

471
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,600
Do you have a fever?

472
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,240
Shall I go to the infirmary with you?

473
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,960
You don't have a fever. Don't worry.

474
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,800
Don't force yourself.

475
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,880
First, you are yourself.

476
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,080
The second is the monitor.

477
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,560
Don't think you're just a monitor

478
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,000
You don't even need to see a doctor.

479
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,040
I don't think he has a fever.

480
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,800
By the way,

481
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,320
Did Ms Qiao criticize you?

482
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,120
No.

483
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,120
She just told me

484
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,000
to get ready.

485
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,960
I'm going to the pediatric knowledge competition in two weeks.

486
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,080
Don't you have a math competition?

487
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,840
Why is there another one?

488
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,800
The Education Bureau

489
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,360
to improve your learning interest.

490
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,080
It's a fun competition.

491
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
There's no pressure.

492
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,000
Each class has to send a representative

493
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,560
As the representative of our class,

494
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,120
I should at least get a good result, right?

495
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,240
What's wrong?

496
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,600
I was thinking...

497
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,240
you're really strong.

498
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,120
When can I be like you

499
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,680
like you.

500
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,280
I think

501
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,320
Actually,

502
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,680
it's not necessarily a good thing to be trusted.

503
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,040
Living in the expectations of others

504
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,040
Sometimes it's tiring.

505
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,280
It's better than being disliked by everyone.

506
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,080
Besides,

507
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,480
don't take everything on yourself.

508
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,040
You can share it with your friends.

509
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,680
Like me.

510
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,440
Although I can't help you with a big favor,

511
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
but I can still support you.

512
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,320
and material support.

513
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,560
As long as I have pocket money,

514
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,560
I do need your help.

515
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,360
What?

516
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,320
I'm going to the library this afternoon

517
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,440
to borrow some encyclopedia.

518
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,880
There are a lot.

519
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,800
Please help me.

520
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm a deer.

521
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,440
A deer who is good at finding books.

522
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,440
Leave it to me.

523
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,840
What deer?

524
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,480
You're just a stupid pig.

525
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,360
Zhang Ruoxi.

526
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,560
Your mouth will be sealed by glue sooner or later.

527
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,080
Are you okay?

528
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,920
I couldn't find you anywhere today.

529
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,280
Did Ms Qiao say anything about you?

530
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,600
How did I find it at once?

531
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
It's because someone didn't look for it.

532
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
It's okay.

533
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,440
Mr Qiao asked me to go to the office to inform me

534
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,520
to participate in the Baidia Knowledge Competition in two weeks.

535
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,600
You didn't criticize me.

536
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,160
Don't you have a math competition?

537
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,080
Why is there another one?

538
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,080
Why are you laughing?

539
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,880
It's none of your business.

540
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,880
Class is about to start.

541
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,520
Let's go.

542
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,600
Okay, class begins.

543
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,600
What are you laughing at?

544
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,760
Tell me.

545
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,440
Tell me.

546
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,080
What is it?

547
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,640
What is it?

548
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,560
Ruotear.

549
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,120
Can you take a look at this face cream?

550
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,440
My mom told me this is imported.

551
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,360
But I always feel that she was cheated.

552
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,600
Can I open it?

553
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,040
Xiao Yu.

554
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,160
Your mother is really willing to

555
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,920
This face cream costs hundreds of yuan.

556
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,040
Really?

557
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,240
The sun is rising from the west.

558
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,520
Mother is so nice to me this time.

559
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,120
It smells really good.

560
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,880
Thank you, Ruotear.

561
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,840
Hello, Miss Xiammy.

562
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,440
I'm Xing Zhou, editor of Xin Literature Magazine.

563
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,840
Congratulations on passing your manuscript.

564
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,520
the Youth Cup Tournament.

565
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,520
Xia Mi, what's wrong?

566
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,200
Are you okay?

567
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm fine.

568
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,760
I'll talk to you later.

569
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,160
I need to reply a message.

570
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,840
Sir.

571
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,280
Come in.

572
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,440
What's wrong with Ms Qiao?

573
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,520
Here's the thing.

574
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
The school wants to make a promotional video

575
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,200
on an official website.

576
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,440
and chose our class as the representative.

577
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,880
I know you've done some charity commercial before.

578
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,880
You have a lot of acting experience.

579
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,960
So I want to ask you

580
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,400
if you're willing to be the male lead.

581
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,520
Sure, no problem.

582
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,640
It's my honor.

583
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
When will we shoot?

584
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,920
The time hasn't been set yet.

585
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,960
But it won't affect your study.

586
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,800
This is a general time plan. You can take a look.

587
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,360
Okay.

588
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,040
May I ask if the female lead has been decided?

589
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,400
Not yet.

590
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,520
Actually, I think you're quite good.

591
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,120
Why don't you consider it?

592
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,000
Okay.

593
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,280
How about this?

594
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,160
Send me the photo.

595
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,560
Okay.

596
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,040
Okay.

597
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,680
Thank you.

598
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,520
Go.

599
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,600
OK. I’m leaving.

600
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,280
Go.

601
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,160
Here are the test papers.

602
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,720
Okay.

603
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,160
I'm going back to the classroom.

604
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,680
Go.

605
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,600
This way.

606
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,080
Let's go.

607
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,640
I remember

608
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,000
in my English class,

609
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,160
in my English class.

610
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,800
Really?

611
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
Let's pick her.

612
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,400
Sir.

613
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,680
This is yesterday's English homework.

614
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,920
Thank you.

615
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,960
Ruotear.

616
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,560
Don't bother. You're a good boy.

617
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,240
But I can do my own thing.

618
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,880
Thank you.

619
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,840
Sir.

620
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,040
I don't mean anything else.

621
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,400
I didn't mean anything else.

622
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,160
Ruotear, you can go back to class first.

623
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,640
She was good at Chinese before.

624
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,920
Her English is good too.

625
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,760
Teacher

626
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,760
Actually, I've been in a campus promotional video since middle school.

627
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,240
Sure.

628
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,000
You can send us the video you took before.

629
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,040
We'll think about it.

630
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,160
OK.

631
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,920
The girls in our class are so good.

632
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,200
Yes.

633
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,520
They're all excellent.

634
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,000
It's hard to choose.

635
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,440
Why do you have to talk here?

636
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,320
The monitor is waiting for me in the classroom.

637
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,800
You asked him to tutor again?

638
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,040
No.

639
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,639
Monitor, aren't you going to the Baidia Knowledge Competition?

640
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,600
We agreed to look for books in the library.

641
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,120
Fan Yuan needs your help.

642
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,679
You're just causing trouble.

643
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,120
Are you looking down on me?

644
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,480
The monitor invited me.

645
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,040
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

646
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,040
By the way, I...

647
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
Didn't I submit my manuscript two days ago?

648
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,400
The editor texted me yesterday.

649
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,320
My first draft has been approved.

650
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,239
It'll be published next month.

651
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,800
Not bad, great writer.

652
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,280
If you become famous,

653
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
remember to sign more autographs for me.

654
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,120
I'll tell everyone

655
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,880
this great author named Rammy

656
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,520
is my best friend in high school.

657
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,639
This is too much.

658
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,040
I just passed the first trial.

659
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,600
I may not win the award.

660
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,880
I need to revise the script.

661
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,040
Yes.

662
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,480
We don't know what's going on.

663
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,800
You can do it.

664
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,880
Have you forgotten the luck I gave you?

665
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,840
I said you'll win the award.

666
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,080
I'm sure you'll win.

667
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,040
Really.

668
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,320
I will win the award.

669
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Let me tell you another good news.

670
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,400
For the sake of this news,

671
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,320
let’s forget

672
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,560
with you.

673
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,320
OK?

674
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,280
What is it?

675
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,960
The school is shooting a promotional video.

676
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,640
Ms Qiao asked me to be the male lead.

677
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,800
The female lead?

678
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I recommended you.

679
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,800
Who wants to do the promotional video with you?

680
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,440
Okay.

681
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,960
I'll tell Ms Qiao that you're not suitable.

682
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,640
I thought that the promotional video could increase the operating points,

683
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,440
Someone can also gain more experience in writing

684
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,880
and experience of life.

685
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm afraid the bigger the expectations, the bigger the disappointment.

686
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,680
I'm not the type to show off.

687
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,440
I just want to experience someone's life.

688
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,160
You know this is very important

689
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,360
to write.

690
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:23,960
Yes.

691
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:24,680
Yes.

692
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,600
You don't care how many operational points you get anyway.

693
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,800
Zhang Ruoxi.

694
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,400
Will you die if you don't say anything?

695
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
Shut your mouth.

696
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,240
Stop laughing.

697
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,800
Smile.

698
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,240
What are you two doing around here?

699
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,280
Is it puppy love?

700
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,400
Stop right there!

701
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,280
My shoes.

702
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,800
Get on my back.

703
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,240
I can't walk on my own.

704
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,440
Don't drag me down.

705
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,280
