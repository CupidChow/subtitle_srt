1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,800
Every year,

3
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,280
I can cure some of you

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,759
And those with bad physique.

5
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,000
Come out at once.

6
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,400
I'll treat you all.

7
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,880
Xiammy.

8
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,120
Are you okay?

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,400
Sergeant.

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,280
I'm the monitor.

11
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
I'll take her to the infirmary.

12
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,920
Hurry up.

13
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,520
It's nothing serious.

14
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,680
I think he has hypoglycemia due to skipping breakfast.

15
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,840
It happened in military training in the past.

16
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,320
I'll give you some glucose.

17
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,560
Thank you, doctor.

18
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,640
Doctor, be gentle.

19
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,920
You have to eat something later.

20
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,040
I can't leave my stomach empty.

21
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Young man, go buy her something to eat.

22
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,240
Okay.

23
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,760
Thank you.

24
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,600
Natmmy.

25
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,120
Is there anything you want to eat?

26
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,840
I'll buy it for you.

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,880
Thank you.

28
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,000
It's okay.

29
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,000
Have some.

30
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,120
Listen to the doctor.

31
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,080
Actually,

32
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,920
I want to eat chicken.

33
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,800
Is there any chicken in the canteen?

34
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,360
No problem.

35
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll buy you another bowl of porridge.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,640
It's good for your stomach.

37
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,480
Thank you, monitor.

38
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
The temperature difference outside is huge.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
Don't catch a cold if you're hungry.

40
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,280
Take a rest here.

41
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,200
Wait for me.

42
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,280
Thank you, monitor.

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,880
I didn't bring my phone.

44
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,200
So boring.

45
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,360
So slow.

46
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,240
How long will it take for me to finish it?

47
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,240
Fan Yuan.

48
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,960
Fan Yuan.

49
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,240
Fan Yuan.

50
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,320
Fan Yuan.

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,760
You again?

52
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,160
You know the six-vein sword?

53
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,560
Why do I always run into him when I'm embarrassed?

54
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,520
Did I blow up his roof in my previous life?

55
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,160
Why are you...

56
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Haven't you finished yet?

57
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,880
Why did you take it off?

58
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,120
I'll ask the doctor to fix it for you.

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,920
Don't...

60
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,240
You're the best.

61
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,640
It's all glucose anyway.

62
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,000
It's faster than this

63
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,240
Awesome.

64
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,920
There were a lot of people in line just now.

65
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,000
Sorry I'm late.

66
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,440
Ruoxi.

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,760
Why are you here?

68
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,720
Well,

69
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,440
The instructor saw you haven't been back for a long time.

70
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,600
Let me have a look.

71
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,120
She has low blood sugar.

72
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,200
The doctor asked me to buy her breakfast.

73
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,520
I'll go back to training later.

74
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,000
Come on.

75
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,280
See if you like it.

76
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,320
Thank you Monitor

77
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,800
This is the smell.

78
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,880
That's you.

79
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,880
It's such a big bottle. It's already finished?

80
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,480
She didn't finish it.

81
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,080
She is...

82
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,720
She is...

83
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,720
Shut up.

84
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,800
Finished.

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,080
It's glucose.

86
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,440
What if something else

87
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,880
What if something goes wrong?

88
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,640
Okay.

89
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,320
Okay.

90
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,520
Are you still training today?

91
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,840
I feel much better after the drip.

92
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,360
But

93
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,600
I still feel dizzy.

94
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,400
You were still weak

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,080
when you drank just now.

96
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,280
Look, he's coughing.

97
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,640
My heart is beating fast.

98
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,760
Drink it.

99
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,280
Don't go to training today.

100
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,680
I'll ask the doctor to give you a leave.

101
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,680
Really?

102
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,800
Monitor, you're really a good person.

103
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,680
Then...

104
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,840
Thank you.

105
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,200
Okay, drink it.

106
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,760
Doctor.

107
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,919
Don't expose me.

108
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,000
It depends on my mood.

109
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,640
Well, Natmmy,

110
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,880
It's dangerous to remove the IV without permission.

111
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,440
You have to be serious.

112
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,240
Don't do it again.

113
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,440
Doctor.

114
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,360
I think she looks quite strong.

115
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,200
It won't take a whole day.

116
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,880
But

117
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,080
some girls just look strong,

118
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,480
but they are actually quite weak.

119
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
A whole day is safer.

120
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,200
Are you going to take leave or not?

121
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,760
Yes.

122
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,520
Thank you, doctor.

123
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,360
Congratulations. You can sleep in peace.

124
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,240
Don't think I don't know

125
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
You're up to no good.

126
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
Can you really do it alone?

127
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,240
Do you want me to stay with you?

128
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,960
No.

129
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,960
Go back to the military training.

130
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
It's not good if the instructor gets angry later.

131
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,280
I’ll take a rest.

132
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,680
If you need anything,

133
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
ask the doctor immediately, okay?

134
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,240
Let's go, Ruoxi.

135
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,920
Why are you still here?

136
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,760
Miss Xiammy,

137
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,240
Fan Yuan and I asked for your leave for you.

138
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,440
Do you want to thank us?

139
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,520
If you don't interrupt,

140
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,320
I've already approved my leave.

141
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,440
You should thank our monitor.

142
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,840
Cut.

143
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,840
Let's go.

144
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,400
Bye, Xiammy.

145
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,640
Baby

146
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,040
[Solo Meal]

147
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,200
Tears.

148
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,400
Don't worry. I'm fine.

149
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,440
I just have low blood sugar.

150
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,800
You didn't come all day.

151
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,960
How can I not be worried?

152
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,240
Do you still feel dizzy?

153
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,920
I'm fully recovered.

154
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,640
I'll go to the hot water room to make you a glass of brown sugar water.

155
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,360
No need, Ruotear.

156
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,840
Drink it.

157
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,560
Thank you.

158
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,560
By the way, I brought you this.

159
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,160
I also prepared this for you.

160
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,000
You won't have hypoglycemia tomorrow.

161
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,880
You're so nice.

162
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,920
Go sit down.

163
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,040
You must be more tired than me during the military training.

164
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,680
I’m not tired of today’s training.

165
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,120
What do you mean?

166
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,520
It's so big.

167
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,520
Crouch down?

168
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,480
Stand up.

169
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,600
Stop the intermediate change.

170
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,920
Creeping forward.

171
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,000
This is training us to be bodyguards.

172
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,240
Exactly.

173
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,280
So complicated.

174
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,400
I won't be able to catch up tomorrow.

175
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,760
It's okay.

176
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
The movements are simple.

177
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,440
I'll teach you tomorrow.

178
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,600
Ruotear.

179
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,960
You're really an angel.

180
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,440
No, it's not that easy.

181
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,680
Several students made mistakes today.

182
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,680
Especially Zhao Rui.

183
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,240
He can't tell right from wrong.

184
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,760
The instructor almost fainted.

185
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,360
Right.

186
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,360
And Xiao Junyi and Liu Dayou.

187
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,320
The instructor said turn left.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,920
They just face to face.

189
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,360
Xiao Junyi almost made me laugh.

190
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,120
Actually, I think Zhao Rui is fine.

191
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,800
As for Liu Dayou,

192
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,400
When Liu Dayou rushed forward,

193
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,400
He said,

194
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,680
He said...

195
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,440
Why are you holding it back?

196
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,360
Smile.

197
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,160
Take me back to my dorm.

198
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,640
He said...

199
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
What did he say?

200
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,800
Nothing.

201
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,560
His pants are torn.

202
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm so mad. I shouldn't have asked for leave.

203
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,080
I missed so many good things.

204
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,280
I still have chicken.

205
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,520
Tell me more.

206
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,720
What else?

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,040
Who else?

208
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,760
I've taught you the key points of the front step.

209
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,120
Next,

210
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,120
Let's walk together.

211
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,280
Attention.

212
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,280
Walk straight.

213
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,480
Two.

214
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Look right.

215
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,480
Oh no.

216
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,600
My facial features are disobedient.

217
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,720
What are you doing, Rammy?

218
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,520
Change it.

219
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,640
I don't know.

220
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,280
I have my own ideas.

221
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,000
What are you doing?

222
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,400
Why are you walking like this?

223
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Halt.

224
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,280
The instructor is getting angry again.

225
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,600
What are you doing?

226
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,880
Is it a biochemical crisis?

227
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,200
Still laughing?

228
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,960
The one who laughs the loudest.

229
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,760
You.

230
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,440
Fall out.

231
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,720
I’ll give you time to smile.

232
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,840
Sorry, sir.

233
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,920
I was wrong.

234
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,240
Watch your language.

235
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,440
Why do you learn Hong Kong cavity?

236
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,120
Sorry, sir. I was wrong.

237
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,880
Fall in.

238
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,960
You just walked like that.

239
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,960
How dare you be happy?

240
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,920
Your school leaders will check you.

241
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,720
just wait to make a fool of yourself.

242
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,760
The first row.

243
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,320
The first and the second girl.

244
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,000
Fall out.

245
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,400
Right away.

246
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,360
It's fine that you made a mistake,

247
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,400
but you interact with each other and affect other.

248
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
Be serious during training.

249
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,120
Are you ignoring this?

250
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,760
Sir,

251
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
I made the mistake first.

252
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,040
Please punish me alone.

253
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,960
Do you think you are loyal?

254
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,080
You are a group.

255
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,400
Together. Together.

256
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,200
One loss and one loss.

257
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,400
Do you think

258
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,040
by criticising you alone?

259
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,920
Sir,

260
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,760
I think you can't solve any problem even if you keep criticizing them.

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It’s better to help them adjust.

262
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,320
You, fall out.

263
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,040
Are you teaching me?

264
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,800
Sir,

265
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,840
I didn't mean that.

266
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,400
It's just a reasonable suggestion.

267
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,960
Suggestions?

268
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,720
Sure.

269
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,200
What's your name?

270
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,280
You are so good at teaching.

271
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,640
Why don't you teach me?

272
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,400
Sergeant,

273
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
My name is Ruoxi Zhang.

274
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,160
If you allow me,

275
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm willing to help.

276
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:21,840
Okay.

277
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,040
Then you teach me.

278
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,000
I want to see how you will teach me.

279
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,920
Yes, sir.

280
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,600
Can I talk to them?

281
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,080
Go.

282
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,080
You're really the top one.

283
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,880
We could have gone back if we were scolded.

284
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,680
Now we have to show off in front of the whole class.

285
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,160
What are you up to?

286
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,960
Don't worry.

287
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,160
I never do things I'm not sure of.

288
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,800
I can teach you.

289
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,880
Are you that good?

290
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,440
Are you hiding something?

291
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,880
Am I so immoral?

292
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,360
You'll know if you try later.

293
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,800
Ruoxi,

294
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,920
I'll leave it to you later.

295
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,680
You made a mistake just now.

296
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,600
because the instructor was too loud.

297
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,400
and scared you.

298
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,240
And you wanted to correct her.

299
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,960
because you wanted to correct her.

300
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,119
Am I right?

301
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,599
That's easy.

302
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,280
As long as your nervousness is solved,

303
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,359
you won't make any more mistakes.

304
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,599
When the instructor shouts the command,

305
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,560
Don't look at him.

306
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,359
Look at the clouds in the sky.

307
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,800
or the trees.

308
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,640
Don't think about him.

309
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,520
And Lin, don't pay attention to her anymore.

310
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,119
You can think whatever you want.

311
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,040
Sir.

312
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,720
Yes.

313
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,120
Come here.

314
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,160
So fast.

315
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,000
That's it?

316
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,760
Please check the result.

317
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,960
OK.

318
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,640
One more time.

319
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,040
If you make another mistake,

320
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,960
you'll stand up for an hour.

321
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,720
You...

322
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,960
Run ten laps as punishment.

323
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,600
Return!

324
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,440
Yes, sir.

325
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,000
Go straight.

326
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,640
One, two, one.

327
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,920
One, two, one.

328
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,120
Look right.

329
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,880
One, two, one.

330
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,480
One, two.

331
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,120
One, two, one.

332
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,000
Two, one.

333
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,720
One, two, one.

334
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,000
Halt.

335
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,440
You did well this time.

336
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,000
I approve of Zhang Ruoxi's teaching results.

337
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,160
Thank you, sir.

338
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,880
But

339
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,920
This is not the reason for you to decide on your own.

340
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,240
Military training requires absolute discipline.

341
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,080
I don't want you to mess around.

342
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,840
and individualism.

343
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,960
You should be punished.

344
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,960
Next,

345
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,840
All of you.

346
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,040
Stand in position.

347
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,040
Half an hour.

348
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,720
Oh.

349
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,840
I forgot my glass. I'll go get it.

350
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,160
Just wait for me.

351
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,880
Rammy.

352
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,080
How do you know this is my cup?

353
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,520
I saw you use it once this morning.

354
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,080
You left it on the basketball court, right?

355
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,800
Wow

356
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,000
You'll remember once you see it.

357
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,760
You have such a good memory.

358
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,880
Yes.

359
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
Thanks to his good memory.

360
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,960
I didn't forget

361
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,960
I didn't forget him.

362
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,640
Really?

363
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,880
You smart students are really different from us mortals.

364
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,280
I wish I had this superpower too.

365
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,640
Xiammy.

366
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,760
We used to be

367
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,160
Xia Mi.

368
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,040
Class monitor Rong has left.

369
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,240
Let's go eat.

370
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,520
I'm starving.

371
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,440
Right away

372
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,520
Monitor you just wanted to say

373
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,720
Nothing.

374
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,400
Thank you for your training this afternoon.

375
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,480
Let's go eat.

376
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,560
Let's go

377
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:29,960
Thank you, monitor.

378
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,960
You're welcome.

379
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,160
Forget it.

380
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,720
Next time.

381
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,120
This military training is so torturing.

382
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,840
They either stand or scold each day.

383
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,320
I really can't live a day

384
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,200
Almost.

385
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,160
The performance is in two days.

386
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Hang in there.

387
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,280
No, I want meat.

388
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
I'm going to buy some meat.

389
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,040
Do you want some?

390
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,760
I want it.

391
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,440
No, thanks.

392
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,960
I'm going to buy some meat.

393
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,880
Hello.

394
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,680
Can I sit here?

395
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,120
You've already sat.

396
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,800
Why are you asking so much?

397
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,680
Ruoxi.

398
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,840
Thank you for today.

399
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,600
Without you,

400
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,640
we would have been scolded again.

401
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,440
You're welcome. It's nothing.

402
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,440
Don't mention it.

403
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,520
Thank you.

404
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,440
You're welcome.

405
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,440
You can prove that I’m not immoral.

406
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,160
Mr. Dai. Mr. Dai.

407
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,280
Let’s see who dares to waste food.

408
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,320
Aren't you afraid of choking?

409
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,480
Do you know

410
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,480
why Grandpa Xiaoming lived to 99?

411
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,440
What?

412
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,680
Hey.

413
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,080
I know that.

414
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,960
why grandpa Xiaoming could live to 99.

415
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,880
Because he

416
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,720
He never cares about others' business.

417
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,080
I'm full.

418
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,800
Xiammy.

419
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,000
Hello, Director.

420
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,600
You're leaving already?

421
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,920
Which class are you in?

422
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,720
Class 1.

423
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,200
Class 1.

424
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,440
The two holes under the eyebrows

425
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,360
for breathing?

426
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,040
The words on the wall are so big.

427
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,760
Don't waste it. Can't you see it?

428
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,280
And what is this hair?

429
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,720
It's as hot as a feather duster.

430
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,000
Deduct your class’s exercise points.

431
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,040
No, sir.

432
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,360
I'll go back and finish it.

433
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,360
Do you need my help?

434
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,400
No.

435
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,640
This is nothing.

436
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,320
Eat up.

437
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,000
Sir, I'm done.

438
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,600
That's more like it.

439
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,240
Stop laughing.

440
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,120
I wouldn't have been caught if it weren't for you.

441
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,440
I almost got penalty points.

442
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,280
I didn't remind you just now.

443
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,600
Ruo tears.

444
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,240
Xiao Yu.

445
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,240
Let's go.

446
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,120
Class teachers,

447
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,200
organize a camping party for your students.

448
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,680
See you, instructor.

449
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,080
When will the party start?

450
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,240
I'm exhausted after the performance.

451
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,440
I want to go back to sleep.

452
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,920
Have some water.

453
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,200
Why is he the host?

454
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,400
Because he's good at hosting.

455
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
He hosted

456
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,600
in our junior high school.

457
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,520
One year, there was a reporter

458
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,000
there were reporters reporting

459
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,920
A lot of people asked him to do advertisements on the news.

460
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,920
Him?

461
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,320
Did you meet a con artist?

462
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,480
Everyone, please come here.

463
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,840
Our gala is about to begin.

464
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,160
First,

465
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,040
Let’s congratulate

466
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,960
Your class got the title of excellent class in military training.

467
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,600
That’s right.

468
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,200
Now,

469
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,360
please give us the honorable instructor.

470
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,280
And Ms. Qiao, please give a big round of applause.

471
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,280
Of course.

472
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,680
And we can also

473
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,000
Applause for yourselves who have trained hard, OK?

474
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,440
Work hard.

475
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,480
Of course.

476
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,440
Since today is the camping party,

477
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
we must have some fun.

478
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,800
Next, we'll play some fun games.

479
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,280
We'll get a surprise reward if we win.

480
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,400
If you lose,

481
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,240
you have to show all your skills.

482
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,000
to make everyone happy.

483
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,320
What's the reward?

484
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,720
It's a surprise.

485
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,480
It'll be boring if I say it.

486
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,560
But don't worry.

487
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,280
This is definitely a super valuable gift.

488
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,160
The first game is counting frogs.

489
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,760
The rules are very simple.

490
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,840
Have you all played it before?

491
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,320
I know.

492
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,560
Is it that

493
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,600
One frog opens his mouth

494
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,680
Two eyes and four legs.

495
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,160
Yes.

496
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,800
That's right.

497
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,040
The rules are clear now.

498
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,960
Let's start with this student.

499
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,880
And our order is the timeline.

500
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,000
Okay.

501
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,000
Let me give you a rhythm and we'll start.

502
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,280
Start

503
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
One frog opens his mouth

504
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,720
Two eyes and four legs

505
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,200
Two frogs and two mouths.

506
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,440
Four eyes and eight legs

507
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,720
Three frogs, three mouths.

508
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,920
Six eyes twelve legs

509
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,080
Four frogs, four mouths.

510
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,200
Eight eyes 16 legs

511
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,600
Five frogs, 15 mouths.

512
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,240
Eight frogs.

513
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,680
One frog.

514
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,480
Three mouths.

515
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,640
All right.

516
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,760
I didn't expect

517
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,160
the first little frog surfaced so quickly.

518
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,160
Rammy.

519
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,440
Show us what you have.

520
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,000
If there's no show,

521
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,880
you can read a poem.

522
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,160
If you have nothing to perform,

523
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,840
you can beg me.

524
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,920
I can do it for you.

525
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,160
Please.

526
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,520
You'd better keep your peacock tail.

527
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,560
I don't have any special talent.

528
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,400
I'll sing you a song today.

529
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,720
Okay.

530
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,800
Make a Chinese knot.

531
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,280
and a red ribbon.

532
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,760
May good people

533
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,640
good luck every day.

534
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,400
Your healthy life is beautiful.

535
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,560
Good luck.

536
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,240
What's wrong?

537
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,160
I sang a song for my three-year-old cousin's kindergarten.

538
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,280
What?

539
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,760
Is this a grand show at the kindergarten school?

540
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,720
Stop singing.

541
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,000
Good luck.

542
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,520
A Chinese knot.

543
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,680
How could you say that?

544
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,280
What's wrong with kindergarten?

545
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,240
We like to listen to kindergarten.

546
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,160
Any problem?

547
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,480
That's right.

548
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,400
Any problem?

549
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,560
Good luck brings you good luck.

550
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,440
Good luck brings joy and love

551
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,280
Good luck brings us good luck

552
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,400
Good luck and prosperity

553
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,120
Good luck brings us good luck.

554
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Good luck brings joy and love

555
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,840
Good luck brings us good luck

556
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,480
Good luck and prosperity.

557
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,600
Thank you for your encouragement.

558
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
I hope everyone who heard this song

559
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,320
can have good mood and good luck.

560
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,240
Okay.

561
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,680
It sounds good, right?

562
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,000
Yes.

563
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,840
Even singing out of tune can change the atmosphere.

564
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,720
Normal people are not capable

565
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,920
Monitor, you don't have to praise me if you don't know how to praise me next time.

566
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,000
It's more awkward to say that

567
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,280
It’s really nice.

568
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,600
I’ll leave the next part to you.

569
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Give him a round of applause.

570
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,400
Okay.

571
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
The next game

572
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,640
we’ll invite some boys in our class to play.

573
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,000
What game, sir?

574
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,800
A chicken fight.

575
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,160
Fighting chicken.

576
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,280
I'm good at fighting chicken.

577
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:18,880
Hong Kong Taiwan.

578
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,560
Pick me.

579
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,160
Yes.

580
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,760
I remember you.

581
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,400
Okay.

582
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,400
Count you in.

583
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,400
Ms. Zhang Ruoxi.

584
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,160
Monitor.

585
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,160
And this left and right

586
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,080
And those who are weak, come up here.

587
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,440
It's my strength.

588
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,200
Three, two, one, go.

589
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,640
God.

590
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
He's a divine leg.

591
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,520
Mr Qiao, what's my gift?

592
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,000
Congratulations on getting a set of exercises book.

593
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,320
I wish you progress.

594
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,560
Let's applaud.

595
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,240
Everyone is having fun today's game.

596
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,120
The instructor and I also felt your enthusiasm.

597
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,080
Since you are so happy now,

598
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,680
I have good news.

599
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,520
What is it?

600
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,040
Starting tomorrow,

601
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,360
Every morning at 6:30 a.m.

602
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,400
all students have to run 800 meters in the morning.

603
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
I hope you

604
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,360
remember the instructor's instructions.

605
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,760
I won't be late or leave early.

606
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,440
This is for your own good.

607
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,360
Health is the foundation of learning.

608
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,520
It's getting late today.

609
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,840
Let’s sing a song together.

610
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,920
Send the instructor away.

611
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,520
OK.

612
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,200
Beyond the long corridor

613
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,840
By the ancient road

614
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,760
The green grass connects with the sky

615
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,680
The night breeze blows the willow and the flute is broken

616
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,000
The setting sun is setting outside the mountain

617
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,720
At the end of the sky and the corner of the earth

618
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,680
Friends are parted

619
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:35,880
It's rare to have a reunion in life.

620
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:42,160
Only parting is more

621
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,400
Outside the long corridor

622
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,520
By the ancient road

623
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:57,640
The green grass connects with the sky

624
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:07,480
When will you return this time?

625
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:14,480
Don’t hesitate when you come.

626
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,040
Goodbye, sir.

627
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,600
The night breeze blows the willow and the flute is broken.

628
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:31,680
The setting sun is beyond the mountain

629
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,560
One, two, three, four.

630
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,440
Three, two, three, four.

631
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,760
One, two, three, four.

632
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,200
Wait.

633
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,800
Ruo tears.

634
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,680
What's wrong with you?

635
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,040
Are you hurt?

636
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,720
Ruotear.

637
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,080
Can you continue, Ruotear?

638
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,120
Maybe there's sand in my sole.

639
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
You guys go ahead.

640
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm fine. I'll follow you soon.

641
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,800
Do you need someone to help you? No.

642
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,560
Be careful.

643
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,320
Okay.

644
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,920
Let's get ready and run.

645
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,160
Okay, come back to your positions. Hurry up.

646
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,640
Hurry up.

647
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,960
Run!

648
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,600
One two three four

649
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,480
Why is there a 38 big foot?

650
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:45,080
One, two, three, four.

651
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,560
What are you doing?

652
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,640
Why aren't you running?

653
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,440
Are you slacking off?

654
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:05,160
One, two, three, four.

655
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
How about running slower?

656
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,040
I just came by bike.

657
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,440
I haven't had breakfast.

658
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,880
My legs are almost broken.

659
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,000
Everyone, slow down.

660
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,920
Today is the first morning run for many students.

661
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,520
Many people are not used to it. They should understand each other.

662
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,040
But

663
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,199
we have to keep up.

664
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:40,040
One, two, three, four.

665
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,080
Rammy, are you okay?

666
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,400
Yes.

667
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,080
Thank you, Ruoxi.

668
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,600

Monitor

670
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,920
Why are you still collecting girls' stuff?

671
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,200
Do you look familiar?

672
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,520
No.

673
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,040
Okay.

674
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,520
You like this too, Monitor.

675
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,520
Yes.

676
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,960
This was my favorite when I was young.

677
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Let me tell you.

678
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,200
Once I went on a trip with my parents,

679
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,880
There was no lead in the snack bag.

680
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,440
I'm in a hurry to go back.

681
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,320
Take this.

682
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,480
Thanks. Thank you.

683
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,320
Oh, Monitor.

684
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,720
did you have something to tell me last time?

685
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,720
I was in a hurry to the canteen.

686
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,560
What are you trying to say?

687
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,200
Is there something on my face?

688
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,520
No.

689
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,320
I mean,

690
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,040
maybe

691
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,520
we might have met when we were young.

692
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,000
On a cruise in Guilin.

693
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,920
Do you remember me?

694
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,960
Back then,

695
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,720
with two ponytails

696
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,640
wearing a flower dress.

697
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,000
with the same tear mole on his face.

698
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,800
He was following me on the boat.

699
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,040
Brother calling me

700
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,840
Just like now

701
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,400
I like tax milk.

702
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,320
Slow down.

703
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,640
Why does it sound like an idol drama?

704
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,480
Is he kidding me?

705
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,400
Then we broke up.

706
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,120
You gave me your favorite hairpin as a gift.

707
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,320
He said he would come back to play with me after the trip.

708
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:01,960
