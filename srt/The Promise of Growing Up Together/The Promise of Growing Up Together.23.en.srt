1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on!

2
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,759
I've never been your enemy.

3
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,920
If you really love the monitor,

4
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,000
I hope you can cherish it.

5
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,560
Don't blame it on others.

6
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,600
Thank you for reminding me.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,560
Of course I will cherish it.

8
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,720
I have to go.

9
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,200
I didn't order any cake.

10
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,880
Hello, this is a man

11
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,960
who doesn't want to reveal his name.

12
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,200
Enjoy your meal.

13
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,960
I can't see.

14
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,640
Please tell the man who doesn't want to reveal his name.

15
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,520
I don't like the taste of this cake.

16
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,120
Buy him some.

17
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,760
Okay.

18
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,040
Ruoxi, are you done?

19
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,079
Eat it yourself. I'm leaving.

20
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
Xiammy.

21
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,079
Xiammy.

22
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,240
Xia Mi! Xia Mi!

23
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,480
Don't be angry. I won't bother you anymore.

24
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,040
Ruoxi, are you a piece of rubbish?

25
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,520
I told you not to follow me.

26
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,600
I wish I were a dog-skin plaster.

27
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
At least I can stick to you and follow you.

28
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,600
Am I the only one who quit this project to ignore me?

29
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,160
I'll tell the company now.

30
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,680
No, I'm sorry.

31
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
I promise I will never pester you again.

32
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,480
This project is your hard work.

33
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't be angry.

34
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,640
I'll quit if I want to.

35
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,560
Do whatever you want.

36
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,320
Hello?

37
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,480
What?

38
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,560
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

39
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,600
What's wrong, Xiammy?

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,880
My dad is sick. I have to go back now.

41
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Let me give you a ride.

42
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,120
It's just acute gastroenteritis.

43
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
It's nothing serious.

44
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,880
You can go home

45
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,040
you can go home.

46
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,200
Thank you, Uncle Wei.

47
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,120
Have a good rest.

48
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,800
Thank you.

49
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,159
Let me see you off.

50
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:45,200
I told you to drink less beer and eat less crayfish yesterday.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
Now you're in the hospital.

52
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:51,880
Ruoxi.

53
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,680
I really have to thank you this time.

54
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,159
If you hadn't carried Xia here yesterday,

55
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,760
Mi and I

56
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,960
can move this

57
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,400
this heavy rock.

58
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,680
You're too kind.

59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,080
It's my duty.

60
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,800
Take care of him.

61
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
I'll get you some water.

62
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,680
Thank you.

63
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,720
You're welcome.

64
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
Take care. Take care.

65
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,720
Young man,

66
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you for today.

67
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,520
But it’s different.

68
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,360
You made Mi sad for so long.

69
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,200
I haven’t settled the score for you.

70
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,480
Come with me.

71
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,600
Be careful.

72
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Dad, where are you going?

73
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,560
Leave her alone.

74
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,240
Do you know how hard it has been for her these years?

75
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,800
She has been writing day and night.

76
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,640
just for the stupid agreement between you two.

77
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,680
Mi,

78
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,680
It’s two o’clock.

79
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,280
Why are you still working?

80
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,920
Dad, why do you wake up so late?

81
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't worry. I'll go to bed right away.

82
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,640
You too.

83
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,120
She even got

84
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,840
because of you.

85
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,680
Dad.

86
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Stop it.

87
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,520
Xiammy.

88
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,240
We...

89
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,520
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
No need to apologize.

91
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,400
This is part of my work.

92
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,760
It has nothing to do with you.

93
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,840
Uncle, auntie.

94
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,840
I know it's my fault.

95
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't worry.

96
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,040
I won't do anything to hurt her again.

97
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,320
I won't disturb you.

98
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,360
Mimi.

99
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,520
See Ruoxi off. Okay.

100
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,560
Go.

101
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,600
I'm worried that my dad won't send you down.

102
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,120
Thank you

103
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,040
Thank you.

104
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,280
It's okay.

105
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,400
Call me if you need anything.

106
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,400
If you save it,

107
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,880
Go back.

108
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,080
Ruoxi Zhang.

109
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,280
Ruoxi Zhang.

110
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,000
Ruoxi Zhang!

111
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
Jang Ruoxi, you jerk!

112
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,440
Where have you been?

113
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,840
Rammy.

114
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,920
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

115
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,040
Ruoxi Zhang.

116
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,960
You jerk!

117
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,240
It's me.

118
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,840
I'm a jerk.

119
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,640
Then don't be afraid.

120
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,280
You can beat me and scold me if I'm here.

121
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,040
I won't let you cry again, okay?

122
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,240
Let's go.

123
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,720
Are you feeling better?

124
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,280
I'm sorry.

125
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,440
I won't leave you anymore.

126
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,440
Whether it's sunny or rainy,

127
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,040
I will never leave you again.

128
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,480
Can you forgive me?

129
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,760
You think too much.

130
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,200
I'm afraid of the rain. It has nothing to do with you.

131
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,080
I came out to chase you

132
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,360
because I was afraid something would happen to you.

133
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
Since you're fine,

134
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
I'm going back.

135
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Don't follow me.

136
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,920
What's wrong?

137
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,040
What's going on?

138
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Fan Yuan.

139
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,880
I know I was wrong this time.

140
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,520
Can you forgive me?

141
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,000
Let's go inside.

142
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,440
You'll catch a cold.

143
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,600
Don't push me away.

144
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,800
Just a moment.

145
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,480
Just a moment

146
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
Dry your hair first.

147
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,040
I'll get you some hot water.

148
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,520
I want two fried dough sticks.

149
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,440
Girl, it's your turn. How many do you want?

150
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,640
Boss.

151
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,280
I want three fried dough sticks and three glasses of soy milk.

152
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,600
I'll pack them for you.

153
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,840
Ruoxi Zhang.

154
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Don't you understand me?

155
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,360
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

156
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,400
It's okay.

157
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,880
You said you wouldn't look for me.

158
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,359
When did you become so obedient?

159
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,480
How's your script going?

160
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,440
What?

161
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,840
You didn't answer my calls or reply my messages.

162
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
He said he would never leave me.

163
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,840
Men always lie.

164
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,880
Hey, why didn't you reply to my call?

165
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,400
Rammy, come to Ruoxi's house.

166
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,720
It's where he used to live.

167
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,040
Ruoxi thinks you won't forgive him.

168
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,680
She's packing up and going back to Beijing.

169
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,600
Where is he?

170
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,720
Sister-in-law.

171
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,760
You're late.

172
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,240
He left.

173
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,160
He asked me to take care of these.

174
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
But I think I should show you.

175
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,760
I just found out.

176
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,400
He's been watching you all these years.

177
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,320
We've graduated.

178
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,960
Little girl,

179
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,560
Give her a cup of milk tea.

180
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,840
Congratulations on getting into college.

181
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,000
Thank you, boss.

182
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,840
Try it.

183
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,520
Who made this milk tea

184
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,760
I made it

185
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,280
Is it not good?

186
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,320
I knew the quality of this batch is bad.

187
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,840
No, boss. It's delicious.

188
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,440
Wish you a good business.

189
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,280
The name is Nongnong, Jiangzhai, Hengyang, Hunan.

Let me help you.

194

Thank you.

195
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,000
You're welcome.

196
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,640
How long has he been gone?

197
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,920
Which boarding gate?

198
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,040
The boarding gate is...

199
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,400
Xiao Junyi, why did you take my photo frame out?

200
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,360
Ruoxi Zhang.

201
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,560
You lied to me again.

202
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,840
Sister-in-law.

203
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,040
It's none of your business.

204
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,160
I saw him still calling your name when he fainted.

205
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,040
Sumi, Sumi, Sumi.

206
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,840
So I called you here on my own.

207
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
He missed you so much all these years.

208
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,600
I can't sleep because I miss you so much.

209
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,240
Xiao Yu asked me to go back to do the laundry. I'm leaving.

210
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,480
Don't go.

211
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,560
Ruoxi.

212
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,800
Is it fun?

213
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,040
Is it fun to fool me?

214
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,040
You didn't answer my calls or reply my messages.

215
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,800
You colluded with Xiao Junyi to lie to me.

216
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,880
Is it fun to see me in such a mess?

217
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,560
I didn't know you'd come today.

218
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,160
I have a fever. I didn't hear the bell.

219
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,280
I won't trust you anymore. I'm going back.

220
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,440
Let go.

221
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,560
Stop pretending.

222
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,680
I said I won't trust you anymore.

223
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,320
I'll let go if you keep doing this.

224
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,120
Three.

225
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
Ruoxi Zhang.

226
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Thank you.

227
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,920
Are you feeling better?

228
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
I'm asking you. Are you out of your mind?

229
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,520
I feel better. Thank you.

230
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,760
Have a good rest. I won't bother you.

231
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,280
I don't feel disturbed at all.

232
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,080
Even if you play the gong and play the fireworks here,

233
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,640
I won't feel noisy.

234
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,880
I think you've lost your mind.

235
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,240
You're talking nonsense.

236
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,360
Rammy.

237
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
I...

238
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,960
Zhang Ruoxi.

239
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,680
All these years,

240
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,640
why did you hide and refuse to see me?

241
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,480
Why didn't you come to Beijing?

242
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,520
Why did you change your phone?

243
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,040
I want the truth.

244
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,520
Tell me.

245
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,600
Go ahead.

246
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,480
Okay.

247
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Let me tell you.

248
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Sit down.

249
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,080
In the first year,

250
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,120
I didn't take the college entrance exam

251
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
and I was afraid it would affect you.

252
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,600
Why did you take my last money?

253
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,120
Why, Dad?

254
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,600
Don't do this.

255
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,560
We found her heart.

256
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,120
The most important thing now is to let mom operate first.

257
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,240
We can think of something about the money.

258
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,480
I'm too ashamed to see your mom.

259
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,560
Dad.

260
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,040
Have a seat.

261
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,440
What should I do?

262
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,160
Dad.

263
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,240
This is the first time

264
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,480
crying like this in front of me.

265
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,960
It's okay.

266
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,200
We can make it through.

267
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,040
Right?

268
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,120
Mom.

269
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,640
You must be tired from studying.

270
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,760
Do you want me to cook you some noodles?

271
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,840
Why are you still up so late?

272
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,280
I'm not hungry. You can go to bed first, okay?

273
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,720
I can't sleep even when your dad is on a business trip.

274
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,960
I'm fine.

275
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,000
It won't take much effort to cook noodles.

276
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,040
Wait for me.

277
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,200
Mom.

278
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,480
What's wrong?

279
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,360
Hello, is this 120? Yes.

280
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,920
Female, 43 years old.

281
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,680
She had a heart transplant.

282
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,360
The address is Jing'an District, Shanghai.

283
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,560
Liuli Road. Yes.

284
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,640
It's all my fault.

285
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,280
I'm a burden to you.

286
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,240
The college entrance exam is coming.

287
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,120
It's all my fault.

288
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,360
It's okay.

289
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,720
It's okay.

290
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,240
Calm down.

291
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,240
It's okay.

292
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,200
Gaokao

293
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,360
The college entrance exam will be the same next year

294
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,480
I can get better grades if I study for one more year.

295
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,760
Right?

296
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,840
As long as you get better,

297
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,560
nothing else matters.

298
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,920
Should I go to Beijing to find her

299
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,800
or Shanghai?

300
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,880
Dad.

301
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Ruoxi.

302
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,200
If you want to go to Beijing, go.

303
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,200
I'll take good care of my mom.

304
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,960
Don't worry about your tuition.

305
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,400
I'll take care of everything.

306
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,080
Dad.

307
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,920
Well...

308
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,880
Can I go back to my hometown first?

309
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,840
No, I'll do it.

310
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,360
Mom, I'm going to practice.

311
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,200
I'll be back after I finish my internship.

312
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,640
Take care of yourselves.

313
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,000
Don't worry about us.

314
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,920
As for you,

315
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,160
take more rest.

316
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,360
Don't work too hard.

317
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,760
Also,

318
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,760
You can stop dating

319
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,480
I've learned enough from eating.

320
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,560
I don't want to see you again.

321
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,560
You got hurt.

322
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,240
Xia, stop it.

323
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,200
You say it every time you come back.

324
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
I know what to do when I grow up.

325
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,960
Don't listen to your dad.

326
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,520
Do whatever you want.

327
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,400
I support you.

328
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,600
Don't worry. I'll take care of myself.

329
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,800
Go back.

330
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,680
Bye, mom and dad.

331
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,680
Bye.

332
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,120
[Forgive me for not having the courage to meet you.]

333
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,320
I have nothing now.

334
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,640
I can't bring you good luck anymore.

335
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,160
You did a great job.

336
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,240
Go back and wait for the notice.

337
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,720
Thank you.

338
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,560
Thank you.

339
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,120
Tingbo Hotel.

340
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,520
I'm sorry, I've decided on someone else.

341
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,800
I'll call you next time if I find a suitable role.

342
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,840
Hello?

343
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,640
I mean it.

344
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,240
I can play any role.

345
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,240
I can audition anytime.

346
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,960
CALIFORNIA.

347
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,800
Hello.

348
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,680
This is the information of my actor.

349
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,520
ST.176.

350
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,280
Hello.

351
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,200
Put it down.

352
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,000
Good job.

353
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,080
Close the door.

354
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,560
Okay.

355
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,600
Hello, mentors.

356
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,680
My name is Zhang Ruoxi.

357
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,960
I'm 24 years old.

358
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,320
I play Zhanneng.

359
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,760
Hello, mentors.

360
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,200
I'm Zhang Ruoxi, 24 years old.

361
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,480
I'm interviewing Hao today.

362
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,000
I knew it.

363
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,680
Maybe I'm not good enough to be an actor.

364
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,240
It's okay. Didn't Mr. Zhao say there's a project?

365
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,280
Let's give it a try.

366
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,840
No. I've graduated for so long.

367
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,320
I can't even eat anything.

368
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,720
I'd rather go back to my hometown and find a stable job.

369
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,240
What about you?

370
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,240
Are you going to keep going?

371
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,120
Why are you so persistent?

372
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,440
Is red really that important?

373
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,640
Promises are important.

374
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,520
If you don't keep it,

375
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,480
she'll cry.

376
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,040
Director.

377
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,400
Oh.

378
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,239
You've already chosen, right?

379
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,280
It's okay.

380
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,360
We can work together next time.

381
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,480
Thank you.

382
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,960
Bye.

383
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,360
Excuse me, didn't you see a phone?

384
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,880
It's black. It has a phone rope.

385
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,880
It's hanging the sunflower. You didn't see it.

386
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,720
No no

387
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,040
RBANKOFHUNANANANANANANANANANANAN BANK of Hunan Bank HUNANAN

388
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,040
Excuse me, sir.

389
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,600
Your card balance is not enough.

390
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,000
Why don't you pick a cheaper phone?

391
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,360
It only costs 800 won.

392
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,560
I'll take a look.

393
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,200
The maximum withdrawal amount is 5,000 won.

394
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,000
Amy.

395
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,680
We're going to meet the producer today.

396
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
Don't be late.

397
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,680
Okay, don't worry.

398
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,880
I'm nearby.

399
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,040
Watch the steps.

400
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,160
AFIVD Your Step

401
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,160

Watch the steps.

403
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,360
Hello?

404
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,440
Zhang, why can't I get through to you?

405
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,080
Our drama is still recruiting.

406
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,920
Do you want to come?

407
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,440
The salary is not high.

408
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,800
But there are actors.

409
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,040
We can't waste our skills, right?

410
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,080
Okay, I'll go.

411
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,400
Thank you.

412
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,960
No matter how hard it is,

413
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,880
I will try my best to keep our promise.

414
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
Even if

415
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,360
you may no longer need me.

416
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,760
Ruoxi.

417
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,680
Come and meet Director Wu.

418
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,000
Ruoxi.

419
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,160
It's really you.

420
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,320
Long time no see.

421
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,680
Long time no see.

422
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,640
When Wang introduced you to me, I thought it was the same name.

423
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,000
I didn't expect it was really you.

424
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,640
You know each other?

425
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,480
That's right. What a coincidence.

426
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,480
Director Wu has

427
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,760
is looking for a leading actor.

428
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,560
Ruoxi, why don't you talk first?

429
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,000
You haven't changed much.

430
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,040
Long time no see, director.

431
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,160
Long time no see.

432
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,920
Ruoxi.

433
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,960
Brother.

434
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,800
Well,

435
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,640
I've arranged someone to take care of your house in your hometown.

436
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,400
Next time you go back, you can live there directly.

437
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,880
Thank you, brother.

438
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,880
Don't mention it.

439
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,960
But these years,

440
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,440
for you these years.

441
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,000
But now,

442
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,960
I'll make a comeback.

443
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,880
Your new drama is about to start.

444
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,040
Our fortune is very lucky.

445
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,080
You called me here in such a hurry

446
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,440
about the house?

447
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,600
Yo

448
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,960
Look at me.

449
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,280
I almost forgot.

450
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,120
I received a good script yesterday.

451
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,960
It suits you very well.

452
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,160
Coincidentally, the male lead has the same name as you.

453
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
Ruoxi Zhang.

454
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,000
Let's go to the film academy together.

455
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,160
Hey.

456
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,800
When is this interview?

457
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,400
Today is okay, right?

458
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,960
Is this notebook so touching?

459
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,880
Send me the address. Bye.

460
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,480
Now?

461
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,680
Thank you.

462
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,440
I'm back.

463
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,640
Will you give me a chance?

464
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,600
Why do you have to endure all this alone?

465
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,960
You can tell me if you need help.

466
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,000
I told you not to carry it alone.

467
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,520
If you tell me, I can go to Shanghai.

468
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,760
You're so stupid.

469
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,560
Yes.

470
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,880
You're so stubborn.

471
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm a fool. I'm a fool.

472
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,480
All right.

473
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,680
I know I was wrong.

474
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,080
Please forgive me.

475
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,880
Will you leave me again?

476
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,960
I promise

477
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,760
I won't leave you again.

478
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,000
Wait.

479
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,080
You just said

480
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,440
you didn't join the film academy

481
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,280
That's why you didn't apply for the film academy.

482
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,680
Ruoxi, you passed the art exam but didn't come to me.

483
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,320
Do you know how much I wanted to see you?

484
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,680
You left without telling me.

485
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,640
How did you know it would bring me bad luck?

486
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,880
I know.

487
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,440
You just don't trust me.

488
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,040
I...

489
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,360
Let me explain.

490
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,840
It's not that I don't trust you.

491
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,800
I didn't have the courage

492
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
to see you again.

493
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:31,680
I...

494
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,320
Take your time to cool down at home.

495
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,400
