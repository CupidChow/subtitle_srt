1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,600
Mom.

3
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,240
Are you sick?

4
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Where's your dad?

5
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,759
Why isn't he here yet?

6
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,440
What did Uncle Wei tell you?

7
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,800
Did he say

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,960
Mama can't be saved!

9
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
No.

10
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,840
Uncle Wei said

11
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,360
Where is the heart?

12
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,280
I'm almost there.

13
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,160
I told you to recuperate.

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
You're lying to me again.

15
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,400
If it's good news,

16
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,800
we don't need to talk outside.

17
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,840
Mom.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
If you don't believe me,

19
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,960
if you don't believe me.

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,320
Auntie.

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,680
He didn't lie to you.

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,520
I can testify.

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,280
Don't worry.

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
You are...

25
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm his deskmate.

26
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,360
I understand why you suspect him.

27
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,720
He likes acting so much.

28
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,079
Exactly.

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm afraid

30
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,400
He's still hiding it from me.

31
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
No.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,920
He may not look serious sometimes,

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,200
but he's reliable at critical moments.

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,840
My classmates said he was an all-rounder warrior.

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,800
Don't worry.

36
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,800
I'm not lying.

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,320
It's okay.

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,720
I'll take a nap.

39
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,800
Okay.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,720
Thank you.

41
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,160
Just now...

42
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
Thank you for comforting my mom.

43
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,640
You sent me away with just a thank you.

44
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,040
How insincere.

45
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,480
What sincerity do you want?

46
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,480
I hope

47
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,720
eat well

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Sleep well.

49
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,480
Take care of yourself.

50
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,720
Also,

51
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,440
don't ignore my calls.

52
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,480
I know you're busy.

53
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I don't want you.

54
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,600
answer my calls or reply to my messages.

55
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,400
But I'm worried about you.

56
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,120
I didn't know.

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,880
When I saw your house was empty,

58
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,240
I thought

59
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,240
I would never see you again.

60
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,240
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,440
It's all my fault.

62
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,120
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,360
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,720
It's okay.

65
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,440
It's okay.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,440
Where do you live now?

67
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,240
I'm staying at my grandparents' house.

68
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,640
Don't worry.

69
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,159
I can't live under the bridge.

70
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,240
Let's go.

71
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,600
I'll take you home.

72
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,040
It's getting dark.

73
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
We'll be worried if we don't go back now.

74
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,280
No need.

75
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,640
My house is nearby. I can walk there.

76
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,720
Go back and keep her company.

77
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,360
Tomorrow,

78
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,960
tomorrow.

79
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,920
But you were alone at night.

80
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,360
Have you forgotten?

81
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,720
I can defeat two men 1.8 meters on my own?

82
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,800
I'm fine.

83
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,840
Call me when you get home.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,160
Pince.

85
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,720
Okay?

86
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,760
Remember to call me

87
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,480
MASONPRINCE

88
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
MASONPER

MASONPRINCE

93
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:52,880
PRINCE

94
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,960
Mom.

95
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,920
Do you know a good cardiologist?

96
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,360
Mimi, what's wrong?

97
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,840
What's wrong?

98
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,560
It's not me.

99
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,920
It's Zhang Ruoxi.

100
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,000
His mother is sick.

101
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,280
He needs a heart transplant.

102
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,480
I want to help him.

103
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,680
but I can't do anything.

104
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,040
I can't do anything.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,880
Don't cry.

106
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Mom knows

107
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,080
I can't do anything.

108
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,600
A friend of your dad is a doctor in Beijing.

109
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,120
He promised to try his best.

110
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Really?

111
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,400
It's the one you've been looking for since you were a kid.

112
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,040
It's your dad's favourite gift since you were young. It's your father's favourite gift.

113
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,880
your dad,

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,720
and the lucky money from your grandparents.

115
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,280
and the growth fund you saved once a year.

116
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,720
can help.

117
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,880
Ruoxi

118
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,560
is quite blessed.

119
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,880
There's an old saying that good people are blessed.

120
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,640
Don't worry too much.

121
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,240
Mom.

122
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,120
Thank you, Dad.

123
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,760
Don't mention it.

124
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,799
If you need help,

125
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
tell us right away.

126
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,600
Don't hide and be sad.

127
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,320
Got it?

128
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,880
She's asleep.

129
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,120
How's Mom today?

130
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
She...

131
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,040
haven't seen you for a day.

132
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,360
I feel uneasy.

133
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,400
One more thing.

134
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,880
Uncle Wei said

135
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,400
we haven't found the heart yet.

136
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,760
but he'll keep an eye on it.

137
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,080
It's exactly because of this.

138
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,400
A friend of mine contacted the hospital in Shanghai

139
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,800
He said he could help me find my heart.

140
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,120
and asked me to help in his company.

141
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,560
Ruoxi.

142
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,000
I've thought about it for a long time.

143
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,920
The medical resources there are better than here.

144
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,440
I want to take your mom there.

145
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,080
It's you.

146
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,600
I know this decision is very sudden for you.

147
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,360
You don't have to follow him.

148
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,720
Just stay here and study.

149
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,080
Uncle Fan promised me too. No.

150
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,600
If I don't go, who will take care of my mom?

151
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,920
I've discussed with your grandma.

152
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,480
She will go with me.

153
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,760
That's even worse.

154
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,240
Grandma is old.

155
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,560
I can't let her work so hard.

156
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,680
What if mom

157
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,680
she can study anywhere.

158
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,440
As long as we are together,

159
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,880
nothing can't be overcome.

160
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,280
I know it's too hard for you.

161
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,160
You're in grade 12 now.

162
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,080
It's all my fault.

163
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,520
I trusted others and hurt your mother.

164
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,720
Dad.

165
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,240
You spent the most

166
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,080
for me and my mom.

167
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,560
I've always treated you as my role model.

168
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,240
I still do.

169
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,800
So you're not the one who's wrong.

170
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,960
It's those swindlers.

171
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,560
Dad.

172
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,160
When you were young, you said

173
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,040
as a man,

174
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,120
What? You can't cry easily.

175
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,760
Why do you forget it now?

176
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,000
I didn't.

177
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,840
Well,

178
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,600
There's sand in my eyes.

179
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay.

180
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,760
Go inside and keep an eye on mom.

181
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,200
If she wakes up and sees you gone,

182
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
when she wakes up.

183
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,760
Don't let her see you cry.

184
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,280
I'm home.

185
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,360
Don't worry.

186
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,040
How is your mom?

187
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,920
Have you eaten well?

188
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,800
Are you free after school tomorrow?

189
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,760
Ruoxi Zhang.

190
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,760
Ruoxi Zhang.

191
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,120
Why are you running so fast on such a hot day?

192
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,160
Aren't you afraid of heatstroke?

193
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,560
I'm afraid if I'm late,

194
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,560
if I'm late.

195
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,160
I told you I came to see you today.

196
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
How can I leave without seeing you?

197
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,800
You're wearing a school uniform.

198
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,760
Are you coming back for class?

199
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,120
How can I enter school without my uniform?

200
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,200
What about your mom?

201
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,640
Is she feeling better today?

202
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,600
She's much better after seeing you yesterday.

203
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,080
It's okay. My dad is with her.

204
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
I'll visit her every day.

205
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,000
I hope she gets better soon.

206
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,320
My parents saved this card for me.

207
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,640
I don't have much,

208
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,480
but I hope it can help you and your mom.

209
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,760
If you return it, I'll break up with you.

210
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,600
Let me make it clear.

211
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,440
I didn't give it to you. I lent it to you.

212
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,080
Give it back to me.

213
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,720
And I'll pay you back double.

214
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,600
You're a good businessman.

215
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,480
You just realized?

216
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,360
Take it.

217
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,360
I have good news for you.

218
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,320
My dad has a friend from Beijing.

219
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,320
I told them about your mom.

220
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,440
They said they'll try their best to find a matching heart.

221
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,280
Don't worry too much.

222
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,440
My dad has found a doctor.

223
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,160
Really?

224
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,240
When is the surgery?

225
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,360
Xiammy.

226
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,280
Nothing.

227
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,160
They'll arrange it as soon as possible.

228
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,640
Thank uncle for me.

229
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,080
If you want to thank him, come to me yourself.

230
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
I won't help you.

231
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,560
Okay.

232
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,920
Take a walk with me.

233
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,120
Is it hard for 12th grade?

234
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,520
Of course.

235
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,560
You don't know.

236
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,880
When you're not around,

237
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,120
the test papers will go down like snowflakes.

238
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,920
Your papers are so thick.

239
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,640
And the teacher is getting faster and faster.

240
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,720
Every time I want to ask you,

241
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,920
You're not here.

242
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,440
Sorry.

243
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,680
You're just saying sorry.

244
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,560
At least buy me a cup of milk tea.

245
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,320
Okay.

246
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,600
That one again.

247
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,480
Sir.

248
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,040
Two cups of signature milk tea.

249
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,800
It's you again.

250
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,600
This is the girl

251
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,240
you mentioned last time.

252
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,960
You have no idea.

253
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,400
he was so persistent to make milk tea for you.

254
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,920
to make milk tea for you.

255
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:08,960
Boss.

256
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,440
Can you hurry up?

257
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,160
We're in a hurry.

258
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,360
So shy.

259
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,480
What about the thick-skinned energy?

260
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,040
If you think I'm slow,

261
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,080
come in and do it yourself.

262
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,840
Boss.

263
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,880
Coming.

264
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,920
Find a seat and wait for me.

265
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,720
Try it.

266
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,160
Handsome.

267
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,880
Make me a signature milk tea

268
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,200
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,599
I'm not a clerk here.

270
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,560
I'm just her exclusive milk tea lady.

271
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,400
Okay.

272
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,079
How is it?

273
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,200
Try it.

274
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,040
How is it? Is it good?

275
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,079
If the full score is 100,

276
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
120.

277
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,480
What?

278
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,200
It's good.

279
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,000
Boss, check please.

280
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,520
I thought about it.

281
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,640
If a cup of milk tea is enough to make you apologize,

282
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,600
it's too easy for you.

283
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,320
When you become the best actor,

284
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,840
I'll blackmail you.

285
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,960
This milk tea

286
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,320
as a gift for you.

287
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,240
Remember to come again.

288
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,200
Thank you, boss.

289
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,680
We'll come often.

290
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,600
Every day.

291
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,680
Thank you, boss.

292
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,360
It's stinky tofu.

293
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,320
Smells good.

294
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,840
Do you want some? I'll buy it for you.

295
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,320
No need.

296
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,560
There are so many people in line. It must take a long time.

297
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,560
Besides,

298
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,400
I don't want to eat that much either.

299
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,200
It's okay.

300
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,040
Wait for me here.

301
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,520
Okay.

302
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,480
Ruoxi.

303
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,000
Why are you acting strange today?

304
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,720
Are you hiding something from me?

305
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,640
No.

306
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,720
What's wrong with me?

307
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,480
I haven't eaten stinky tofu for a long time.

308
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,440
I'm a little hungry.

309
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,280
Wait for me here.

310
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,160
I'll buy it.

311
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,200
Boss.

312
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,160
Take a look at my bag.

313
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,960
I asked the boss to put more radish sticks.

314
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Try it while it's hot.

315
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,680
The first bite

316
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,840
is to reward the piggy who lined up so long.

317
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,320
You're trying to impress me again.

318
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,440
No.

319
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,680
It's delicious. Try it.

320
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,360
Sure.

321
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,360
What's wrong?

322
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,160
Nothing.

323
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,120
I ate too fast and choked.

324
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,120
Where are we going later?

325
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,160
Are you in a hurry to go home?

326
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,280
No.

327
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,840
I've finished my homework.

328
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,320
I told my parents

329
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
I'm not in a hurry to go home.

330
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,080
Will you go for a walk with me?

331
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,200
There's a place I've always wanted to go with you.

332
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,520
Let's eat this stinky tofu first.

333
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,400
Come on, one more bite.

334
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,040
You too.

335
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,960
I'll eat it.

336
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,000
Ruoxi Zhang.

337
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,800
When did you want to bring me here?

338
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,320
From the first day I knew this place.

339
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,880
Come here

340
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,040
Excellent ashore.

341
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,560
Hurry up.

342
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,120
Excellent ashore

343
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Excellent!

344
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,480
Okay.

345
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,200
Now,

346
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,400
we have reached a contract with it.

347
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,520
So,

348
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,080
Auntie will be fine.

349
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,480
Everything will be fine.

350
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,800
Don't think I'm talking nonsense.

351
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,200
Excellent ashore.

352
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,440
You told me

353
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,360
the power of faith is very strong.

354
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,840
As long as we believe it,

355
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
it will come true.

356
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,840
Come on.

357
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
Everything will be fine.

358
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,080
Come here.

359
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,680
Come on!

360
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,560
Good job!

361
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,280
Do you want to take a photo with me?

362
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,440
But only the two of us

363
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,280
can take photos for us.

364
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,120
Wait for me.

365
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,240
Three, two, one. Cheese.

366
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,120
Please relax.

367
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,160
Look at each other.

368
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,080
One more.

369
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,000
Look at each other.

370
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,440
Yes.

371
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,400
Three, two, one. Cheese.

372
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,440
Thank you.

373
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,360
You're welcome.

374
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,280
It's nothing.

375
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,480
Bye. Bye.

376
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,240
Take a look at the photo.

377
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,400
Zhang Ruoxi.

378
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,520
From now on,

379
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,720
let's take a photo here every year, okay?

380
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,520
Sure.

381
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,600
Sure.

382
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,040
Let's go over there.

383
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,400
There's still a lot to see.

384
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,280
You're walking so slowly.

385
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,080
Why are you pulling me?

386
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,880
Take me with you.

387
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,200
Take five yuan.

388
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,320
You even want to ask me for money?

389
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,000
Yes.

390
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,520
Don't walk so fast.

391
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
You're so slow.

392
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,080
Good night.

393
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,160
Have a good dream.

394
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,120
What's wrong?

395
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,000
I feel like

396
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,760
I had a dream today.

397
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,280
When I go up,

398
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,600
I'll wake up from my dream.

399
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,720
Walk with me one more time.

400
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,200
If it doesn't affect you going to the hospital,

401
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,920
It's okay.

402
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,000
We still have time.

403
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,480
Let's go.

404
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,400
Do you want ice cream?

405
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,200
Yes.

406
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,960
Buy me a meal.

407
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,800
Sure.

408
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,560
I'll buy it for you.

409
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,320
Why did you return your bank card?

410
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,960
I'll pay you back double.

411
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,320
I was kidding.

412
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,280
Sorry, Natmmy.

413
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,800
Dad and I plan to send mom to Shanghai for treatment.

414
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,080
When my mom is cured,

415
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,600
I'll come back to you.

416
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,640
I won't forget our promise.

417
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,480
Take care of yourself.

418
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,000
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

419
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,520
Ruoxi.

420
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,520
The transfer medical car will arrive in Shanghai the day after tomorrow.

421
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,440
When you arrive,

422
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,960
contact Uncle Zhou first.

423
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,000
He'll arrange a place for you.

424
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,280
and wait for us.

425
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,960
Okay.

426
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,800
Got it, Dad.

427
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,960
I'll get the paperwork done.

428
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
Good work, son.

429
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,480
Have a safe trip.

430
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,480
Ruoxi Zhang.

431
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,800
Zhang Ruoxi.

432
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,480
You jerk.

433
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,480
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

434
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,200
You promised you wouldn't hide anything from me.

435
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,320
Rammy.

436
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,240
Why are you back so late?

437
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,120
Why are you hurt?

438
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,840
Oh my god.

439
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,240
Xia Mi.

440
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,200
I just came back from the teacher's office.

441
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,320
He told me Ruoxi dropped out.

442
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,960
What's going on?

443
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,840
What's wrong with him?

444
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,800
Where is he now?

445
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,280
What happened to his family?

446
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,680
What's going on?

447
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,600
He left.

448
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,280
He didn't keep his promise.

449
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,240
What promise?

450
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,920
Stop talking.

451
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,040
It's okay.

452
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,360
He left.

453
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Why is she crying?

454
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
I don't know.

455
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
It's okay

456
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,640
It's so hot lately. It's autumn and it's still sunny.

457
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,040
My face is covered.

458
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,000
I have an aloe vera glue which is very useful.

459
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,080
It's only a dozen yuan.

460
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,600
And it's sold outside the school.

461
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,400
It's very effective for sunburn. Do you want to try it?

462
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,840
Is that really effective?

463
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,720
I have a new one in my dorm.

464
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,400
Do you want to try it first?

465
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,320
Sure, Ruotear, you're actually quite nice.

466
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,000
It's nothing.

467
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,840
We are classmates. We help each other.

468
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,920
And look, I've been exposed to the tantrum lately.

469
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,000
Me too.

470
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,720
Right?

471
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,000
Yes.

472
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,760
What about you?

473
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,960
But I think

474
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,400
I'm wearing something different.

475
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,680
Don't you have aloe vera glue?

476
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,280
Why are you playing with your phone again?

477
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,960
I'm playing after class and eating.

478
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,360
If you keep playing like this, your eyes will go blind.

479
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,680
You'll get blind.

480
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,320
Let's go.

481
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,040
Let's go.

482
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,400
Call us for dinner next time.

483
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,240
The more people, the better.

484
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,320
Yes, we can order a lot of dishes. Let's eat together.

485
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,200
Where do you think Ruoxi is?

486
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,480
Will he come back?

487
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,160
The food is the most important.

488
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,280
The cumin beef is very delicious today.

489
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,520
Do you want me to get one for you, Natmmy? My treat.

490
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,360
It's okay.

491
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,400
I call him 800 times a day

492
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
until he answered.

493
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,920
I'll tell you immediately if I have any news about him.

494
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,280
Thank you.

495
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,920
I'm fine. Let's eat.

496
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,800
Let's eat first.

497
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,400
This is very delicious.

498
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,120
This is delicious.

499
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,040
The beef is still delicious, right?

500
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,639
What's wrong? You're not full?

501
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,719
You have low blood sugar after dinner.

502
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,639
It's too dark in the canteen.

503
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,360
The light is too strong when you go out.

504
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,400
I'm fine. Let's go.

505
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:36,920
I'm fine.

506
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,400
I'm fine.

507
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,679
Don't move.

508
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,560
Liu Dayou, what's wrong with you?

509
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,480
No.

510
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
I want to remove some dirty things for you.

511
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,400
My white clothes are not dirty.

512
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,000
They can drift.

513
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,640
Look, it's floating here.

514
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,000
Can't you see it?

515
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,840
Little bugs and dirty things.

516
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,040
Liu Dayou, you don't have good grades.

517
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,400
Why can't you speak clearly?

518
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,680
You're making fun of me.

519
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,880
I'll tell the teacher later.

520
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,600
I'm sorry.

521
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,240
I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose. Maybe he saw it wrong.

522
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,200
This is my apology.

523
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Yes.

524
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,920
Don't be angry. We're classmates.

525
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,480
Are you okay, Dayou?

526
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,240
I'm not lying. I really saw a lot of bugs.

527
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,440
But...

528
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,400
Am I terminally ill?

529
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,880
Dayou,

530
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,480
Are the things you see little by little

531
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,640
or fly back and forth like mosquitoes?

532
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,800
Yes.

533
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,640
It's okay. This is called Flying mosquito.

534
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,840
I read too much during summer vacation.

535
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,040
But I asked the doctor.

536
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,880
Don't stay up late and don't overdo it with your eyes.

537
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,920
Do more eye exercises.

538
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,080
It'll be fine

539
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,280
Really?

540
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,320
Can she lie to you?

541
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,000
Look.

542
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,880
It's all because of this phone.

543
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,920
I told you.

544
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,880
You'll be blind sooner or later. Now you know how good you are.

545
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,000
You've been playing with your phone a lot lately.

546
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,080
Don't you realise that you're depressed now?

547
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,600
You don't read or play basketball, and play with your phone every day.

548
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,880
I lost confidence.

549
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,080
You don't even look handsome.

550
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,280
Who said that?

551
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,920
My handsome face is covered by these fat meat.

552
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,880
When I lose weight, I’ll be

553
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,240
in Zhixiang City.

554
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,720
Right.

555
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,720
Before you were obsessed with your phone,

556
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,160
you were always confident and cheerful.

557
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,800
Okay.

558
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,720
I won't use my phone anymore.

559
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,920
Study hard.

560
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,560
I'm back to my handsome, handsome, confident and cheerful look.

561
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,800
That's right.

562
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,680
From now on,

563
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,240
so that you can focus on your studies.

564
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,960
You can't use your phone

565
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,200
during class.

566
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,920
Please write your names on your phones.

567
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,560
