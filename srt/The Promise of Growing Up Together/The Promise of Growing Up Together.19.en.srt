1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,960
Come on. Come on.

3
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,600
Me too.

4
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,200
Ruoxi.

5
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,920
What's the relationship

6
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,000
What's your relationship with her?

7
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,520
Answer me.

8
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,880
She's my girlfriend.

9
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,160
Natmmy.

10
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,160
Your iced watermelon is ready.

11
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,680
This is my wish.

12
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,240
I'll leave it with you.

13
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,920
When your wish comes true,

14
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,640
you can return the stars to me.

15
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,760
I want to go to the film academy with Xiammy.

16
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:37,640
I want to go to the film academy with her.

17
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:53,520
I want to go to the film academy with her.

18
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,400
Please bless me.

19
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,840
There will be times

20
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,880
and go straight to the sail to help the world.

21
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,920
All seniors and seniors in grade 12

22
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,720
May you have a good college entrance exam

23
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,360
The top of the exam.

24
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,080
Come on! Come on!

25
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,920
It's a rare chance to fight in life.

26
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,000
My generation is a playboy.

27
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,360
A sword sharpened in ten years.

28
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,600
It must be sharp when it comes out of the sheath.

29
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,680
Thank you for your blessings.

30
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,320
Let's see

31
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,080
The future depends on you.

32
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,360
Come on! Come on!

33
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,680
The determination of seniors and seniors.

34
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,480
I believe you've felt it.

35
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,320
They will bring our blessings to the battlefield.

36
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,880
Should we keep working hard

37
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,840
with their expectations?

38
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,680
Yes.

39
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,480
Yes, come on.

40
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,800
Let's go, students.

41
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Go back to our battlefield.

42
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,560
Work hard.

43
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,159
Let's make another one.

44
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,760
This is too strict.

45
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,000
Sorry.

46
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,560
I was in a hurry.

47
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,400
Read your book.

48
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,120
Where did you see?

49
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,320
Here?

50
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,160
Let me see this.

51
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,920
Tears.

52
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,600
Monitor.

53
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,040
Xia Mi.

54
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,920
Why do you take the liberal arts exam?

55
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,480
I want to be a screenwriter at the film academy.

56
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,440
This is necessary.

57
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,760
Let me learn first.

58
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,760
In that case,

59
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,919
you and Ruoxi will go to the same university.

60
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,080
Looks like you've found your goal.

61
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,720
Good luck.

62
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,840
We're looking forward to your work.

63
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,480
Of course.

64
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,680
When I become a famous screenwriter,

65
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
I'll make you all my guest actors.

66
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
What took you so long?

67
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,440
So stingy.

68
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,200
Why do you want to be the male lead?

69
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,160
You can get an Oscar first.

70
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
My play can't be performed by a friend card.

71
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,760
Fine.

72
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,680
In order to act as Mr. Xia,

73
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,120
I have to work hard.

74
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,080
I envy you.

75
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,760
You can find your dreams.

76
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,840
Unlike me,

77
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't even know

78
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,840
where I'm going in the future.

79
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,840
Is he still bullying you?

80
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,240
No.

81
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,760
I was just wondering which college I should go to.

82
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,000
and where to go.

83
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,720
Even...

84
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,920
whether I can go to college

85
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,080
is the same.

86
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,120
How is that possible?

87
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,680
You have good grades.

88
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,320
you won't worry about getting into a good university.

89
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,520
Don't be afraid.

90
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
Just be yourself.

91
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,960
You still have me.

92
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,720
Let's not think too much.

93
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,080
Do whatever you want.

94
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,480
Go ahead bravely.

95
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,760
Go! Go!

96
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,640
Chen Sijian.

97
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,960
Lin Ruotear.

98
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,000
Zuo Wei.

99
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,200
Li Xiang.

100
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,040
Sorry.

101
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,480
I'll pick it up.

102
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,240
This mock exam is much harder than before.

103
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,440
It's normal that your grades can't go up.

104
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,760
Don't be discouraged.

105
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,320
Look

106
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,240
When you do this,

107
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
you can't be anxious.

108
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,040
You need to figure out your thoughts one by one and interrogate the questions.

109
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,440
Put this in.

110
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,960
Then I asked for the answer.

111
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,760
Thank you.

112
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,240
You're welcome.

113
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,520
By the way,

114
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,240
There are many ways to go to school by yourself.

115
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,400
As long as you want.

116
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,960
Thank you, Monitor.

117
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,960
I'm going out.

118
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,000
Drama.

119
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,000
Sadness.

120
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,760
It's literally

121
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,520
Xiammy.

122
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,080
Ruoxi.

123
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,920
Monitor, what brings you here?

124
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,760
Is there something important?

125
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,920
Not really.

126
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm listening to her writing.

127
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,520
My English score is so low.

128
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,720
I just want to take the time to recuperate.

129
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,000
Got it.

130
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,720
After all, you are going to the same school.

131
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,200
This is the summary of liberal arts math knowledge from grade 1 to grade 12.

132
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,880
I hope I can help you in the future.

133
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,440
You can watch it together.

134
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
Of course Ruoxi doesn't need it.

135
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,520
Consider it a supplement.

136
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,480
Take a look.

137
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,120
I didn't do it.

138
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,840
Thank you.

139
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Monitor.

140
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,520
You'll spoil us if you treat us so well.

141
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,360
This is for you.

142
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,200
Chocolate.

143
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
Take one when you're tired.

144
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,240
There's a surprise.

145
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,680
Surprise!

146
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,600
Monitor

147
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,560
What day is it today?

148
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,680
Why did you send us so many things?

149
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,520
Did something happen?

150
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,800
Why all of a sudden?

151
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,120
give us gifts so formally?

152
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,760
What can happen

153
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,000
I did it in the handmade class.

154
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,920
I thought it was hard for you to review.

155
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,720
to reward you.

156
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,880
If I knew you were so nervous,

157
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
I wouldn't have given it to you.

158
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,400
No.

159
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,000
What happened?

160
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,560
Why are you two acting weird?

161
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,440
It's a thousand.

162
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,760
It's okay.

163
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,440
I thought Fan Yuan would tell me next.

164
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,760
Peach Blossom Pool is so deep.

165
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,600
It's not as deep as Ruoxi's love.

166
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,880
Let me see

167
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,800
What kind of joke can Monitor Fan Yuan write?

168
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,480
Here.

169
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,560
By the way,

170
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,640
how is your review

171
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,640
How is your review going?

172
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,040
You have a bright future.

173
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,920
Let me tell you.

174
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,360
In this math elementary exam,

175
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
I got 130.

176
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,720
It's an unprecedented result.

177
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,520
Really?

178
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
She has improved a lot.

179
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,200
She only got 130 scores once.

180
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,240
She always says

181
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,120
Now,

182
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,680
I just need to draw a banner at the entrance of the teaching building

183
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,040
to the public.

184
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,960
Monitor, don't listen to him.

185
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,400
He'll exaggerate the fact.

186
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,120
Even if I want to draw a banner,

187
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,880
I'll do it when I make the top in the imperial examination.

188
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,600
When are you going to make it?

189
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,280
Of course.

190
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,480
I'll wait for the day you become the top student.

191
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,120
to see how big your banner is.

192
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,040
It's big.

193
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,040
How big?

194
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,200
How big is it?

195
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,160
Rammy.

196
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,360
I got my report card.

197
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,000
Really?

198
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,520
Let me see.

199
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,240
Guess your ranking.

200
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,440
Tell me.

201
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,080
Guess.

202
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,040
Go ahead.

203
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:52,960
Number one.

204
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,040
Ruoxi Zhang.

205
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,840
Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

206
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,680
The third place.

207
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,880
Not bad, Xiammy.

208
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,440
You are the third in the class.

209
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,960
Hang in there.

210
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,079
If you push Tian Jiarong away,

211
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,760
our names will be lined up.

212
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,720
Who wants to be with you?

213
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,319
My goal is to surpass you.

214
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,480
I want to be the first.

215
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,119
Xiammy.

216
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,079
Xiammy.

217
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,800
Xiammy.

218
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,720
Look.

219
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,000
The Elite List.

220
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,400
You are No.19 this time.

221
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,280
Not bad.

222
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,599
I won't call you a stupid pig anymore.

223
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,040
You're the stupid pig.

224
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,680
You're the number one, stupid pig.

225
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,040
I'm the first, stupid pig.

226
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,200
You're the third, stupid pig.

227
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,240
Ruo tears.

228
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,000
Ruo tears.

229
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,600
Actually, I just read your final exam paper.

230
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,760
In fact, you've improved a lot in math this time.

231
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,520
But the main problem is physics and chemistry.

232
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,520
I think you can

233
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,320
you can do more tests to improve yourself.

234
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,280
It's okay.

235
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,520
Don't worry. Take your time.

236
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,880
Monitor

237
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
My math score has improved.

238
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,560
Thanks to you.

239
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,440
Without you,

240
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,800
I really don't know what to do.

241
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,720
Don't cry.

242
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,240
Ruotear.

243
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,680
The four of us are good friends.

244
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,000
We should help each other

245
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,200
And the monitor is not that petty

246
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,760
You're welcome

247
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,080
Yes, Ruotear.

248
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,560
You don't have to be so polite.

249
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,440
Am I too serious, monitor?

250
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,680
Did I scare you?

251
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,560
No.

252
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,040
The final exam is almost over.

253
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,840
Let's go to Mount Lushan to see the sunrise.

254
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,400
Call Wang Xiao Yu and Xiao Junyi.

255
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,480
Sure.

256
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,320
Everyone is under a lot of pressure recently.

257
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,760
Let's go out for a walk.

258
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,280
Okay?

259
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,560
Okay.

260
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,840
Look, it's so beautiful.

261
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I told you the temperature difference between day and night is huge.

262
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,080
I asked you to bring a coat.

263
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,880
You don't believe me?

264
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,360
I thought it was July.

265
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,040
How cold can it be?

266
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,200
What if you give me your coat?

267
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,600
I'm not afraid of the cold.

268
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,280
If I catch a cold,

269
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,240
if I catch a cold.

270
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,960
The sun hasn't come out yet?

271
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,120
Tears.

272
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,520
Where's your coat?

273
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,440
I got dirty in the bathroom.

274
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,120
Don't you dare let me out.

275
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,880
Ruo tears.

276
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,280
Here.

277
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,520
It's okay.

278
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,880
The sun will come out soon.

279
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,240
Put it on.

280
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,840
Boys are much more anti-cold than girls.

281
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,200
Thank you.

282
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,280
Can I borrow your coat?

283
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,240
I'm cold.

284
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Xiao Junyi.

285
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,520
Do you want to hear yourself?

286
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,600
How can a boy borrow a girl's coat?

287
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,840
Anyway,

288
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,760
You're not a girl.

289
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,680
Don't hit me.

290
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,560
I'm sorry.

291
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,960
Watch the steps.

292
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,640
Slow down.

293
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,280
It's almost time.

294
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,480
Look.

295
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,800
Really.

296
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,240
Hurry.

297
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,680
I...

298
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,240
Natmmy.

299
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,160
will become the best screenwriter in the world.

300
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,240
[Jang Ruohee]

301
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,000
I want to be the best actress.

302
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,920
You can do it.

303
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,720
I want to be the best mathematician.

304
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
I must get into a good university by myself.

305
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,000
I want to make a lot of money.

306
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,680
and become a big boss.

307
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,200
I want to travel around the world.

308
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,080
I want to go to Weiming Lake.

309
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,120
I can definitely go to Peking University.

310
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,840
I want to go to a good university

311
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,280
and find a good job

312
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,200
and let my parents live a good life.

313
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,440
Yoo Dayou.

314
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,800
I want to date in college.

315
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,240
Stop it.

316
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,320
I hope everyone's wishes will come true.

317
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,360
You can do it

318
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,760
Monitor

319
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,640
Why are you alone?

320
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,760
Where are the others?

321
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,080
I think Ruoxi went to the bathroom.

322
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
I don't know where Ruotear and Dayou are.

323
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,520
Here.

324
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,400
Thank you.

325
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,880
I'll take it for you.

326
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,840
Three, two.

327
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,320
Okay.

328
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,600
Let me have a look

329
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,040
Let me see.

330
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,200
I saw you wandering around the world alone.

331
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,120
What are you thinking about?

332
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,440
I'm thinking

333
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,880
what we will look like

334
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,400
ten years later?

335
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,800
Mr. Writer.

336
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,480
Show your imagination.

337
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,040
Ten years later,

338
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,120
you should be doing a classy experiment

339
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,320
in a classified lab.

340
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,640
The kind that no one can find you when your phone is off.

341
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,360
Zhang Ruoxi.

342
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,920
I think she's on an announcement.

343
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,520
Maybe there are many fans behind him.

344
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,680
I must be at home

345
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,320
at home.

346
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,000
She didn't shower or wash her hair for a week.

347
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,400
As for Ruotear,

348
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,440
Why do you think so?

349
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,640
I'm not talking nonsense.

350
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,760
I've seen many interviews from great scriptwriters.

351
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,240
They didn't take a shower for half a month.

352
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,200
It seems that

353
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,960
in the future.

354
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,120
I feel sorry for you.

355
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,720
Don't pity me.

356
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,400
Although I sacrificed my image,

357
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,280
my work won a great victory.

358
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,720
Maybe I can win the award.

359
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,600
I've been in the lab for ten days.

360
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,760
It's time to come out.

361
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,960
When you came out of the lab,

362
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,600
you saw the good news of my work winning.

363
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,920
Then we can have hotpot together.

364
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,280
and drank a lot.

365
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,720
You like drinking?

366
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,600
Actually, I haven't.

367
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,120
I don't know if you like it.

368
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,440
But we'll be adults by then.

369
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,080
It's normal for adults to have a few drinks occasionally.

370
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,760
Then we can have hotpot first.

371
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,800
Then we can go to karaoke.

372
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,200
We can sing as much as we want.

373
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,320
No one cares about us anyway.

374
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,400
It's a deal.

375
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,840
You'll treat me to hotpot ten years later.

376
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
and sing for me.

377
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,360
The screenwriter treats me to hotpot and sing.

378
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,600
You have to take me with you.

379
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,880
You were a big star then. Why did you ask me to treat you?

380
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,440
So petty.

381
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,120
Trying to cheat?

382
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,040
Put it on.

383
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,440
My hands are sore.

384
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,520
You are so precious.

385
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,560
And Ruotear.

386
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Ten years later,

387
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,680
the four of us

388
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,360
have hotpot and sing until dawn.

389
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,720
If anyone is absent,

390
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,360
who buys instant noodles without seasoning?

391
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,480
Okay.

392
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,520
Okay.

393
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,840
Two, three.

394
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,960
Our promise is over.

395
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,240
Then...

396
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,320
Let's make a ten-year contract.

397
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,360
What appointment?

398
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,160
Ten years later.

399
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,800
Let's make a deal.

400
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,520
See you in ten years.

401
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,040
You must keep your promise.

402
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,160
That's

403
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,320
is the most romantic thing.

404
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,320
Okay.

405
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,840
If I break the contract,

406
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'll bite myself.

407
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,120
Why?

408
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,400
Because the person who broke the contract is a puppy.

409
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,120
I'm home.

410
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,800
Thank you for sending me home.

411
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,600
I'll go upstairs now.

412
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,600
Xiammy.

413
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,040
this summer vacation,

414
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,160
I'm going on a trip with my parents.

415
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,280
Maybe

416
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,280
I can't accompany you.

417
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,040
I thought something happened.

418
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,240
So the monitor doesn't want to leave us

419
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,960
It's just a trip

420
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,880
How long can I go?

421
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,240
It's not like we'll never come back.

422
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,760
We can still play together after school starts.

423
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,160
Right?

424
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,360
I'll go upstairs now.

425
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,640
Bye.

426
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,880
Bye.

427
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,160
Let's go.

428
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,280
Fan Yuan.

429
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,360
You still won't tell me the truth?

430
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,400
You still want to hide it from me?

431
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,200
Again?

432
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,240
What am I hiding from you?

433
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,880
By the way,

434
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,240
how are you feeling?

435
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,640
Don't change the subject.

436
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,960
Are you going on a vacation

437
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,960
or Germany?

438
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,320
You know.

439
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,760
Why are you acting in front of me?

440
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,800
You don't take me as your brother anymore?

441
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,520
What about you?

442
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,120
You're hiding something too.

443
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,680
You don't want to complain to me.

444
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,000
I just don't want to mention it again.

445
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
I know.

446
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,080
But since you know about this,

447
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,600
you should know

448
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,520
I've always liked her.

449
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,920
Didn't you say you'd go to Germany after high school?

450
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,800
Is it because of me and Rammy?

451
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,640
No.

452
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,080
It's none of your business.

453
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,040
Although

454
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,000
she only has eyes for you,

455
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,080
But don't be proud.

456
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,480
If we really want to compete fairly,

457
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,240
I may not lose to you.

458
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,440
Unfortunately,

459
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,120
I don't have a chance.

460
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,760
I'll go abroad in advance.

461
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,360
because my dad

462
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,760
showed my Math Olympiad grades to the professor of PoEn University.

463
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,960
The professor of PoEn University wants me to go there and learn from him.

464
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,480
My parents want me to go there as soon as possible.

465
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,960
Why didn't you tell her?

466
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,040
I'm afraid she'll be sad.

467
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,960
I was afraid to see her sad.

468
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,760
But when she finds out later,

469
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,720
she'll still be sad.

470
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,400
I have you.

471
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,200
Ruoxi.

472
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,160
Let's say I don't have the courage.

473
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,600
After I leave,

474
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,040
after I leave.

475
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,440
[and comfort her.]

476
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,720
Ruoxi Zhang.

477
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,960
You can solve anything.

478
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,400
Don't give up easily.

479
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,240
Amy. She's just

480
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,160
She looks like

481
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,000
on the outside.

482
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,720
She cares about everyone more than anyone else.

483
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,200
Don't worry.

484
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,200
She's not that fragile.

485
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,560
She's much braver and stronger than we thought.

486
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,560
And you.

487
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,840
Uncle and auntie.

488
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,240
Don't worry about me.

489
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,840
My mom is much better now.

490
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,200
The doctor said

491
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,960
you can be discharged after another week.

492
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,280
That's good.

493
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,200
Let's go.

494
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,120
Let's play a few more games before you leave.

495
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,760
Sudok.

496
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,760
Now

497
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,840
Afraid?

498
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,520
I'm afraid you'll lose badly.

499
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,200
Let's go.

500
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,240
You're late on the first day of school.

501
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,680
You didn't reply my messages.

502
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,360
What?

503
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,520
Monitor Rong, let me do it.

504
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,880
You don't know until you're in class.

505
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,560
Xiao Junyi.

506
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,080
Come here.

507
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,880
Let me ask you.

508
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,640
Did Ruoxi contact you?

509
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,560
No.

510
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,080
I called him at least ten times today, but he didn't answer.

511
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,400
If he comes to school tomorrow,

512
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,920
you have to talk to him.

513
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,280
Why didn't you ask for leave from Mr Qiao?

514
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,760
Mr Qiao looked for him the whole morning.

515
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,320
I don't know how he's the class monitor.

516
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,800
Class monitor Rong, calm down.

517
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,080
Ruoxi must be delayed by something.

518
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,800
I'm here to help him.

519
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,000
If you have any physical issues,

520
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,600
just come to me.

521
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,480
Okay?

522
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,360
Send out the information now.

523
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,880
There are many things to move.

524
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,400
No problem.

525
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,080
I'll get back to work.

526
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,680
Zhao Rui.

527
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,640
Is Fan Yuan really in Germany?

528
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,680
I hope it's fake too.

529
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,880
But Mr. Wang told me that himself.

530
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,760
But he hasn't finished his high school yet.

531
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,520
before he finished his high school.

532
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,280
It should be just a pre-examination.

533
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,639
But with his ability,

534
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,040
he'll be admitted sooner or later.

535
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,400
Who went to Germany?

536
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,080
Ruotear.

537
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,800
Aren't you familiar with Fan Yuan?

538
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Why don't you know?

539
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,440
Impossible.

540
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,199
Why did he go to Germany?

541
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,639
She really doesn't know.

542
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,360
I knew it.

543
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,239
They are not that close.

544
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,080
Fan Yuan has always been close to that girl in Class 6.

545
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,800
and didn't talk to her actively.

546
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,520
Why didn't you tell me Fan Yuan went to Germany to study?

547
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,639
Study abroad?

548
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,239
You're playing dumb again.

549
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,400
Why didn't you invite me to see Fan Yuan off?

550
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,960
You always say it better than singing.

551
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,720
You said I was your best friend.

552
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,920
You didn't even tell me he went abroad to study.

553
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,000
You mean...

554
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,240
the monitor went to Germany?

555
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,880
It's not the time, Natmmy.

556
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,520
Why are you still playing dumb?

557
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:12,880
I...

558
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,400
Didn't Fan Yuan tell you why he went to Germany?

559
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,880
why Fan Yuan went abroad?

560
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,840
What do you mean?

561
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,520
If you hadn't been pestering her,

562
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,520
do you think Fan Yuan would make friends with you?

563
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,280
Everyone in the school

564
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,760
There are many people who want to make friends with Fan Yuan.

565
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,360
You're just like a piece of plaster.

566
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,560
Nonsense!

567
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,040
You just think Fan Yuan is good to me.

568
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,280
I'm busy studying every day.

569
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,440
Who has time to pick on you?

570
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,720
Can you stop making yourself

571
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,120
like Mrs. Xianglin?

572
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,560
You are the most pitiful person in the world.

573
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,040
I don't even want to look at you.

574
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:49,800
You...

575
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,720
Lin Ruotear.

576
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,360
Fan Yuan went to Germany because of you.

577
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,480
If I were you,

578
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,720
I'll show my last bone

579
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,080
and never look for him again.

580
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,000
Shut up!

581
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,760
Ruotear, calm down.

582
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,920
What are you talking about?

583
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,000
Calm down.

584
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,200
You're totally siding with her now, aren't you?

585
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,760
Rammy.

586
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,000
I knew you never treat me as a friend.

587
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,760
Has she considered your feelings

588
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,080
after she knew Fan Yuan went abroad?

589
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,640
Lin Ruotear has never treated you as her friend.

590
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,960
Wake up.

591
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,920
Hello.

592
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,040

[The person you have reached is not available.]

596
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,120

597
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,880
Let's go.

598
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,240
Be careful.

599
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,880
No hurry.

600
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Pay attention to the threshold.

601
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,360
Watch the steps.

602
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,320
Okay.

603
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,320
Put it beside that table.

604
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,000
Brother.

605
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,520
Where are you going to move your stuff?

606
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,560
Not where.

607
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,040
It's a new owner.

608
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,440
He wants us to

609
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,360
to throw them away.

610
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,000
What about the original owner?

611
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,280
We don't know.

612
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,840
Get a packaging car.

613
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,840
I...

614
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,040
want

615
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,280
Call.

624
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,280

I'm sorry.

629
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,560
I'm sorry.

630
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,600
Mi Mi is back.

631
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,280
Why are you back so late?

632
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,000
Did you go out with that kid?

633
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,080
Mimi.

634
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,600
What's wrong with her?

635
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,040
Mimi.

636
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,560
Don't scare me.

637
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,120
Did you quarrel with your classmates?

638
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,680
Miss Xiammy.

639
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,680
Miss Xiammy.

640
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,120
Did Ruoxi contact you?

641
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,400
Did you contact her?

642
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,840
Tissue.

643
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,880
My dad told me

644
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,760
your mum is in the hospital.

645
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,240
Go see him.

646
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,080
He should be here too.

647
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,840
He's not doing well.

648
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,800
If you go,

649
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,240
he might be happier.

650
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,080
Thank you.

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,800

But

654
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,680
your mom's condition isn't very good.

655
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
You and your dad

656
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,960
be mentally prepared.

657
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
Don't worry.

658
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,000
Auntie will get better.

659
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,360
She will.

660
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,200
You'll be fine.

661
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,680
You'll be fine.

662
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,840
I'm fine. I'm just too tired.

663
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,440
Nonsense.

664
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,240
Ruoxi.

665
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,920
Don't act tough.

666
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,240
Don't carry it alone.

667
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,600
You can tell us anything.

668
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,040
We'll help you.

669
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,800
I'm not acting tough.

670
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,120
Really.

671
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,720
Didn't you just get off school?

672
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,280
Go home and do your homework.

673
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,440
