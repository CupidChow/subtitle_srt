1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on. Come on.

2
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,640
No.

3
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,640
Why are we hiding from the lab?

4
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,960
Isn't this a trap?

5
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,759
Where's your turtle shell?

6
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,240
It's not the time to joke.

7
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,040
Don't worry.

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,720
The corridor is an exit.

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,760
Mr. Dai will think we’re going there.

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,280
The most dangerous place is the safest.

11
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,840
I'll give you two one last chance.

12
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,640
to come out and fight for leniency.

13
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,040
If I catch you myself,

14
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,320
the whole school will criticize you tomorrow.

15
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,880
Young man, the most dangerous place is the safest.

16
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,960
I didn't expect him to predict my prediction.

17
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,400
What should we do now?

18
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,960
I'll distract him

19
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,800
before you run.

20
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,240
Put it on.

21
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,960
Hide and don't get caught.

22
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,160
Ruoxi Zhang!

23
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,280
Stop!

24
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,520
Stop!

25
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,200
Why isn't she back yet? Did she get caught?

26
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,640
Zhang Ruoxi.

27
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,720
You're finally back.

28
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,440
Did Mr. Dai find you?

29
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,560
Go.

30
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,960
He'll be here soon.

31
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,560
What?

32
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,960
Wait.

33
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm exhausted.

34
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,480
Let me tell you.

35
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,120
I must have had a grudge against Mr. Dai in my previous life.

36
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,840
That’s why I’m always pursued by him.

37
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't think you're just enemies.

38
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,120
It could be a natural enemy.

39
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,200
Have you seen a cat and a mouse?

40
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,120
Don’t you think Mr. Dai looks like that cat?

41
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,920
You mean Tom and Jerry?

42
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,680
That's right.

43
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,960
It's quite vivid.

44
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,440
No.

45
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,840
I'm a mouse?

46
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,520
Yes.

47
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,120
Fool.

48
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,360
I finally found it.

49
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,760
Push me!

50
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,280
Oh no!

51
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,000
I forgot about the monitor.

52
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,160
Monitor!

53
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,840
Sorry, I'm late.

54
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,280
You...

55
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,440
Why did you lose your shoes?

56
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,080
We met Mr. Dai on the way.

57
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,880
He ran after us.

58
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Then my shoes ran away.

59
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,880
Mr. Dai.

60
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,640
Why did Mr. Dai chase you?

61
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,440
You broke the school rules and discipline.

62
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,360
No, no.

63
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,440
I'll give you back my shoes.

64
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,000
You don't have to.

65
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,400
Aren't you going to the library?

66
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,560
Give it back to me. What are you wearing?

67
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,240
You can't wear without shoes.

68
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,280
Leave me alone.

69
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,840
No, no, no.

70
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,280
I'll give it back to you.

71
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,440
It's okay.

72
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,080
Xiammy.

73
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,240
Have a seat.

74
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,280
You too.

75
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,280
One of your shoes doesn't fit your feet.

76
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,720
One walking barefoot for so long must be uncomfortable.

77
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,080
Take a break.

78
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,640
Let's talk about the library tomorrow.

79
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,120
I have an appointment with my teacher.

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll go find him.

81
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,159
Is the monitor upset?

82
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,360
It's all my fault.

83
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,040
I wasted his time.

84
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,360
You think too much.

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,000
Is Fan Yuan that petty?

86
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,520
You can help him find his reference book tomorrow.

87
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,560
Fan Yuan.

88
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,800
Go back to study.

89
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,760
Fan Yuan.

90
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,520
Fan Yuan.

91
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,520
I heard the school made an exception for you to participate in the math competition.

92
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,520
Is it true?

93
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,360
What?

94
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,640
I participated in an encyclopedia knowledge competition.

95
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
I also participated in that.

96
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,080
It's quite simple.

97
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:32,960
Awesome.

98
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,360
Come on.

99
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,440
Wait.

100
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,840
Let me tell you. Math competition.

101
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,200
Why are you talking about the pediatrics competition?

102
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,960
Besides, we are both freshman.

103
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,640
Why are you the only one in the school?

104
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,560
I'm not convinced.

105
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,040
If you're not convinced,

106
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,320
go straight ahead and turn right.

107
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,720
Go to the office and discuss with the teacher.

108
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
I'm going back to the classroom to study at night.

109
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,680
OK?

110
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,440
Why do you need to study at night?

111
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:53,960
How about this?

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,040
Go to Mr. Wang's place with me.

113
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's compete again.

114
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,040
If I win,

115
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,920
I'll take the place for the competition.

116
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,320
Let's go.

117
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,920
No.

118
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,000
Dayou.

119
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,200
Thank you, Xiammy.

120
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,000
Chen Simin.

121
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,080
Thank you.

122
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,120
Lin Yuting.

123
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,520
Thank you.

124
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,080
Jia Rong.

125
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,320
Thank you, Xiammy.

126
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,360
Why didn't the monitor come to the evening study?

127
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,800
Is he still mad at me?

128
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,320
I hate 800 meters.

129
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,200
Fan Yuan.

130
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,880
Did you dig the mine last night?

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,440
I can even punch you in your mouth.

132
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,360
Ruoxi.

133
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,840
Everyone else cares about me.

134
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,760
Only you laughed at me.

135
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,200
Don't you feel guilty?

136
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,000
What is conscience?

137
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,360
Can it eat?

138
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,520
My fist is delicious. Do you want some?

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,480
Try it.

140
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,320
Here.

141
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,640
What?

142
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
It can relieve your fatigue.

143
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
For the sake of the drink,

144
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,120
I'll spare your life for now.

145
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,880
Thank you, heroine.

146
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,960
Please forgive me.

147
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,280
All of you.

148
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,480
Stand still.

149
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,440
Recently, puppy love in our school

150
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
is getting stronger.

151
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,280
Last afternoon at the artificial lake,

152
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,800
in the artificial lake yesterday afternoon.

153
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,040
If you're still a little ambitious,

154
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,920
you can turn yourself in

155
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,200
to turn yourself in.

156
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,560
I hope you can take care of yourself.

157
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,960
Rammy.

158
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
This is not yours.

159
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,120
Lower your voice.

160
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
I’ll be doomed if Mr. Dai hears it.

161
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,840
The four students in front.

162
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,440
Stop!

163
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,760
Yes, you four.

164
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,520
What should I do?

165
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,240
Don't be afraid.

166
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,520
He didn't see his face yesterday.

167
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,640
Just don't admit it.

168
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Get your clothes ready.

169
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,280
Turn back.

170
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,080
Did you two go to the artificial lake yesterday?

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,040
No, I haven't.

172
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,720
Me neither.

173
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,480
Your shoes are over 30 size.

174
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,680
Sir, I'm size 45.

175
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,280
I didn't ask you.

176
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,200
Male woman.

177
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,800
Xiao Junyi, give it back to me.

178
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Isn't that her shoes?

179
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,840
That's...

180
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,400
Shut up!

181
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,960
Are you going to sell both Chief Guardian and Ruoxi?

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,320
Why are you two standing so close?

183
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,160
Stand separately.

184
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,240
What shoes?

185
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,480
Whose shoes?

186
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,520
What should I do?

187
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
Did we get caught?

188
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,160
It's okay.

189
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,720
Whose shoes?

190
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
It's my shoes.

191
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,360
I wear size 36.

192
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,200
Let's see if you have tight skin.

193
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,480
Stand aside.

194
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,760
I'm glad you didn't go.

195
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
Don't go there again.

196
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,360
Got it?

197
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,520
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,560
Don't worry. I'm not familiar with him at all.

199
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,320
We're not familiar with him at all.

200
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
I'll definitely take a detour when I see the artificial lake.

201
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,160
I won't go anywhere except the classroom canteen and the basketball court.

202
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,200
I'm talking about the new style of the civilization tree.

203
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,680
I want to be a Pacesetter in the new era.

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,160
If he goes east, I'll go west.

205
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,120
She takes the Yangguan Road.

206
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,960
I'll take the single-plank bridge.

207
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,160
We'll never be together anyway.

208
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,440
That's more like it.

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,160
You're quite prepared.

210
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,200
You two should have the same thought.

211
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,120
Don't get close.

212
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,920
Understand?

213
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,360
Okay.

214
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,320
Okay.

215
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,360
All of you.

216
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Go back to class for morning self-study.

217
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,920
Goodbye, teacher.

218
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,320
Put on your uniform.

219
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,840
What was that? I don't want to talk to you.

220
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,120
Why are you doing this?

221
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,520
Good morning, Monitor.

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,440
Morning.

223
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,680
Why didn't you come to the evening self-study class yesterday?

224
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,040
I left you a drink. Did you get it?

225
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,440
What is it?

226
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,240
I didn't see it.

227
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,480
Didn't you see it?

228
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,680
I put it on your desk.

229
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,000
Did someone take it?

230
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,400
What about me?

231
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,280
I only got this from Gugu.

232
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,480
I didn't see anything else.

233
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,880
Monitor.

234
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,520
Are you kidding me?

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,480
You smiled.

236
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,000
You're not angry anymore.

237
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,040
Rammy.

238
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,440
I'm not mad at you.

239
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,280
Don't comfort me.

240
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,840
Of course you're angry.

241
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,520
But it's okay.

242
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,760
It was my fault.

243
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,200
You should be angry.

244
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,720
No.

245
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,120
I was with Qin Zeyang last night.

246
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,880
So,

247
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,800
Were you waiting for my call last night?

248
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,880
Yes.

249
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,440
I wanted to apologize to you face to face,

250
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,520
But

251
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,480
you didn't reply, so I gave you a sticky note.

252
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,400
Sorry, Xiammy.

253
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,640
I should have replied earlier.

254
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,120
I won't do this again.

255
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,120
It's okay.

256
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,000
By the way,

257
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,160
Have you found the reference book you're looking for?

258
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,280
I'm free today.

259
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,560
Do you want me to help you look for it?

260
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,160
Not yet.

261
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,880
Come with me at noon.

262
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,560
No problem.

263
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,520
Namida, let's go to the library this afternoon.

264
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,080
I need your help.

265
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,360
Ruo tears.

266
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,200
Change to mine.

267
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,440
Mine is in the middle.

268
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,160
I'll get a ladder.

269
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,000
Thank you.

270
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,040
Amy.

271
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,160
You're so manly.

272
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,920
I wish you were my boyfriend.

273
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,080
I feel so secure.

274
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
Aren't you my girlfriend now?

275
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,120
Be careful.

276
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,680
Xiammy.

277
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,640
Are you okay?

278
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,320
Rammy, are you okay?

279
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,720
Are you okay?

280
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,960
Are you stupid?

281
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,160
You came here to be my human cushion.

282
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,400
What if you get hurt?

283
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,840
I can't just watch you fall down.

284
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,120
I should've picked it up.

285
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,240
I'm worried if you get hurt.

286
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,720
Why are you so reckless?

287
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,640
You can fall while walking.

288
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,640
How can you fall down with a book?

289
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,880
Are you brainless

290
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,840
or your brain?

291
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,120
It's okay this time. What about next time?

292
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,880
Do you think my head is basketball?

293
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,640
Hit me if you want.

294
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,760
Are you okay?

295
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,120
What happened just now?

296
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,000
She almost fell down with the book.

297
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,480
Is your hand okay, Natmmy?

298
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,560
Sorry.

299
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,680
I was thoughtless.

300
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,120
I don't want this book.

301
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
No. These are all what you need.

302
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,040
We have a brain here.

303
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,440
The brain is well developed.

304
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,520
Leave it to him.

305
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,560
Otherwise Ruotear and I will get hurt.

306
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,160
Let's go.

307
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,080
It's okay.

308
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,640
I'm here to help you anyway.

309
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,480
Go back to work.

310
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,160
Sorry.

311
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,920
Be careful!

312
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,880
The Devil Lord fell in love with me.

313
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,520
I just read it.

314
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,520
I don't read these books anymore.

315
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,200
You're the first one who dares to refute me.

316
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,800
Girl.

317
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,280
What's your name?

318
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,760
Ruoxi Zhang, why are you doing this? It's embarrassing.

319
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,800
Xiammy.

320
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,080
I remember.

321
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,560
From now on,

322
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
you're my personal servant.

323
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,640
Ruoxi Zhang.

324
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,120
Are you crazy?

325
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,520
From now on,

326
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,600
you can only see me in your eyes.

327
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,040
I forbid you to smile at others.

328
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,120
Do you hear me?

329
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,080
A man.

330
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,960
Don't challenge my patience.

331
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,520
What if I insist?

332
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm warning you.

333
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,600
Beg me now.

334
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,160
Otherwise,

335
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,800
don't cry and beg me.

336
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,880
You're playing with fire now.

337
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,240
Rammy.

338
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,080
Ruoxi did a good job.

339
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,400
You were so close.

340
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,560
Ruotear, monitor.

341
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,520
When did you come

342
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,200
When playing with fire.

343
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,080
Natmmy.

344
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Didn't you say you'll help the monitor with the book filling?

345
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
Why did you ask Ruoxi to hang out?

346
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,200
I'm sorry, Class Rep.

347
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,440
I'll go filling the book now.

348
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,600
I found the book. I'll get it for you.

349
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,600
Oh, Monitor.

350
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,000
Are you going to take the exam at Luxiang University next week?

351
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,920
I'll cheer for you.

352
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,720
Me too.

353
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,000
Thank you.

354
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,120
Next Saturday.

355
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,720
Xiammy.

356
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,080
It's really you.

357
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,320
It's you, Chul Myung.

358
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,280
Long time no see.

359
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,600
The exam starts at nine.

360
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,640
Why isn't he here yet?

361
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,560
#3

362
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,320
Fan Yuan UMBNESS

363
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,240
Where are you?

364
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,960
I'm

365
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,480
near Lulu Intersection.

366
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,920
The driver's car had a flat tire.

367
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,800
I didn't expect to meet you here.

368
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,960
What a coincidence.

369
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,640
Yes, it is.

370
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,200
Wait a minute.

371
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,640
Sir,

372
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,680
How long will it take to Luxiang University?

373
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,680
I don't know.

374
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
It'll take more than ten minutes.

375
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,240
Come on.

376
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,720
Okay.

377
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,160
Excuse me.

378
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,000
Can I borrow your bike?

379
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,760
I'll return it to you soon.

380
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,320
This is my classmate.

381
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,480
What's wrong?

382
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,600
Fan Yuan is trapped on the road.

383
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm going to pick him up.

384
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,520
Hurry up.

385
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,320
Take it.

386
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:22,960
Okay.

387
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,760
By the way,

388
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,840
The exam is coming.

389
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,600
You can go in first.

390
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,680
Okay.

391
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,480
I'm going to take the exam too.

392
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,320
Come on!

393
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,160
Come on.

394
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,480
Bye.

395
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,000
Be careful.

396
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,480
Sir.

397
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,160
I'll get off now.

398
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,880
Thank you.

399
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,200
Ruoxi.

400
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,880
Get in.

401
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,520
You're finally here

402
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,120
We're here. Hurry up, monitor.

403
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,880
Only two minutes left

404
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,440
Sorry to keep you waiting.

405
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,360
Go inside.

406
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,120
If you don't get the first place,

407
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
I'm sorry for running all the way.

408
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,560
Hurry up.

409
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,440
Come on. Come on.

410
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,440
Not bad.

411
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,520
I thought you wouldn't make it today.

412
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,640
You know who I am.

413
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,560
Would I let that happen?

414
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,160
How dare you!

415
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,760
Do you know the bicycle owner?

416
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,720
Yes.

417
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,040
Who is it?

418
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,120
Snack from Sha County.

419
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,360
Boss,

420
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,880
Two steamed dumplings please.

421
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,680
Two more

422
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,040
Boss, give me a steamed dumpling.

423
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,800
Sorry.

424
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,920
There's only one steamed dumpling left.

425
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,840
I ordered it first.

426
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,120
Hey,

427
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,720
Can you tell me first come first served?

428
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,120
Hey,

429
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,840
Come here.

430
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,720
Listen to me.

431
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,000
She practices sports.

432
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,760
like flying iron pancakes.

433
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,960
She can defeat two men 1.8 meters on her own.

434
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
I can't beat her.

435
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:24,840
Really?

436
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,440
Do you want to see my wound?

437
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,640
Boss, I don't want dumplings anymore.

438
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,480
Give me some noodles

439
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,440
Bro

440
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,200
Thank you for having such a tough friend.

441
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,120
It's okay.

442
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,560
If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell?

443
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,680
I don't want the noodles, either.

444
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,840
I don't want the money

445
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,160
You're so timid.

446
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,400
You want to jump the queue?

447
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,840
The soul of food in Sha County

448
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,080
is steamed dumplings.

449
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,280
Really?

450
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,720
This is mine.

451
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,600
Don't eat it.

452
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,080
You're so mean.

453
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,400
I didn't help you.

454
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,800
That bowl was already taken away.

455
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,960
How dare you say that?

456
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,280
I heard what you said about me.

457
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,800
I'll sue you for defamation.

458
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,520
Stomachache.

459
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,040
How did you end up like this

460
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,560
Gosh, it hurts.

461
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,400
Forget it.

462
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,560
I'll just send you some mercy.

463
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,840
I'll give you half.

464
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,760
Thank you.

465
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,000
Ruoxi.

466
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,200
You'll die if you don't bully me.

467
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,160
All right.

468
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,240
Here.

469
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,520
Be careful.

470
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,640
Your soul will get cold if you don't eat it.

471
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,360
Why isn't he coming out?

472
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,040
We're almost there.

473
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,160
Let's go. Let's go.

474
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,160
Thank you.

475
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,000
How did it go?

476
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,640
I can tell from his look that he's definitely confident.

477
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,560
Not bad, right?

478
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,120
Thanks to the reference books

479
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,240
for helping me find these reference books.

480
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,240
Thank you, Ruoxi.

481
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,280
Just buy me a meal.

482
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Remember.

483
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,440
Okay, it's my treat.

484
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,840
You decide what to eat.

485
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,080
I’ll tell you when I think of it.

486
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,760
Mi.

487
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,680
Chul Myung.

488
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,320
Good job.

489
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,600
I'm glad I met you today. You have a bike.

490
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Who is it?

491
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,360
Otherwise, he won't make it to the exam.

492
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,080
I want to know too.

493
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,360
Thank you.

494
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,920
You're welcome.

495
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,240
It's a piece of cake.

496
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,280
What?

497
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,960
Who is calling so intimately?

498
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,000
I forgot to introduce.

499
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,160
Let me introduce.

500
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,400
This is my neighbor when I was young.

501
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,800
He often tutors me.

502
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,040
He is a famous student in No. 2 High School now.

503
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,400
A straight A student.

504
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,600
Chul Myung.

505
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,280
This is Zhang Ruoxi.

506
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,280
His name is Fan Yuan, the class monitor.

507
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,800
They are my good friends.

508
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,240
Hello. Hello.

509
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,520
Hello.

510
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,360
My name is Lu Zhiming.

511
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,040
Since you are Mi’s friends,

512
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,200
you are also my friends.

513
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,120
Who is your friend?

514
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,440
Jiraiya.

515
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,680
Mi.

516
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,560
I have something else to do. I’m leaving.

517
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,200
How about this?

518
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,600
I'll visit you at your house during the holiday.

519
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,560
Sure.

520
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,960
Come to me anytime.

521
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,880
When you come, let my mom cook for you.

522
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,440
your favorite braised chicken leg.

523
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,800
She misses you too.

524
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,600
Okay, okay.

525
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,520
I'm leaving.

526
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,480
Welcome two new friends.

527
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,040
Bye, Chul Myung.

528
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,640
Bye.

529
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,280
Ruoxi Zhang.

530
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,160
What's wrong with you? You were rude to my friend.

531
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
That's because

532
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
doesn't match his aura.

533
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,360
Okay?

534
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:31,960
Monitor!

535
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,720
Let's go.

536
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,120
Rammy.

537
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,360
Is he still teaching you?

538
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:36,840
Wait.

539
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,800
Why does he always go to your house?

540
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,400
Why do your parents know him too?

541
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,480
Is he close to your parents?

542
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,800
I don't want to talk to you.

543
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,680
Why?

544
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,720
Enough, stop arguing.

545
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,120
You don't have to.

546
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,880
Ruoxi.

547
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,040
Help me pick up the pen.

548
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,120
Let me help you.

549
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,040
I can carry it myself. Ruoxi.

550
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,880
Another high marks essay?

551
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,520
Did you grow up eating essays?

552
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,880
It has high quality.

553
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
It would be great if I could really eat it.

554
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,080
Then I'll eat math and chemistry three times a day.

555
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,280
I won't be picky.

556
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,440
What's wrong?

557
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,200
Another problem?

558
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,320
How about this?

559
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,000
I'll sell my notes to you.

560
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,920
I'll give you a discount.

561
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,880
998.

562
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,480
A profiteer.

563
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,080
Do I look like a pushover?

564
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,280
My deskmate is the class monitor.

565
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,640
I can borrow his notes for free.

566
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,920
So what?

567
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,760
If I hadn't had other dreams,

568
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,560
I would save space for others to shine.

569
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,840
I'm the top student too.

570
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,240
Why are there so many cows flying in the sky?

571
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,480
It turns out someone blew it up.

572
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,640
I don't see your national treasure eyes anymore.

573
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,320
Why did you change the script?

574
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,560
Good eye.

575
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,600
It's done.

576
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,000
I sent it to the editor last week.

577
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,040
He said it was good.

578
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,360
It's ready to be published.

579
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,760
We have an appointment for next month's manuscript.

580
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,760
Not bad.

581
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,120
I told you it'll work with my luck.

582
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,280
Talk nicely.

583
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,640
Can you stop touching me?

584
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,200
What?

585
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,560
Well, great writer,

586
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,160
Can I think about where to go?

587
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,320
Go ahead.

588
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,480
After you think about it, I'll ask where Ruotear and the monitor want to go.

589
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,160
Isn't it just the two of us?

590
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,880
It'll be livelier if there are more people.

591
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,720
No why

592
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,520
Class is about to start.

593
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,920
I'm going to send my essay.

594
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,080
Let me help you.

595
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,400
I have something to announce before class.

596
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,040
The school wants to shoot a school promotional video.

597
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,280
Our class was chosen as a demonstration class.

598
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,320
The male and female lead

599
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,720
are Zhang Ruoxi and Lin Ruotear.

600
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,920
The shooting will be set tomorrow.

601
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,440
Please get ready.

602
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,440
You're amazing.

603
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,080
Sir.

604
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,560
Is there another way to compete for the leading roles?

605
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,160
Sir.

606
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,320
What are the criteria?

607
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,520
If it's based on the results,

608
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,280
it's fine for Ruoxi Zhang.

609
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,600
Lin Ruotear,

610
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,280
is not the best student.

611
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,520
If we choose according to the character,

612
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,160
it should be fair to vote.

613
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,000
You two sit down first.

614
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,880
This is decided by the school.

615
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,760
Ruoxi and Lin Ruotear

616
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,680
are both good students with good grades.

617
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,280
And they have good image.

618
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,560
The teachers agree that

619
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,600
they are very suitable to be the ambassadors of the school.

620
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,080
That means

621
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,920
Even the teacher thinks they're a good match.

622
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,200
Judging from their appearance,

623
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,240
They do look good together.

624
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,200
Look, their names are symmetrical.

625
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,400
Right.

626
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,320
Even the name is the same.

627
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,880
Right?

628
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,560
Sir.

629
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,160
Except for the male and female lead,

630
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,440
do other students need to be on camera?

631
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,200
Yes.

632
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
Should we prepare some talent shows?

633
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,520
I don't know how to play and play,

634
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,120
but I can do it

635
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,040
I can learn it now.

636
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,680
Don't worry.

637
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,280
Everyone has a chance to be on camera.

638
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,200
So today,

639
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,760
try not to dirty your uniform.

640
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,040
As for the details,

641
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,520
in the afternoon activity class.

642
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,800
Zhang Ruoxi.

643
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,280
Lin Ruotear.

644
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,680
Come with me to the administrative building to meet the director after class.

645
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,960
Yes, sir.

646
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,280
Let's start the class.

647
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,640
Turn to page 70.

648
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,440
Xiammy.

649
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,520
Xiammy.

650
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,440
Xiammy, where are you going?

651
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,480
Does that mean

652
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,240
Even the teacher thinks they're a good match.

653
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,920
Judging from their appearance,

654
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,000
They do look good together.

655
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,000
Look at their names.

656
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,520
Xiammy, wait for me.

657
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,000
Xiammy.

658
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,000
What's wrong with you?

659
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Ruo tears.

660
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,120
Rammy.

661
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,800
I was calling you just now.

662
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,920
but you ignored me.

663
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,000
I thought something happened to you.

664
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,639
I'm fine.

665
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,159
I just want to feel how it feels to get wet.

666
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,920
You should go back to the dorm or you'll get sick.

667
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
You scared me.

668
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,440
I thought something happened to you.

669
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,760
That's good.

670
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
I'll get wet with you.

671
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,120
Zhang Ruoxi.

672
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,520
Why are you here?

673
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,040
I was waiting for you.

674
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,040
What's up?

675
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,760
Go take a shower.

676
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,360
Don't worry about me.

677
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,160
Go.

678
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,120
I'll be right down.

679
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,360
Ruoxi.

680
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,200
Put it on. You'll catch a cold.

681
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,200
Why did you come down so soon?

682
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,920
You didn't dry your hair.

683
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,640
You'll have a headache.

684
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,600
I'm just afraid

685
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,320
someone might catch a cold and blame me.

686
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,880
Tell me.

687
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
What is it?

688
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,200
Let's talk over there.

689
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,080
Did you get wet in the rain

690
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,160
because of the promotional video?

691
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,360
I'm not upset.

692
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,240
I was too happy to get wet.

693
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,360
It's about the heroine in the promotional video.

694
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,600
It's no big deal.

695
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,120
Here, I'll give you an award.

696
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,000
Grand prize.

697
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,960
Now,

698
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,080
I'll announce

699
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,080

700
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,120

Xiammy.

702
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,480
Ruoxi Zhang.

703
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,240
Don't exaggerate.

704
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,040
There's more.

705
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Don't peek.

706
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,560
Are you surprised?

707
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
What surprise?

708
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,480
That's more like a surprise.

709
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,760
So ugly.

710
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,520
Since it's so ugly,

711
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,000
if it can wear it on your head,

712
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,920
it will be its lifetime honor.

713
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,000
Miss Xiammy,

714
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,080
will you give it this chance?

715
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,440
Since you are so sincere,

716
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,080
I'll give it a chance.

717
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,840
