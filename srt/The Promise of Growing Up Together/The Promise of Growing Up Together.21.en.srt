1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,759
Dear students,

3
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,039
100 days left,

4
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,840
you will enter the exam room.

5
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,280
100 days.

6
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,039
In the history

7
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,240
it was just a short moment.

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,560
But it means a lot to us.

9
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,400
It's hard to change.

10
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,360
What should we do

11
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,080
what should we do

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,120
without regret?

13
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,840
without regret.

14
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
Here,

15
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,760
I have a few suggestions.

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,400
for you.

17
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,240
Lastly,

18
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,000
I have something to tell you.

19
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,400
Getting into a university

20
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,640
is important,

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,480
but it's not the only important thing in life.

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,640
The most important thing

23
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,800
is to live healthy.

24
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Only by living

25
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,040
can everything be possible.

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
Only by living

27
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,560
can you see the beauty of the world.

28
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,880
So,

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,520
if there's a problem,

30
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,240
I hope you don’t bear it alone.

31
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,440
and ask for help from Division Commander.

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,640
Remember,

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,520
You're not fighting alone.

34
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,480
The last one.

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,920
I wish you all good grades.

36
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,440
Thank you for your sincere words and encouragement.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,840
Le,

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,440
Next,

39
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,240
let's begin

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
the oath ceremony.

41
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,360
Please raise your right hand with me.

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,720
12 years of hard study will pass in a blink of an eye.

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,800
We are going to the battlefield of the college entrance exam.

44
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,560
12 years of hard study is fleeting

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,960
We are going to take the college entrance exam

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,720
Here,

47
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,760
we swear in the name of youth.

48
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,520
In the name of youth,

49
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,960
From today on,

50
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,280
every second.

51
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,440
Cherish time.

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,440
From now on,

53
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,760
every second.

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,120
Cherish time.

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,840
overcome difficulties with sweat and will.

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,920
Use wisdom and methods

57
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,360
with wisdom and methods.

58
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Fight with wisdom and methods.

59
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,960
I won’t let you down.

60
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,680
and live up to our parents' expectations.

61
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
for a hundred days.

62
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,160
and make the top name.

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,519
for 100 days.

64
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,560
and become the top student.

65
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,800
I wish you

66
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,840
win.

67
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,240
All the roads pass.

68
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,800
To the glory

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,720
Thank you.

70
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:58,480
Victory

71
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,640
Goodbye, teacher. Goodbye.

72
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,040
B.

73
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,960
This is the lucky sign my mom asked for.

74
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,040
It will make your grades better.

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,560
This is the power of faith.

76
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,280
In 2016, the school recruitment exam of the top high school in Japan

77
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,640
In 2016, General High School Recruitment Exam of the National Unification Exam, the old point of the first school in the city.

78
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,920
Mimi.

79
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,440
Don't be nervous.

80
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,920
No matter what your exam is,

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,040
we love you.

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,800
Stop talking. The more you talk, the more nervous she is.

83
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,560
Rammy.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,680
Listen to me.

85
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,440
I'm sure you'll do well in the exam.

86
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
My Xia's daughter is so smart.

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,840
Xia! Mom!

88
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,080
Investigate immediately.

89
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,840
I think you are more nervous.

90
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,200
I've got the answer right.

91
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,200
Probably.

92
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,920
No problem.

93
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,800
Number: 0521.

94
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,080
Number: 0521.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
608.

96
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,560
608.

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,960
You're more than qualified to go to the film academy.

98
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,720
Xia's family also has a college student with 600 marks.

99
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,560
I'm going to tell them the good news.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,520
I'm leaving.

101
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,280
I'll also call

102
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,920
and aunt.

103
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,840
Yes.

104
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,760
Mimi scored 608.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,120
There's no need to hold the wine.

106
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,480
We can have a meal together to celebrate.

107
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,240
Not too high.

108
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,800
It's just around 600.

109
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,640
985 and 211

110
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,720
should be fine.

111
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,800
But

112
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,480
she wants to study scriptwriter at the film academy.

113
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,760
We'll do whatever she wants.

114
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,440
As long as she's happy.

115
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,920
This is my wish.

116
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,480
I'll leave it with you.

117
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,880
When it comes true,

118
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,720
give the stars back to me.

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,960
The moon is still beautiful tonight.

120
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,560
But Zhang Ruoxi,

121
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,680
where are you?

122
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,600
Rammy.

123
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,680
Congratulations.

124
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,080
Sorry.

125
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,200
I didn't notice.

126
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,480
It's okay.

127
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,640
I heard

128
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,360
you were accepted as the top student of the film academy.

129
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,280
Congratulations.

130
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,320
Thank you.

131
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,720
Congratulations on getting into your ideal university.

132
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,440
What's there to be ideal about?

133
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,320
I'm just looking at the scores.

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,720
I've decided. I'll do it. I'll do it.

135
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,720
I've decided

136
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,559
to be a postgraduate in Germany.

137
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,200
Natmmy.

138
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,680
Come and take photos together.

139
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,600
Coming

140
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,440
Me too.

141
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,480
Let's take a photo together.

142
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,080
What are you looking at?

143
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,360
Maybe I'm hallucinating.

144
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,080
It's okay.

145
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,520
Let's take a photo.

146
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,840
I'll start now.

147
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,320
Happy graduation.

148
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,840
Ruoxi Zhang.

149
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,320
Ruoxi Zhang.

150
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,600
Zhang Ruoxi.

151
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,080
Do you remember our promise?

152
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,680
Did you really disappear in my world?

153
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Guess who I am.

154
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
Ruoxi Zhang.

155
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,840
Where have you been?

156
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,440
I've been looking for you.

157
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,600
I didn't go anywhere.

158
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,080
As long as you call me,

159
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,640
I'll be there at any time.

160
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,400
Stop lying to me.

161
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
I'm not lying.

162
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Actually,

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,360
I was always by your side.

164
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,240
and never left you.

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,040
What are you doing?

166
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,160
Why isn't he here yet?

167
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,880
I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

168
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,840
Sorry, I'm late.

169
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,200
You're finally here.

170
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,520
There was a traffic jam.

171
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,600
It's okay. Have some water.

172
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,680
I'll send you the revised script.

173
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,920
I forgot to tell you.

174
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,520
I called you here today

175
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,240
not for the manuscript.

176
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,480
Recently, my agent interviewed many handsome guys.

177
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,520
I was really wrong.

178
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,040
I hope you can give me a hand.

179
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,560
So you want me to do private work?

180
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,440
Fine.

181
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,000
I'll help you with my sharp eyes.

182
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,400
There's an actor inside. Can you meet me later?

183
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,800
He has the same name as your male lead.

184
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,240
also called Zhang Ruoxi.

185
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,600
I suddenly remembered that I have something to do.

186
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,760
I have to go.

187
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,600
You want to run away?

188
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,040
No, I have to finish it today.

189
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,080
How can you call this running away?

190
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,880
Handsome men are not as good-looking as the documents.

191
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,600
Besides,

192
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,640
you have to respect

193
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,160
the imagination of a scriptwriter.

194
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,520
I can't use handsome guys to imprison my thoughts.

195
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,880
And I want to go back to my hometown to enjoy the scenery.

196
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,920
and make the script better.

197
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,960
Don't be distracted.

198
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,080
That makes sense.

199
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,120
Go now.

200
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,480
We won't be able to catch up with your memory.

201
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,320
By the way, Rammy,

202
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,200
The shooting site is set.

203
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,440
Your hometown.

204
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,560
You wrote a story about your hometown.

205
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,440
I think it's more authentic to shoot in your hometown.

206
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,640
And you don't have to go back and forth.

207
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,760
That's great.

208
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,320
Susu, you're so nice.

209
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,480
Goodness.

210
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,560
Let's not talk about this since we're so close.

211
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,400
You're welcome.

212
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,160
But honestly, there are so many people

213
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,720
who want to act these days.

214
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,400
Are you talking about your first love?

215
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,120
Yes.

216
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,080
I knew it.

217
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,280
So the promise in the script is also true.

218
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,440
He's an actor now.

219
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,080
Could it be Zhang Ruo?

220
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,360
Not him.

221
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,440
I need to go back and pack my things.

222
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,920
Let's talk another day.

223
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,760
Okay.

224
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,040
I won't see you off. Bye.

225
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,040
Bye.

226
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,640
Good luck. You'll be the brightest star.

227
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,760
Good luck.

228
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,280
Is this what you wrote in a week?

229
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,120
The character's state is totally wrong.

230
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,000
Did you not hear

231
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,440
in the meeting?

232
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,640
Sorry, sir.

233
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,840
I'll change it now.

234
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,800
Amy.

235
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,000
I have nothing more to teach you.

236
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,600
You can take care of yourself now.

237
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,920
Write well next time.

238
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,960
Thank you.

239
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,240
I'll keep working hard.

240
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,000
Mr. Xia,

241
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,280
Congratulations.

242
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,880
Your script has been reviewed.

243
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,520
The company has decided to vote.

244
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,600
Come on. Hurry up and write the whole script.

245
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,520
It's been ten years.

246
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,040
I've fulfilled my promise.

247
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,840
Will you keep your promise?

248
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,960
Xia.

249
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,680
Xia, you'd better pick up Mimi.

250
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,120
I'm afraid she can't carry her luggage.

251
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,880
Okay.

252
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,520
I'll go after cutting the watermelon.

253
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,560
I promise

254
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,800
she can eat it when she comes back.

255
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,640
Dad, mom, I'm back.

256
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,040
Mimi.

257
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,760
You're back.

258
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,880
Dad.

259
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,400
Let me hug you.

260
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,880
And mom.

261
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,120
I miss you so much.

262
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,000
Let me see.

263
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,960
Why are you so thin?

264
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,640
Work is too hard.

265
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,040
Did you stay up late again?

266
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,360
No.

267
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,200
I sleep less than 10 a.m. every day.

268
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,440
I have better rest than when I was a student.

269
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,440
How are you doing now?

270
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,280
Oh my mom and dad are fine

271
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,400
Early this morning,

272
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,680
your dad went to the market to buy some fresh fish.

273
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,960
The soup is cooked.

274
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,400
It's good for your brain.

275
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,599
Xia, what are you doing?

276
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,720
Go get the watermelon.

277
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,520
I'll get the watermelon.

278
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,160
Have a seat.

279
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,800
Mom

280
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,640
You've lost weight.

281
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,440
No.

282
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,720
Mom, this girl

283
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,880
needs some meat.

284
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,440
Here comes the watermelon.

285
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,319
Hey, Mi.

286
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,520
This one is the sweetest.

287
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,400
Xia's mom.

288
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,160
I'm almost 30.

289
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,920
but you still treat me like a child.

290
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,760
I'm almost 30,

291
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,240
I'm still

292
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,760
You're also my child.

293
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,840
You know you're not young anymore.

294
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Shouldn't you get married?

295
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,760
Look.

296
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Your dad's colleague

297
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,480
He has a good-looking son.

298
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,360
He's handsome

299
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,480
and honest.

300
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,440
Why don't you meet him?

301
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,560
Xia, my butt hasn't been warm since I got home.

302
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,160
You're too anxious.

303
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,080
Are you not satisfied?

304
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,360
I have a few more.

305
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,720
Let me find them for you.

306
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,400
Hey.

307
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,800
Mi must be very tired.

308
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,720
What’s the hurry?

309
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,160
Let's go.

310
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,240
Go back to your room and rest.

311
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,840
I'll call you when I cook.

312
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,720
Do you want to add me on WeChat?

313
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,480
If it can wear on your head,

314
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,400
it will be its lifetime honor.

315
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:55,880
Duan Cheng, a film screenwriter.

316
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,960
I just made this.

317
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
It's a bit rough.

318
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,320
Xiammy, are you still in Beijing?

319
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,240
[Are you free to go back to your hometown in two days?]

320
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,920
Xiao Yu, I'm back.

321
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,440
When did you come back?

322
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,600
Why didn't you ask Xiao Junyi and I to pick you up?

323
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,680
You are so busy at work.

324
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,080
Why should I bother you?

325
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,920
Don't mention it.

326
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,320
You're just in time.

327
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,600
I just agreed to Xiao Junyi's proposal.

328
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,000
It's our 10th anniversary.

329
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,200
We all want to get together.

330
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,680
Are you free to come?

331
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,120
Congratulations.

332
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll be there on time.

333
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,800
Xiammy.

334
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,400
Xiao Yu.

335
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,960
Long time no see.

336
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,400
You've lost so much weight.

337
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,040
You look much prettier.

338
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,320
You must be doing well in Seoul.

339
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,920
I'm not as pretty as a bride-to-be.

340
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,920
You're wearing a ring.

341
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,920
What bride-to-be?

342
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,400
I just agreed to his proposal.

343
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,000
We'll talk about it later.

344
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,520
What do you mean?

345
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,440
You're wearing the wedding ring.

346
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,680
Natmmy.

347
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,040
Long time no see. You've changed a lot.

348
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,000
If you change your mind,

349
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,520
I'll post you ugly photos on Moments.

350
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,760
Who else can you choose besides me?

351
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,880
I'll send you a video of you not taking a shower for seven days.

352
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,720
I'll post it on Moments that you haven't washed your hair for seven days.

353
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,800
You two are still the same.

354
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,480
I'm jealous.

355
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,520
Just so.

356
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,640
Rammy.

357
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,800
Are you still a bachelor?

358
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,920
Since I'm a nobleman, I'll be a little longer.

359
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,480
My boss and...

360
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,640
Everyone must be here.

361
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,000
Let's go inside. Okay.

362
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,080
Do you want a beating?

363
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,400
Don't mention it.

364
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,840
It's all for the big...

365
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Forget it.

366
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,360
Take a look.

367
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,880
Look who I invited.

368
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,800
Mr. Xia.

369
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,520
Welcome. Long time no see. I miss you all.

370
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,760
Sit next to me.

371
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,360
Let me feel the joy of you cultural people.

372
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,760
Come on.

373
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,600
Liu Dayou, stop it.

374
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,640
Don't sell your wine to our Xiammy here.

375
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,840
What are you thinking?

376
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,520
I heard it outside the hotel.

377
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,320
Let me give you my business card.

378
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,200
Here's the thing, Xia Mi.

379
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,160
Where is Dayou?

380
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,520
has launched new products recently.

381
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,720
But our teacher doesn't drink much.

382
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,320
So I can't help you.

383
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,280
It's okay.

384
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,440
I'm in charge of our company's purchase.

385
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,480
But delivering wine isn't the trend now.

386
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,920
It's good for health

387
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,520
It's good for health.

388
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,080
I can make a health-care wine.

389
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
Yes, I'll write it down.

390
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,600
Mr. Writer,

391
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,960
I'm not asking you to buy drinks.

392
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,520
There's a drama going to start soon.

393
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,920
Let me put my wine in your drama

394
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,120
in your TV series.

395
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,760
Xia Mi, ignore him.

396
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,640
Liu Dayou,

397
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,480
Your ugly wine is not enough in my restaurant.

398
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,840
You even have to mock other dramas.

399
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,360
You haven't grown much these years.

400
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,680
You're quite thick-skinned.

401
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,800
I'm two centimeters taller.

402
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,480
Actually, it's not impossible

403
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,920
to be on TV.

404
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,520
It's true. The writer is so generous.

405
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,400
Come on, let me open the wine.

406
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,480
I'll send you the producer's WeChat now.

407
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:01,880
Okay.

408
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,480
How much sponsorship do you want?

409
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,800
Talk to her yourself. Okay.

410
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,960
Miss Xiammy,

411
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,200
It's not good to talk about money.

412
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,520
We've been classmates for so many years. Don't mind me.

413
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,280
Hey, Dayou.

414
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,080
It's a waste of money to talk about love.

415
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,680
My career has just started.

416
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,880
You have to bribe my career.

417
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,720
That's right.

418
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,440
You're right.

419
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,280
All right.

420
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,920
I'll find you when I get married.

421
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,520
Just buy a few more bottles of wine.

422
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,960
Your accent...

423
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,040
Mr. Xiao.

424
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,320
You are the boss.

425
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,440
This is the real boss.

426
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,200
I'll give you 20% off for the drinks, okay?

427
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,520
You're right. You're so loyal.

428
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,280
Don't talk anymore. I'll drink to you first. Let's go.

429
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,960
Sit down.

430
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,280
Find a place to sit.

431
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,960
Have a seat. This is for you.

432
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,120
Good brother, Siu Junyi.

433
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,960
I picked up a friend at the airport yesterday.

434
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,440
I think I saw Zhang Ruoxi.

435
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,640
Is he back?

436
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,400
Zhao Rui, let's have a drink.

437
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,920
Come on.

438
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,520
Let's have a drink.

439
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,280
Have a drink.

440
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,000
Well...

441
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,920
What would you like to eat? It's on me today.

442
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,600
Ms. Shaking.

443
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,680
How bold.

444
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,960
Here, Rammy, let's see what to eat.

445
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,960
I think we can have this.

446
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,040
You can't eat this.

447
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,800
Miss Xiammy,

448
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,640
Among all of us, I admire you the most.

449
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,680
You said you'd become a scriptwriter.

450
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,720
and stick to your dream until the end.

451
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,960
This perseverance

452
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,920
There's no one else

453
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,000
No one else.

454
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,520
Here, a toast to you.

455
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Thank you.

456
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,520
Is the monitor still in Germany?

457
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,760
I think

458
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,600
a PhD before.

459
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,160
Amazing.

460
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,960
It's still here.

461
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,400
I saw Lin Ruotear's Moments in the past two years.

462
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,640
I found that they've been in a long-distance relationship.

463
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,880
Why are you looking at me?

464
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,040
I don't know.

465
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,960
I didn't pay attention to them since 800 years ago.

466
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,800
Sorry, everyone. I'm late.

467
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,760
Lin Ruotear.

468
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,320
Fan Yuan is still working on his thesis in Germany.

469
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,640
He asked me to say hello.

470
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,120
Namida is getting prettier.

471
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,560
As the saying goes,

472
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,720
I recently opened a small restaurant.

473
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
There are a few kinds of wine

474
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,600
with your current temperament.

475
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,040
Come to my restaurant when you have time.

476
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,080
This is my name card.

477
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,160
Dayou, what a coincidence.

478
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,200
I have an exhibition in my company.

479
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
I need some wine.

480
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,520
How about this? I'll call you if I need anything.

481
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,560
My goddess is so pretty and generous.

482
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,360
Natmmy.

483
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,040
Long time no see.

484
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,760
I heard you're shooting a new drama, right?

485
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,440
Congratulations.

486
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,040
Thank you.

487
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,240
Ruoxi didn't come with you?

488
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,640
Did Ruoxi contact you all these years?

489
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,840
Don't you know that?

490
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,560
You're a millennium fox. Why are you chatting?

491
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,960
I'm sorry.

492
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,440
I didn't mean it.

493
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,880
I wanted to say

494
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,960
Fan Yuan hasn't mentioned him for two years.

495
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,440
I thought you two had reunited.

496
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,600
It's okay. You didn't contact me.

497
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,440
Why not?

498
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,640
I really want to find him.

499
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,920
If anyone knows where he is,

500
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,520
tell me immediately

501
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,760
so that I can beat him to vent my anger.

502
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,160
Bring me along and beat him up.

503
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,320
And me.

504
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,080
Me too.

505
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,160
Take your Nunchucks with you.

506
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,160
I'll leave you to it. I'm going to the bathroom.

507
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,480
Okay.

508
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,320
That preserved egg.

509
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,160
Is it good?

510
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
It's lily. It's so delicious.

511
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,520
Natmmy.

512
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,400
I'm sorry about just now. I didn't mean it.

513
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
I didn't know Ruoxi wasn't back yet.

514
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,120
Aren't you tired?

515
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm not as tired as you.

516
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,960
I've been waiting for someone who doesn't even know when he'll be back.

517
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,840
It breaks my heart.

518
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,320
I don't need you to care about me.

519
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,960
I'll wait for the person I like.

520
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,280
No matter what the result is,

521
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,560
it's my own business.

522
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,920
I won't blame myself or blame others.

523
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,480
But...

524
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,760
thank you for caring about me.

525
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,920
Come back, Xiammy.

526
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,840
A rare guest.

527
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,040
A rare guest that you would never expect.

528
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,280
Why didn't you tell us you came back?

529
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,040
Yeah.

530
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,920
Natmmy.

531
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,880
Monitor.

532
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,680
Why didn't you tell us you were coming back?

533
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,320
I wanted to give everyone a surprise.

534
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,880
I didn't tell you.

535
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,840
Long time no see.

536
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,720
Fan Yuan.

537
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,920
Fan Yuan, your surprise...

538
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,240
from your girlfriend?

539
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,360
She just said you asked her to say hello to us.

540
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,360
Right?

541
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,400
Yes.

542
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,320
I came back this time

543
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,160
not only to give you a surprise,

544
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,440
but also a surprise for Ruotear.

545
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,440
Sorry, everyone didn't tell you.

546
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,200
How could you do this?

547
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,080
You lied to me.

548
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,520
I'm sorry.

549
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,240
I'll spend more time with you this time.

550
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,680
Don't be upset.

551
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,960
What surprise?

552
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,960
Monitor, you're just doing this for personal gain.

553
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,680
to play with your girlfriend.

554
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,360
That's right.

555
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,680
I'll drink three cups as punishment.

556
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,800
Come on.

557
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,240
Come on.

558
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,720
The first cup.

559
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,240
Come on, let me pour it for you.

560
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
You must finish it.

561
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,560
Here.

562
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,200
Monitor

563
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,120
Here.

564
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,480
Wait a minute.

565
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,080
Wait.

566
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,920
He'll have a stomachache if he drinks so much.

567
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,880
You're already protecting him?

568
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,920
I see.

569
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,080
You called me here today

570
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,280
on purpose.

571
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
No, I have to drink it.

572
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,120
You must drink it.

573
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,360
It's not that serious.

574
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,520
I didn't tell you when I came back.

575
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,760
Cheers.

576
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,280
But you drank so much.

577
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,720
How about this?

578
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,720
Let's propose a toast to the monitor

579
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,440
to celebrate the monitor's return?

580
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I think this is a great suggestion.

581
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,880
Come on.

582
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,920
Okay.

583
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,760
Monitor.

584
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,640
Welcome back.

585
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,560
It's okay.

586
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,200
Monitor

587
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,040
Didn't you say you wanted to stay for teaching?

588
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,320
Why did you come back suddenly?

589
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,920
Did you quarrel with Ruotear?

590
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,320
What?

591
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,760
forget our ten-year agreement so soon?

592
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,600
Didn't you say

593
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,680
after you become a screenwriter,

594
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,080
will you buy us drinks and sing all night?

595
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,880
I came back

596
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,760
came back for this meal.

597
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,040
How could I forget?

598
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,600
Unfortunately,

599
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,200
don't remember.

600
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,600
After he went to Shanghai with Uncle,

601
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,800
he hasn't contacted me for so many years.

602
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,440
He returned all the money my mom gave him.

603
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,200
I know.

604
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,200
he was afraid he would drag us down.

605
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,600
But I didn't expect him to be so stubborn.

606
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,800
I've never worried that he would drag me down.

607
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
What makes me sad

608
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,199
he made the decision without saying a word.

609
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,520
All these years,

610
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,920
even if he gave me a response,

611
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Even if he said he doesn't like me anymore, I can accept it.

612
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,239
But he didn't.

613
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,320
Ruoxi Zhang, I passed the art exam.

614
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,480
No.1.

615
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Isn't it amazing?

616
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,719
I'll wait for you at the film academy.

617
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,600
[Hello, the number you've dialled is unavailable.]

618
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,320
Is this what you wrote in a week?

619
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,160
The character's state is totally wrong.

620
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,040
Did you not hear

621
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,480
in the meeting?

622
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,680
Sorry, sir.

623
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,880
I'll change it now.

624
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,480
Ruoxi.

625
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,960
Is that you?

626
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,720
You got the wrong number.

627
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,320
Jang Ruoxi, you jerk!

628
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,520
Where have you been?

629
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,160
It's okay.

630
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,640
It's just a song.

631
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,560
I'll treat you tomorrow.

632
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,200
Okay.

633
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,960
Let's go.

634
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,640
Rammy.

635
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,840
Do you need a ride home?

636
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,560
No need.

637
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,520
I have to go back to work.

638
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,640
I won't hold you up.

639
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,800
See you tomorrow.

640
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,720
Call me.

641
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,960
Fan Yuan, let's go.

642
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,000
I'll call you when I get home.

643
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,160
Fan Yuan.

644
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,520
Don't go.

645
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,840
Can you give me another chance?

646
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,600
Let's talk.

647
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,680
How have you been this year?

648
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,800
Not bad.

649
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,840
What about you?

650
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
I'm not okay.

651
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,800
Every day after I left you was bad.

652
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,600
Fan Yuan, I know I was wrong.

653
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,800
Since then,

654
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,840
I never contacted him again.

655
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,200
Please trust me.

656
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,360
Mr. Li.

657
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,440
Thank you for your gift today.

658
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,440
I like it.

659
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,400
Just a thank you.

660
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,400
Re-PARIS!

661
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,240
Tears

662
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,840
It's all in the past.

663
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,280
All these years, I've thought about it.

664
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,920
I've been busy with work abroad.

665
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,880
I didn't care about you.

666
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,120
Speaking of which,

667
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,920
I owe you a lot more. I'm sorry.

668
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,840
Well,

669
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,880
will you give me another chance?

670
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,560
Ruo tears.

671
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,920
I think you should find someone

672
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,600
who really suits you.

673
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,840
We

674
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,120
for each other.

675
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,960
You still like her, don't you?

676
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,280
How am I inferior to her?

677
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,280
I've been with you for so many years.

678
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,200
Not her.

679
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,920
Why can't she really love me?

680
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,800
From now on... Let's take a photo here every year, okay?

681
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,360
Sure.

682
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,400
Now we've reached a contract with it.

683
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,920
Good job.

684
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,280
Come on.

685
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,640
Auntie will get better.

686
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,840
Come on.

687
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,480
Don't think I'm talking nonsense.

688
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:48,800
Excellent ashore.

689
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,000
You told me

690
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,800
the power of faith is very strong.

691
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,320
Excellent ashore.

692
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,760
As long as we believe

693
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,400
it will come true.

694
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,720
We agreed to come once every year.

695
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,120
Liar.

696
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,000
You even fall when you walk.

697
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,400
Is your brain not developed well?

698
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,360
Why are you so careless?

699
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,640
You can fall while walking.

700
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,480
How can you fall down with a book?

701
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,040
Are you brainless

702
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,000
or your brain?

703
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,360
It hurts.

704
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,240
Do you think my head is basketball?

705
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,000
Hit me if you want.

706
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,320
Did you put lead in your hand?

707
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,440
Can't you be gentle?

708
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,760
Let's go. I'll buy you something to eat.

709
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,240
I'm not eating. Let's go.

710
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,840
I'm not eating. The door is closing. Let's go.

711
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:06,920

712
