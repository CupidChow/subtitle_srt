1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on. Come on.

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,240
Are you still angry?

3
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,000
Please talk to me.

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,400
I don't want to get mad at someone who doesn't trust me.

5
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,920
Can you listen to me?

6
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,920
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,880
I'll trust you for 200 percent.

8
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,240
Can you forgive me?

9
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,280
Why are you holding my hand?

10
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,360
I didn't say I forgive you.

11
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,560
Then forgive me now.

12
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,160
That's funny. Why?

13
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,040
Because I really like you.

14
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,680
You like me too.

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,160
Ruoxi Zhang.

16
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,400
You're shameless enough to block bullets, you know?

17
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,120
I was right.

18
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,760
Take this heart.

19
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,680
You can overcome all difficulties.

20
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,480
Natmmy.

21
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,360
Undesta.

22
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,200
I was too timid and self-abased.

23
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
so we missed too much time.

24
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,760
But from now on,

25
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,600
I want to cherish

26
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,320
I want to cherish it.

27
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,760
Oh.

28
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,080
That depends on your performance.

29
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,440
What are you doing, Ruoxi?

30
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,840
Thank you.

31
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,240
Thank you for forgiving me.

32
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,640
Call me back.

33
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,840
You're so shameless.

34
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Hold on tight.

35
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,040
Do you remember when we were here,

36
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,040
Mr. Dai chased us all the way here?

37
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,520
What are you two doing around here?

38
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,600
Is it puppy love?

39
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,320
Stop right there!

40
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,440
Of course I remember.

41
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,160
I even ran away with my shoes.

42
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,400
Without you,

43
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,240
I would have been caught by Mr. Dai.

44
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,200
I even wrote the script.

45
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,440
Do you want to experience it again?

46
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,120
Okay, come on up.

47
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Oh.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,120
What? Am I heavy?

49
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,040
What did you eat these days?

50
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,000
Are you saying I've gained weight?

51
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,560
I'm not.

52
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,880
Jang Ruoxi.

53
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,720
You can carry me on your back from now on.

54
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,000
until you're old, okay?

55
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,920
Do I have to carry you?

56
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,200
Aren't you afraid I'll break your bone?

57
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
Are you allergic to romance?

58
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,200
Can't you just work out?

59
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,360
Don't carry it. Put me down.

60
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,240
Okay.

61
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,320
I promise you.

62
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,960
Work out.

63
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,160
I'll carry you on my back when I'm 100.

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,320
Then you have to keep your promise.

65
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,040
If you can't do it,

66
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,480
You're a dog.

67
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,720
Hey, girlfriend.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,640
Can you give me some human rights?

69
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
Who's your girlfriend?

70
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,880
You've never confessed to me properly.

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,800
Didn't I tell you?

72
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,480
I really like you.

73
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,200
And I gave you roses.

74
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,640
I promised

75
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,840
I will love you every day.

76
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,520
Then...

77
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,600
Those were from Zhang Ruoxi in my dream.

78
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,720
It doesn't count.

79
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,720
It doesn't count.

80
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,000
Ruoxi.

81
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,880
Why are you running so fast?

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
Put me down.

83
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
Don't run!

84
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,800
If you promise to be my girlfriend, I'll put you down.

85
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,360
Fine.

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,440
I promise.

87
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,720
Stop running.

88
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,360
Where are we going

89
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,040
Where are we going now?

90
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,760
Let's go to the basketball court.

91
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,480
Let's pick up

92
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,640
our youth, okay?

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,960
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,480
Let's go.

95
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,760
A promise to grow up together.

96
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,880
It's a complete wrap.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,960
Good luck!

98
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,240
Happy wrap!

99
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,200
Ruoxi, Xiammy,

100
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,440
We'll work together again after more than ten years.

101
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,360
We're really destined to be together.

102
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,040
Yes, I didn't expect that.

103
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
Actually,

104
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,040
I've seen your works. I like them all.

105
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,960
Thank you.

106
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,040
To be honest,

107
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,360
I'd like to work with you in the next drama.

108
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,320
Sure.

109
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,280
I like your script too.

110
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,600
By the way, what's your next story?

111
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,680
Why haven't you decided yet?

112
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,120
Sorry, I was distracted.

113
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:18,920
It's okay.

114
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,000
I just recalled the time when I was in college.

115
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,360
I was quite depressed.

116
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
I was idle all day.

117
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
I'm confused about the future.

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,840
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,840
I made you unhappy.

120
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,520
No.

121
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,400
During that time, I often asked myself

122
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,280
if this road really suits me.

123
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,320
Can I really write a good script?

124
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,280
I always feel confused.

125
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,159
Until I saw a book by chance.

126
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,920
When I saw grandpa Yuan Longping

127
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,680
in search of

128
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,880
When I was looking for the fleeting hope in the field,

129
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,000
I suddenly realized

130
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,000
that our lives

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,280
is full of uncertainties.

132
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,240
the process of pursuing the truth

133
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,800
is so valuable.

134
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,840
This is the inspiration

135
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,120
inspired by your next script?

136
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,280
Yes.

137
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,000
I wanted to go around

138
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,960
and find some unknown heroes.

139
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,000
and write down their stories.

140
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,520
Oh.

141
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,000
That's great.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,480
That's a good idea.

143
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,840
But in this process,

144
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,480
in this process.

145
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,120
As long as the main direction is right,

146
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,680
as long as you stick to it,

147
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,720
We'll reach the bright shore.

148
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,200
Okay.

149
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,760
I'll wait for your script

150
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,880
send me the script as soon as you finish.

151
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,680
I'm looking forward to working with you.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,960
Okay, that's it.

153
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,520
Let's meet at the wrap party tonight.

154
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,360
I'll get back to work.

155
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,320
Okay, bye.

156
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,280
Bye, director. Bye.

157
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,360
Xia Mi, Ruoxi.

158
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Monitor.

159
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,160
I thought you weren't coming.

160
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Of course.

161
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,560
Today is a good day for your ten-year promise.

162
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,120
I must witness it.

163
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,800
What is this?

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,720
You said you knew me in high school.

165
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,800
It's true.

166
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,240
Yes.

167
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,240
Back then,

168
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,960
on the cruise.

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,040
Hey, nerd.

170
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,960
Why are you reading when you're on a trip?

171
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,440
Give me back my book.

172
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,560
No.

173
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,240
Unless you play with us.

174
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,680
You'll be the eagle.

175
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,360
I don't like playing games. Please give me back my book.

176
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,320
You shouldn't bully people.

177
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,120
Kids, go away.

178
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,240
Or I'll bully you too.

179
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,320
If you bully me, I'll cry out loud.

180
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,240
When my parents hear me cry,

181
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,320
when they hear me cry.

182
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,480
Useless.

183
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,240
You're an adult. You still have a girl to protect you.

184
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,560
I'll cry if you keep talking.

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,480
Let's go.

186
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,240
I kicked out all the bad guys.

187
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,920
This is for you.

188
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,400
You've always liked to help others.

189
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,600
Unfortunately,

190
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,720
those who were saved still remember

191
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,760
but those who are righteous forget it.

192
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,120
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
I thought you were making up stories.

194
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
But I remember

195
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,880
that his name is Ma Xiang.

196
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,040
I answered only because you asked me who he was.

197
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,000
I got it wrong.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,520
No.

199
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,440
I asked the wrong question.

200
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,120
What I wanted to ask was your name.

201
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,480
But I asked you where you came from.

202
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
You never told me about this.

203
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,440
It's all in the past. It doesn't matter.

204
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,760
I'm here today

205
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,280
to give the album to her

206
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,720
as a gift for your finishing.

207
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,320
Thank you, monitor.

208
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,800
I like this gift.

209
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,800
It's not only to celebrate the wrap of your drama,

210
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,680
I'm here to say goodbye too.

211
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,400
Say goodbye?

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,880
Where are you going?

213
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
To Germany?

214
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,080
When are you leaving?

215
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,720
Can we make it to the wrap party tonight?

216
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,680
It's too late.

217
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,720
Okay.

218
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm not worried

219
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,280
I'm not worried anymore.

220
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,880
Welcome to Germany.

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,680
You have to accompany me all the way.

222
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
No problem.

223
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,960
We're running out of time.

224
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,440
I'll leave you alone.

225
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,600
Xiammy Ruoxi.

226
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,720
Take care.

227
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,280
Monitor.

228
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,040
Take care.

229
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,920
Goodbye.

230
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,960
Bye, monitor. Bye.

231
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,640
Let's go home.

232
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,080
I also prepared a wrap gift for you.

233
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,880
Hello, mom.

234
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,800
Don't worry. Everything is ready.

235
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,160
No need to see me off.

236
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,680
Take care of yourself in the countryside.

237
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,480
Okay, bye.

238
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,200
Coming.

239
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,400
Fan Yuan.

240
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,760
Can you not abandon me?

241
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,760
Lin Jinlong is released.

242
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,600
He'll kill me.

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,240
I don't know how to live without you.

244
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,400
I beg you.

245
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,400
Please.

246
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,480
I beg you.

247
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,680
It's okay.

248
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,920
It's okay.

249
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,440
Be careful.

250
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,280
Okay.

251
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Go forward.

252
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,080
Ruoxi Zhang, what are you showing me?

253
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,040
Why are you so mysterious?

254
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,720
You'll know later.

255
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,880
Take your time.

256
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,920
Not yet.

257
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
We're almost there.

258
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,160
Turn right.

259
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,960
Then I'll open my eyes.

260
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,360
Open your eyes.

261
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,520
When did you take it so ugly?

262
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,720
It's pretty.

263
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,560
Look.

264
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,960
If you don't study hard,

265
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,560
I still have better grades than you.

266
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,040
I'm the class representative.

267
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,080
So what? I'm the class monitor.

268
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,680
So what?

269
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,000
Of course.

270
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,360
Why do you have my childhood photo?

271
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,040
My mom gave it to you.

272
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,160
He also contributed a lot.

273
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,680
He really sold me out.

274
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,000
You were so cute when you were young.

275
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,040
I made up the numbers.

276
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Stop looking.

277
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,200
Why can't I see it? It's sticky.

278
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,240
You even exposed my dark history.

279
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,040
What happened over there?

280
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,360
Why didn't you tell me?

281
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,120
Why should I?

282
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,800
Let me see.

283
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,600
It won't look good.

284
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,240
So ugly.

285
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,480
How is it ugly?

286
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,760
You look good in any way.

287
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
So cheesy.

288
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Gross.

289
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,600
Who asked me

290
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,800
if

291
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,720
Will you love me every day?

292
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,120
Shut up.

293
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,280
I...

294
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,840
How long are you going to make fun of me with this?

295
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,080
Drunk talk.

296
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,240
But I'm serious.

297
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,120
Wait for me.

298
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,840
If you think that day is a dream,

299
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,520
I hope from now on,

300
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,440
turn this dream into reality.

301
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,119
Rammy.

302
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,640
I'll love you every day from now on.

303
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,560
Will you

304
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,800
let me love you?

305
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,320
Why aren't you answering me?

306
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,480
Hello?

307
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,200
Are you awake, girlfriend?

308
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,680
You haven't forgotten what day it is today, have you?

309
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,800
Ah.

310
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,520
What day is it today?

311
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,640
Did you really forget?

312
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,400
It's just camping.

313
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,880
I have a bad memory.

314
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,520
You even called to remind me.

315
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,440
You scared me.

316
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,400
I'll pick you up at home.

317
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,280
I need to go to the security.

318
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,680
My mom asked me to send something to her card friend.

319
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,680
I'll pick you up at the security office.

320
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,760
See you later.

321
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,640
It's just camping.

322
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,920
Just dress up.

323
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,400
OK?

324
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,600
Like this.

325
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,080
A white shirt and a black pants.

326
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,320
How about this?

327
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,040
Brother.

328
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,560
You've tried more than ten pieces.

329
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,680
Stop it.

330
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,400
You're so handsome, aren't you?

331
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,680
Why are you so nervous?

332
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,640
You know a hammer.

333
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,840
This is the first formal date

334
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
for so many years.

335
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,360
Just tell me

336
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,320
Which one?

337
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,160
Okay.

338
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,640
I don't understand

339
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,400
But I really can't stand

340
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,720
I can't stand it anymore.

341
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,520
Take your time.

342
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,280
You can do it. Come on.

343
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,440
I'm in trouble.

344
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,360
I'm in trouble.

345
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,040
Grandma is fine.

346
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,000
I didn't cause any trouble.

347
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,080
No.

348
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,400
Grandma,

349
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,560
Please take a rest here.

350
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,760
We'll help you pack your things.

351
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,440
We'll send you back after you pack up, okay?

352
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,320
Young ladies,

353
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,440
Thank you.

354
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,200
Good people will be rewarded.

355
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,600
You will be happy forever.

356
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,880
Thank you, Grandma.

357
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,720
I think so too.

358
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,680
Why are you laughing?

359
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,920
Why are you laughing?

360
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,640
I didn't expect

361
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,560
the old lady came out to work because she was bored.

362
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,120
They are all like this.

363
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,480
They don't like to rest.

364
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,560
Afraid of wasting time

365
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,440
I always feel that working is the most glorious thing.

366
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,360
I didn't expect you to know him so well.

367
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,480
When we were in the drama troupe,

368
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,560
they would send us to the nursing home for love regularly.

369
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,440
We'll get to know more if we talk more with them.

370
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,480
I've accumulated experience in acting.

371
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,000
What's wrong?

372
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,360
Nothing.

373
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,960
I just feel

374
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,080
you're shining now.

375
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,480
I'm still shining even when I'm so dirty.

376
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,280
Yes.

377
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,080
Even if the diamond falls into the mud, it's still a diamond.

378
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,440
It won't affect its light.

379
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,760
Since you praised it like a diamond,

380
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,280
you should shine more.

381
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,160
Although this couple outfit is special enough,

382
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,920
but we can't go camping in this.

383
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,720
Let's go get you a real couple outfit.

384
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,320
This is so beautiful.

385
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,440
Ruoxi.

386
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,840
You prepared such beautiful clothes today.

387
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,320
and such a nice place.

388
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,120
Your boyfriend

389
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,640
is doing well.

390
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,600
Of course.

391
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,720
This is our first official date.

392
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,480
Here.

393
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,240
Dear Mrs. Natmmy,

394
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,600
Let's go ahead.

395
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,280
There are more beautiful things waiting for you.

396
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,320
What do you think?

397
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,720
These...

398
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,040
When did you prepare these?

399
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,680
When you were sleeping in.

400
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,160
The bear said

401
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,320
the surprise you prepared for Ms. Natmmy

402
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,240
She likes it very much.

403
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,520
Really?

404
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,360
Yes.

405
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,680
Teddy, please tell Ms. Natmmy

406
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,960
I got it.

407
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,720
Thank you.

408
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay.

409
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,920
Copy that.

410
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,920
Got it.

411
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,320
Dear Mrs. Natmmy

412
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,800
Chef Jang is here to serve you today.

413
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,920
Please take a seat

414
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,200
Here.

415
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,920
Wait for me here.

416
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,200
I'll get the ingredients.

417
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,440
I'll let you have a big meal later

418
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,360
Chef, are you tired?

419
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,520
Do you need my help

420
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,880
You don't need to rest.

421
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
I'll be fine soon.

422
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,800
Fire!

423
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,120
I'm sorry.

424
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,600
I messed it up.

425
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,760
It's okay.

426
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,600
It was an accident.

427
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm glad you're okay.

428
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,400
And I'm not hungry now.

429
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,360
It's okay.

430
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,800
Okay, let's change the apron first.

431
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,400
I'll ask the owner for some new ingredients.

432
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,520
We'll grill again. Okay.

433
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,520
Wait for me here.

434
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,680
I'll be back soon.

435
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,160
Wait for me.

436
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,080
What song is this?

437
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,040
Why haven't I heard it before?

438
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,280
The rain is talking.

439
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,240
It's telling me that it likes you.

440
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,360
Don't be afraid.

441
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,240
Rain on the street

442
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,000
It's as smooth as crispy

443
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
The grass is far away but not close.

444
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,800
When I was a student,

445
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,040
The teacher once asked us to write a composition

446
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,320
with this poem.

447
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,920
I wrote it very well.

448
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,360
I read it as a model essay in front of the whole class.

449
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,320
I felt very accomplished at that time.

450
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,240
I started liking writing since that day.

451
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,680
I also liked rainy days.

452
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,040
What a coincidence.

453
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,600
I liked rainy days when I was young.

454
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,760
Why?

455
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,280
Because I can fight water without fear.

456
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,160
Even if I'm all wet,

457
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,440
my parents wouldn't know I went to play with water.

458
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,280
They just thought I didn't bring an umbrella when it rained.

459
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,480
Here, Rammy.

460
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Let me take you to know the rain again.

461
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,760
Rain is actually gentle.

462
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
It won't hurt even if you hit it on your hand.

463
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,280
Do you want to try?

464
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,600
It's okay. Take your time.

465
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,320
I think I heard the rain talking to me.

466
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,360
I heard it saying you're happy now.

467
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,800
because you're slowly falling in love with it.

468
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,520
Hey.

469
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,200
I think

470
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,720
I heard the rain talking to me.

471
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,000
What did it say?

472
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,200
It's laughing at your nonsense.

473
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,440
Come on.

474
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,960
It smells good

475
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,640
I'm sorry.

476
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,880
I made you wait for so long for this meal.

477
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,040
It's okay.

478
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,680
The waiting time

479
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,080
will only make the food more delicious.

480
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,000
Thank you.

481
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,000
Is it sweet? Yes.

482
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,560
If it's delicious, you can go to the stall.

483
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,360
Really?

484
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,280
Try it.

485
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,760
It's really good

486
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,960
Yeah Give me another bite

487
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,600
Eat slowly

488
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,840
Take it.

489
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,760
Why aren't you picking up?

490
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,880
I don't want to.

491
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,160
Just answer it.

492
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,840
What if there's something important?

493
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,680
What could be so important?

494
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,640
He probably suffered at Wang Xiao Yu's place.

495
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,120
Zhang Ruoxi, where are you?

496
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,720
Wang Xiao Yu said she won't marry me.

497
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,520
and kicked me out of the house. It's so hard for me.

498
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,680
Okay.

499
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,000
I told you.

500
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,720
You don't know

501
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,280
Wang Xiao Yu's temper

502
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,880
is like the firecrackers in the steamer.

503
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,440
It exploded.

504
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,880
This morning, she asked me whether to buy a wedding dress or rent a wedding dress.

505
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,280
I said yes.

506
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,400
She got angry.

507
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,920
She said I didn't care about her. How could I not care about her?

508
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,400
In order to

509
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,880
to have a sweet relationship with her,

510
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,280
I even changed my accent.

511
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,520
How can I not care about her?

512
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,560
Ruoxi.

513
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,720
Tell me.

514
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,920
Women

515
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,160
Are you all unreasonable?

516
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,640
I'm telling you, if you don't beat a boat down,

517
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,120
That's how it is.

518
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,440
Of course, except for her.

519
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,840
She's the most reasonable one.

520
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,440
Unlike a fish.

521
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,760
Xiao Yu may have pre-marriage anxiety.

522
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,480
Please tolerate her.

523
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,400
That's too early to worry.

524
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,120
I asked her to decide today

525
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,800
to let everything go as she wants.

526
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,520
How come she abandoned me in the end?

527
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,640
She asked me to text her every day that I love you.

528
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,280
I have to report to her

529
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,600
I have to send her a message.

530
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,480
I'm hanging up.

531
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,200
It's all in the wine.

532
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,560
Come on.

533
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,560
I'm not drinking.

534
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,120
Let's eat.

535
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,960
Eat more.

536
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,560
Ruoxi.

537
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,720
Your meat is too little for me.

538
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,360
I've opened my appetite after chatting with you.

539
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,680
Go grill some more for me.

540
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,040
Okay, take your time. We'll grill them for you.

541
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,360
Don't spoil him. These are for you.

542
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,720
You can grill them yourself.

543
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,760
Oh, Rammy.

544
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,080
Are you roasting or not?

545
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,160
No.

546
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,000
No, you don't.

547
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,400
Are you grilling it if I'm hungry?

548
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,080
No.

549
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,680
You don't grill even when I'm hungry.

550
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,840
It's disgusting here.

551
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,880
Can you hurry up? I'm really hungry.

552
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,360
Let's go.

553
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,640
Okay.

554
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,040
Shameless.

555
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,440
Thank you.

556
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,640
I'll grill it for you.

557
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,280
Do you want to join me?

558
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,159
Wang Xiao Yu has gone too far.

559
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,760
Honey.

560
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,639
Take me home.

561
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,159
I don't want to sleep on the street.

562
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,120
Xiao Junyi, what are you yelling for?

563
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,560
Honey.

564
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,040
I'm sorry.

565
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,520
I wanted to give you a perfect day today.

566
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,840
but everything didn't go well.

567
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,560
I'm sorry.

568
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,600
It's okay.

569
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,199
I think it's going well.

570
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,719
As long as we are together,

571
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,159
everything will be perfect.

572
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,480
Take care of him.

573
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,600
I'll call Xiao Yu and tell him he's safe.

574
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,840
Honey.

575
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,560
Hello?

576
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,160
Where did you go?

577
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,560
Dear Mrs. Natmmy,

578
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,960
It's time for the late dessert.

579
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,200
Please come to the big tent

580
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,800
to the big tent.

581
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,040
What are you up to?

582
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,440
Starlight Avenue.

583
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,840
That's what it means.

584
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,080
[Jang Ruoxi.]

585
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,440
Where are you?

586
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,160
Why are you still hiding?

587
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,040
Zhang Ruoxi.

588
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,280
Although you said

589
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,040
as long as you're with me,

590
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,720
no matter what happens,

591
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,680
you think it's a perfect day.

592
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,000
But I don't want any regrets.

593
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,840
I want to give you all the best.

594
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,240
Do you remember you gave me a star before?

595
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,760
You said

596
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,040
I'll give it back to you

597
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,880
I'll give it back to you.

598
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,400
But I failed.

599
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,680
What about the star?

600
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,280
I have no right to return it to you.

601
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,240
So,

602
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,760
I prepared a new one.

603
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,840
I can't change the past.

604
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
But in the future,

605
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,400
I will protect you with this star.

606
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,560
You didn't break your promise.

607
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,800
Now you are my male lead,

608
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,320
and I'm your heroine.

609
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,840
The future

610
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,280
or the future, it won't change.

611
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,360
All stars will be there for us.

612
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,200
Stars will be there for us.

613
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,560
Hello, everyone.

614
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,720
My name is Ruoxi Zhang.

615
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,640
There's only one keyword for me.

616
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,400
My keyword is actually double speed.

617
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,440
Cool.

618
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,280
Very handsome.

619
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,160
Very handsome.

620
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,080
Very handsome.

621
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,440
Okay, everyone has good taste.

622
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,920
But let's keep a low profile.

623
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,440
Actually my key word is basketball.

624
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,080
If anyone likes to play basketball with me,

625
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,520
everyone will meet a group of cute people in their youth.

626
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,960
Let's go crazy together.

627
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,920
Let's do it together.

628
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,920
Cry together

629
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,840
Laughing together

630
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,120
Let's work hard for our dreams.

631
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,560
We'll fall and climb up together.

632
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,640
We might get separated.

633
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,200
But if we go in one direction,

634
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,360
Isn't this Mr. Liu?

635
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,880
What's wrong?

636
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,480
Captain Rong.

637
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,880
Saving a life is better than building a seven-level pagoda.

638
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,000
Take me to meet a client.

639
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,360
Be careful.

640
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,160
Let's return the things to these two ladies, okay?

641
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,040
Let's go back and rest early.

642
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,360
See you at school tomorrow, okay?

643
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,280
Goodbye.

644
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,360
Bye.

645
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,360
Xiao Yu.

646
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,600
Why didn't you come tomorrow?

647
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,200
Do you know how long I waited?

648
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,400
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

649
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,280
Next time?

650
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,320
Who are you going to come with next time?

651
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,240
No, that's not what I meant.

652
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,160
Ruo tears.

653
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,960
If you're bored,

654
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,240
we can go somewhere else.

655
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,320
No.

656
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,600
I won't be bored no matter what.

657
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,800
And I'm quite interested in philosophy recently.

658
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,600
I don't know which book to start with.

659
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,800
Why don't you pick one for me?

660
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,560
Sure.

661
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,520
This one

662
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,160
This is about Greek art and aesthetics.

663
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,600
It should be easier to read.

664
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,440
We will grow up together.

665
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,240

666
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,280

Let's make another ten-year contract.

669
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,720
What is it?

670
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,080
Ten years later, let's...

671
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,840
Okay.

672
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,360
But we won't make a pinky swear this time.

673
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,600
Let's stamp it.

674
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,120
