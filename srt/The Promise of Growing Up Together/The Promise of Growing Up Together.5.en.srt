1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,640
Stupid shrimp, stupid fish.

3
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,800
Xiao Junyi, stop it.

4
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,200
Xiao Junyi, shut up!

5
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
Apologize to her now.

6
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,039
Why?

7
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,240
How can your monitor control my mouth?

8
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,759
You don't have to listen if you don't want to.

9
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,600
Xiao Junyi.

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
Listen to the monitor.

11
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,360
Apologize to her now.

12
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,560
Do you really think he's the class monitor?

13
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,120
We all have to listen to him.

14
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,520
If we don't apologize, we'll record it.

15
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,120
I didn't expect the monitor to be so stubborn.

16
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,320
It's just for the last one

17
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,880
Monitor

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm fine.

19
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,240
Okay.

20
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,240
Go back to your seats.

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,680
Class begins.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,120
Books.

23
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,600
I gave you a challenge on behalf of the boarding house.

24
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,280
On behalf of myself,

25
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
I won't lose to you in this monthly exam.

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,600
I won't.

27
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,240
Go back to your seats.

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,560
I'm fine.

29
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,560
Don't stay around. Class is about to start.

30
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,440
Go back to your seat.

31
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,800
Go back to your seat, Xiao Yu.

32
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,280
According to the book,

33
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,560
Food can secrete a lot of dopamine in the brain.

34
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,320
It can make people happy quickly.

35
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,680
Have some.

36
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Thank you.

37
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,080
By the way,

38
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,680
How did you know I was here?

39
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,200
Of course my radar antenna just detected it.

40
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,520
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,120
I told a cold joke.

42
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,160
You didn't even laugh.

43
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,519
You're making me laugh.

44
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,120
You're really an idiot.

45
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,440
Why do you have this nickname?

46
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,640
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

47
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm just asking.

48
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,720
Don't feel pressured.

49
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,760
There's nothing I can't say.

50
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
When I was young,

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,040
my parents were busy with work.

52
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,640
My grandparents are getting old.

53
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,760
It's hard to guide me.

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,000
He sent me to study early.

55
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,960
I don't know if I was born stupid

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,560
or I didn't catch up.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,680
I always got the last place.

58
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,520
Later, my classmates

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,440
gave me the nickname "Stupid Shrimp".

60
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,520
Some boys

61
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,560
That's too much.

62
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,440
They just use the pen

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,880
"I'm a stupid little shrimp behind me."

64
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
I was laughed at by the whole school.

65
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,960
Stupid little shrimp.

66
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,160
Stupid shrimp

67
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,200
I'm not playing with a fool. I'm going to play.

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,440
Stupid Shrimp doesn't play with her.

69
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,120
This nickname accompanied me to middle school.

70
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,480
I thought

71
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,320
it would be hopeless.

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,080
But I didn't expect my grades to improve suddenly in grade three.

73
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,840
and got into Yi Zhong High School.

74
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
At that time, I thought

75
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,200
God must have given me

76
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,680
a chance to recreate.

77
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,560
I didn't know it was just a chance.

78
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,159
I'm still a bad student.

79
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,280
I'm no different from before.

80
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
Of course.

81
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,560
Haven't you noticed?

82
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,360
Everyone likes you very much.

83
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,760
There are over 30 people in the class.

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
only a few people say nicknames you don't like.

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,720
I...

86
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,680
[Xiao Yu.]

87
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,680
Xiao Yu.

88
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,400
Ruoxi.

89
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,120
Everyone likes you very much.

90
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,560
They don't want you to get hurt.

91
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,840
That's why

92
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,000
and do things that can make you shine.

93
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,240
Monitor.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,520
Hello. I want to give you a banner.

95
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,640
Sure.

96
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,240
Give me the banner.

97
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,280
Actually, I'm not that sad anymore.

98
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,840
Although the results are still the same,

99
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,840
at least

100
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,360
I made such good friends.

101
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,960
I think

102
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,800
This is a big gift from God.

103
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,920
Besides,

104
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,440
I have my own weapon.

105
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,440
What weapon?

106
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,840
It's a secret.

107
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,880
You must want to tell me this secret

108
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
when you give me the banner, right?

109
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
All right, let's eat.

110
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,280
The chicken chop will get cold.

111
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,480
Delicious.

112
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:08,960
Do you want some?

113
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,000
No.

114
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,880
####

115
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,960
Wipe it.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,520
Thank you.

117
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,680
Before,

118
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,480
I wanted to treat you.

119
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,520
It's your treat again.

120
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,360
I'll come next time.

121
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,120
Sure.

122
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,159
Deal.

123
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,040
What are you doing?

124
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,480
You brought me here

125
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,320
to beat me up?

126
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,680
But let me tell you,

127
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,159
even if you beat me,

128
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,920
I won't apologize to them.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,480
What?

130
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,880
You deserve a beating.

131
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,000
I heard you used to practice 100 meters.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,480
Yes.

133
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,960
Let's have a 100-meter race.

134
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,840
You lost.

135
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
Go back and apologize to Fan Yuan and Xia Mi.

136
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,160
You win.

137
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,000
I'll call you brother.

138
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,840
What do you think?

139
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,360
Lose?

140
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
You can beat me in basketball,

141
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,080
but you might not be able to beat me.

142
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,040
I broke the record of 100 meters in middle school.

143
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,440
Don't regret it.

144
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,320
I'll make you convinced.

145
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,000
Come on. Let's go.

146
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,480
Ready?

147
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,040
Ready.

148
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,080
Run!

149
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,000
I won't yield to any wall in the future.

150
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,520
Are you an all-rounder?

151
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,040
Not to mention an apology,

152
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,520
I'll do anything

153
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,920
I'm willing to do it.

154
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,840
Just apologize.

155
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,120
I don't run a zoo.

156
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,360
Let's go.

157
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,240
Let's go.

158
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,680
Awesome!

159
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,160
Not bad.

160
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,480
You ran so fast.

161
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,840
To Mr Qiao

162
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,520
Thank you for sending me the magazine and encouraging me to study.

163
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,880
Thank you for your hard work.

164
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,080
You're making the main poster for the Teacher's Day

165
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,880
It's the Blessing Wall.

166
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
The Teacher's Day is coming

167
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
I want to collect everyone's blessings

168
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,720
I'll stick them on the door and make them as gifts for you.

169
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,360
Miss Natmmy.

170
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,520
Sorry.

171
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
I shouldn't have called you Little Shrimp.

172
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,680
Please forgive me.

173
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,920
I can forgive you.

174
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
Then you can ask all the readers to leave a message.

175
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,480
Then it's over.

176
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,320
No problem.

177
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,880
I'll go get them now.

178
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,080
I promise you.

179
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,080
Do I have the honor to be the second person to leave a message?

180
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,920
Write it if you want.

181
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,120
No one will stop you.

182
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,920
To all teachers

183
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,400
Thank you for your hard work.

184
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,040
for tolerating our willfulness and quarrels.

185
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,560
Happy Teacher's Day.

186
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:57,840
A small greeting card

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,080
A small greeting card

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,080
Don't say a word.

189
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,400
Peach plums don't speak.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,280
It's just a plus.

191
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,400
Although it's only A+

192
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,040
Stand up.

193
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,520
Happy Teacher's Day.

194
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,360
Okay, have a seat.

195
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,200
You kids.

196
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Thank you.

197
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,880
Whose idea is this?

198
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,800
Teacher.

199
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,720
This is her idea.

200
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,520
This is a good idea.

201
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,800
I'm touched.

202
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,400
I believe other teachers will be very happy

203
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,560
will be very happy.

204
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,880
Let's go to class.

205
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,960
Are you writing a self-criticism?

206
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,440
Why don't you go back to your dorm for lunch break?

207
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,240
Are you here to see her again?

208
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,440
You again?

209
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,560
Sorry.

210
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,680
I didn't mean it.

211
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,640
I'll leave it to you.

212
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,360
I'm leaving.

213
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,160
Sorry, I can copy another copy.

214
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
No, I can do it myself.

215
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,480
Is this the manuscript for the magazine?

216
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,320
Give it to me.

217
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
I can't send it out if I can't finish it today.

218
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,720
Don't worry.

219
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,280
I'll take responsibility for my mistake.

220
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,480
I'll give you a complete manuscript before school ends.

221
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,240
Can you be quiet? The class hasn't started yet.

222
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,720
Sorry.

223
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,400
Manual questions.

224
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,080
There will be

225
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,760
There are many choices questions.

226
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,600
And the topic has changed a lot.

227
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,640
Sorry.

228
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,520
So practice hard.

229
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,120
Ruoxi.

230
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,680
This is the class of a hero. Don't be afraid.

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,760
Aren't you scared?

232
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,480
It's okay. Just drop the sentry for me.

233
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,040
This is very typical.

234
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,880
Ruoxi.

235
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,080
What are you doing?

236
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,520
Oh no.

237
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,560
Is he copying my manuscript?

238
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,400
I said I'll do it myself.

239
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,160
I'm going to lose everything.

240
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,280
What?

241
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,680
What?

242
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,280
Nothing.

243
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,520
Come on.

244
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,840
Answer the question on the blackboard.

245
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,800
The plane arrived at 40 degrees east, 100 degrees.

246
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,680
How did you get it?

247
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,760
It’s a question. It’s a question.

248
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,280
the plane is flying on the line.

249
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,840
1100km per hour.

250
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,680
8 hours is 80 degrees.

251
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,760
The plane departs from 60 degrees north

252
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,880
Fly over 30 degrees to the North Pole

253
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,720
and fly to the south 50 degrees.

254
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,120
Comprehensive analysis.

255
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
The plane is 40 degrees east, 100 degrees.

256
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
Correct.

257
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,240
But you still have to listen carefully.

258
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,520
OK.

259
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,160
Xiammy.

260
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,200
Are you okay?

261
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,880
Editor-in-Chief wants Gao Jun, Xu Lihong, Xiang Mengmeng.

262
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,240
Beijing University of Science and Technology.

263
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,240
Jiang Xue.

264
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,880
Beijing Tech University Publishing Press.

265
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,320
Your handwriting is not bad.

266
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,960
Forget it.

267
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,880
I forgive you.

268
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,240
You're acting like a judge.

269
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,119
OK.

270
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Rammy, Ruotear.

271
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,880
We're leaving.

272
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Bye. Bye.

273
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,960
Xiammy.

274
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
Even you are leaving.

275
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,440
I'm alone in the dorm.

276
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,200
Is your house far away?

277
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,800
You haven't been home for weeks.

278
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,160
Not far.

279
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,640
My parents are in Beijing.

280
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,960
And they don't come back often.

281
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,520
I'll be alone even if I go home.

282
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,400
How about this?

283
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,680
Come to my house.

284
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,400
My parents are also very nice.

285
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,920
We can eat snacks while watching dramas.

286
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,040
No, no.

287
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,320
It's too disturbing.

288
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,240
And this weekend,

289
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,520
this weekend.

290
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Okay.

291
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,440
Call me if you're bored.

292
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,920
I'm leaving.

293
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,600
Bye.

294
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,960
To the post office?

295
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,160
Yes.

296
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,320
Let's go. Get in.

297
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,880
I'll give you a ride.

298
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,440
as an apology.

299
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,320
No need.

300
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,240
The post office is quite close.

301
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,080
I can walk there.

302
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,600
I can't walk faster than riding a bike.

303
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,040
Don't you trust my driving skills?

304
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,080
Fine, I'll sit.

305
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,200
Shut up.

306
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,160
So heavy.

307
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,360
I'm not talking about your bag, not you.

308
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,560
You packed a lot of papers, right?

309
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,200
Are you really determined to slap Siu Junyi in the face?

310
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,120
Of course.

311
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,360
I've told everyone.

312
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,480
I'll keep my promise.

313
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Sure.

314
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,320
From now on, I admire you.

315
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,720
Are you riding or not?

316
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,400
I'll go down if you don't.

317
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,360
Let's go.

318
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,840
Open time.

319
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,360
What are you praying for?

320
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,800
God of Post.

321
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,520
I'm just worried that I can't make a wish.

322
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,400
Why do you care?

323
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,520
No.

324
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,000
I told you.

325
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,880
your writing is not worse than those magazines.

326
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,000
even better than those magazines.

327
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,000
Thank you for your consolation award.

328
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,840
Unfortunately, you're neither an editor nor a judge.

329
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,800
What?

330
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,360
Don't move.

331
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,480
I'm injecting your luck.

332
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,480
Okay.

333
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,600
I'm always lucky.

334
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,120
I just gave you my luck.

335
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,560
You should trust me instead of the God of Post.

336
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,600
I'm sure you'll receive the notice.

337
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,360
Thank you.

338
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,240
Bye. Bye.

339
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:06,960
Bye.

340
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,040
Let me give you a ride.

341
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,360
You're good at writing stories. Do you want to be a writer in the future?

342
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,640
I do.

343
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,200
But I think

344
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,160
I still have a long way to go.

345
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,360
Not far.

346
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,960
The target is more than most people.

347
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,360
Unlike me.

348
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,160
I don't even know what to do.

349
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
How is that possible?

350
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,160
You're good at everything.

351
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,840
Look.

352
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,520
You're good at basketball

353
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,400
and good grades.

354
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,680
People like you

355
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,520
to do anything.

356
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,400
I didn't know I was so good in your eyes.

357
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,240
I'll compliment you.

358
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,240
Studying is my duty.

359
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,560
Basketball is just a hobby.

360
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,560
But it takes talent

361
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,720
to find something you want to do.

362
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,360
After you find it,

363
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,200
you need to be persistent.

364
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,840
Judging from this point,

365
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,560
Amy,

366
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,160
You are better than me.

367
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,240
Guang, Mingqiao.

368
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,280
Which bus are you waiting for?

369
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,560
520.

370
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,480
So romantic.

371
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,920
My car is here. I'm leaving.

372
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,920
Bye. Bye.

373
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,320
Cheng Qing.

374
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,760
Today is a commemorable milestone ceremony.

375
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,000
I, Xia Xiaomi's Child Shoes,

376
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,560
I finally submitted my first novel.

377
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,280
[I'm one step closer to the goal of the Star Sea.]

378
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,080
Not a small step, but a big step.

379
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,600
Trust my luck.

380
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:57,960
Not a small step, but a big step. Trust me.

381
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,440
It's not your glory.

382
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,000
Your glory is waiting for you.

383
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,040
You're so literary.

384
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,440
Your childhood and my childhood are all the same.

385
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,000
I was chased by dogs.

386
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,360
You're a good runner.

387
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,880
Listen carefully now.

388
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,240
The fifth page in the textbook.

389
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,360
Page 9.

390
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,280
Page 16.

391
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:50,880
Page 21.

392
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,600
Page 22.

393
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,920
It's all about our midterms.

394
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,080
When we go back,

395
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,200
study more.

396
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,160
Okay.

397
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,120
Class dismissed.

398
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,920
Stand up.

399
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,280
Thank you.

400
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,000
This is too much.

401
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,840
Unless you have three heads and six arms.

402
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,160
I want to brainwash all my knowledge at once.

403
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,040
Natmmy.

404
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,680
Did you learn something new?

405
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,000
No.

406
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,520
I'm just looking for a miracle.

407
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,920
It's so hard to

408
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,160
The language is too hard.

409
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,240
I don't mean to laugh at you.

410
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,640
Just laugh.

411
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,800
I can only try my best.

412
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,080
Not everyone

413
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,440
like you.

414
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,600
Natmmy.

415
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,240
Actually, memorizing is a skill.

416
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,000
If you want,

417
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,080
during the afternoon and evening self-study,

418
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,920
I can teach you how to recite quickly.

419
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,800
Of course.

420
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,160
Is this our secret operation?

421
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,560
Deal.

422
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,360
Wait for me to work hard.

423
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,640
and amaze everyone.

424
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,320
and everyone.

425
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,840
That's all for today.

426
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,080
The midterm exam is next week.

427
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,560
You have to study quickly

428
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,320
and try to get a good result.

429
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,080
You can go eat after copying the notes.

430
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,520
Fan Yuan.

431
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,360
Come here.

432
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,040
Okay.

433
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,280
Okay.

434
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:10,840
Go.

435
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,760
Thank you.

436
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,480
Monitor

437
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
What did the teacher say to you?

438
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,680
He asked me to participate in the math competition in advance.

439
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,400
That's amazing.

440
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
Actually...

441
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,440
Nothing.

442
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,400
Let's go.

443
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,160
Rammy.

444
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,680
Here.

445
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,320
It's autumn.

446
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,080
The weather has changed a lot.

447
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,640
Thank you, monitor. Don't catch a cold.

448
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,040
What?

449
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,240
Monitor.

450
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,600
Did you hear anything strange?

451
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,480
Strange sound?

452
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,760
No.

453
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,320
Maybe I heard it wrong.

454
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,000
Let's go.

455
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:34,840
Let's go.

456
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,720
Why are you here?

457
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,720
There's no unventilable wall in the world.

458
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,520
What did Fan Yuan and Xia Mi say?

459
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,520
It seems

460
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,960
The monitor said

461
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,880
after school.

462
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,000
I envy her so much.

463
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,440
If only I were the class monitor's deskmate.

464
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,240
Who said Fan Yuan is my deskmate?

465
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,960
Grandmaster.

466
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,680
Monitor Fan Yuan and Xia Mi.

467
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,240
Everyone wants to listen to the monitor's learning method.

468
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,080
Yeah

469
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,920
Since we're here,

470
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,360
Let's go together.

471
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,320
Monitor.

472
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,280
How did you find this treasure place?

473
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,520
When Ruoxi climbed over the wall

474
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,920
and was punished to clean the art building,

475
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,440
I found it with him.

476
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,960
What are you doing? I told you to clean.

477
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
No one uses it.

478
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,240
Let's go in.

479
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,800
No.

480
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,640
My knees.

481
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,480
Open the door.

482
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,200
This is our secret base from now on.

483
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,320
Okay.

484
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,480
How is it?

485
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,240
Not bad, right?

486
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,800
The floor was dirty and full of falling leaves.

487
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,320
We worked so hard to clean it.

488
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,280
Normally no one comes here

489
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,960
It's perfect for studying

490
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,160
Sit here

491
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,120
Thank you, monitor.

492
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,120
Why are you all here?

493
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,080
Fan Yuan.

494
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,640
Why didn't you invite me to attend this kind of tutoring?

495
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,680
You were the one who followed us.

496
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,920
How could you say that?

497
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,320
I'm attracted by the fragrance of knowledge.

498
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,280
Come on.

499
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,720
You're the 3rd. You need extra lessons.

500
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,640
Who would believe that?

501
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,960
So what?

502
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,560
There's room for improvement, right?

503
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,840
Learning is endless.

504
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,760
It's easier to follow your ship.

505
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,200
Am I right?

506
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,280
Yes

507
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,240
Monitor please

508
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,520
Please monitor

509
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,160
Monitor please

510
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,960
Since you're all here

511
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,320
let's learn together.

512
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,520
Hooray!

513
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,080
Hurray

514
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,120
Find your seat.

515
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:26,920
Monitor

516
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,600
You're amazing.

517
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,600
So many people want to study with you.

518
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,240
If you have a cram school,

519
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,240
there will be a lot of people.

520
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,040
Let's go. Okay.

521
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:36,800
Okay.

522
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,000
This is the ambiHos forgetting curve.

523
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,360
It shows the whole memory cycle of our brain.

524
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,040
If the time we first learned is x hours,

525
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,440
Then Y is almost

526
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,000
Y equals 0.56X. the power of 06.

527
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,640
We just need to

528
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,960
in this period of time,

529
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,320
we can turn a short memory

530
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,480
into a long memory.

531
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,120
Am I not clear enough?

532
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,120
It's okay. I can say it in another way.

533
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,680
How do you recite it based on the forgotten cycle?

534
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,800
To put it simply,

535
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,440
you have to recite things you'll forget repeatedly.

536
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
For example, we have to memorize 100 words a day.

537
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,480
Then after one day,

538
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,000
we will only remember

539
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,640
more than 50 words.

540
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,600
As long as we

541
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,920
in this period of time,

542
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,680
In a day,

543
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,960
we can memorise about 8 to 90 words.

544
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,800
But if we don't repeat the process,

545
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,600
we'll only remember about 30-40 words.

546
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,360
It's more troublesome

547
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,840
Isn't it more troublesome?

548
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,240
Trouble is only temporary.

549
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,920
When you get used to it, you'll be very relaxed.

550
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Because memories are connected.

551
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,320
For example, if you remember the same word,

552
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,240
you'll remember the words in a short time.

553
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,000
I know.

554
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,760
Right?

555
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,160
Like a b

556
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,760
It's either the opposite or different.

557
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,480
If it's normal

558
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,480
then abrandomal is abnormal

559
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,120
Right?

560
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,080
You're smart, aren't you?

561
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,239
Monitor

562
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,440
May I ask

563
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
how can we improve our grades as soon as possible?

564
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,000
The three tests Zhao Rui mentioned

565
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,120
is very important.

566
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,320
First you must understand the principle and concept

567
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,920
Second, you need to solve more questions.

568
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,920
The same question can try different solutions.

569
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,840
and try different types.

570
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,320
As time goes by,

571
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,239
our grades will naturally improve.

572
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,639
But I can't even think of a solution.

573
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,600
how to think of the second and third.

574
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,639
I can lend you my brain.

575
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,400
How?

576
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,960
Are you playing tricks on me?

577
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,560
No, I mean

578
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,719
you can ask me if you have any questions.

579
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,320
I can teach you.

580
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,360
It's okay, Natmmy.

581
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
When you encounter different questions,

582
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,320
you can think about it first.

583
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,600
It's okay if you can't do it

584
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,960
The most important thing

585
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,040
is to form a habit of thinking independently.

586
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,239
Same goes for everyone.

587
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,880
Theory is better than practice.

588
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,160
Let's do more exercises, okay?

589
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,000
Okay.

590
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,680
Come on.

591
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,320
Come on. Come on.

592
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,080
Fan Yuan.

593
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,080
Is there anything you don't know?

594
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,680
I really can't figure out this question.

595
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,240
Which one?

596
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,080
This question

597
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,960
is a concept of increase function.

598
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,920
Your first step is right.

599
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,760
It's just that the formula in the end is complicated.

600
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,840
You're getting confused.

601
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,600
Because I have psychometry.

602
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,720
It's like this. It's like this.

603
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,080
It's because of this

604
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,920
Fx increases voluntarily on zero to the top.

605
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,680
So this F (x 1) reduced F (x 2). Equal to 0.

606
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,720
Right?

607
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,960
Not bad.

608
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,400
Your math is not bad at all.

609
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,560
You're good at math.

610
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,080
You taught me well.

611
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,440
Ruoxi, you're really good at teaching people.

612
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,880
Of course.

613
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,400
Okay.

614
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,000
Do you know any questions?

615
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,400
Not for now.

616
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,840
I'll call you if there's any problem.

617
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,520
Okay.

618
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,680
Ruoxi.

619
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,600
This question...

620
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,200
This question is too difficult.

621
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,960
I didn't even calculate a piece of white paper.

622
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,080
Take a look.

623
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,880
Why is it so difficult?

624
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,680
It's a little difficult.

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,360
