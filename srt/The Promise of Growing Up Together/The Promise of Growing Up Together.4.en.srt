1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,120
You can talk to him directly.

3
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,120
He's not an outsider.

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520
It means...

5
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,920
Can't you understand?

6
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,280
I can't tell.

7
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,200
Xiaoyu.

8
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,720
Is he your brother?

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,120
Hello, brother. Hello, brother.

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,960
Xiaoyu.

11
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,000
I didn't expect to see my family so soon.

12
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,960
This is so funny.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
It's more dramatic than an idol drama.

14
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,759
If you don't follow the rules, how can I act?

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,880
Shut up.

16
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
How can you tell he's my brother?

17
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,920
We are...

18
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,079
Anyway,

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,240
stop pestering me.

20
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,760
I don't like people pestering me.

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,360
And...

22
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,560
This...

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,720
He's not your brother.

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
Is he your uncle?

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,440
Hello, uncle.

26
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,800
No, no.

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,680
They're old for morality.

28
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,600
I'll go help him.

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,560
Wait.

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,800
Take the bag back for me.

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,000
Rammy.

32
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
Hello, uncle, uncle.

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,160
But this is not right.

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,280
They're all wearing school uniforms like us.

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,120
You're relatives of your juniors.

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,560
Why can't you understand Mandarin?

37
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,720
Xiaoyu.

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,920
Ruoxi.

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,680
You...

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,040
You...

41
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,800
It's not what you think.

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
Explain it to me.

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,840
Xia Mi, let me explain.

44
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,079
I don't want to hear it.

45
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,320
Xiammy.

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,400
Hit me.

47
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,720
Kill me.

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,079
I'm beating you.

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm hitting you!

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,160
Stinky man.

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,720
All right.

52
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,840
Even a soap opera at eight is not as awkward as you.

53
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,240
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,520
I did it on purpose

55
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,680
Because

56
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,440
she used this way

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,800
in this way.

58
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:47,920
So,

59
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,600
I wanted to tease you for him.

60
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
But...

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,480
your flamboyant performance just now

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,040
you realized how boring I was.

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,960
Who is exaggerating?

64
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,440
I did a good job.

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,200
He's the one who's exaggerating.

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,240
Me?

67
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,960
Anyway, I wasted your time.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,440
I'll make it up to you.

69
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,520
Really?

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,200
Rammy.

71
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,360
Monitor, don't get me wrong.

72
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,880
It's not what you see.

73
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,680
Why is there another one?

74
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,000
Didn't I say I won't act?

75
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,400
You guys

76
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,360
What are you doing here?

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Run!

78
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,480
Don't run!

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,920
Which class is he from?

80
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,440
He can run so fast.

81
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,120
No.

82
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,280
You didn't get caught, did you?

83
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,600
Why does he have my number?

84
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,520
Natmmy.

85
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,000
Why are you still up?

86
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,120
Ruoxi asked if we're back.

87
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,400
I'll reply to him.

88
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,840
The lights are out.

89
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,159
Why are you still up?

90
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,000
Deduct your class’s exercise points.

91
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I confiscated my phone.

92
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,159
Come to me tomorrow morning.

93
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,400
Auntie.

94
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,040
Sleep.

95
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,920
You didn't text me

96
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
or text.

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,360
Why now?

98
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,840
Ruoxi Zhang, you jinx.

99
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,960
Are you asleep

100
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,520
or caught?

101
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,720
Is she with you?

102
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,200
Have you arrived at the dorm?

103
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,960
We're here.

104
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,960
Sorry for making you worry.

105
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,560
Did you get home safely?

106
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,720
Chief Guardian.

107
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,480
Here.

108
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,840
Write a letter of challenge for me.

109
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,240
Challenge letter?

110
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,240
Who are you challenging?

111
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,720
Of course, our boarding party will challenge them.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,280
Didn't I tell you yesterday to teach them a lesson?

113
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,320
Have you forgotten?

114
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,800
Xiao Yu.

115
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,280
Actually, it was a misunderstanding.

116
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,600
I handed in my homework book.

117
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,240
Why don't you

118
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,880
I'd better not.

119
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
I'm not talking about you throwing your notebook.

120
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,840
It's about throwing trash yesterday.

121
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,840
I'm the sect leader.

122
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm a man of my word.

123
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,240
Besides,

124
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
it's not about throwing trash.

125
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,440
It’s between the two sects.

126
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,960
As my Chief Guardian,

127
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,560
according to the rules,

128
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,960
you will do anything for me.

129
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,760
Warning!

130
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,200
The world has just begun.

131
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
All heroes live.

132
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,800
There are no two tigers in one mountain.

133
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,080
One class cannot tolerate two sects.

134
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,360
My boarding sect has an ambition.

135
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
I want to fight with you.

136
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,720
Heroes should work together

137
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,240
and make up our minds.

138
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,840
A good brush makes flowers.

139
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,480
Just write it.

140
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,200
Thank you.

141
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
It's not as good as a flower.

142
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,800
Your Sanfen just now...

143
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,400
Xiao Junyi.

144
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,920
What?

145
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,320
Here's the challenge letter.

146
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,120
Mandarin.

147
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,120
I didn't know you could do that.

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,840
A read-through boarding party.

149
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,080
It's written by Xiammy.

150
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,440
You're quite observant.

151
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,360
But cut the crap.

152
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,120
I'm asking if you're going to answer it.

153
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,880
Of course I dare.

154
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,880
Do you think we should accept the challenge?

155
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,240
Forget it.

156
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,320
You think it wasn't noisy enough yesterday?

157
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,480
But they kicked us to the door.

158
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,960
Are we still the descendants of the dragon if we don't fight?

159
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,960
Bastard!

160
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,160
You don't listen to me and still call me brother.

161
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,200
Fine.

162
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,240
I'll listen to you.

163
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,040
I knew you wouldn't dare.

164
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,120
Coward.

165
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,640
Wang Xiao Yu.

166
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,920
I can't listen to you today.

167
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,800
I'll take the challenge.

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm not afraid.

169
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,680
In this exam,

170
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,000
only three students got full marks.

171
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm not satisfied with this result.

172
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,760
You are all the best students in school.

173
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,840
It shouldn't be.

174
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,320
Math.

175
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,280
Hand out the test paper later.

176
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,600
Math.

177
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,040
Reflect on yourselves.

178
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,400
Those who call your name, come up and get the test paper.

179
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,520
Thank you, Yuhan.

180
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,440
Fan Yuan.

181
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,920
Today's fortune is so accurate.

182
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,840
Even our papers are next to each other.

183
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,600
Congratulations on getting full marks.

184
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,640
Thank you.

185
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Next.

186
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,560
Xiammy.

187
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,680
You are her?

188
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,000
You are the only student in the class.

189
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,160
You didn't write anything on the last question.

190
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,000
You should at least write the answer.

191
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,880
Cheer up in class from now on, okay?

192
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,120
Yes, sir.

193
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,320
The last two students who got full marks

194
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,440
Ruoxi Zhang.

195
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,000
Tian Jiarong.

196
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,440
Here.

197
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,200
Thank you.

198
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,000
You get full marks in the basketball court every day.

199
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,520
Didn't you say people with limbs are simple-minded?

200
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,520
Why does he get all the benefits?

201
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,240
What a coincidence.

202
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,280
Did you bring any door?

203
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
You can come out anytime and scare me.

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,280
Do you think I'll mess with you?

205
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,880
I told you.

206
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,120
I didn't do your math homework and textbook.

207
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,720
I know it wasn't you.

208
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,800
I misunderstood what happened before.

209
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,640
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,400
It's okay.

211
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,120
I won't be like some elementary school students.

212
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,880
like some elementary school kids.

213
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,600
I'll remove your name.

214
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,480
Besides,

215
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,760
Even so, we're from two factions.

216
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,880
Stay away from me.

217
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,360
Wait.

218
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,160
What?

219
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,000
Here.

220
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,200
It will make your grades better.

221
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,920
Stop frowning.

222
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,600
I'm not.

223
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,560
Zhang Ruoxi.

224
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,520
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

225
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm the successor of Socialism.

226
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
You can't believe this even if you're a scientist.

227
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,360
Ridiculous.

228
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,600
Believe me.

229
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,960
This is the lucky sign my mom asked for.

230
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,520
It's not science.

231
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,040
It's the power of faith.

232
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,080
Then I can't take it.

233
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,920
Take it as a loan.

234
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,760
When you become as smart as me,

235
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,640
when you become smart like me.

236
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,040
narcissistic.

237
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,440
This guy

238
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,640
doesn't seem that annoying.

239
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,000
Seol.

240
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,920
Where are you going?

241
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
Let's go. Our boarding party and reading school.

242
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,680
They're competing on the playground.

243
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,280
A competition?

244
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,600
What game?

245
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,920
Human caterpillar.

246
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,600
Human caterpillar.

247
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,480
What is it?

248
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,320
Ready.

249
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,160
Three, two, one, go.

250
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,720
Come on!

251
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,480
What's wrong?

252
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,800
Turn around.

253
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:27,880
Go.

254
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,760
Slow down.

255
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,680
Turn.

256
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
So slow, Wang Xiao Yu.

257
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,400
You have so many boys.

258
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,920
We only have a few girls.

259
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,560
How can we beat you?

260
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,840
We agreed to have only one round.

261
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,280
Why do we have to win two out of three?

262
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,600
Three rounds are international rules.

263
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,440
Which game only has one game?

264
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,160
Why do you always play dirty?

265
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,600
We'll win even if it's three rounds.

266
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,440
Okay, English class is coming soon.

267
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,680
Let's play the last round.

268
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,720
Okay?

269
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,080
No problem.

270
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,560
Sure.

271
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,920
Let's just warm up.

272
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,720
Let's have a game now.

273
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,000
Then one more round.

274
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,680
You lose anyway.

275
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,160
Okay.

276
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,680
Be generous.

277
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,240
It's not worth being angry with them.

278
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,160
Come on.

279
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,360
Ready.

280
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,280
Three, two, one, go.

281
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:57,760
Come on!

282
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,320
Keep the formation and pay attention to the rhythm.

283
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Dayou.

284
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,240
Are you okay?

285
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,800
I'm fine.

286
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,520
Miss Xiammy, forget it.

287
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,680
Beg us.

288
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,600
Brothers, let's go.

289
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,000
Xiammy.

290
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,480
Forget it.

291
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,880
Rammy.

292
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,520
I haven't lost yet.

293
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,400
One, two, three.

294
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,520
Come on! Come on!

295
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,400
Hurry.

296
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,079
Come on! Come on!

297
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,920
Get up. Hurry up.

298
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,839
They can't catch up.

299
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,360
We won.

300
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,280
We won!

301
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,520
You lost.

302
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,800
From tomorrow onwards,

303
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,920
bring us breakfast and don't charge us anymore.

304
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,560
Okay.

305
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,160
Why should we do the cleaning?

306
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,800
You boarding party should play this kind of game.

307
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,720
What's so proud about winning?

308
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
We don't accept it.

309
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
Do you have the spirit of contract?

310
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,520
Your boss agreed.

311
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,320
I didn't call him boss.

312
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,920
Your boarding party didn't recognize you as the boss, right?

313
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,360
We all regard her as our boss.

314
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,920
There's nothing to be proud of after winning this game.

315
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,640
Fight for the result if you dare.

316
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,600
Yeah.

317
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,720
It's a competition.

318
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,480
Sure.

319
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,760
Fan Yuan won't lose anyway.

320
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,160
Fan Yuan.

321
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,360
Don't forget

322
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,360
that you still have a last one.

323
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,800
She ranked hundreds of places in this exam.

324
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,640
Even if you have two Fan Yuan,

325
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,880
you won't be able to lead her.

326
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,960
That's too much.

327
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,440
Say that again!

328
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:44,840
Okay.

329
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Let's see the result.

330
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,200
Sure.

331
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,160
I'm counting on you.

332
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
It's a test.

333
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,680
Study hard, you hear me?

334
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,240
I just lost.

335
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,880
Lose, lose, lose.

336
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,520
Let's go back to the classroom.

337
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,160
When it's done,

338
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,120
It often connects with the words to guide the timeline.

339
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,120
The lyrics are all here.

340
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,560
Remember it when you go back, okay?

341
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,760
Got it.

342
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,640
You have to memorize it.

343
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,160
That's all for today. Class dismissed.

344
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,880
Stand up.

345
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,440
Thank you.

346
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,560
Study hard.

347
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,200
Okay.

348
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,920
Goodbye, teacher.

349
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,840
Wang Xiao Yu, you...

350
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,920
Dear Chief Guardian,

351
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,080
This is the precious study information I collected for you.

352
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,920
and the study plan I made for you.

353
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,600
What do you think? I'm a reliable leader, right?

354
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,600
Fifty words or a test paper to exchange a novel.

355
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,400
Xiao Yu.

356
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,280
What is this?

357
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,960
From now on until the midterm exam,

358
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,160
you have to give me all your entertainment items.

359
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,280
As long as you complete the study task according to the plan,

360
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,200
you can exchange the right to use time.

361
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,080
Xiao Yu.

362
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,520
You're forcing me to go to Mount Liang.

363
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,280
Make a sacrifice.

364
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,160
As long as our boarding party

365
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,880
win their reading style,

366
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,720
I won't force you.

367
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,960
You don't want to be the last again

368
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,280
to be laughed at by those who are not good at math.

369
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,880
She failed math again this time, right?

370
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,240
She's so bad at science.

371
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,160
Why are you still in our class?

372
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,120
He's shameless.

373
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,960
If it were me, I would have left already.

374
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,240
You're right. Look at her.

375
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,880
Xiao Yu.

376
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,600
You're right.

377
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,640
I can't be looked down upon anymore.

378
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,840
I’ll do my best.

379
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,080
You are my Chief Guardian.

380
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,240
Here.

381
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,440
Give me all the magazines and novels.

382
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,280
This won't do.

383
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,240
I need one more page to finish.

384
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,840
I promise I'll do it right after that.

385
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,120
What's wrong with them?

386
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Wang Xiao Yu is forcing her to study

387
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,480
she's forcing her Chief Guardian to study.

388
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,880
I confiscated her phone and magazine.

389
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,120
Even Abbess of Destruction are better than her.

390
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,000
I will never mention it.

391
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,320
Never mention it.

392
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,920
Hello.

393
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,200
Do you have the Hanabi magazine here?

394
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,000
Over there.

395
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,280
Okay, thank you.

396
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,040
Let me show you a treasure.

397
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,600
Ruoxi Zhang.

398
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
I won't watch it.

399
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,200
Why?

400
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,240
I don't want to see it.

401
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,600
Don't think I don't know you're playing tricks on me again.

402
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,760
You are the first one to use these words on me.

403
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,800
Do you want to see what this is?

404
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,360
Where did you get it?

405
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,600
Xiao Yu stole it.

406
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,760
Is it so hard for me to buy magazines?

407
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,600
Can't you think of me better?

408
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,560
Forget it.

409
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,160
Since you don't want to see it, I'll watch it myself.

410
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,120
Let me see.

411
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,760
Ruoxi Zhang.

412
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,880
Give it to me.

413
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,760
I want it.

414
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,240
Give it to me.

415
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,680
Who did you call a pervert?

416
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,440
I am.

417
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,880
I am.

418
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Unlike you.

419
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,680
You're beautiful, kind, smart and cool.

420
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,160
Your hair is thick.

421
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,960
The whole galaxy is not as dazzling as you.

422
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,760
Happy?

423
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,360
What are you two looking at?

424
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,960
I see.

425
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,080
Are you rebelled by reading?

426
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,880
Grandmaster, your Chief Guardian has been revolted.

427
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,760
She was bribed.

428
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,840
What?

429
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,320
What are you hiding behind you?

430
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
Nothing.

431
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,800
Xiao Yu.

432
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,360
I was born as a boarding party, and I was a boarding ghost.

433
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,080
If I read with them, I'll be invincible.

434
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,680
I'm going to study now.

435
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,880
Ruoxi Zhang.

436
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,440
Although you're amazing, I admire you.

437
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,040
but

438
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,600
we two gangs are enemies.

439
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,800
Don’t try to disturb Chief Guardian.

440
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,480
Do you hear me?

441
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,400
Do you hear me?

442
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,200
Are you too immersed?

443
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,400
Monitor.

444
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,680
Okay.

445
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,280
Pull the curtains.

446
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,600
We're going to the movie class.

447
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,000
Rammy.

448
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,760
This movie has the highest votes.

449
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,160
Natmmy.

450
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,480
Don't you like this movie?

451
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Why don't you watch it?

452
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,000
I do like it.

453
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,640
But I've watched this movie many times.

454
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,120
I can tell where it is just by the sound.

455
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,880
I can take this time to finish the notes.

456
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,680
I wanted you to relax.

457
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,680
What?

458
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,440
Nothing.

459
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,480
Why do you copy this now?

460
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,640
I have this habit.

461
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,720
Look at the words I copied.

462
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,640
I can use them when I write.

463
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,040
Don't be too anxious.

464
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,560
You can relax when you need to.

465
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,120
Why don't you watch the movie and do your homework?

466
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,960
You don't like this?

467
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,520
No.

468
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,640
Why should I answer the enemy's question?

469
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,160
Because I have to fight for every second.

470
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
to defeat you.

471
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,080
Natmmy.

472
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,320
Don't study so late in the future.

473
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,480
How many times have you yawned today?

474
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,000
Don't get tired before the exam.

475
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,920
I'm fine.

476
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,720
Everyone worked so hard.

477
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,280
I can't hold you back.

478
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,520
But your health is the most important.

479
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,240
Little Shrimp.

480
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,600
It's really you, little shrimp.

481
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,560
Jiang Li.

482
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,840
When I first saw your name,

483
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,840
I thought it was just the same name.

484
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,840
I didn't expect you to get into Yi Zhong High School.

485
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,040
It seems that you've improved in grade three.

486
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,240
I'm just lucky.

487
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,840
You work so hard.

488
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,680
You always memorize the words.

489
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,240
How good are your grades now?

490
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,880
Did you

491
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,320
in the last exam?

492
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,040
My grades are not good.

493
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,280
So I'm going to study now.

494
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,440
Excuse me.

495
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,720
I saw you put nail polish on.

496
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,600
I'll tell your teacher now.

497
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,880
Deduct your class’s exercise points.

498
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,360
You got into Yi Zhong High School and you're so arrogant.

499
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Why are you so proud?

500
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,360
You're still the stupid little shrimp.

501
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,000
Natmmy.

502
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,960
Who is that?

503
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,600
Are you afraid of her?

504
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,880
Why are your hands cold?

505
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,200
She was my junior high classmate.

506
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,480
She transferred to another school in grade three.

507
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
At that time, I was always a burden to my class.

508
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,240
They often laughed at me

509
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,800
They said I did the same thing as my name.

510
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,760
Like a little shrimp.

511
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,000
Anyone who gets along with me will be laughed at.

512
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,400
So I didn't have many friends.

513
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,000
It's okay. It's all in the past.

514
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,760
Those who know nothing will laugh at others.

515
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,960
is the best joke.

516
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,840
Besides, you're so serious this time.

517
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,200
You'll get good results.

518
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,120
They won't laugh at you then.

519
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,280
Ruo tears.

520
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,640
Thank you.

521
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,000
You're welcome.

522
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,840
Let's get in line.

523
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,640
Here.

524
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,920
Hello, little shrimp.

525
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,080
Little Shrimp.

526
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,960
How do you know this name?

527
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,760
Stop it. I don't like it.

528
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,320
Fool has a temper?

529
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,040
Little Shrimp, you have a temper?

530
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,200
You've gone too far.

531
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,520
Can you be polite?

532
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,760
Rammy.

533
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,400
Ignore these boring people.

534
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,880
One of you is stupid.

535
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,960
and the other is a good match.

536
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,840
Who are you calling stupid?

537
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,640
I said I don't like this name.

538
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,000
Can you have some manners?

539
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,960
I'm just kidding.

540
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,960
You boarders can't do it themselves.

541
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,080
Not yet.

542
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,680
That's right.

543
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,280
You're the best at joking.

544
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Shut your mouth.

545
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,400
Let's go.

546
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,000
Perfect.

547
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,200
Little Shrimp.

548
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,400
Did you draw your self-portrait

549
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,320
Is it good?

550
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,960
Xiao Junyi, are you crazy?

551
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,600
I just told you to stop talking.

552
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
You're the reincarnation of a fly.

553
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,480
So annoying.

554
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,560
I just...

555
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,280
I knew it.

556
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,360
Stupid fish, stupid shrimp.

557
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,520
Xiao Junyi, stop it.

558
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,920
Xiao Junyi, shut up!

559
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,120
Apologize to her now.

560
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:47,880
Ruoxi Zhang, Tian Hongjie.

561
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,200

562
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:19,920
