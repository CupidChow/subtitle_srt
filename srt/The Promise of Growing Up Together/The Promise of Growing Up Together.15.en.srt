1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

2
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,080
Rammy.

3
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,600
Ruotear.

4
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,000
I've reserved a seat for you two.

5
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,120
Xiao Yu.

6
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,800
Thank you.

7
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,600
I won't sit here today.

8
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,360
Xiammy.

9
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,440
What's going on?

10
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
Otomo.

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,079
Is anyone here?

12
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,960
Can I sit here?

13
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,160
No.

14
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,920
Have a seat.

15
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Are you okay?

16
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,040
I can explain the gift.

17
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,600
Well...

18
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,320
I'm not mad at you.

19
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,040
Little turtle, I was wrong.

20
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,160
I gave her a gift for a reason.

21
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,400
It's not what you think.

22
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,000
Can you talk to me?

23
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,840
I'm a virus program.

24
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,200
Talk to Ms. Zhang quickly.

25
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,079
Otherwise, I'll send you requests regularly

26
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,920
until you forgive him.

27
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,000
Stop writing.

28
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,520
Give it back.

29
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,640
Give it back!

30
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
Give it back!

31
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,560
Give it back to me.

32
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,720
Stop crying.

33
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,960
Stop crying.

34
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,280
Stop crying, okay?

35
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
Ruoxi Zhang, you're a big fool.

36
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,640
Big fool.

37
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,400
Yes.

38
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,159
You're right.

39
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,040
I'm an idiot.

40
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm a super universe super idiot.

41
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,360
If you want to write, I'll write with you.

42
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Don't cry, okay?

43
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
I know it's not your fault.

44
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,680
but I really don't know what to do.

45
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,600
I treat her as my best friend.

46
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,040
She doesn't deserve it.

47
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,640
It's okay.

48
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,840
Eat slowly.

49
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
Cheers.

50
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,240
Sir.

51
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,600
I want a beer.

52
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,160
Young lady.

53
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,800
You're not allowed to drink.

54
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,360
Why don't you drink coke?

55
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,640
You adults are discriminating.

56
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,880
Boss is in a bad mood.

58
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm not in a bad mood.

60
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,080
I'm in a good mood.

61
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,760
Yes.

62
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,840
You're in a good mood.

63
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,400
But if you go on like this,

64
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,600
the boss will be in a bad mood.

65
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,040
Z.

66
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,720
Let's sit down and eat.

67
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:36,840
Z.

68
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,200
Sit down.

69
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,360
Cheers.

70
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,440
Cheers.

71
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,480
You said you'd drink to drown your sorrow.

72
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't even have the right to be sad.

73
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,480
I wish I could grow up soon.

74
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,200
I won't have so many troubles when I grow up.

75
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,320
Don't you want to drown your sorrows with wine?

76
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,320
Wait for me.

77
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,360
Come on.

78
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,840
Wine made meatballs.

79
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,000
What kind of wine is this?

80
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,159
Why not?

81
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,440
Aren't they from the generation of alcohol?

82
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,040
Little Wan, wake up.

83
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,400
Look at her.

84
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,240
She's discriminating against you now.

85
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,480
She said you're not from the generation of alcohol.

86
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,720
Look at her face.

87
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,280
Remember her.

88
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,920
and sue her for discrimination.

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,240
Ruoxi Zhang.

90
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,640
Have you turned your IQ into three years old?

91
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,560
So childish.

92
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,880
As long as you're happy,

93
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,640
I can be zero.

94
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,040
Talking sweet.

95
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,080
Are you happy now?

96
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,600
Rammy.

97
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,360
Look at me.

98
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,400
It's her gift. It's mine.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,120
I left it behind.

100
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,960
But I didn't accept it.

101
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,960
I gave her a gift because she helped us.

102
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,760
This is a gift in return.

103
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,360
But the only gift I want to receive

104
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,960
is yours.

105
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,840
I know.

106
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,000
You don't have to explain.

107
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,840
No.

108
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,360
I think I have to tell you something.

109
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,679
Now I've made it clear.

110
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,919
What about you?

111
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,840
What about me?

112
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,640
You prepared a gift for me.

113
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,680
Right?

114
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,960
Yes.

115
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,360
Great!

116
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,680
Boss, your barbecue is very delicious today.

117
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,840
It's my birthday today.

118
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,920
Let me toast you with water.

119
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,160
Enjoy yourselves.

120
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,960
You're embarrassing.

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,240
Everyone is looking at you.

122
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
So what is my gift?

123
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,760
I...

124
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,240
Tell me what it is.

125
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,960
I'll give it to you another day, okay?

126
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,200
Just tell me.

127
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,120
Just a little.

128
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,920
What is it?

129
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,880
You're so annoying.

130
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,920
Can't you say anything?

131
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,880
Forget it.

132
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,440
How's your review?

133
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,600
Do you need my help?

134
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,640
I won't charge you.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,840
You shouldn't have taken my money.

136
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,720
I was going to charge you.

137
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,000
Money slave?

138
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,280
Of course.

139
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,160
There's no free lunch in this world.

140
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,520
But if we're friends,

141
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,480
you can eat whatever you want.

142
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
We're in the dorm.

143
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,080
I'm leaving.

144
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,080
I haven't finished yet.

145
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,240
Hurry up.

146
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,520
The dorm will be closed soon.

147
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,480
Then we won't go back to the dorm.

148
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,160
I'll take you home.

149
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,720
Let's go.

150
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,960
It hurts.

151
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,640
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,560
Zhang Ruoxi.

153
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,000
If you lie to me again,

154
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,160
I won't talk to you anymore.

155
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,920
Okay.

156
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,360
I just want to stay with you a little longer.

157
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,080
Can I?

158
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,560
Sure.

159
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,160
Amy.

160
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,480
I'm ready to go to Beijing Film Academy.

161
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,800
I signed up for the acting class for winter vacation.

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If you have time,

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,160
you can come and watch my performance.

164
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,040
Performance?

165
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,040
When did you decide?

166
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,160
A few days ago.

167
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,640
I convinced my parents.

168
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,080
They all support me to pursue my dream.

169
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,880
Congratulations.

170
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,200
I envy you.

171
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,120
You have your own goal so early.

172
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,360
Unlike me.

173
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,560
I don't even know which university I can go to.

174
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,600
Come to Beijing.

175
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
There are so many good universities in Beijing.

176
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,760
There must be one that suits you.

177
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,880
But with my current result,

178
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,280
I can't get into a good university.

179
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
Let me help you.

180
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,360
Isn't there a year left?

181
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,160
As long as we work hard,

182
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,040
we can do it.

183
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll do my best.

184
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,080
I'll take that as a yes.

185
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,520
I'll prepare study materials for you tonight.

186
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,000
But you have to be prepared.

187
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,160
I'm very strict.

188
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Okay. Okay.

189
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,360
I'll go back first.

190
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,520
I'm going in.

191
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Bye.

192
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,400
Monitor

193
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,040
Monitor

194
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,080
Monitor, bad news!

195
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,000
Li Xiang is fighting with Huo Yongfeng.

196
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,720
They are very fierce.

197
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,280
I can't stop them.

198
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,200
Hurry, let's go.

199
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,560
I used to love you.

200
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,320
Love

201
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,160
may not completely disappear in my heart.

202
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,920
I hope it won't bother you again.

203
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,920
I don't want to make you sad anymore.

204
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,280
I loved you

205
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,440
and gentle.

206
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,720
May God bless you.

207
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,160
The other person

208
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,960
[will be like I love you.]

209
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,040
Hello.

210
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,360
I'm today's broadcaster,

211
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,760
from Class 6, Grade 2.

212
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,840
I just brought you

213
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,240
a love poem by Pushkin, Russian poet.

214
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,000
I loved you.

215
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,880
I hope you'll like

216
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040
and sweet classic work.

217
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,000
Tears.

218
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,800
You were reading it with emotions.

219
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,520
Did you miss someone?

220
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,480
Is this what you want to read

221
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,120
Can I have a look?

222
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Hello.

223
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,760
This is the music program.

224
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,240
Welcome to

225
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,080
And please write your songs.

226
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,600
Is there anything on my desk?

227
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,880
Why is everyone here?

228
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,800
Amy.

229
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,600
When did you

230
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,920
When?

231
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,360
That thing.

232
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,080
You are too high-profile.

233
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,200
What is this?

234
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,440
Hello, everyone.

235
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,040
Next is

236
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,120
from Class 1, Grade 2.

237
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,240
to Miss Xia Mi

238
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,880
from Class 6, Grade 2.

239
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,040
where Shadows chase light.

240
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,160
After summer rain,

241
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,200
Waiting by the roadside of the shadow chasing light

242
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,960
It's not what you think.

243
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,880
We're not together.

244
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,000
It's so high-profile.

245
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,480
This is going against the heavens.

246
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,880
That's my old monitor Fan Yuan.

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,640
It's already been a while.

248
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,480
with a single brilliant feat.

249
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,400
We're really not together.

250
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,480
I don't know where this came from.

251
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,960
Natmmy.

252
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,240
I've been sitting in front of the door all day.

253
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,760
No.

254
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,040
Fan Yuan.

255
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,680
Xiammy.

256
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,920
Follow me to the office.

257
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,840
At this moment, I'll play and sing by myself.

258
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,800
At that time, the air is filled with the fragrance of approval.

259
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,760
A big confession from the radio station.

260
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,240
Are you afraid that the whole school won't know?

261
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,160
Rammy.

262
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,480
How many troubles have you caused?

263
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
And you, Fan Yuan.

264
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm so disappointed.

265
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,480
Ruoxi.

266
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,280
If you go in now,

267
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
will only make her and the monitor get scolded more.

268
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,680
Should I just let them be scolded like this?

269
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,400
Wait.

270
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,360
Mr. Wang is too angry now.

271
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,120
Let's go and find Ms. Qiao.

272
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,440
Do me a favor.

273
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,920
Call your parents.

274
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,840
Mr. Dai is very angry this time.

275
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,720
I have to invite him.

276
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,520
Sir,

277
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,920
This has nothing to do with her.

278
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,280
It's all my fault.

279
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
You can punish me alone.

280
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,400
Help!

281
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,160
Stop!

282
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,960
Isn't this those good students?

283
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,200
What did they do this time?

284
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,800
I heard it's puppy love and fight.

285
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,440
How dare you!

286
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,040
Have you seen enough?

287
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,119
Rammy.

288
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,400
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,440
I dragged you down.

290
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,839
That wooden sculpture...

291
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,800
Monitor.

292
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,160
It's none of your business.

293
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,839
It's obviously a prank.

294
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,599
There are wooden sculptures and letters and songs.

295
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,200
What a coincidence.

296
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,119
I'm sure he doesn't like me.

297
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,880
So...

298
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,240
You didn't believe it from the beginning?

299
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,560
There must be a prank.

300
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,600
You're so smart

301
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,880
How could you be so stupid?

302
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,400
The teacher scolded me for nothing.

303
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,760
It's really a big pot.

304
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,920
and got Xia involved.

305
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,080
I'm sure he'll be doomed.

306
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,640
I even got you involved.

307
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,760
Stop laughing.

308
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,240
It's none of your business.

309
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
Why did you fight with Siu Junyi all of a sudden?

310
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,680
I came here for nothing.

311
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,440
I'm afraid the teacher will scold you too hard.

312
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,480
It's okay.

313
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,440
Fan Yuan said

314
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,000
We share happiness and hardships together.

315
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,160
Stop laughing. I saw it.

316
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,480
Rammy.

317
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,680
Come here.

318
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,040
Rammy!

319
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,160
Stop!

320
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,240
What are you doing?

321
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,000
What are you talking about?

322
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,280
You've only been in school for a few days.

323
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,680
You're in puppy love.

324
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,240
It's a misunderstanding.

325
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,520
It must be a prank.

326
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,200
I'm not in puppy love.

327
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,040
Stop quibbling.

328
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,480
Xia.

329
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,360
Enough.

330
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,560
What are you doing?

331
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,440
Mi has been scolded by the teacher.

332
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't add fuel to the fire.

333
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,360
Mimi.

334
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,720
Don't be upset.

335
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,120
Look, mom is cleaning.

336
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,160
Can you help me?

337
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,320
You spoiled her.

338
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,760
Help me.

339
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,960
Auntie, where is Xiammy?

340
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Uncle, wait.

341
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,920
Wait.

342
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,320
Calm down. Don't hit me.

343
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,920
Monitor.

344
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,720
Ruoxi.

345
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,360
Why are you here?

346
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,960
Xiammy.

347
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,160
Are you okay?

348
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,280
Uncle.

349
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,120
This is a misunderstanding.

350
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,640
She didn't do anything wrong.

351
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
It's all my fault.

352
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,920
You misunderstood.

353
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,440
We were going to clean the place with Mi Mi.

354
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,680
I didn't mean to hit her.

355
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Sorry, uncle.

356
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,040
Sorry, uncle.

357
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,040
Sorry, aunt.

358
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,480
Why didn't you explain to me earlier?

359
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,840
You didn't give me a chance to explain.

360
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,520
Will your dad hate me?

361
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,000
If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have hated you.

362
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,840
It's hard to say.

363
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,520
My dad is very serious sometimes.

364
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,400
Maybe

365
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,640
have been blacklisted by him.

366
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,680
What?

367
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,040
No.

368
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,840
Then...

369
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,480
Xiammy.

370
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,000
Come and help me clean up the kitchen.

371
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,560
I'll go uncle

372
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,560
I can do it.

373
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,280
I’m strong.

374
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,800
Mi.

375
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,800
Help me take out the trash.

376
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,760
Let me do it.

377
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,960
Monitor

378
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,720
You can rest here.

379
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,560
I'm sorry to ask for your help.

380
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,480
Auntie.

381
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,880
Have a seat.

382
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Have some fruits.

383
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,640
Thank you for your hard work.

384
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,480
Thank you, aunt.

385
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,240
Sit down. Thank you.

386
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,160
Are you all Mi's classmates?

387
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,840
I'm her deskmate.

388
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,640
I was her deskmate when I was in Xiammy High.

389
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,200
You're all her deskmates.

390
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,760
Not bad.

391
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,480
Are you staying at a boarding house?

392
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,600
I'm a student.

393
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,840
Is it convenient to read?

394
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,760
Will it be hard to go to school and after school?

395
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't think so.

396
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,920
I feel more comfortable at home.

397
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,040
And I have more free time to study.

398
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,720
Most importantly, the food is good.

399
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,840
Right.

400
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,880
Actually, we're considering

401
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,120
to let Mimi read too.

402
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,760
She has lost weight.

403
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,360
The school food must be bad.

404
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,520
I'm just worried

405
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,240
it's not safe to go home after school.

406
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,080
Ma'am.

407
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,360
I'll take her home later.

408
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,320
It's on my way anyway.

409
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,120
That's right.

410
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,760
Mom.

411
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,280
Don't listen to him.

412
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,080
We're not going the same way.

413
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,520
And I can go home by myself.

414
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,160
Why not?

415
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,040
It's on my way anywhere.

416
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,360
Yeah.

417
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,920
Have some fruits.

418
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,720
Thank you.

419
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,240
Eat your fruit.

420
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,320
Eat it yourself.

421
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,040
Thank you.

422
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,320
Sorry.

423
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,600
What are you doing?

424
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,320
This is mine.

425
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,680
Are you Lin Jin?

426
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,760
Lin Ruotear's classmate?

427
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,640
Yes.

428
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,440
I'm his brother.

429
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,680
This money

430
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,440
to you.

431
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,240
Just ask her for it.

432
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,200
No, no, no.

433
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,880
What are you doing?

434
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,480
What are you doing?

435
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,280
This is my money.

436
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Guys, I...

437
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,400
Someone's here.

438
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,800
What's going on? What's going on?

439
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,600
Ruoxi.

440
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,680
That man claimed to be Lin Ruotear's brother stole my wallet.

441
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
Stop him for me.

442
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,240
Don't run! Don't run!

443
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,320
Lin Jinlong!

444
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,320
Give me back my wallet.

445
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,680
Consider it a loan.

446
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,440
I'll pay you back when I have money for New Year.

447
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,520
Lin Jinlong, can you be a human?

448
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,040
That's my classmate's wallet.

449
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,920
How am I supposed to face people in school?

450
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,000
Do you want to get beaten again?

451
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,800
What are you doing?

452
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,760
Why are you bullying me?

453
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,240
Good girl.

454
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,480
The guardian is here.

455
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,320
Thank you for the food.

456
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,640
See you next time.

457
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,640
Stop!

458
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,600
Monitor!

459
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,920
Are you okay?

460
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,080
Fan Yuan, catch him!

461
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,520
He took Xiao Junyi's wallet.

462
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,440
Stop!

463
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,320
Monitor!

464
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,120
Monitor

465
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,240
Monitor

466
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,000
Monitor!

467
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,400
Forget it.

468
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,600
I got my wallet back.

469
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,360
Xiao Junyi said he was your brother.

470
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,520
What happened?

471
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,560
No matter what your relationship is,

472
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,800
who he is,

473
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,040
But he made a mistake.

474
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,920
If you have any difficulties,

475
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,040
you can tell everyone

476
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,320
They're talking nonsense.

477
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,000
I don't have a brother like that.

478
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,240
I couldn't catch up.

479
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,120
Thank you.

480
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,360
Monitor.

481
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,600
This person is too familiar with our school.

482
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,040
I don't think this is the first time.

483
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,680
I have to inform the teacher about this.

484
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,000
Ruo tears.

485
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,640
What?

486
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,000
Monitor

487
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,600
I think I sprained my ankle.

488
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,560
Can you take me to the infirmary?

489
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,680
Slow down.

490
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,920
You were fine just now.

491
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,960
It's a misunderstanding.

492
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,400
It's all a misunderstanding.

493
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,600
Xiammy.

494
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,800
We already know.

495
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,400
Your rumors are just pranks.

496
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,360
So...

497
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,640
what should we do with this wooden sculpture?

498
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,320
Give it to me.

499
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,600
This wooden sculpture is a New Year's Day gift from Fan Yuan.

500
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,520
It's his concern and blessing for me.

501
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,480
But I don't know who took it.

502
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,440
I hope that kid

503
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,400
don't take other people's things again.

504
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
Don't blame me.

505
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,880
Blame yourselves.

506
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,240
If I don't fight for myself,

507
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,320
I'll lose everything.

508
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,800
Squad Leader Fan Yuan

509
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,600
Is this real?

510
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
No.

511
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,960
If that's the case,

512
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,440
why is the name

513
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,320
on the wood carving?

514
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,760
Could it be...

515
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,560
that the prank did this too?

516
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,160
Who's so boring?

517
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,240
Then who did it?

518
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,040
It's all my fault.

519
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,080
I made her misunderstood for so long.

520
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,000
Actually, the wooden sculpture didn't engrave.

521
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,120
Maybe

522
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,680
someone thinks we're too close.

523
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,520
because we're close.

524
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,880
I see.

525
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,320
Fan Yuan.

526
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,360
Am I right?

527
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,920
Where is your seat?

528
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,840
Let me help you.

529
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,440
Really?

530
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,600
Fan Yuan and Lin Ruotear?

531
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,640
Of course.

532
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,440
Fan Yuan made a wooden sculpture for her.

533
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,320
Of course.

534
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,200
But it's not strange

535
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,120
to get close to each other.

536
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,280
That's true.

537
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,400
Yeah.

538
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,680
What are you talking about?

539
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,160
What did you do?

540
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,600
Tell me.

541
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,960
How could Fan Yuan give you what he carved himself?

542
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,640
You must be lying.

543
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,680
Tell me.

544
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
You're lying.

545
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,160
Xie Yuhan, calm down.

546
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,720
Haven't you seen her face clearly?

547
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,880
Where are your eyes?

548
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,280
She gave him a scarf in front of you.

549
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,680
She ignored her.

550
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,040
She immediately targeted Fan Yuan.

551
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
When will you

552
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,760
see her face clearly?

553
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
Thank you, Yuhan.

554
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,840
This wooden sculpture is for you.

555
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,280
Don't be angry.

556
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,720
That's too much.

557
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,240
It's a robbery.

558
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,360
Fan Yuan has admitted it.

559
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,800
What do you know?

560
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,920
You don't know Fan Yuan at all.

561
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,320
He will never give it to her.

562
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,120
No.

563
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,560
Come out and calm down.

564
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,520
Ruo tears.

565
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,880
Why did you do that?

566
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,880
What did I do?

567
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,080
Do you think

568
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,880
everything in this world

569
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,120
is yours, right?

570
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,560
What do you mean?

571
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,520
Xiammy.

572
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,800
Don't be so selfish.

573
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,640
Not everyone in this world should be around you.

574
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,640
You have enough.

575
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:32,960
Z.

576
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,800
Monitor was nice to you.

577
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,920
but it doesn't mean he should treat you well forever.

578
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,720
That's not what I care about.

579
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,440
I treat you as my best friends.

580
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,320
Friends should help each other.

581
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,680
But Ruotear,

582
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,240
Have you ever treated me as a friend?

583
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Who didn't treat me as a friend first?

584
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,600
You know I like apples.

585
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
but you still took it away from me.

586
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,200
Is the person you like an apple?

587
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,760
Would you be my friend without an apple?

588
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,840
What do you mean?

589
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Do you think I'm stupid?

590
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,760
About the manuscript fee...

591
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,840
About the monitor.

592
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,640
You think I don't know you did it?

593
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

594
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,760
Lin Ruotear.

595
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,600
If you still have a conscience,

596
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,720
don't use the monitor anymore.

597
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,080
What are you doing?

598
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,560
Ruotear.

599
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,000
Where are you going?

600
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,640
I forgot to tell you.

601
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,520
I changed to science.

602
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,960
Starting today, I'll study in Class 1.

603
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,760
What?

604
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,560
Why?

605
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,560
Ruo tears.

606
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,120
Ruotear, this is too sudden.

607
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,360
Why did you transfer?

608
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,080
Ruotear.

609
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,000
Fan Yuan.

610
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,920
Are you here for me?

611
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,600
I'm officially transferred to your class starting today.

612
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,800
I still need your help in tutoring.

613
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,720
I'm afraid I can't make it in time.

614
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,720
Are you okay?

615
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,160
What are you playing this time?

616
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,800
Are you okay?

617
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,840
I'm fine, monitor.

618
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,880
Let's go back to the classroom.

619
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,480
I didn't use my strength.

620
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,240
I didn’t.

621
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,840
Han.

622
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:58,920
Stop it.

623
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,040
Thank you.

624
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,680
Let me help you.

625
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,160
Thank you.

626
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,040
I'll take it back to the classroom.

627
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,520
We

628
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,360
go back to the classroom together.

629
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
See you after class.

630
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,840
Let's go.

631
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,200
Wait.

632
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,400
Why did you go back to class together?

633
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,520
Looks like you're transferring to another class for the monitor.

634
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,040
Class begins.

635
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,120
Let's go. Let's go. Okay.

636
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,080
Okay.

637
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,840
Starting this semester,

638
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,239
Lin Ruotear

639
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,480
will join our class.

640
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,840
Please introduce yourself

641
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
introduce yourself.

642
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,280
Hello, I'm Lin Ruotear.

643
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
I'm glad to be in Class 1 from Class 6.

644
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,400
I hope we can be friends.

645
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,800
How did she turn around?

646
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,440
Isn't Class 6 in the liberal arts class?

647
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,120
Ruotear.

648
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,199
Why did you suddenly change your major?

649
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,480
Because...

650
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,880
Fan Yuan.

651
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,480
Okay, be quiet.

652
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,440
I really want to study science.

653
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,480
But my parents think that girls can't study science well,

654
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,840
so they didn't allow me to learn.

655
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,720
But Fan Yuan has always been my role model.

656
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,880
When he studies hard,

657
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,440
I will be encouraged.

658
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,800
I also want to be loyal to my original aspiration.

659
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,880
I know I just transferred from the liberal arts class.

660
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,600
I’m not as good as you.

661
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,040
But I will try my best to catch up with you.

662
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,640
I hope you don't mind.

663
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,120
We welcome every student

664
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,720
who work hard and work hard.

665
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,320
You're beautiful and diligent.

666
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,640
We won't dislike you.

667
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,000
Our class is very tolerant.

668
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,160
Welcome, Namida.

669
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,480
Okay.

670
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,840
Namida.

671
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,160
There's an empty seat over there.

672
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,320
Why don't you...

673
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,240
I want to sit with Fan Yuan.

674
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,520
Because

675
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,560
I only know Fan Yuan in this class.

676
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,880
And I think Fan Yuan's result is good.

677
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,960
so that I can catch up with everyone.

678
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,920
Okay.

679
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,200
Well...

680
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,080
Chen Simin, sit in the empty seat.

681
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,560
Thank you.

682
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,720
I'll study hard.

683
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,040
Monitor

684
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,200
Thank you.

685
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,520
Monitor.

686
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,680
Thank you.

687
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,040
You're welcome.

688
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,800
If you have any questions, just ask me.

689
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,440
Gently, I'm leaving.

690
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,720
Like I gently

691
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,040
I wave gently

692
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,680
Beyond the clouds in the west

693
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,000
The golden willow by the river

694
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,200
is the bride in the sunset.

695
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,920
in the sunset

696
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,920
in my heart.

697
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,600
Thank you.

698
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,320
Sit down.

699
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,080
Listen to me.

700
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,800
Next month is the 50th anniversary of our school.

701
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,440
Our class and Class 1 are chosen as representatives.

702
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,360
Choreography song.

703
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,960
Singing the motherland

704
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,200
Monitor, go organize this.

705
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,000
We have another program to prepare.

706
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,880
Everyone should think about it.

707
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,800
Let's discuss it next week.

708
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,080
Okay.

709
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,160
Class is over.

710
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,760
Stand up. Okay.

711
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,960
Thank you.

712
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,560
Let's go.

713
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,920
What are you thinking?

714
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,160
Nothing.

715
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,560
Nothing.

716
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,440
Can you help me think of an activity plan?

717
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,400
You have a lot of ideas.

718
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,800
Ten or eight first.

719
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,760
Ten, eight.

720
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,080
You're so naughty.

721
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,480
Give me a discount.

722
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,480
Five is okay, right?

723
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,600
You wish.

724
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,160
Two at most.

725
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,960
Deal.

726
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,240
Write it down. Thank you.

727
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,000
I can't write it now. Let me think.

728
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,240
Take your time.

729
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,360
Let me help you.

730
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,320
I'll help you now.

731
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,760
Do you have an idea?

732
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,720
No.

733
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,040
I really didn't.

734
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,800
Really.

735
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,480
No.

736
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,560
Okay, I'll think about it for you.

737
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Don't disturb me.

738
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,120
The five-star red flag is flying in the wind

739
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,080
The song of victory is so loud

740
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,520
Sing our dear country

741
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,640
From now on, we will be prosperous

742
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,520
Singing our dear country

743
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,680
From now on, we will go to prosperity

744
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,200
Over the mountains and the plains

745
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,800
Cross the rowing river

746
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,920
The vast and beautiful land

747
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,840
is our beloved hometown.

748
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,640
Let's go.

749
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,360
The heroes are standing up.

750
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,520
We're strong and united.

751
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,720
Good singing

752
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,640
You sang well.

753
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,120
Well...

754
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,920
Let's take a five-minute break.

755
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,640
Wait a minute.

756
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,680
Let's continue.

757
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,360
Okay.

758
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,400
Come here, you two.

759
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,240
Lin, Fan.

760
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,480
You two lead vocals.

761
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,840
You must interact with your eyes.

762
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,400
OK?

763
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,200
You have to make it sound.

764
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,560
Okay.

765
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,880
You two go back and practice.

766
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Thank you.

767
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,160
She was close to Fan Yuan.

768
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,720
I heard that Lin Ruotear transferred to our class

769
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,800
because of Fan Yuan.

770
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,640
She was close to Fan Yuan.

771
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,400
Right?

772
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,520
A perfect match for the eyes.

773
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,800
How does Lin Ruotear match Fan Yuan?

774
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,800
What's going on?

775
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,960
They're making a scene.

776
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
He asked you to rest.

777
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Class is over.

778
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,080
Sir.

779
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,200
I'm not convinced.

780
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,760
Why is there a lead singer in Class 1?

781
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,160
Is there anyone in Class 6?

782
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,840
The mentors chose based on your performance.

783
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,840
The most important thing is the harmony of everyone.

784
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,040
I think Lin and Fan

785
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,440
are

786
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,400
are more suitable.

787
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,960
How are they suitable?

788
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,640
They are not suitable at all.

789
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,840
Thank you, Yuhan.

790
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,360
Are you questioning my ability?

791
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,560
I'm sorry.

792
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,760
She didn't mean that.

793
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,160
Humph.

794
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,240
Don't be stubborn.

795
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,600
Don't make the teacher angry.

796
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,800
Don't make it difficult for the monitor.

797
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,800
Who else has questions?

798
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,680
Sorry, everyone.

799
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,480
Practice a song.

800
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,560
Hang in there.

801
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,640
You played well, Ruoxi.

802
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,320
What do you think?

803
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,920
Good.

804
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,560

805
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,520
We'll practice later.

806
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,120
Okay. Okay.

807
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,360
Okay.

808
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,720
That's a tacky name.

809
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,920
That's right. It sounds tacky.

Lin Jinfeng. Jin Feng.

811
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,560
This name doesn't suit her at all.

What are you talking about?

813
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,880
Can I join?

814
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,320
Nothing.

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,480
