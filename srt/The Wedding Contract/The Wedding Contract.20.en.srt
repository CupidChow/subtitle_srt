1
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,920
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,960
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,120
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,520
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,360
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,760
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,400
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,960
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,040
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,200
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:26,320
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,479
Geez!

13
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,159
Gosh!

14
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,239
I won't do it.

15
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,599
No need to exaggerate on the word "geez "

16
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,519
P'Toei.

17
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,159
How's P'Vee?

18
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,999
Aha. Changing subjects now?

19
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,359
You shouldn't have to be his sister.

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,759
If he dies,

21
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,239
will hell take him?

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,279
Khun Ran shouldn't have brought him back to the farm either.

23
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,079
Do you believe that he will cause nothing but problems?

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,799
Regarding the police,

25
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,239
if they can't find any evidence, they can't convict us.

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,439
Yes.

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,079
I understand that it feels like your face got stepped on

28
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,919
when Ran took your woman.

29
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,639
I paid 500K.

30
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,119
I didn't even get to touch her arms.

31
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,519
Orn told me about it.

32
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,519
So what are you going to do?

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,519
How will you bring your debtor back?

34
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,119
Ran got himself involved.

35
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,239
What Ran did wasn't right.

36
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,279
Since Rave e is your debtor,

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,479
Ran shouldn't be protecting him

38
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,679
We've been like this for a long time.

39
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,319
Ran should respect the rule

40
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,639
He didn't just disrespect.

41
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,079
But he wanted to put me in jail

42
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,799
I just talked to Ran earlier.

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,599
I heard about Tin

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,519
Yes.

45
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,439
You should at least respect the rule of the people that live here.

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,479
There's three influential people here.

47
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,359
You,

48
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,759
me,

49
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,119
and Tin.

50
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,919
The rule is not to cross each other

51
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,639
But right now you're crossing Tin.

52
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,999
You're protecting someone who Tin wants.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,999
There's going to be problems

54
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,999
I'll payback all the money.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,519
Sometimes it has nothing to do with the money.

56
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,919
I don't want this to escalate.

57
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,839
Think about it.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,759
What if he doesn't do what you asked?

59
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,519
That's like...stepping on your face as well.

60
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,679
You're home early

61
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,479
All the good things I've done for you,

62
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,519
did you ever take notice of it?

63
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,359
You went out with your ex,

64
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,919
and you say it's something good you're doing for me?

65
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,799
In that case,men will probably have mistresses all over the world,

66
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,999
and say they're doing something good for their wives.

67
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,279
Your husband is no good so you want to find a new husband?

68
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,159
He just gave you a small amount of money and that made you soften up?

69
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,479
No one gives out money for free.

70
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,079
You wouldn't give it to me for free.

71
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,239
So that means...

72
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,319
if l gave you a lot of money,

73
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,759
can you stay with me and not look at other men?

74
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,479
I have to see how much you're talking.

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,759
Is it enough for me not to look at other men like you said or not?

76
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,959
All I have.

77
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,279
Is that enough?

78
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,319
Even if you give me everything you have

79
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,959
but ll have to share my husband with another woman then I don't want it.

80
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,839
Khun!

81
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,359
You're not happy I went out with Orn.

82
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,119
Have you ever asked me

83
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,239
why I went out with her?

84
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,519
Do you know

85
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,359
how big of a problem it is?

86
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,479
What problem?

87
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,999
Vee taking his money

88
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,839
Are you going to come up with an excuse that it was my fault that you went out with Khun Orn?

89
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,679
Also about having Vee stay here.

90
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,959
I only asked to give him shelter.

91
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,079
Not to leech off of you for free.

92
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,079
My brother and l will work to make it worth the cost of food, water, and electricity bill.

93
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,639
You don't need to worry.

94
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,119
You won't lose any profit.

95
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,959
I meant...

96
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,999
me protecting two people that Tinnamai wants.

97
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,359
Do you know how big of a problem that is?

98
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,079
-Uncle.
-Huh?

99
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,919
What is it Pim?

100
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,479
What's up?

101
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,839
Uncle.

102
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,359
I want to know

103
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,599
why is it a big problem for Khun Ran to have me and P'Vee stay here?

104
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,999
A deal not to cross each other's line?

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,439
The three influential people in this area

106
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,919
are like three tigers in the same den.

107
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,919
If they mind their own business

108
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,799
no problems will occur

109
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,999
But if one catches its prey and the other one intervenes,

110
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,639
a problem will occur guaranteed

111
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,079
Some and P'Vee are the prey.

112
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,759
That means Khun Tin and Khun
Yut will be going after Khun Ran?

113
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,479
For sure Khun Tin.

114
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,119
But I don't know about Khun Yut.

115
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,159
If those two gang upon Khun Saran,

116
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,079
Khun Saran will definitely be in trouble

117
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,479
Ever since Saran married you,

118
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,959
Saengtawan Farm has had so many enemies.

119
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,159
Do you realize you've been causing problems for everyone?

120
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,679
-Ran.
-Can we not make the stuffed animal?

121
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,279
I can't.

122
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,279
I signed the contract with them.

123
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,479
Then can we hire a factory to do it?

124
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,679
No.

125
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,319
I will make the full amount just like what you promised the association.

126
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,479
Hey.

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,359
Yes?

128
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,799
Why do you want to make the stuffed animal?

129
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,359
You think l want to do it sol can go out to see P'Nai right?

130
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,959
I guess your mind is always thinking about Nai.

131
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,359
P'Nai this, P'Nai that.

132
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,959
It's you not me.

133
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,679
Can you think about something good?

134
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,919
I don't want Khun Chu to break her promise.

135
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,759
It's humiliating when you can't fulfill a promise.

136
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,439
You're the one that always thinks lwant to go out with P'Nai.

137
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,279
I don't want you making the stuffed animal

138
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,359
because l don't want you thinking about your factory that got burned.

139
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,639
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,439
Sorry you like Nai?

141
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,279
No!

142
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,119
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

143
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,119
Also...

144
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,679
I'm sorry for causing your family problems.

145
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,919
I put you in an uncomfortable position over me and my brother.

146
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,799
It would be nice If everything can be fixed like this skillet.

147
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,999
No need to apologize.

148
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,279
I made the decision to help.

149
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,839
Whatever the consequences may be, I will handle it.

150
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,439
Thank you.

151
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:34,439
I'm going to go help P'Taew and Aunt Noi clean out the warehouse.

152
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,519
Will he get it?

153
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,479
Geez.

154
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,359
Acting like a madam surveying the farm or what?

155
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,919
Have you ever cared about me who has to be tired from doing a job for ten people?

156
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,079
You're complaining already after two days of labor?

157
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,999
I've struggled for months

158
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,679
I haven't complained one bit.

159
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,239
Pim.

160
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,599
Pim wait!

161
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,799
Pim.

162
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,999
Since you're already Saran's wife,

163
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,479
can you ask him to pay my debt to Tinnamai?

164
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,079
Please?

165
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,359
Over a million baht worth of Grandpa's
land that you tricked him into selling?

166
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,159
Just a little over a million baht.

167
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,159
He won't go broke.

168
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,479
Hey

169
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,919
If we pay off all the debt,

170
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,479
we can get out of here and we don't have to struggle like this.

171
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,959
Okay?

172
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,599
Oh.

173
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,639
So then...

174
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,799
Khun Tin won't come after you.

175
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,919
But it will be Khun Ran that will come after me because I tricked him for his money?

176
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,599
When that time comes,

177
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,479
you would be getting away with it

178
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,599
and leaving me with your problems again?

179
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,159
I'm only willing to be stupid because I only have you in my family left.

180
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,159
If I had a choice,

181
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,319
I don't want to be the stupid girl who helps the person that betrayed me over and over like you.

182
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,679
Pim!

183
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,079
It's only a small matter! Help me out!

184
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,359
Nuan.

185
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,439
Before you worked here, what job did you do?

186
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,759
Daily laborer.

187
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,279
What kind of labor?

188
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,919
Just in general.

189
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,839
Like cleaning up?

190
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,599
Yes.

191
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,519
How did you end up doing housekeeping?

192
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,679
Um...

193
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,599
I just want a stable salary.

194
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,319
You can go.

195
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,599
Bird.

196
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,999
We can't let Ran protect those two siblings like this.

197
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,359
People will see us as fools.

198
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,319
We must go to Saengtawan Farm.

199
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,159
If he doesn't hand over Vee,

200
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,439
we just have to drag him back.

201
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,759
I don't want to believe that you would do this kind of business.

202
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,759
Like how?

203
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,959
Not being transparent.

204
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,999
Are you saying I'm swindling?

205
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,239
I never swindled anyone.

206
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,279
But you sold flawed products to P'Ran.

207
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,439
Gossip travels fast.

208
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,279
But no one knows about this except Uncle Yut.

209
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,759
If you don't want other people to know,

210
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,079
hurry up and claim that girl.

211
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,839
Ive done everything already.

212
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,599
I'll just have to wait for her to change her mind.

213
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,519
Gosh!

214
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,799
If you keep on waiting, she's going to get pregnant!

215
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,759
You've been talking nonstop since you go t here.

216
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,439
You guys talk. I'm leaving

217
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,799
Oh?

218
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,639
Nai doesn't have the answer so I have to go find the answer myself.

219
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,479
She comes here as she please as well as leave as she please.

220
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,479
She's like this, Impatient.

221
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,119
But with certain things, shouldn't you have to wait for it?

222
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,759
But sometimes,

223
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,359
it's a waste of time to wait for something that doesn't belong to you.

224
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,599
Hey.

225
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,799
What?

226
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,319
I heard you bought a piece of land?

227
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,599
Is it a secret?

228
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,159
How did you know?

229
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,359
My customers

230
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,119
aren't lame.

231
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,359
Why did you buy it?

232
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,839
To raise sheep.

233
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,519
Raise sheep?

234
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,119
Yes.

235
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,999
I plan to build a small house to sleep in.

236
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,319
It's heavy.

237
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,279
Do you want to go buy the fabric to make the stuffed animal now?

238
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,639
So I can hurry back-to finish making it.

239
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,279
I'll catch up to you.

240
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,959
Better late Khun Saran seems happy n never

241
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,679
That's a big smile.

242
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,519
-Uncle Rong.
-Yes?

243
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,359
Can you bring the things to make the stuffed animal here?

244
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,279
Or if there's tables or anything I else, that would be nice too.

245
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,319
Okay.

246
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,839
I'll let Noi and Taew to handle it for you

247
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,799
Okay.

248
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,759
You can open up the factory when you get back.

249
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,919
Thanks.

250
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,959
You were speaking Isaan to Khun Saran.

251
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,759
You're close now?

252
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,759
You talk nonsense.

253
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,839
It's unbelievable that Pim is really the lady of Saengtawan Farm

254
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,439
Better than a fake bitch like Khun Orn!

255
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,799
In front of Khun Saran,

256
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,599
she's like an angel.

257
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,959
-But behind his back..
-Yeah?

258
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,919
a dog is better than her.

259
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,919
Stop it already!

260
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,639
Toei.

261
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,839
Go let Khun Chu know we've 
finished cleaning the warehouse up.

262
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,799
We just need to bring the stuff in.

263
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,479
-Get going.
-Okay.

264
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,239
Let's go.

265
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,439
I think it's cute when you speak lsaan.

266
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,519
Can you speak like this to me forever?

267
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,919
Mm.

268
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,959
Hello Auntie.

269
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,279
Hello.

270
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,159
Peeling the fruit for the twins?

271
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,119
Yes.

272
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,319
Ran just stepped out.

273
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,359
Really?

274
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,679
Yes. Did you need something?

275
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,999
I want to talk to P'Ran about what he discussed with Uncle Yut last night.

276
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,959
Oh.

277
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,239
I also want to know why he wanted to talk to Khun Yut.

278
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,959
It's about the price on the corn.

279
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,239
Also about him helping the two siblings.

280
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,279
What do l have to do not to have any problems?

281
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,279
Hand Vee back to me.

282
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,439
What's Tin doing here?!

283
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,079
It's not good for-sure.

284
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,839
-Dad!
-Uncle!

285
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,679
Dad!

286
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,279
-Uncle!
-Dad!

287
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,439
-Pim --
-Yeah I know about that.

288
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,519
You two go look for Vee.

289
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,159
I think he's at the farm Go!

290
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,119
Okay.

291
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,839
You should go back Srinuan.

292
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,759
Tin might get suspicious.

293
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,919
Okay.

294
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,799
Thanks for letting us know.

295
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,479
The total is 3,200.

296
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,079
I'll have someone carry it to your car.

297
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,239
Thank you.

298
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,799
Bring the stuff out.

299
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,359
Pim.

300
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,079
Can't you give Nai his money back?

301
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,799
No.

302
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,159
6 Why not? You have plenty of money

303
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,599
Why did you sell the sheep to him?

304
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,919
That plenty of money is your money.

305
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,359
Not my money!

306
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,519
When the contract is up,

307
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,079
I need the money to start over.

308
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,959
That means...

309
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,479
you're making the stuffed animal just so you can save up?

310
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,639
Yes.

311
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,999
What is it Uncle?

312
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,599
I'm on my way home.

313
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,679
Quickly put the things in!

314
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,279
We need i to get home fast!

315
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,319
Go!

316
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,079
-What happened?
- Tinnamai went to get 
your brother at the house!

317
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,119
Where is he?

318
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,239
We've searched the whole farm and couldn't find him.

319
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,599
Now what?

320
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,359
Last one.

321
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,759
The sheep's pen!

322
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,519
Go!

323
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,839
-Did you find him?
-No.

324
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,999
Where is he?

325
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,639
Everyone is in trouble and he's fucking sleeping here.

326
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,319
Someone like him is fine.

327
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,159
He's sleeping here and doesn't realize his head is about to come off.

328
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,159
Come on.

329
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,359
Come here!

330
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,839
Let me go! Let go!

331
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,319
What the hell?!

332
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,239
I'm trying to sleep! can't you see?!

333
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,679
You can sleep here.

334
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,799
But Khun Tin's men are on their way here to take you

335
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,159
Huh?!

336
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,839
Are you gonna stay here for them to beat you?!
I'm leaving!

337
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,119
-Hey!
-Wait up!

338
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,679
Hey stop!

339
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,279
Stop!

340
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,759
Hey stop!

341
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,919
You can't escape.

342
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,279
Toei, Taew.

343
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,759
What should we do?

344
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,839
Oh I know!

345
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,319
This!

346
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,599
Beat him up!

347
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,159
Take him!

348
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,759
I won't stop you!

349
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,279
Kick him for me! I came to help him but look what he did to me!

350
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,239
That's right!

351
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,359
Stand him up.

352
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,799
Stand up!

353
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,719
Better late,

354
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,279
Boss wants me to take you back

355
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,359
If you won't go back

356
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,079
I'm supposed to kill you

357
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,919
Let me beat him first.

358
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,359
He got us worked up.

359
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,799
Sure.

360
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,359
Is he gonna die?

361
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,239
P'Toei.

362
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,599
You're serious?

363
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,919
He'll die if we leave him alone.

364
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,919
But if you jump in, you'll die too

365
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,839
Go get Boss!

366
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,919
Wait Uncle!

367
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,639
-What?
-Let me!

368
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,679
You can't!

369
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,519
Pim! You can't go!

370
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,279
Take the gun with you then

371
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,759
Go.

372
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,639
You won't listen to me!

373
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,839
Don't come near me!

374
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,919
Why did you swindle him?

375
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,999
I didn't have money!

376
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,479
I had no options!

377
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,839
I'll do anything for it!

378
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,159
That way Boss!

379
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,519
Boss said if you fight back, I am allowed to kill you.

380
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,239
You were fighting back right?

381
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,639
No I wasn't.

382
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,119
Don't hurt me. Don't shoot me.

383
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,839
Everyone that is staying at Saengtawan Farm are my people!

384
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,599
No one

385
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,519
has the right to harass any of my people!

386
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,279
But Vee swindled my boss.

387
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,439
Then you come talk to me nicely!

388
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,959
You can't just do this!

389
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,479
If I talked to you nicely

390
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,159
would I get him back?

391
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,599
And remember this,

392
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,239
you're siding with the wrong person.

393
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,439
Stop!

394
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,519
All the trespassers, I can have you all arrested!

395
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,999
Thank you.

396
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,679
I'm the one that gave permission to let Tin's guys go in.

397
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,999
If you still want to protect the wrong people like this,

398
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,159
you will get in trouble, You know that.

399
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,439
That's right.

400
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,119
And since Tin came to ask, I had to do my job and do the right thing.

401
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,439
We made a deal that we won't interfere in each other's business.

402
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,159
But if you choose to protect the one that swindled me,

403
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,919
that means you're crossing the line

404
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,319
Bu I won't pursue the matter

405
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,319
if you hand him over to me.

406
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,119
Can I pay in installments?

407
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,079
It depends on...

408
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,119
how you will pay.

409
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,159
Will you pay with money

410
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,519
or...

411
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,439
Stop!

412
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,119
I came to collect my money!

413
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,999
If you won't hand him over,

414
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,079
our deal that we will help each other will end.

415
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,639
And if that happens,

416
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,679
you need to watch your back.

417
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,479
Just give Vee back to Khun Tin.

418
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,919
It's better to live peacefully here.

419
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,479
I won't!

420
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,599
If the deal is off

421
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,079
and Tin wants to declare war with me,

422
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,159
I won't mind.

423
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,599
I will pay you every baht that Vee owes you!

424
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,519
I won't take the money.

425
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,919
I want your life.

426
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,919
Thank you.

427
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,319
Why did you do that?!

428
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,519
When we moved here,

429
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,639
we had problems with the influential people here.

430
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,239
We had to join hands with Khun Yut and Tin

431
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,759
for us to live peacefully here.

432
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,159
But if you do this, you're the one that will be in trouble.

433
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,479
Pim.

434
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,599
Today Ran protected your brother.

435
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,479
But if one day those people come to get Ran's life,

436
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,799
can you protect him?!

437
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,839
If you change your mind,

438
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,839
I can go talk to Khun Tin for you.

439
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,159
No.

440
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,359
Khun Ran.

441
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,119
I'm sorry.

442
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,919
Don't apologize.

443
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,439
I told you

444
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,479
the consequences that follows after my decision,

445
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,239
I will handle it.

446
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,279
Including this matter.

447
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,559
But...

448
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,799
But I...

449
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,319
Because of you,

450
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,279
no matter what happens,

451
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,279
I am willing to make that sacrifice.

452
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,799
Actually this would be over if he had given Pim's brother to him.

453
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,079
He's protecting them but who's going to protect him?

454
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,079
He's so thoughtless, He forgot that he has two kids here.

455
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,239
If he's not worried about himself he should worry about the twins.

456
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,679
There's no rules for those kind of people.

457
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,799
They can't hurt the adult so what happens if they come and hurt the children?

458
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,919
I'll go talk to P'Ran for you.

459
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,919
Please do.

460
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,919
I don't know what to say anymore.

461
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,839
Yes.

462
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,999
Ow Dad!

463
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,239
You're all bruised up right here

464
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,359
Get well soon.

465
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,999
Hey Dad.

466
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,079
I looked at his face

467
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,759
and then I hit him with the shovel, then I punched him and then elbowed him!

468
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,999
Really?

469
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,399
Yes.

470
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,319
Wow.

471
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,639
I told him that

472
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,239
you can hurt me but don't touch Taew!

473
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,359
Thank you so much.

474
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,239
Without you,

475
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,999
Taew would have got beaten by them.

476
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,159
That hurts!

477
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,119
So it can heal.

478
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,079
Toei.

479
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,079
Thank you Toei.

480
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,679
Toei.

481
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,279
What's he up to this time?

482
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,079
I know right?

483
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,839
I'm really thankful

484
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,679
that you helped me

485
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,479
Thank you.

486
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,079
You're not going anywhere today?

487
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,959
Yeah.

488
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,359
I don't know where to go.

489
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,479
You wanna go out to eat?

490
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,679
Sure.

491
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,639
But you need to come with me to buy something first.

492
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,799
Sure.

493
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,959
Let's pack up. I'll help

494
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:21,999
Okay.

495
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,919
You're that much in a hurry?

496
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,799
400 in three days.

497
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,159
I have to be able to make 135 in a day.

498
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,479
Will you make it in time?

499
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,479
I have to.

500
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,919
Even if I don't sleep.

501
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,999
So your aunt can have the complete amount to send to the association in time.

502
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,119
When you make the stuffed animal,

503
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,839
do you miss your parents?

504
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,679
Let me see.

505
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,679
Does it hurt?

506
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,839
When sewing things, you're bound to get hurt.

507
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,239
I'm used to it already.

508
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,079
Everyone.

509
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,759
Go eat and then come back to finish it.

510
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,319
Sure

511
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:48,679
Okay.

512
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,919
Put the things away.

513
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,599
We should go eat too.

514
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,079
You go ahead.

515
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,839
I'm not hungry?

516
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,279
I want to finish making this batch first.

517
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,759
When the one year is up.

518
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,599
can you not go?

519
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,519
Can you stay with me?

520
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,079
But...

521
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,519
No buts.

522
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,159
You're shameless!

523
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,679
You've ruined people's lives and you don't realize it!

524
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,479
Orn!

525
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,279
What?!

526
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,079
Don't stop me!

527
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,799
If you can't handle her,

528
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,479
then I will!

529
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,639
<i>Did I not take good care of you?!</i>

530
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,079
<i>Why did you do this to me?!</i>

531
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,239
<i>I didn't just get drunk and you slept with me.</i>

532
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,839
<i>But you didn't use a condom!</i>

533
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,839
<i>Perfect.</i>

534
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,799
<i>You...</i>

535
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,999
<i>can find someone better than me</i>

536
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,919
<i>I don't want someone better.</i>

537
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,759
<i>I want you.</i>

538
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:36,000
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

539
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:44,460
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

540
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:49,860
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

541
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,400
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

542
00:45:53,400 --> 00:46:01,840
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
