00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,319
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,359
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,519
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,759
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,159
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,799
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,359
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,439
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,600
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,439
Really Toei?

13
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,479
Yes really.

14
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,359
Khun Ran wanted to drop something off for Grandpa Ruj.

15
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,279
So he had me bring the greens from the farm.

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,840
-Oh the one you had me go pick?
-Yes.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,959
So what happened with Grandpa Ruj?

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,759
What did Boss say?

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,359
He said...

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,319
he wants to kill someone.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,799
Huh?! Kill someone?!

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,839
That's right.

23
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,839
Why are there so many problems?

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,279
Grandpa doesn't seem well.

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,799
Plus P'Vee keeps spending money like it's some piece of paper.

26
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,359
Will Boss really kill someone from that family?!

27
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,640
I think so.

28
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,159
From the looks of it, he seemed really serious!

29
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,359
No!

30
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,839
-What?!
-Who is your boss going to kill?!

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,919
-I don't know.
-I didn't see.

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,679
You don't know? You didn't see?

33
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,519
So what were you guys talking about?

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,119
Khun Ran told us to come fix the fence, He said the rope came off.

35
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,079
Yes.

36
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,479
-Is it this one? Yes it is!
-You're not going to tell me?

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,839
Fine.

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,639
Hey!

39
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,799
What are you doing?!

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,639
If you won't tell me, I will untie all the ropes!

41
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,159
You won't be able to do it if you're not crazy!

42
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,479
Will you tell me or not?

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,919
Khun Ran will go kill your brother!

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,759
P'Toei!

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,639
If we don't tell her, she won't stop bugging us and we won't get our job done!

46
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,519
Where are you going?

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,239
Go see your boss!

48
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,159
We're gonna be in trouble!

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,519
It's your fault! It has nothing to do with me!

50
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,079
Hey you.

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,759
How did you get in? Why didn't you use the front porch?

52
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,519
I came to see Saran.

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,759
You need an appointment to see him

54
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,119
You can't just crossover whenever you want to see him

55
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,479
I can wait.

56
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,759
I won't let you wait.

57
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,999
You should leave.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,439
You can come back another day.

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,639
It's fine.

60
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,279
I'll talk to her first.

61
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,959
Don't you need to go check the plots that will be planting today?

62
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,319
It's fine.

63
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,319
I can talk to her first.

64
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,519
Have a seat.

65
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,119
You said you were going to kill my brother?

66
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,799
You know how your brother is.

67
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,119
You might have power around here

68
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,639
but it doesn't mean you can hurt anybody you want!

69
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,799
There's laws in this country, Do you know that?

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,479
If there's a problem, just talk it out.

71
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,279
If you don't like something, then I'll
have P'Vee come apologize to you

72
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,479
What?

73
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,239
You have money so you think other people's lives are meaningless?

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,919
People who can think like this isn't human!

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,319
And how do you know I was going to kill your brother?

76
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,359
I heard.

77
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,919
That depends if that person you heard it from is reliable or not.

78
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,639
I don't need to answer you.

79
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,799
If you're here to talk about this then leave.

80
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,679
Fine I'll leave.

81
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,599
But I'm going to go file a report.

82
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,119
If something happens to anyone in my family,

83
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,359
you once made a threat.

84
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,359
Be careful not to get charged with perjury.

85
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,599
He probably bribed the whole police station in this area to say I would dare commit perjury.

86
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,519
Your subordinate said so himself and
you're gonna say you didn't say it.

87
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,679
What a thick face!

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,279
Where's Grandpa P'Vee?

89
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,639
I haven't seen him.

90
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,159
Grandpa.

91
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,119
Two people must sign it?

92
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,999
Vee.

93
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,959
-The usual?
-Yes.

94
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,479
On the rocks.

95
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,839
Oh Vira,

96
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,839
you wanna move some place else?

97
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,279
May be we'll make money faster.

98
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,839
Sounds interesting

99
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,159
You're already rich

100
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,639
Why do you care?

101
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,639
I have money but l also want freedom

102
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,679
What do you think Vira?

103
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,159
I'm in.

104
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,839
Nus.

105
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,159
Get up.

106
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,439
Right now.

107
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,639
What is it?!

108
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,759
Go inside the house, Don't wait up.

109
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,079
Where did you go with Nus?

110
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,359
To have a drink.

111
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,479
P'Ran, just let Vee go.

112
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,999
What's your deal?

113
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,759
We went to have some fun.

114
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,239
Someone who isn't fun like you don't like that right?

115
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,679
Think about your sister, Will she be happy or not?

116
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,839
You're a thoughtless brother.

117
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,439
P'Ran!

118
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,999
Enough. That's enough

119
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,519
If you can't go home on your own

120
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,519
then I'll drop you off.

121
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,479
-P'Ran!
-Come.

122
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,959
P'Ran!

123
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,839
Early in the morning like this,that knuckle face probably isn't guarding his grass yet.

124
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,479
Speaking of the devil My sheep haven't eaten the grass yet!

125
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,999
What is this?!

126
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,839
Let me go!

127
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,999
P'Vee!

128
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,079
- P'Vee!
-I better not see your face again!

129
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,319
Hey!

130
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,119
Why did you hit P'Vee?!

131
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,639
You think you can do anything to us now that Grandpa isn't here?!

132
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,519
Hey, you're really going to try and kill my brother aren't you?

133
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,919
What are you?

134
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,439
You have money, power, but no heart.

135
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,439
You think you can do whatever you want?!

136
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,759
Fuck off!

137
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,359
My family can't compare to how much your family has!

138
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,919
But you will never be superior!

139
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,919
Karma catches on like 5G now.

140
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,959
Just wait and see. Karma will catch up to you!

141
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,319
I want to buy this whole farm

142
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,159
I won't sell it.

143
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,479
I rather starve to death than sell it to you!

144
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,479
Name the price.

145
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,799
You don't want to keep a land that is mortgaged right now

146
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,839
-Sell it and take the money.
-l told you,

147
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,839
I won't sell it!

148
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,839
I will never sell it to a person like you!

149
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,799
That's fine.

150
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,359
I can wait.

151
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,839
If you don't like me so much,

152
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,239
sell it and move someplace else.

153
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,279
P'Vee.

154
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,159
Our farm is being mortgaged right now.

155
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,079
What do we do if we don't sell it?

156
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,239
We can't afford to buy back the land.

157
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,919
Pim.

158
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,279
Trust me.

159
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,999
I can handle this.

160
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,319
This is a bank withdrawal slip

161
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,319
Just sign it.

162
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,839
So I can take out the money to pay the installments.

163
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,759
Here'syour1,500,000

164
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,119
Take it.

165
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,599
Thank you Sia.

166
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,359
Here.

167
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,319
The power of attorney and land sales contract that l have signed

168
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,639
The only thing missing is my sister's signature

169
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,839
In conclusion you're selling the land to me for 1,500,000

170
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,759
Another 500 K that you have to pay back the bank.

171
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,318
That's right Sia.

172
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,519
Even when the rancher Saran came to buy it from me, I didn't even sell it to him.

173
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,759
las sure you this time

174
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,919
you will get to humiliate him completely.

175
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,279
Good,

176
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,838
That will be satisfying.

177
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,959
Here's 500K.

178
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,679
For the loan agreement,

179
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,159
at the end of the contract it says you will
give me your sister to pay off the debt.

180
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,759
Thank you Sia.

181
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,799
Auntie.

182
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,439
Can l have half a kilo of the pork bone?

183
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,439
Going to boil it for the dog?

184
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,439
I'll pick ones with some meat on them.

185
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,479
Auntie.

186
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,119
One kilo of Samgyeopsal.

187
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,999
I don't have that!

188
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,239
There's only my foot, you want that?!

189
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,839
Auntie, calm down!

190
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,959
So what do you want?

191
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,119
One kilo of pork belly.

192
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,799
It's that simple.

193
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,999
I don't have any Samgyeopsal.

194
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,359
It will actually be nice that you
give your shoe to him to boil.

195
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,119
It must be sticky
like having rubber teeth.

196
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,479
Pim!

197
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,079
It's me!

198
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,119
Go sh! Are we really neighbors?!

199
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,479
This is yours. 45 baht.

200
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,239
-Okay There's a lot of meat on it.
Your dog will like it.

201
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,919
Thank you Auntie.

202
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,599
See ya.

203
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,439
Pork bones for the dog.

204
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,919
Yeah.

205
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,279
I'm the dog.

206
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,319
Here's yours.

207
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,159
Auntie!

208
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,799
This is your shoe! Gosh!

209
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,639
-I ordered Samgyeopsal. You know?!
-Yeah!

210
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,639
200.

211
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,199
Pim! Pim!

212
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,239
-Pim!
-What is it?

213
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,479
Do you want to come over for some barbecued pork tonight?

214
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,239
No.

215
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,439
I don't want to see your boss.

216
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,479
Gosh! We're eating it in the backyard.
Khun Ran won't go there.

217
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,119
Just come. It'll be fun.

218
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,439
Fine.

219
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,759
I'll bring some vegetables.

220
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,639
See you.

221
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,239
Why so many things?

222
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,159
Orn.

223
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,759
You came to see Ran?

224
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,119
I brought the stuff needed for Nus's birthday party here first.

225
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,799
Since you're here, do you want to stay and join me for a meal?

226
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,479
Sure.

227
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,919
Noi, make extra for Orn too

228
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,159
Sure.

229
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,119
Taew.

230
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,759
-Go call Ran to come eat
-Okay

231
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,479
Taew.

232
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,919
Can you go put the dress in the guest room?

233
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,359
Sure.

234
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,999
Ran is here. Are you hungry Ran?

235
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,639
Orn came to drop off some stuff for Nus's
birthday sol invited her to eat with us.

236
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,159
You go ahead.

237
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,159
I'm heading back to the farm with Uncle Rong.

238
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,079
Really?

239
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,119
The grapes have been infested lately

240
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,439
So Ran has to check in on it often

241
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,279
It's okay.

242
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,359
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

243
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,599
What is it Da?

244
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,239
Did you forget about the dress you ordered?

245
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,919
If you forgot your order, l will follow you to your house

246
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,239
Yeah l didn't forget.

247
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,919
I came to drop off some things at Nus's house first.

248
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,439
You want to see Nus or P'Ran?

249
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,319
P'Ran left to the farm.

250
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,799
He guards that farm better than a house dog.

251
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,319
Gosh you.

252
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,959
It's noon.

253
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,959
Let's go have lunch.

254
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,679
I'll bring you your dress, Send me the location on Line

255
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,159
Okay Sure thing.

256
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,279
If you had ordered and forgot

257
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,799
I was going to expose you during live.

258
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,519
Your shareholder probably doesn't mind.

259
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,119
Can even loan it for free.

260
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,319
Nus doesn't mind but I mind!

261
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,159
I'll hang up now, See you at the restaurant.

262
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,519
Wire me the money for the dress too.

263
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,799
Okay.

264
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,439
Auntie

265
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,319
Da had me go take a look at Nus's dress

266
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,679
I probably can't stay for lunch anymore.

267
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,159
Oh really?

268
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,679
That's okay.

269
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,479
You go do what you need to do.

270
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,639
-You don't need to make extra now Mom
-Oh

271
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,239
How come?

272
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,119
What do you think?

273
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,479
Once Khun Ran left, Khun Orn changed her mind real quick.

274
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,799
She sudden had errands to do.

275
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,239
She probably wants to eat with Khun Ran.

276
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,919
More like eat Khun Ran.

277
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,359
Let me smack you for once!

278
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,359
Why do you joke around?

279
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,839
Who says I'm joking Mom?

280
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,039
I'm being serious!

281
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,439
I even heard her say Boss guards
the farm more than a house dog!

282
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,919
Did Khun Chu hear her?!

283
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,279
I don't think so.

284
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,239
She was having fun talking on the phone.

285
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,359
Is at near her and I heard with my own two ears!

286
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,079
You were being nosy right?

287
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,239
Yes.

288
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,799
Gosh!

289
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,919
If Boss marries this girl,

290
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,759
we are bound to grow chrysanthemum all over the farm!

291
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,159
Chrysanthemum?

292
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,079
What's that?

293
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,319
It's a gold --

294
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,319
That beautiful yellow flower dear.

295
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,839
Ohh...

296
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,919
Pim.

297
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,599
I'm going to step out.

298
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,439
Oh.

299
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,439
You won't eat pork porridge first?

300
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,239
That's okay.

301
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,959
See ya.

302
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,759
Hey!

303
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,159
Why didn't you tell me first so
I wouldn't have to make extra?

304
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,519
I forgot to invite you for the barbecued pork!

305
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,119
All done.

306
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,919
Shall we go eat something delicious in town then?

307
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,639
Sure. We should go to our usual place.

308
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,439
Sure.

309
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,799
When did P'Vee and his sister become close?

310
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,999
Auntie.

311
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,679
Pim will be joining us.

312
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,639
Okay.

313
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,759
The more the merrier

314
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,319
It's rather fun.

315
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,999
When did you invite her?

316
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,999
I saw her at the market this morning.

317
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,279
And?

318
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,479
I saw her buy pork bone to cook I took pity sol invited her.

319
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,999
Pork bones?!

320
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,919
What can you do with that?

321
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,599
May be she's boiling it for a dog.

322
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,119
Pim only has sheep no dogs.

323
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,359
Oh.

324
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,439
That's true?

325
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,839
It's good you invited her.

326
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,519
Ever since her grandfather died, Pim must be struggling.

327
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,479
Uncle, you go ahead.

328
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,480
I'll be back.

329
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,680
Okay.

330
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,599
Hey! Hey! Are you guys done gossiping?

331
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,599
I'm hungry, Is it done?

332
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,799
Let me look

333
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,679
Hey!

334
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,959
This collection is nice.

335
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,759
Good designer

336
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,479
Sure.

337
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,999
Hey Da.

338
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,239
Why don't you start your own business?

339
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,439
A shareholder like Nus don't seem to be helping at all.

340
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,959
Don't call her a shareholder.

341
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,839
Call her an investor instead!

342
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,279
But you get equal profits?

343
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,759
Is that fair?

344
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,639
Who cares?

345
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,599
-After you.
-Thank you.

346
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,239
For two.

347
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,799
Who is she here with?

348
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,319
My nosy self has been notified

349
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,319
I wonder too.

350
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,279
Do you think P'Ran knows?

351
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,839
Those two talk a lot.

352
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,359
Everyone is going to find out about us soon.

353
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,439
Those two are your friends?

354
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,919
Yes.

355
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,279
Should we go say hi?

356
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,639
No.

357
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,519
It's good that we're pretending not to see them.

358
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,919
Okay

359
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,639
Go sh, all of them looks delicious.

360
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,239
Here it is Dad.

361
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,599
Come. The fire has started.

362
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,519
P'Toei, did you bring chopsticks?

363
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,599
Even chopsticks come in pairs.

364
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,119
But "I love you" must have you!

365
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,759
Do you need help with anything?

366
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,279
Help use at is good enough!

367
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,319
What is this?

368
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,559
Corn?

369
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,159
Chili peppers too.

370
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,999
I noticed that you guys like eating spicy.

371
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,279
There's a lot of them growing back home sol brought you guys some.

372
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,919
-Thank you.
-Speaking of peppers,

373
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,000
It's spicy,

374
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,679
But if you're talking about cool,

375
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,679
it's me!

376
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,159
Stop talking Toei!

377
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,919
If you're that cool then a duck is superman!

378
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,839
-Dad.
-Who's your dad?

379
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,999
Come! Come eat! Hello there!

380
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,439
Oh, Boss said he was going to join us but l don't know where he went

381
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,999
Saran will be joining us?

382
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,919
Yes That's what he said

383
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,799
I'll go home then.

384
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,119
Hey! Eat first!

385
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,280
No.

386
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,519
He's even stingy with grass. I probably won't get to eat the pork.

387
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,839
Who wants to stay and let your boss scold me?

388
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,439
Not me.

389
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,639
Why would I scold you?

390
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,439
Boss.

391
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,599
Sit here.

392
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,359
-Sit.
-Please have a seat.

393
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,799
Eat up.

394
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,079
Why didn't Pim eat one bite?

395
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,599
Probably feels considerate of Khun Ran.

396
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,959
Why be considerate?

397
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,360
Khun Ran is a kind person.

398
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,159
If I wasn't close to him, I wouldn't eat either :

399
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,599
Seeing Khun Saran calm like that.

400
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,959
he must be feeling awful too.

401
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,999
Why don't you talk
in your native language?

402
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,399
You hate it?

403
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,079
I don't hate my native language.

404
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,479
I just don't want to speak
it to someone I'm not close to.

405
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,959
The barbecued pork is for you to eat.

406
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,439
Not stare at.

407
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,079
I don't want to eat your food

408
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,519
Then why are you here?

409
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,839
I'll leave then.

410
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,919
Eat first.

411
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,239
I had Uncle Rong put your bike
on the back of the truck already.

412
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,359
Huh?!

413
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,279
Hey! You had to take away my bike
just to force me to eat your pork?!

414
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,640
Just eat.

415
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,279
I'll drop you off.

416
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,759
No.

417
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,759
I came here on my own. I can leave on my own.

418
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,279
Alright.

419
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,999
Eat.

420
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,079
No.

421
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,799
I rather go home and eat my food.

422
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,159
If I eat your food and you ask for it back,

423
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,159
wouldn't I have to throw it backup?

424
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,519
I won't ask f on it back.

425
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,239
Or do you want me to feed you?

426
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,759
What's it gonna be?

427
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,239
No need!

428
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,519
I can feed myself.

429
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,079
This is what they mean by eating five porks a day.

430
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,479
Crispy pork, roasted pork, grilled pork, pork belly, and barbecued pork!

431
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,239
So delicious!

432
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,119
Thank you.

433
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,359
Did you plant the grass I gave you?

434
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,479
Not yet.

435
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,839
Where is it?

436
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,799
Right here.

437
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,678
Why?

438
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,759
You're scared l will take the sheep to eat your grass?

439
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,160
Leaving it in the sack will dry it up!

440
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,639
I already told you the water in my farm won't reach that area.

441
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,639
They'll be dead even if I plant them.

442
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,679
Aunt Noi gave you some things too.

443
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,159
I'll put it in the kitchen.

444
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,880
That's okay. I'll take it!

445
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,519
You're in such a hurry.

446
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,999
For what?

447
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,599
What are you doing?! It's okay! I'll do it!

448
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,959
I'm sorry.

449
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,119
I put it right here I'll take my leave now.

450
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,759
Good thing the pork porridge did
not fall. Otherwise, it :ll be a waste

451
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,319
Aunt Noi gave me so many things!

452
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,679
She's petite.

453
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,999
She should be able to manage for days.

454
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,479
P'Vee!

455
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,119
I'm sorry.

456
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,359
I was being too loud

457
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,359
It's okay.

458
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,679
I was waiting to talk to you anyway.

459
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,999
What's the matter?

460
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,279
Are you dating that knuckle face's sister?

461
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,679
Gosh! We're just friends!

462
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,079
Hey.

463
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,999
Everyone knows he's so protective of his sister.

464
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,359
If he finds out, he will kill you.

465
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,359
Look.

466
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,119
Didn't I tell you we're just friends?! You weirdo!

467
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,679
Go. Go to bed.

468
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,079
It's late.

469
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,519
I'm sleepy too.

470
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,479
You hate the brother but wants his sister?

471
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,839
You're gonna get hurt for nothing if you
mess with his sister and he finds out

472
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,119
Boys', be careful with what you're carrying.

473
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,559
Don't let it get damaged.

474
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,119
Put the vase in the middle.

475
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,599
Got it?

476
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,079
You don't listen to what I'm saying
huh? You don't even turnaround!

477
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,840
Taew.

478
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,919
Nus is having a lot of people over?

479
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,639
Seems a lot.

480
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,959
Spending money like this,
when will she grow up?

481
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,759
Have they been here since morning?

482
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,679
You're the bad one.

483
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,479
You didn't even stop your sister!

484
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,239
You let her spend however
much amount of money she wants

485
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,439
She knows how to spend
but don't know how to earn.

486
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,639
Will she be able to grow?

487
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,639
Just let her Auntie.

488
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,479
Nus only has me and you now.

489
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,919
She didn't get the chance
to live with her parents.

490
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,279
If spending money is
what makes her happy,

491
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,359
I'm okay with that.

492
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,359
Because you think like
this that's why Nus is spoiled

493
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,839
Every time it's Nus's birthday,

494
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,599
I just miss P'Pat all over again.

495
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,679
Two years ago,

496
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,999
if P'Pat didn't have to come to Nus's birthday,

497
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,759
the accident wouldn't have happened.

498
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,759
Yes P'Pat?

499
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,479
I'm gonna stop by Nus's birthday party this year.

500
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,279
You can come?

501
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,519
Daniel is meeting up with a friend who is
a client sol thought of stopping by

502
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,359
Will my kids becoming too?

503
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,839
The women are going to think you have a wife
and kids already by calling them that.

504
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,919
They call me dad though.

505
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,799
True.

506
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,759
- The two monkeys won't be going.
-My turn!

507
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,439
-Please!
- Daniel doesn't want them traveling. It's far.

508
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,519
It's two hours to get to the airport by car then they have to fly afterwards.

509
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,279
I'll see you in two days okay?

510
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,479
Sure thing.

511
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,359
I miss you so much.

512
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,519
If P'Pat hadn't come to Nus's birthday...

513
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,599
the car wouldn't have crashed.

514
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,319
Don't talk about sad things Ran.

515
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,679
It's your sister's birthday today

516
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,479
Can you manage the coordinators?

517
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,319
-I'll go check on the farm.
-Okay.

518
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,599
Go! Hurry!

519
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,479
Go!

520
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,839
Hurry!

521
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,639
Slow!

522
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,959
Eat it.

523
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,799
Once l have money to install the water pipe,
we don't need to beg him to eat his grass.

524
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,839
I don't know how many times I told her

525
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,839
not to let the sheep come eat grass on this side

526
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,119
She just won't listen.

527
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,999
I give her grass to grow but she refuses

528
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,679
Seeing you guy seat grass like this

529
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,639
makes me hungry.

530
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,959
I ll be eating good today

531
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,959
After put the sheep away, I'll have to stop by and thank Aunt Noi.

532
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,839
Savory!

533
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,639
Compared to those fine dining food

534
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,079
it's not as delicious as this grilled pork
with sticky rice and chili dipping sauce!

535
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,319
Eating this

536
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,519
makes me think of Grandpa.

537
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,599
Grandpa.

538
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,519
How are you up there?

539
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,439
Are you doing well?

540
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,439
Look.

541
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,799
This...

542
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,359
is your favorite food.

543
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,319
Don't worry about me.

544
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,439
Me being here,

545
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,519
I'm eating well.

546
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,959
Your sheep

547
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,279
are happy too.

548
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,319
But...

549
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,279
I just miss you.

550
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,279
<i>It's my birthday, Why don't you come?</i>

551
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,959
<i>I can wear anything?</i>

552
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,759
<i>Who's that?</i>

553
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,519
<i>My neighbor.</i>

554
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,599
<i>She's cute.</i>

555
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,239
<i>I want to get to know you.</i>

556
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,319
<i>Your family owes debt so you're trying to catch a man around here or what?</i>

557
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,359
<i>Where's your brother?!</i>

558
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,519
<i>Are you crazy?!</i>

559
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,639
<i>Your brother Vee ran away with Nus!</i>

560
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:25,599
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

561
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:34,060
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

562
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:39,460
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

563
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,000
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

564
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:51,440
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
