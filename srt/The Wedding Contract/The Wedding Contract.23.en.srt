1
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,320
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,360
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,520
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,920
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,760
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,800
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:04,360
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,440
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,600
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,799
So you've accepted
 that they love each other?

13
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,079
Well...

14
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,159
I have to.

15
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,519
What about the ring you bought?

16
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,159
I'll keep it.

17
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,799
For the next girl?

18
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,639
Do you want to go celebrate your heart break?

19
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,439
I rather not.

20
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,079
I just want to sleep here.

21
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,999
You can sleep there every day

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,519
You can sleep there until you're no longer heartbroken.

23
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,319
Sorry.

24
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,239
I thought you were awake.

25
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,999
What do you want?

26
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,239
I came to visit.

27
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,799
I heard something happened and got you hospitalized.

28
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,279
You can leave.

29
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,919
I came to visit you

30
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,759
but you're kicking me out. Isn't that a little rude?

31
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,439
To someone like you,

32
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,159
I don't need to have manners!

33
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,319
I wanted to kill you.

34
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,679
You crossed the line with me

35
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,359
You can't blame me.

36
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,239
Hello.

37
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,919
I came to guest ion Khun Saran about the incident in front of the association.

38
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,279
Go ahead Officer.

39
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,959
I was just about to leave.

40
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,519
Get well soon.

41
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,999
Look after the people close to you too.

42
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,079
Tell the police that he just admitted to doing this to you.

43
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,799
No.

44
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,239
Khun Saran, do you remember the culprit's face?

45
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,159
No.

46
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,799
Do you have any issues with anybody right now?

47
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,679
No.

48
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,799
Vee probably didn't intentionally wanted to kill him.

49
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,079
Or else Ran wouldn't recover this quickly.

50
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,359
He's recovered?

51
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,479
That l don't know but he sure had a bad mouth.

52
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,799
Nurse.

53
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,079
I have other business to attend. Please look after my niece.

54
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,239
Also, go check on her frequently.

55
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,439
Sure.

56
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,999
Doctor.

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,759
The patient in Room 511 lab results are in.

58
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,999
-Thank you.
-Sure.

59
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,799
How are you? Are you feeling better?

60
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,239
Yes.

61
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,639
I have good news.

62
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,159
Maybe it'll put a smile on your face.

63
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,279
You're pregnant.

64
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,999
Luckily no harm was done on the fetus.

65
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,639
If you are feeling better,

66
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,119
please set a prenatal appointment.

67
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,119
So we can check if the baby is healthy or not.

68
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,279
Get lots of rest.

69
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,079
Excuse me.

70
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,239
Doctor.

71
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,119
Please don't tell my uncle about my pregnancy yet.

72
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,119
I want to surprise him.

73
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,799
Sure.

74
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,999
Orn has been MIA for days and hasn't returned my calls.

75
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,079
She's probably watching over P'Ran at the hospital.

76
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,759
What's wrong with P'Ran?!

77
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,759
Nus!

78
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,239
Yeah it's me.

79
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,919
You guys broke up?

80
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,919
Yeah.

81
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,439
We're just different. Our lifestyles aren't the same.

82
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,919
Why didn't you think of that when you first ran away?

83
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,599
Nus.

84
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,519
Hmm?

85
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,319
Did you go home yet?

86
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,639
No.

87
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,959
Why didn't you?!

88
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,798
I'm scared P'Ran will scold me!

89
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,359
Yeah. You guys said P'Ran is at the hospital.

90
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,759
What happened?

91
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,918
He was shot!

92
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,919
He's fine.

93
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,759
Pim is watching him.

94
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,359
Pim?

95
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,519
Yeah.

96
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,959
The girl from Grandpa Ruj's farm?

97
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,679
Good. I'll have an excuse to go home.

98
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,439
Wait.

99
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,079
Why does Pim have to watch over P'Ran?

100
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,799
They're married

101
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,679
The wife is expected to watch over the husband

102
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,679
He married Pim?!

103
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,319
What was PRan thinking?! He didn't tell me anything!

104
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,959
If they don't break up now, they are bound to break up soon.

105
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,679
How can Aunt Chu allow this?!

106
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,279
Aunt Chu allows it but I won't!

107
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,359
What a shame that Khun Saran couldn't remember anything.

108
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,119
If you guys can remember anything about the culprit,

109
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,759
we are still able to find leads for you

110
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,999
I will let you know if anything comes up.

111
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,079
Thank you.

112
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,159
Bye.

113
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,439
Are you here to watch P'Ran?

114
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,159
Pardon?

115
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,519
I asked if you're here to watch P'Ran.

116
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,719
Yes.

117
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,959
How is he?

118
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,839
Go visit him if you want to know.

119
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,439
I want to talk to you instead.

120
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,479
How many times do I have to tell you

121
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,679
you need to go talk to Khun Ran not me.

122
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,919
Alright, let's just finish this up.

123
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,079
I can answer for Khun Ran that he doesn't want you.

124
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,079
Stop bothering him

125
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,079
He and I are husband and wife.

126
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,079
You should understand that already.

127
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,599
I'm pregnant.

128
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,759
You want to say you're pregnant with Khun Ran?

129
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,919
If I was pregnant with someone else, why would I tell you?

130
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,759
I know right?

131
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,759
If you are pregnant with someone else,
why would you tell me?

132
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,319
Hey.

133
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,319
Did you not hear me?

134
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,839
said I'm pregnant with P'Ran.

135
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,919
Your husband!

136
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:37,959
I heard

137
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,319
but l don't believe you.

138
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,279
If you won't accept the truth

139
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,439
then that's fine.

140
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,839
It's not that l refuse to accept the truth.

141
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,119
But the reason l don't believe you is because it sounds unreasonable

142
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,119
How is it unreasonable?

143
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,639
Khun Ran

144
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,839
doesn't like you.

145
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,279
That's enough reason for me.

146
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,439
Another reason,

147
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,519
I don't see when he would have the chance to go and get you pregnant.

148
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,759
When we went to Bangkok.

149
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,279
And also that night.

150
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,999
When he stayed with me until morning.

151
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,359
How can you forget?

152
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,919
because you want me to divorce Khun Ran.

153
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,919
I won't divorce him.

154
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,159
Unless Khun Ran wants to divorce me.

155
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,439
That was some long conversation with the police.

156
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,679
It took so long because it wasn't just the police.

157
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,119
What else?

158
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,479
I saw Khun Orn.

159
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,279
So?

160
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,679
I think she got admitted here as well.

161
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,519
So you went to visit her?

162
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,519
No.

163
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,079
She said she's pregnant with you.

164
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,119
Is it true?

165
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,919
You believed her?

166
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,599
I didn't at first.

167
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,999
But certain things that she said are possible.

168
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,759
How is it possible?

169
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,959
Orn must be busy or else she would have gone to Bangkok with him.

170
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,319
Or maybe perhaps she will follow him there later on.

171
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,639
I only dropped her off at home.

172
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,159
I drank one glass of wine.

173
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,439
But if more than that, I don't think anyone would see.

174
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,519
When you went to Bangkok,

175
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,639
she said she went with you.

176
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,319
I went alone!

177
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,679
And when you disappeared with her all night and returned home close to morning?

178
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,119
l explained that to you already

179
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,919
Nothing happened.

180
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,639
Saying it isn't enough.

181
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,279
I trust you.

182
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,279
But if-there is proof

183
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,479
it would make it more believable.

184
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,279
Are you sure you won't go home first?

185
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,839
I want to visit P'Ran first.

186
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,759
He's with the doctors. He'll be fine.

187
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,999
I'm not worried about his health. I'm worried if he's getting deceived by that girl or not.

188
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,799
That's Orn.

189
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,079
Yeah.

190
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,239
Orn!

191
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,159
Nus.

192
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,759
Why are you in the hospital?

193
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,119
Did you know that P'Ran got shot?

194
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,519
Yes.

195
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,959
Let's go talk in my room.

196
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,319
Huh?!

197
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,119
Pregnant?!

198
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,439
Who are you pregnant with and when?

199
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:58,959
P'Ran.

200
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,479
When you told the police that you couldn't remember,

201
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,279
was that true?

202
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,799
Even if I said I remember, they can't do anything about it.

203
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,079
Why not?

204
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,919
The person that hired him is probably very influential.

205
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,239
Are you trying to handle this yourself?

206
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,639
You got Orn pregnant?!

207
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,999
What about you?

208
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,759
Did you run out of money? Is that why you're back?

209
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,479
I came back because I found out you've been shot.

210
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,599
What about Vira?

211
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,599
Where's my brother in law?

212
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,639
This is as much as I can do for you.

213
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,119
If it's not good enough,

214
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,119
I won't stop you if you want to leave!

215
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,598
Do not challenge me. I will leave!

216
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,479
He didn't come. He's busy with work

217
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,639
Stop talking about me.

218
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,519
When did you marry this girl?

219
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,119
When you ran away with a man.

220
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,759
-Do you want me to go wait outside?
-No!

221
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,359
Stay and listen.

222
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,319
No matter how well you dress,

223
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,839
in the end trash is trash

224
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,479
You will never look expensive

225
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,759
Nus!

226
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,639
It's fine.

227
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,639
Khun Nus just got back.

228
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,519
She's probably shocked to find
 out I'm her sister in law.

229
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,959
But after this moment,

230
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,679
we are one family.

231
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,439
I won't count you as my family!

232
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,919
Go back Nus.

233
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,839
I'll call Aunt Chu and 
let her know you're back.

234
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,999
You got Orn pregnant.

235
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,319
I think you need to take responsibility.

236
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,119
And if you know you don't suit P'Ran
then break up with him!

237
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,279
To be honest,

238
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,479
someone like you

239
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,639
suits to be only a maid.

240
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,959
Not wife.

241
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,159
If we love each other,

242
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,439
no one can tell us to break up.

243
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:31,079
<i>[ Buddhist verses]</i>

244
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,959
Put the stuff down.

245
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,999
Hurry!

246
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,799
Hello Aunt Chu.

247
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,959
Oh hey Lada.

248
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,839
I came to drop off Nus.

249
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,839
Aunt Chu.

250
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,519
I'm sorry.

251
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,519
I know I was wrong. I chose the wrong person.

252
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,279
You ran away with a man and he isn't a good man either.

253
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,799
You're a woman, It's nothing but damage for you.

254
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,519
I'm sorry.

255
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,239
I now know home is where I belong. I'm sorry Aunt Chu.

256
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,239
Please forgive me.

257
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,919
What do you want me to say?

258
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,119
I can't kick you out.

259
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,839
Alright.

260
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,239
Go upstairs and shower then we'll talk.

261
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,799
So many stuff.

262
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,639
That was easy.

263
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,639
I thought you would be in more trouble.

264
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,519
Thank you for dropping me home.

265
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,639
Why did you break up with him?

266
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,759
He couldn't financially support me.

267
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,279
It's passed the age of living together in abject poverty.

268
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,119
No matter how much l love him but if I have to struggle,

269
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,639
l couldn't even eat a decent meal once a month,

270
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,759
I rather come home.

271
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,159
I'll have money and I don't need to get a job.

272
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,279
You can't eat love.

273
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,079
But...

274
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,519
if you love each other and both of you work,

275
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,759
there will be money coming in.

276
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,479
But l want to have it easy.

277
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,479
Not wait ten years for it.

278
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,799
Regarding P'Ran and Orn, it's better to listen to both side of the story.

279
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,679
Why?

280
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,639
How can Orn be pregnant with P'Ran?!

281
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,999
When you left, P'Ran signed the 
marriage certificate with Pim right away.

282
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,159
You're telling me she's not pregnant with P'Ran but with someone else?

283
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,999
Yeah!

284
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,279
Who?

285
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,439
I don't know!

286
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,799
If you don't know and no one comes 
forward to claim to be the father,

287
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,959
I think it's better to leave it as that.

288
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,919
So we can use the excuse of Orn being
 pregnant to kick Pim out of the house.

289
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,359
You're still here?

290
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,519
Yeah.

291
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,799
Where do you want me to go?

292
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,639
You've been sleeping here since l left?

293
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,919
Yes.

294
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,799
Why are you so dramatic?

295
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,519
They love each other, So what?

296
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,959
And so I'm heartbroken.

297
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,159
I know but you're not dead!

298
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,079
Get up!

299
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,959
Let's go eat.

300
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,519
Come.

301
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,839
Your treat?

302
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,679
Just eat some.

303
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,679
A heart break won't kill you

304
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,119
But starving will!

305
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,599
Eat up!

306
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,479
It's delicious.

307
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,479
Is it good?

308
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,279
I gave you the skin because I love you.

309
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,079
Oh.

310
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,999
Orn is pregnant.

311
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,239
With P'Ran?!

312
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,679
That's what she said.

313
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,959
Hey!

314
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,679
But l don't think so.

315
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,119
Why?

316
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,999
I think she's pregnant with someone else

317
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,999
and is pushing it to be P'Ran's baby.

318
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,639
It would be great if she's able to do it.

319
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,599
He has to take responsibility

320
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,479
and break up with Pim.

321
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,599
J just need to talk to her so there won't be any more doubts.

322
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,479
Excuse me.

323
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,759
Where's the patient?

324
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,439
She has been discharged

325
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,519
Her family came to pick her up this morning.

326
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,319
She left?

327
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
Babe.

328
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,839
Babe what?!

329
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,679
You see that guy?

330
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,119
That bad guy who doesn't know what gratitude is?

331
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,919
Just say what you need to say.

332
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,799
No need to talk sarcasm.

333
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,599
I just want to know how thick will your face get.

334
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,599
That's my problem.

335
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,479
Do you know that Boss will be coming home today?

336
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,599
Why are you telling him?

337
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,079
He wouldn't even care.

338
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,759
In that case let's go.

339
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,439
I don't want to see his face!
 Bacteria will go in my eyes!

340
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,839
Let's go babe.

341
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,919
He's back today?

342
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,519
He's coming home today?

343
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,599
Go get the guys.

344
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,839
Okay.

345
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,679
If l let someone else kill him and he doesn't die,

346
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,759
I'll handle him then.

347
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,119
You sure you can manage?

348
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,759
The doctor allowed me to go home so that means I'm okay

349
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,159
Are you worried about me?

350
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,519
A little.

351
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,119
Saran's car just passed by.

352
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,679
Good.

353
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,599
Ran's car is on the way Boss.

354
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,839
Good.

355
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,119
Where is Ran?!

356
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,999
Why are you driving his car?!

357
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,479
Ran went into town with Pim first.

358
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,959
Into town?

359
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,959
Are you sure

360
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,959
you didn't tip him off?

361
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,159
P'Vee.

362
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,119
I came to pick you and Khun Ran up.

363
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,799
Khun Chu told me to bring the car to Khun Ran.

364
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,119
Switch cars?

365
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,159
I just came to switch --

366
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,599
switch cars per Ran's order

367
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,439
Switch cars?

368
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,759
You think I'm stupid?!

369
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,119
Why would he switch cars

370
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,959
unless someone told him to be watch his back?

371
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,159
May be he's just being more cautious now.

372
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,999
Since he did get shot.

373
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,959
Even if he did do it to be more cautious,

374
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,439
but you're the one that drove his car back.

375
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,479
I still don't trust you.

376
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,319
Turnaround.

377
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,239
You're not fully recovered

378
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,519
Why didn't you go straight home?

379
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,839
I had to run errands.

380
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,839
We'll go home after this.

381
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,079
No more stops.

382
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,279
Aunt Chu's birthday is coming up.
You won't have an outfit to wear.

383
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,999
Done.

384
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,239
What kind of dress do you want?

385
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,479
Anything works for me. Up to you.

386
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,839
-Someone like you would --
-Da.

387
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,079
I have one in mind.

388
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,159
Oh then you can go choose the fabric and design upstairs

389
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,359
Come.

390
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,759
Right now.

391
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,159
Wait here. I won't be long.

392
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,919
Self-centered.

393
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,639
You walk too much. I hope your wound hurts again!

394
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,279
What kind of design do you have in mind? I can choose the fabric.

395
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,439
Or do you want one from my new collection? I'll make her a special one.

396
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,839
Let me look.

397
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,119
I think this one would be nice.

398
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,519
You don't have to choose Da.

399
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,319
I want something like this.

400
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,239
Khun Ran is here!

401
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,959
Why is it Vee?

402
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,679
Go.

403
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:58,839
Toei.

404
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,079
Why didn't you take him to the hospital?

405
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,519
He didn't care

406
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,119
when Khun Ran got injured.

407
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
That's right Dad.

408
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,279
Why should we care about him?

409
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,799
Is he gonna die though?

410
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,999
If he does die, I will go get the mortician so we can set up a temple for him.

411
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,479
It was Tin's people wasn't it?

412
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,919
What did he want you to do?

413
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,679
That's what he gets

414
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,999
From the state he's in,

415
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,799
he got hit hard.

416
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,119
Is that Khun Ran?

417
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,959
Gosh! Who else do you think is back?

418
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,919
Who switched cars?

419
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,239
Why was Vee driving Khun Ran's car

420
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,119
and Khun Ran is driving the farm's car?

421
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,119
Never mind that. Let's go.

422
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,799
Do you need anything to be carried down?

423
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,479
-Go help Khun Ran put the luggage in his room.
-Okay

424
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,799
Pim.

425
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,960
Your brother

426
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,479
got beaten up b ad He's in his room right now.

427
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,639
Who did it?

428
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,679
I think Tin did it

429
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,439
P'Vee!

430
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,759
Why did they do this to you?

431
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,479
Pim.

432
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,479
You need to tell Khun Ran to be careful.

433
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,079
It was Tin right?

434
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,999
What do you know?

435
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,439
Well?

436
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,079
Can I talk to your brother in private?

437
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,359
-Where are you taking P'Vee?!
-You wait here.

438
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,599
Where are you taking my brother?!

439
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,799
I won't kill him.

440
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,239
Promise?

441
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,079
I know what is what.

442
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,839
Fine.

443
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,999
I promise I won't hurt your brother.

444
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,439
Nuan.

445
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,319
Yes?

446
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,479
I want to ask both of you

447
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,319
the reason you got away from Tin was because he let you go right?

448
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,079
He asked for something in return, didn't he?

449
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,159
Right?!

450
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,239
I think we should tell him.

451
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,079
I think he can guess everything that's happening.

452
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,319
I have to report to him of your whereabouts and what you're doing.

453
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,599
Even though I'm working for him

454
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,799
but l never forgot the gratitude you and Khun Pim have for me.

455
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,279
Where are they going?

456
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,639
They're not going anywhere soon.

457
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,999
Even though I had to tell him where you two were going

458
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,999
but I didn't want them to kill you.

459
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,159
I know

460
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,159
that Tin will use everyone here as his tool!

461
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,999
To kill men.

462
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,959
What did you talk to P'Vee about?

463
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,439
for saving my life today.

464
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,919
That means you're not going to prank him anymore?

465
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,599
You're going to let him stay here now right?

466
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,799
I already am letting him stay here.

467
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,159
I mean stay like other people and not have him do a ten people job.

468
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,359
I will let him stay here

469
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,119
as my wife's brother.

470
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,239
But he has to work.

471
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,479
He can't be procrastinating everyday. Okay?

472
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,639
Okay.

473
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,119
What?

474
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,479
Scared I'll do more than a hug?

475
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,439
No.

476
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,519
Why did the doctor let you come home when you're still having these symptoms?

477
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,079
I just feel nauseous.

478
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,639
I think it's just car sick.

479
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,439
Car sick in the morning?

480
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,079
Yes.

481
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,599
Go rest.

482
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,919
If you're feeling better tomorrow, you can go see Ran.

483
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,439
Wait.

484
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,239
Can you tell me what you were talking to P'Vee about?

485
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,519
-Daddy!
-What's up kids?!

486
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,479
Try not to let Daddy be in pain.

487
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,799
Sorry Daddy!

488
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,119
You miss Daddy?

489
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,279
Yes.

490
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,959
Does it hurt a lot Daddy?

491
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,759
I'm no longer hurt

492
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,519
You were taking care of him Mommy?

493
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,919
Yes.

494
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,599
Mommy took really good care of me.

495
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,959
If Mommy took really good care of you then you have to love her a lot!

496
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,519
Yes a lot. As big as the world.

497
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,959
I do love her very much

498
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,959
So does that mean I can have her be your mommy?

499
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,599
A huh!

500
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,319
Are you okay with that Mommy?

501
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,839
Mommy said okay.

502
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,999
I need to talk to you

503
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,919
Speak.

504
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,999
Well..

505
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,159
Orn is pregnant with P'Ran.

506
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:57,999
Huh?!

507
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,999
Orn is scared to tell P'Ran or anybody because it might look bad

508
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,279
Besides she feels considerate of Pim because Pim is his lawful wife

509
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,919
Orn doesn't want anyone to look at her as the mistress.

510
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,519
You can look through those papers tomorrow morning.

511
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,159
Go to bed.

512
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,239
It's late.

513
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,599
Although I sympathize you because you got injured

514
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,919
and I agreed to marry you,

515
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,119
but it doesn't mean the contract I have with you will be void right now.

516
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,079
When will it be void?

517
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,839
What are you doing?!

518
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,639
Making the contract be voided right now.

519
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,759
I'll give you back the land.

520
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,159
I will give you all the money.

521
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,759
Khun Ran.

522
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,159
Whatever that is mine

523
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,359
I will give it all to you.

524
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,439
I will take care of you

525
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,839
and your family

526
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,279
so,

527
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,079
whether the contract is voided or not,

528
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,839
it's no different now right?

529
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,119
<i>I can get a DNA test done,</i>

530
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,919
<i>I can do anything.</i>

531
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,159
<i>But the father of that baby is not me.</i>

532
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,119
<i>I'll have the wedding reception after your birthday party.</i>

533
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,679
<i>Hello Uncle.</i>

534
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,079
<i>Are you really gonna be my enemy?!</i>

535
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,319
<i>Did you know</i>

536
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,359
<i>he once applied to adopt the twins</i>

537
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,279
<i>but the judge wanted the 
twins to be raised in a family</i>

538
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,599
<i>That's why he had to get married.</i>

539
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:22,800
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

540
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:31,260
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

541
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:36,660
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

542
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,200
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

543
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:48,640
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
