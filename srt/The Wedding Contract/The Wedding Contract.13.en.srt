1
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,780
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,820
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,980
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,380
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,220
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,620
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,260
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:04,820
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,900
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,060
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:25,180
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,759
You have a smart mouth!

13
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,599
-You dare slap me?!
-Yeah!

14
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,079
I have hands and feet too!

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,079
You slap me, I slap you back. No cheating!

16
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,679
Fine!

17
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,599
If you want to snitch on me again to Khun Ran or his aunt again,

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,519
you're gonna get hurt like this again!

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,599
Pim.

20
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,319
P'Ran.

21
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,799
I'm hurt.

22
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,959
Why did you do this?

23
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,279
Always showing up at the end and misunderstanding

24
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,359
Uncle.

25
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,519
Yes?

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,159
Watch Pim clean the stable

27
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,479
Make sure she cleans every nook and cranny

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,479
I'll take Orn to get washed up.

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,919
Okay.

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,599
I don't know if my hip is broken or not.

31
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,759
Pim kicked me so hard

32
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,959
Let's get you washed up.

33
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,599
If it still hurts, I'll take you to see a doctor.

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,079
Are you okay?

35
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,759
Just unlucky.

36
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,519
I saw Khun Orn smiling at you.

37
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,999
She came here to pick a fight with me.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,439
I'm not going to let her slap me for nothing.

39
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,599
And Khun Ran happened to see when you slapped her back.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,799
Yeah. Why didn't he come in time when I got slapped?

41
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,839
I know right?

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,279
But look at her.

43
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,639
Her face is all dirty

44
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,679
Wash up first.

45
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,439
I'll have Taew lend you one of Nus's clothes to wear.

46
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,679
Okay.

47
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,639
It's good that this happened

48
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,959
sol don't have to explain myself.

49
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,799
It stinks!

50
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,919
Taew.

51
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,439
Can't you clean it better?

52
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,279
You're in a hurry to do it so you can go out with Toei right?

53
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,839
No I'm not.

54
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,839
Clean it nicely.

55
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,759
There's still dust on this

56
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,159
Taew.

57
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,479
Go bring down one of Nus's clothes.

58
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,479
Bring a towel too.

59
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,079
Sure.

60
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,319
What's going on?

61
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,359
Orn fell.

62
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,599
Oh, how is she?

63
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,599
She's washing up outside.

64
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,999
Orn!

65
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,679
My goodness!

66
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,119
How are you dear?

67
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,119
Look at you. You're all dirty.

68
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,799
How are you?

69
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,959
Carefully get up.

70
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,639
Can you manage?

71
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,799
Tell me what happened.

72
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,599
Poor thing!

73
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,599
-Pim slapped me.
What?!

74
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,519
She's probably mad about the horse incident the other day

75
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,439
-Take Orn to go shower in the guest room.
-Sure.

76
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,439
Orn.

77
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,239
I brought you a towel. You can fit in Nus's clothes right?

78
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,119
Yes. Thank you.

79
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,519
Khun Nus's clothes is in the bathroom already You can go there now.

80
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,999
Go on.

81
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,759
Get yourself cleaned up.

82
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,239
Watch your steps.

83
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,359
-Oh my goodness!
-It hurts.

84
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,079
Ran!

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,239
That girl is being too aggressive now.

86
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,479
You give into her too much. That's why she's be having like this!

87
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,959
And this time, did you see with your eyes that Pim slapped Orn?

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,879
Yes.

89
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,079
Pim can't say that we're accusing her this time around.

90
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,359
I saw Pim slapped Orn first.

91
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,519
But I don't know what happened prior to that.

92
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,159
We'll have to ask them first.

93
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,959
But regardless, we have to look after Orn first.

94
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,319
So she doesn't think that we let your wife harass her and we didn't do anything about it.

95
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,319
You're going to be in big trouble Pim.

96
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,599
But I did not start it

97
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,519
What are you guys up to?

98
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,959
What's going on?

99
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,759
Pim got into a fight with Khun Orn.

100
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,399
Khun Ran came in right when I slapped her.

101
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,439
Man, why didn't I come in time when you slapped her?!

102
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,639
Did you slap her hard?

103
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,279
Pretty hard. My whole palm!

104
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,799
Why are you bummed then?

105
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,519
We should be celebrating!

106
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,279
She deserved it so she i can stop being a fake bitch!

107
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,519
Celebrate what?

108
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,519
Khun Ran didn't see when Khun Orn slapped Pim.

109
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,479
Oh.

110
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,279
You're in trouble then

111
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,039
Yeah.

112
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,839
That's why I'm bummed

113
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,639
What are you going to do?

114
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,479
Nothing.

115
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,919
No words to say.

116
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,759
I'll help you blow dry your hair.

117
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,239
No need.

118
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,479
Just carry the hairdryer out with me.

119
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,439
Orn.

120
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,119
Why didn't you blow dry your hair?

121
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,839
You'll get sick if you leave it wet like this.

122
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,479
I can't lift up my arm.

123
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,319
Oh.

124
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,079
Then let's have Ran blow dry it for you

125
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,639
That's okay. I feel considerate.

126
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,759
Don't be, It's right of him to look after you.

127
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,079
Yes.

128
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,119
Here you go Khun Ran.

129
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,799
We can do it in the bedroom.

130
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,479
Can we do it right here?

131
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,239
I can't really walk.

132
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,279
II just carry you there.

133
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,359
You fake bitch! Mushroom head!

134
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,999
When you were with me, you pushed me away.

135
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,319
Now you can't walk?

136
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,679
Taew!

137
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,679
-Yes?
-Don't follow them.

138
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,919
Come massage me.

139
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,479
Okay.

140
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,359
Thank you.

141
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,639
I'm sorry that you had to come take care of me.

142
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,919
It's okay.

143
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,439
By the way, why did you go to the horse stable?

144
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,959
Auntie said you were there sol went to see you.

145
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,839
I wanted to go discuss the price of the corn for this batch.

146
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,919
Uncle Yut said if you want a good price,
you need to wait a little.

147
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,919
China is buying corn from places to turn it into animal food right now.

148
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,359
Tell him I said thank you for letting me know.

149
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,239
Sure.

150
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,519
Is this good?

151
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,919
I want Ran to get with orn.

152
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,319
They're so compatible with each other.

153
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,479
But Khun Ran is married to Pim.

154
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,519
I don't acknowledge their marriage.

155
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,239
You're siding with Pim?!

156
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,239
No I'm not.

157
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,799
Good,

158
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,239
You should be siding with me.

159
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,599
Let them see each other often and talk more often.

160
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,599
He'll eventually like Orn.

161
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,119
They've seen each other since they were kids.
Is it not enough?

162
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,599
What was that?

163
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,759
they see each other often

164
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,599
They will become each other's partner for sure!

165
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,159
True.

166
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,079
It's better to have her as his confidant

167
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,599
than a stupid looking girl like Pim

168
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,119
How long will she be able to put on this good girl facade secretly wanting his money?

169
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,599
Poor like her?

170
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,319
If she doesn't want to be rich and have an easy life then what does she want?

171
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,759
My foot hurts!

172
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,319
Your foot hurts

173
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,319
but my face hurts more!

174
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,479
What are you complaining about?!

175
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,919
Keep massaging me.

176
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,599
Yes Ma'am.

177
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,079
Who's sleeping dead right here?

178
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,639
Gosh Noi!

179
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,639
You have the mask on so early, It's not even dark yet.

180
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,079
I've been cooking in front of the hot stove.

181
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,079
I have to pamper my face a little.

182
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,119
Your face will still be wrinkly anyway.

183
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,999
Wan What did you say?!

184
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,599
After you do your mask, your face will look sleek.

185
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,159
Beautiful like before.

186
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,999
Okay then.

187
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,599
It's hard to move my face.

188
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,639
Aunt Noi.

189
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,279
want to have a firm face.

190
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,079
Can I do it too?

191
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,519
Like this?

192
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,839
Here, let me introduce you to it. Give that to me!

193
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,319
Let me recommend you this.

194
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,079
This right here.

195
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,959
Cheap and good!

196
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,679
Once you rinse it off, you'll be pretty like me.

197
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,999
-Here you go, Take it.
-Thank you.

198
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,959
P'Toei.

199
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,599
Can you help me with something?

200
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,279
Can't.

201
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,119
Can't say no!

202
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,319
Just tell me. Tell me.

203
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,679
Can't say no?'You can't say no?!

204
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,319
Geez, so many jokes.

205
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,159
Do you hear that?

206
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,239
Yes.

207
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,639
Who's playing traditional music around here?

208
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,079
Did I not wash it off completely? Why do I still smell it?

209
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,599
It's not coming from you.

210
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,279
It's coming from me.

211
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,959
I'm punishing myself by rubbing the horse poop on my face.

212
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,799
I came to ask for your forgiveness for making you fall.

213
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,159
Good that you've realized your mistake but it's a little dirty

214
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,239
Next time just do the apology.

215
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,919
Just give me the tray and go wash up.

216
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,079
You stink.

217
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,959
I forgive you.

218
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,959
I can't.

219
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,318
I want to dance one more song to ask for your forgiveness.

220
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,359
The pour was just perfect like it was rehearsed!

221
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,519
What kind of water is this?!

222
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,959
It wasn't water.

223
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,839
Pim!

224
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,999
I just wanted to apologize

225
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,479
She was mad that her face fell in the horse poop.

226
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,799
Sol brought the poop to ask for forgiveness.

227
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,319
You need to handle her for me!

228
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,279
Orn.

229
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,279
Go shower and get yourself cleaned up.

230
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,839
No I'm going home.

231
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,359
You stink!

232
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,279
Come here.

233
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,079
Khun!

234
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,999
Oh no!

235
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,999
I wonder how Pim is doing.

236
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,079
I will not let you do this to me!

237
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,959
It's not going to end so easily if she's announcing war like this.

238
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,999
Yeah.

239
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,959
Driving so fast.

240
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,079
You too Rong!

241
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,679
Why didn't you stop them?!

242
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,439
I want Pim to get back at her!

243
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,119
No one likes to get bullied on one side.

244
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,359
To day's problem is for today.

245
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,919
If tomorrow she wants to get back at Pim,

246
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,599
that's for tomorrow

247
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,679
You don't know what you've done wrong huh?

248
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,159
Let me go!

249
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,319
What do l have to do to fix your bad personality?

250
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,639
What bad personality?

251
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,799
I was wrong earlier

252
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,439
But at the horses table, I wasn't at fault!

253
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,119
I saw and heard what you said and did at the stable Pim.

254
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,479
Did you see from the beginning?

255
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,519
I saw from when you told Orn that

256
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,119
if she snitches on you again, she will get hurt even more.

257
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,279
Do you know what happened prior to that?

258
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,479
Prior to that?

259
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,959
Yes!

260
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,759
She slapped me!

261
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,919
She picked a fight with me!

262
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,519
So who's the one with the bad personality?!

263
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,599
Why didn't you explain?

264
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,119
Why do something absurd like this?

265
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,119
Did you give me the chance to explain?!

266
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,639
Or did you think I was in the wrong already so you didn't feel like asking?!

267
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,999
Come here.

268
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,679
Khun Ran!

269
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,679
Let me go!

270
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,679
Shower first so we can continue the conversation outside!

271
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,279
Someone with a bad personality gets good treatment

272
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,639
While the innocent person gets treated like this?!

273
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,799
So someone with a good personality like you should be treated better?

274
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,639
Yes!

275
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,519
Give me.

276
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,439
Khun Ran!

277
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,079
Why are you squirming?

278
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,639
You don't want me to take care of you?

279
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,239
You don't have to any more!

280
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,599
I'll do it myself!

281
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,999
Do you want me to take care of you now?

282
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,599
I stink everywhere!

283
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,919
How many times do I have to shower to get rid of this?

284
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,919
Orn.

285
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,359
Why do you look like this?

286
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,839
Can I stop now Uncle?!

287
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,839
Stop what?

288
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,279
Stop with P'Ran!

289
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,799
If he's stupid enough to marry that homeless girl,

290
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,799
then can't I just let him go?!

291
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,919
No.

292
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,479
Look at me!

293
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,239
Look at what she did to me!

294
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,319
You still want me to go back to him?!

295
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,839
Go shower so you can calm down.

296
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,519
So then we can talk.

297
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,279
Okay.

298
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,599
What?

299
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,359
Scared of me?

300
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,639
Should n't I be?

301
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,479
Why are you scared of your husband?

302
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,919
You're gonna ask?

303
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,919
In case you want to continue from earlier.

304
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,279
Do you want me to take care of you now?

305
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,599
You have soft lips

306
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,479
Clean yourself well.

307
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,479
Sleep with me tonight.

308
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,919
I don't want to smell horse poop all night

309
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,839
Sleep together all night?

310
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,239
He's sleeping with me tonight?

311
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,639
I'm going to go shower.

312
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,239
See you on the bed.

313
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,799
Earlier you want us to sleep together.

314
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,919
Now you say "see you on the bed."

315
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,919
Will I make it through the night?

316
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,599
But he probably wouldn't waste millions in exchange for...

317
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,479
Whatever!

318
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,279
Better safe than sorry

319
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,079
One single pillow can not stop me.

320
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,679
Hey.

321
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,159
Don't be spitting out stuff.

322
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,799
You promised not to take advantage of me.

323
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,279
True.

324
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,479
If you don't consent

325
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,599
or is the person that started it.

326
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,759
You act like you've never.

327
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,799
At the hospital,

328
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,439
you slept with me already.

329
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,159
That...

330
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,079
you came up to sleep with me.

331
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,999
I didn't invite you.

332
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,159
And l didn't want you to sleep with me!

333
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,279
Well I did already.

334
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,919
I don't want people to think otherwise,

335
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,919
that you and In...

336
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,279
like doing it outside the bed.

337
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,599
Or do you want people to think like that?

338
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,759
Who told you to sleep there and not put the pillow and blanket back here?!

339
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,479
And who told you to make the bed
son eat as if no one slept on it?

340
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,839
Then from now on, I won't make the bed.

341
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,639
But you need to return the pillow and blanket back in this room!

342
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,759
I can't.

343
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,239
From this day forward.

344
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,279
I will sleep on the bed.

345
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,919
No!

346
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,239
I'm at a disadvantage too

347
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,639
I'm sleeping right beside you

348
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,279
but can't do anything

349
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,919
Are you insane?!

350
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,279
Do you only think about these things in your head?!

351
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,159
What's so funny?

352
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,919
What kind of pajama fashion is this?!

353
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,759
Protection.

354
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,239
From me?

355
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,959
Yes.

356
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,959
Because no matter how much you take off,
you will never be finished.

357
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,239
Move.

358
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,679
What are you doing?

359
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,759
Just adjusting the body pillow.

360
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,119
Okay then.

361
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,439
Have you calmed down?

362
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,839
Yes.

363
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,959
Don't you like Ran?

364
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,999
So what's the problem?

365
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,959
I want you to make him take interest in you

366
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,079
Have him want to marry you.

367
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,079
So what's the problem?

368
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,079
That he never was interested in me

369
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,279
But he chose to marry a homeless girl like Pim

370
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,479
And you just gave up

371
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,839
to a girl who you called homeless?

372
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,999
I really misjudged you

373
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,479
I thought you were a beautiful person.

374
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,079
I thought you were smart

375
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,359
Someone who's charming.

376
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,839
And someone who doesn't give up so easily.

377
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,119
It's not like l wasn't trying.

378
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,839
If you marry Ran,

379
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,839
our job will be easier.

380
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,239
Everyone here listens to Ran.

381
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,119
If Ran gets to be a part of our family,

382
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,999
think about who the farmers here will choose to sell the produce to.

383
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,079
Us.

384
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,359
That's right.

385
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,959
I wasn't forcing this on you from the beginning.

386
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,999
You already like Ran

387
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,159
Yes.

388
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,959
A homeless girl like Pim

389
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,279
shouldn't be a problem for you to worry about.

390
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,799
I can't take this!

391
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,079
It's hot!

392
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,919
Knocked out like this, I don't think he will wake up.

393
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,638
That's better.

394
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,479
Just one sec please.

395
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,599
Hello.

396
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,239
Hey are you home?!

397
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,479
I came to collect the interest!

398
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,999
Nus called this morning?!

399
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,959
Yes!

400
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,959
If she called you, that means she needs help with something

401
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,639
<i>Hello.</i>

402
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,919
<i>Da.</i>

403
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,079
<i>It's me.</i>

404
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,839
<i>Nus!</i>

405
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,239
<i>Where are you?</i>

406
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,959
<i>Your brother has been looking everywhere for you!</i>

407
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,759
<i>Never mind him.</i>

408
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,239
<i>But right now,</i>

409
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,919
<i>I need your help with something.</i>

410
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,959
<i>What is it?</i>

411
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,319
<i>Well,</i>

412
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,839
I want you to share my percentage from the sales to me sol don't have to wait until the end of the year.<i></i>

413
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,359
<i>Hey</i>

414
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,639
<i>I'm about to do a new collection</i>

415
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,439
<i>I need to pay for the fabrics and seamstresses too.</i>

416
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,439
<i>But weren't sales great from last time?</i>

417
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,079
<i>I think there will be some left over if you shared a little.</i>

418
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,159
<i>Okay. I'll wire it to you.</i>

419
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,519
<i>Same account?</i>

420
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,319
<i>Yeah. Thanks.</i>

421
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,479
So I wired her the money.

422
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,239
She's probably running out of money.

423
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,919
But she has her credit card, why doesn't she use it?

424
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,359
I know right?

425
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,439
P'Ran probably froze her credit card.

426
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,919
Her running away like that, why would he pay for her things?

427
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,679
Did you save

428
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,159
the number she called?

429
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,639
Yeah.

430
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,319
Try calling her back.

431
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,479
Why?

432
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,319
To see if it will connect.

433
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,759
Smart!

434
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,239
Okay.

435
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,439
Then she'll know we're checking.

436
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,599
Right.

437
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,999
Idiot. She'll know!

438
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,159
Just call and if she picks up, just say...

439
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,679
you wired her the money already

440
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,639
Smart!

441
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,319
Please leave a message. Welcome to call back service.

442
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,959
Don't leave a message.

443
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,599
If l only have this much left,

444
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,799
I can rent this place out for a few more months.

445
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,119
But if move to a smaller place,

446
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,919
it will be embarrassing!

447
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,119
I'm right in front of the hospital.

448
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,959
Turn to your left.

449
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,599
Okay.

450
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,119
I want to take out a loan.

451
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,279
This is the place

452
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,599
How much?

453
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,279
Just a little.

454
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,919
Is there a lot of paperwork?

455
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,919
I just need your I.D. that's all.

456
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,079
I.D.?

457
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,359
Here you go.

458
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,439
Right this way.

459
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,839
Take a seat.

460
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,599
Hello Sia.

461
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,999
Interest goes up everyday.

462
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,839
Okay.

463
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,759
Paperwork is done.

464
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,439
Here's the copy of the I.D. card.

465
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,919
How much do you want?

466
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,999
100,000.

467
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,519
Okay.

468
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,359
Sign it.

469
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,439
Okay.

470
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,839
All done.

471
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,759
If in three days you don't pay the interest,

472
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,679
I will send my guys out for you..

473
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,079
Do not worry Sia.

474
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,759
I will quickly pay you back.

475
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,599
Here.

476
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,639
Thank you Sia.

477
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,319
Hey.

478
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,439
-Follow him.
-Okay.

479
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,439
I knew he looked familiar.

480
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,679
What's up?

481
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,679
I found the guy you were looking for.

482
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,479
He's in Chiang Mai?

483
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,959
Yeah.

484
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,839
He came to take out a loan from me just now.

485
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,079
The money he took from me is probably running out.

486
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,119
Now what?

487
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,119
Have your guys keep an eye on him.

488
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,639
I want him back alive.

489
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,119
I'll have my guys drag him back here.

490
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,599
Okay.

491
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,239
Hey.

492
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,119
Don't kill him yet.

493
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,119
My debt will go to waste

494
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,759
Thanks a lot.

495
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,519
I'll treat you to a meal someday.

496
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,639
You can run from me

497
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,959
but I still managed to find you Ravee.

498
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,079
Hey.

499
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,359
I've played with you for so long.

500
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,319
I owe you a little over 20,000.

501
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,639
You had to send someone to collect the debt?

502
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,119
You should make me your VIP customer instead.

503
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,799
Not send someone to collect debt.

504
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,639
When I play, I have money to play.

505
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,679
Don't send anyone else to collect the debt from me.

506
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,999
<i>He's staying at a motel.</i>

507
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,159
<i>How can you say you got yourself a husband after waking up?!</i>

508
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,959
<i>Are you trying to let other people know?</i>

509
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,119
<i>-ls our marriage --
-Everything was a lie!</i>

510
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,919
<i>So they can stop saying I'm trying to trap you!</i>

511
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,919
<i>Are you kidnappers?!</i>

512
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,239
<i>All done Boss.</i>

513
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,599
<i>Put her in my bedroom.</i>

514
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:36,640
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

515
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:45,100
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

516
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:50,500
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

517
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,040
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

518
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:02,480
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
