1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,520
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,560
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,720
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,120
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,960
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,360
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,000
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,560
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,640
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,800
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,920
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,039
She acts innocent in front of
the guy but she's not innocent!

13
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,599
She said something to you, didn't she?

14
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,879
She said she didn't 
seduced him. He wanted her!

15
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,799
Oh.

16
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,359
She's a fake.

17
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,159
Yeah!

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,199
Fake!

19
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,599
She's definitely trying to trap P'Ran.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,279
What will you do next?

21
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,559
I don't know.

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,759
But those two guys seem to really want her.

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,279
But why did they let P'Ran take her instead?

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,079
Where are you going?

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,959
Go see Nai.

26
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,279
I want to know what he'll do once he knows about this.

27
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,759
You're leaving again

28
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,599
Or n's car.

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,679
Orn!

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,759
-Tin.
-How are you?!

31
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,439
It hurts.

32
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,199
Where does it hurt?

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,759
Jay

34
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,719
Have someone come get Orn's car and take it to our farm.

35
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,479
I'll share you the location.

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,199
Right now.

37
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,639
How did your car ended on the side of the road?

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,399
A motorcycle cut in front of me.

39
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,479
Driving too fast?

40
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,399
Who were you mad at

41
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,679
to drive that fast?

42
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,439
I was mad at you!

43
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,759
Me?

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,239
What did I do?

45
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,719
You did nothing that's what!

46
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,999
You couldn't handle Pim

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,599
so now P'Ran is married to her.

48
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,399
Married you say?

49
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,279
She just got discharged yesterday

50
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,119
When did they get married?

51
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,959
At the hospital.

52
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,079
Oh.

53
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,959
No wonder.

54
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,479
That's why he went to buy back Pim's land at the bank.

55
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,999
You're an influential person in that area.

56
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,679
But you let P'Ran humiliate you time after time.

57
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,599
You couldn't even handle one small girl

58
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,679
You just let P'Ran scoop her away

59
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,439
How embarrassing.

60
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,079
If you can't take Pim back,

61
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,519
I think...

62
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,919
no one here will respect you anymore.

63
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,039
What did you buy?

64
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,520
Clothes.

65
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,279
For the kids?

66
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,399
For Pim.

67
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,199
Ran.

68
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,399
She's living here temporary.

69
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,879
You had to buy her this many clothes?

70
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,799
She's my wife.

71
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,119
She needs to look good for my image.

72
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,279
Wife this, wife that.

73
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,839
Did you get a wife just to be a burden for you?

74
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,759
You make him make you breakfast in the morning.

75
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,079
Then in the afternoon you make him go buy you things.

76
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,319
Ever since you walked into this house,

77
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,719
I haven't seen you do anything around here.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,559
Excuse me.

79
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,799
Wash it for Pim.

80
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,319
Don't was hit.

81
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,359
Have her was hit herself.

82
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,719
She can't act like the madam of this house.

83
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,879
You're a petite girl

84
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,399
but you walk so fast.

85
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,359
Where are you going?

86
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,879
Go talk in the car.

87
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,439
It's dangerous out here.

88
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,399
Let go!

89
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,040
Let go!

90
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,479
Let go!

91
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,159
Let me go!

92
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,079
Where are you going?

93
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,119
I'm going home!

94
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,199
Sit still.

95
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,479
I'll drop you off.

96
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,239
It's Saran's car.

97
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,479
He left with a girl

98
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,639
Boss said kill the guy

99
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,959
but save the girl.

100
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,479
Stay strong Pim.

101
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,879
Why is it just this much left of the house?

102
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,119
Why did you do this?!

103
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,479
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

104
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,199
If not you then who?!

105
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,559
You wanted this place at a cheap price If Grandpa didn't die,

106
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,279
you wouldn't have burned my house down right?!

107
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,959
Huh?!

108
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,199
Pim.

109
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,679
It was an accident.

110
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,359
-Right now your sheep--
- You're not human!

111
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,119
What is your heart made of?

112
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,639
What did my sheep do to you?

113
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,639
Why do this to them?!

114
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,199
Animals have hearts too!

115
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,959
Be careful Pim.

116
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,159
Did you hire them to scare me?

117
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,199
Run!

118
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,559
Don't shoot!

119
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,999
You might shoot the girl!

120
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,079
Go!

121
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,399
Let's go.

122
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,079
Look everywhere

123
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,119
We need to cross over to my farm.

124
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,359
So my. Workers can come help us.

125
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,159
Why did you hire them?

126
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,399
Are you crazy?!

127
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,279
We're about to get killed.

128
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,479
Stop yelling for them to come kill us.

129
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,199
Let's go.

130
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,039
Who are they?

131
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,999
I don't know.

132
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,079
I know as much as you do

133
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,679
They left.

134
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,879
we need to reach' my farm.

135
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,759
Why did you pull?!

136
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,199
They didn't really leave

137
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,599
Go that way.

138
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,279
How did you know?

139
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,199
What?

140
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,119
You're gonna say they're! my people again?

141
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,959
I wouldn't hire someone to come shoot myself!

142
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,879
Even a crazy person wouldn't do that.

143
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,999
So how did you know they would wait by the car?

144
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,639
Because I'm smart.

145
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,880
I'm smart.

146
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,079
I don't want to die yet so I took a guess.

147
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,639
Go. Keep walking

148
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,279
Stop thinking i this is my part of the plan.

149
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,559
If it was really my plan,

150
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,839
I wouldn't be risking myself with you.

151
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,599
Crazy girl.

152
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,279
Hey! Let's go!

153
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,399
Hey! Surround the place!

154
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,599
Were those gunshots?

155
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,879
I don't know.

156
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,759
You always don't know!

157
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,759
What do you know?

158
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,199
They're not at the stable. They all left

159
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,319
Mok and Khun Saran is also gone.

160
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,639
I went to check Grandpa Ruj's farm .There's bullet holes everywhere on the car

161
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,079
Two motorcycles drove passed me too.

162
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,199
Oh my god.

163
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,119
Someone is trying to hurt Ran.

164
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,279
It's all Pim's fault.

165
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,959
She's pretending to be weak.

166
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,559
I criticized her and she acted like she couldn't tolerate it.

167
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,759
She pretended to walk away

168
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,599
She took my nephew to get injured.

169
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,679
What happened?

170
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,919
Orn.

171
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,079
It's Ran.

172
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,559
She followed that girl outside

173
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,519
Perhaps they have the newlyweds syndrome?

174
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,879
Seems like you will have another grandchild.

175
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,399
I don't want her child.

176
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,679
I already have two grandchildren. I don't want any more.

177
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,439
Just wait and see.

178
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,399
If anything happens to Ran, I will kick Pim out of the house!

179
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,079
Let's separate!

180
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,959
You know how to ride a horse right?

181
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,519
Meet me on the hill ahead.

182
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:34,999
Go!

183
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,959
Stop!

184
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,279
I will shoot if you don't stop!

185
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,879
Hey!

186
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,999
Khun Ran!

187
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,559
Does it hurt a lot?

188
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,679
No.

189
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,279
Let's go home so we can check your wound.

190
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,239
Did you know...

191
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,959
I come here often to watch you?

192
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,679
I do.

193
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,759
You came to guard your grass

194
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,959
You were scared I would take my sheep to come eat your grass.

195
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,679
Can you tell me

196
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,999
why did you burn my house?

197
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,199
I didn't do it.

198
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,679
If not you then who did it?

199
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,879
The person that will lose the most benefit.

200
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,079
The person that wants this piece of land the most.

201
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,639
Khun Tin?

202
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,959
I don't know.

203
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,439
I don't want to accuse anyone without evidence.

204
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,759
Can I go back to get what's left?

205
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,079
Toei called for the fire truck.

206
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,719
But by the time they go t here.

207
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,199
What the hell?

208
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,399
You took the gang to go handle one person

209
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,679
but you couldn't do anything

210
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,679
And you have the nerves to come back here?!

211
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,519
They know the place better than us.

212
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,679
Every farm looks the same!

213
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,879
I really want to throw your brains for the dog to eat!

214
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,079
They didn't know beforehand but you couldn't do anything to them!

215
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,159
And you also came back looking like this!

216
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,959
So don't even tell me you guys don't know the area.

217
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,279
You just couldn't fight them.

218
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,599
But I really didn't know that that area was the horse stable.

219
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Do you know what this is?

220
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,399
Don't... Don't!

221
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,159
Go bury him.

222
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,399
- But Boss--
-Bury him alive!

223
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,399
Are you gonna do it or do you want me to bury you guys?

224
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,639
Go! What are you waiting for?!

225
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,479
Don't! Don't!

226
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,599
Don't!

227
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,839
Let me go!

228
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,999
Idiot!

229
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,279
Don't cry.

230
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,039
A house is where you live

231
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,439
The reason you're crying

232
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,119
is because you're attached to it.

233
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,879
The house is a memory for the people you loved.

234
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,119
But don't forget that.

235
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,479
everything is in your memories still.

236
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,079
You remember that Grandpa Ruj sat here right?

237
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,359
Close your eyes.

238
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,639
Can you try opening your heart up and listen to me?

239
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,439
The good memories

240
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,879
aren't in this house.

241
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,199
But it's in your heart.

242
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,479
Stop crying now.

243
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,599
You have your younger siblings waiting for you.

244
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,439
Younger siblings?

245
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,679
Your sheep.

246
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,159
My sheep?

247
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,759
Did you bury my sheep or what?

248
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,479
Why is it so far?

249
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,679
I slaughtered them in the woods

250
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,119
I shouldn't have trusted you.

251
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,199
How could I believed that you saved my sheep?!

252
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,679
What are you doing?!

253
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,279
Trying to kill me or what?!

254
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,679
You're gonna check it out?

255
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,559
Yeah.

256
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,639
Wait quietly for me here

257
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,079
P'Jay!

258
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,599
P'Jay don't do anything to me please!

259
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,599
I'm begging you!

260
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,479
Just let me go!

261
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,879
I'm sorry.

262
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,239
If it's not you,

263
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,399
it would have to be us

264
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,679
Brother! Just let me go!

265
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,279
P'Jay!

266
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,359
-Just let me go please!
-Hey! Hurry up!

267
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,999
Throw him down.

268
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,239
Don't do anything to me! Let me go!

269
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,119
Let me go!

270
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,879
Don't!

271
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,399
Let me go!

272
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,679
Don't!

273
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,239
P'Jay!

274
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,079
P'Jay let me go!

275
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,239
Hurry.

276
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,879
Oh!

277
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,999
I told you to wait there, Why did you follow me?

278
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,799
Being there alone is scary too!

279
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,639
What are they doing?

280
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,719
Burying.

281
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,239
Burying their own people alive.

282
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,479
Huh?!

283
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,679
Alive?!

284
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,879
Forgive me.

285
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,479
Let's go.

286
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,919
Oh!

287
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,719
Pim!

288
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,959
What are you doing?

289
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,839
Helping him!

290
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,119
Pim.

291
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,559
Pim. Pim.

292
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,759
Pim.

293
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,399
I think it's too late.

294
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,279
I don't think he's alive

295
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,679
Let's go.

296
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,839
I'll handle this tomorrow morning.

297
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,439
Thank you.

298
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,119
You're thanking me?

299
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,119
It's just us here.

300
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,239
If I'm not thanking you then who am I thanking?

301
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,479
You were criticizing me earlier.

302
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,719
Thank you.

303
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,079
Rong.

304
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,079
Take our people to go look for Ran.

305
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,479
With the gunshots dying down like this,

306
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,199
I don't know if Ran is hurt or not.

307
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,279
Okay.

308
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,799
Stay and look after Ma'am here.

309
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,479
Okay.

310
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,319
I think.

311
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,279
you should take her home instead.

312
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,159
I don't know if those people will come back or not.

313
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,079
I don't know what they want either

314
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,639
P'Ran will be okay Aunt Chu.

315
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,679
Yes.

316
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,239
Horse.

317
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,239
I hear a horse.

318
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,679
Khun Ran.

319
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,599
Ran!

320
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,839
Slowly get down.

321
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,679
Khun Ran.

322
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,799
I heard gunshots when I came by.

323
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,319
I heard you went outside.

324
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,198
You had to go look for someone who was playing hard to get.

325
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,119
Nothing happened.

326
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,119
Of course something happened.

327
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,559
The stable was destroyed

328
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,519
Plus your car is filled with bullet holes

329
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,519
And you're going to say nothing happened?

330
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,399
He's still bleeding Auntie!

331
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,599
What happened?

332
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,879
Mok crashed into a tree branch

333
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,239
The branch just grazed me

334
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,399
It's nothing

335
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,439
Everyone go rest.

336
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,999
Shameless.

337
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,079
You took someone to get hurt and you're just gonna stand there.

338
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,639
I'm sorry Khun Chu

339
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,959
for startling you.

340
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,119
Orn.

341
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,719
Take Ran home.

342
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,759
Okay.

343
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,719
Can you walk?

344
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,479
I'll help support you there.

345
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
You can't walk?

346
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,279
I'll help you.

347
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,479
Wo... Wo...

348
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,919
You mean wow?

349
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,719
Watch your steps

350
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,879
I told Orn to take you home.

351
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,959
It's okay.

352
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,399
Pim can do it.

353
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,479
We live in the same house anyway.

354
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,239
Up to you then.

355
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,519
As the wife,

356
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,679
I should take care of my husband.

357
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,319
If you can't shower on your own,

358
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,479
I'll wipe you down when you're in the room.

359
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,999
Khun orn.

360
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,239
I'll have P'Toei send you out.

361
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,559
Oh shit.

362
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,439
No need.

363
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,639
I can send myself out

364
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,799
I thought you were going to tell her

365
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,999
the husband must take :good care of the wife

366
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,799
But if it were me,

367
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,919
I will take good care of you

368
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,679
Take care?

369
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,039
Take good care of her?

370
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,039
She was talking about Boss.

371
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,039
I'm sorry Dad.

372
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,559
Who's your dad?

373
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,479
I'm sorry Wife.

374
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,199
Who's your wife?

375
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,639
What?

376
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,279
I'm hurt.

377
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,639
I'm being attacked.

378
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,119
I will kick your mouth!

379
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,039
Don't hurt me

380
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,239
You played the jealous wife pretty good.

381
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,919
What are you looking for?

382
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,199
The medicine box

383
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,399
So I can dress your wound before you shower.

384
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,999
If it gets wet, it'll get infected.

385
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:50,999
Here.

386
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,839
Sit down.

387
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,159
I'll dress your wound.

388
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,199
What will you do with what we saw earlier?

389
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,319
About Tinnamai burying someone alive?

390
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,159
Yeah.

391
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,439
I'll file a report tomorrow morning.

392
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,599
Hey

393
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,999
The reason you married me

394
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,999
was just to get Grandpa's land?

395
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,279
Why?

396
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,359
You want me to answer I wanted you more?

397
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,599
I'm not playing.

398
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,399
A contract?

399
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,639
Your grandfather entrusted you to me

400
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,599
My dearest Pim,

401
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,319
I sold the farm to Khun Ran.

402
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,799
The 500K we owe for the land

403
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,999
will be paid by Khun Ran.

404
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,279
The relationship l have with him

405
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,279
is more than the value of our farm.

406
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,479
I'm sorry

407
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,079
that I have nothing to give you as an inheritance.

408
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,519
I'm sorry

409
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,999
that I couldn't give you a good life you deserved.

410
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,800
But I love you.

411
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,639
I love you the most.

412
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,599
I want you to have good opportunities in life.

413
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,599
I want you to be happy

414
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,199
Khun Ran is a good person.

415
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,839
I believe he can make you happy.

416
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,599
I'm entrusting you to him..

417
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,359
May you have a happy marriage.

418
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,399
Take care of each other and love each other.

419
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,599
Be attentive towards each other.

420
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,079
Live your life to the fullest.

421
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,839
I love you the most

422
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,719
my dearest granddaughter.

423
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,599
When did I sign the marriage certificate?

424
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,679
Why can't I remember anything?

425
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,719
Pim.

426
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,959
Congratulations.

427
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,639
Thank you.

428
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,559
Who's your wife?

429
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,319
You.

430
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,599
I can't remember anything.

431
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,479
The truth is...

432
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,479
you're the one that asked me to marry you.

433
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,239
Huh?

434
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,399
You told me

435
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,639
you want to cuddle me every night

436
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,399
No.

437
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,679
I definitely didn't say that.

438
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,839
Only you would think something dirty like that

439
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,879
When it comes to dirty,

440
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,399
save it for your brother and Tinnamai.

441
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,959
Take the land then.

442
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,599
Can you just divorce me?

443
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,479
I can't.

444
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,439
Why not?

445
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,359
<i>Mommy,you didn't give Daddy a good morning kiss yet.</i>

446
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,199
<i>If l had a wife, I would not let her struggle</i>

447
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,439
<i>Yesterday was your doing wasn't it?</i>

448
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,879
<i>What did l do yesterday?</i>

449
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,519
<i>Hey!</i>

450
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,239
<i>I have proof that a murder happened last night.</i>

451
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,480
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

452
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:37,940
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

453
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:43,340
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

454
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,880
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

455
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:55,320
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
