00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,320
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,360
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,760
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,360
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,600
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,199
But if you're lonely

13
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,879
you just have to come down and give me lotto numbers.

14
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,599
Two to three digits are enough.

15
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,599
So I'll have money to buy food to eat.

16
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,799
Oh god!

17
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,399
Hey!

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,879
Are you crazy?!

19
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,679
How can you throw a baby sheep like this?

20
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,399
What will you do if my baby sheep has a broken hand or foot?

21
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,479
I'll just grill it.

22
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,319
How many times have I told you

23
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,679
not to let your sheep come eat my side of the grass?

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,439
You just won't listen.

25
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,079
You knocked down the fence so they can crossover.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,719
I gave you grass to plant but you didn't plant them.

27
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,599
Do you not listen or you just don't understand?

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,639
Is this because P'Vee won't sell the farm to you?

29
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,839
That's why you're doing this.

30
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,119
Wait.

31
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,319
Am I wrong in this?

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,359
Gosh! You just don't get it!

33
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,359
Whether you sell the farm or not, it's not my problem.

34
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,359
Because I'm not troubled by it.

35
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,479
The one that is is you.

36
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,479
Why am I troubled by it?

37
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,279
You have a farm so you must look after it.

38
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,959
You don't have workers.

39
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,600
You don't have money.

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,959
How can you look after the farm by yourself?

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,759
Whatever I do

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,639
is my business.

43
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,079
Let's go kids!

44
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,319
Let's go home. Don't stay here long

45
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,679
You might get grilled.

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,999
Let's go!

47
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,319
What kind of person are you?

48
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,519
So stubborn.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,199
It's just you here.

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,959
You want to look after the farm by yourself?

51
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,439
How can you?

52
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,679
Trouble awaits Uncle

53
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,479
Hey.

54
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,799
Yes?

55
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,799
Where's P'Ran?

56
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,479
He left with Mok.

57
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,879
Where did he go?

58
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,879
I think to check on the farm.

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,799
Go bring me a horse.

60
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,799
You shouldn't take one.

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,999
-If you fall, it'll hurt.
-Yes.

62
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,799
Move!

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,279
You don't usually ride one.

64
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,279
I think you should wait for Khun Ran here instead.

65
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,439
He'll be back soon.

66
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,399
You're an employee so listen to my orders!

67
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
They didn't hire you to order your boss again.

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,599
Why didn't you stop her?

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,599
Did you not see or pretended not to see?

70
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,199
I saw but we couldn't stop her.

71
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,079
I can do it myself.

72
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,639
Okay.

73
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,199
Help me hold the horse.

74
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,199
What's going on here?

75
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,159
These two didn't put the saddle on right so I fell off.

76
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,039
Where are you taking the horse?

77
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,599
I wanted to go pick some wildflowers for Nus's birthday party.

78
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,959
Uncle Rong wanted to go pick it for me

79
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,679
but I wanted to do it myself sol can actually choose them.

80
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,639
When did I say that?

81
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,279
Right?

82
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,679
Can you take me?

83
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,919
Uncle.

84
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,679
Go pick it for Orn.

85
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,519
Toei, watch Mok.

86
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,639
Yes.

87
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,799
You should go wash up.

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,959
The party is about to begin.

89
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,039
Let's go.

90
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,720
Pick nice ones.

91
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,919
"Pick nice ones."

92
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,479
So clear!

93
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,519
What's clear?

94
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,719
That she's a liar!

95
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,519
For sure.

96
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,199
Sales are great huh?

97
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,159
This month's sales has been great that it got me confused.

98
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,479
I'm not confused anymore

99
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,759
I'm just good.

100
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,439
300 Kin profit. Divide that in half so we each get 150K

101
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,479
I'll wire it to you.

102
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,399
Thank you friend.

103
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,839
While l do that, look at this

104
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,799
Let me see.

105
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
-Oh nice!
-Right?!

106
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,719
I want every piece in this collection.

107
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,799
Is my dress that I will wear tonight done?

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,319
You didn't see it.

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,079
It's right here.

110
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,799
Tada! Is it pretty?

111
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,279
Yes!

112
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,399
It's filled with lace and bird feathers too.

113
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,798
Good job!

114
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,279
Will you be debuting someone tonight?

115
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,199
Debut who?

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,559
In case you have a boyfriend.

117
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,279
Your friends might want to meet him

118
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,479
Secretly sleeping with each other...

119
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,679
isn't good.

120
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,199
Well, you never know.

121
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,039
I might show him off tonight.

122
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,679
Wow!

123
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,319
Where are you going?

124
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,799
You look pretty handsome.

125
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,280
A friend's birthday party.

126
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,799
A friend's birthday party?

127
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,999
P'Vee.

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,559
If they have some delicious food,
can you bag some for me?

129
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,319
Pim.

130
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,159
Yes?

131
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,639
How can I do that at a rich people's party?

132
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,239
They're rich too?!

133
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,599
Two bags then because there's gonna be a lot of food.

134
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,159
I'll get going.

135
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,479
Oh.

136
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,999
Pim.

137
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,879
Hello Khun Nus.

138
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,679
Hello.

139
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,999
Let's go.

140
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,559
There's a party at my house today.

141
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,999
A birthday party?

142
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,199
It's my birthday. Join us

143
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,359
I don't have a dress.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,759
It's a laid back party. You can wear whatever.

145
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,599
Go change, I'll wait.

146
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,239
I can wear anything?

147
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,759
Yes.

148
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,399
I'll go change real quick

149
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,079
Okay.

150
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,759
Why did you invite Pim?

151
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,159
We're a couple. I need to get close to my partner's family

152
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,799
But Pim doesn't have any attire for a party you are hosting.

153
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,719
But when you love someone,
you don't judge them from their status.

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,239
It's tomorrow morning.

155
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,199
I've prepared everything already

156
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,399
I'm always ready.

157
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,319
Any time.

158
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,719
Wait one sec.

159
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,799
I'm ready.

160
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,439
This isn't an inappropriate attire right?

161
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,879
No.

162
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,079
Let's get in the car.

163
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,239
All done.

164
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,079
Nus hasn't come yet.

165
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,599
Did she call you to tell where she was going?

166
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,319
She didn't call at all!

167
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,879
But I heard she went to pick up her dress from Da's shop already.

168
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,279
It's her own party

169
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,079
She isn't here to welcome guests.

170
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,039
I'll go put my clothes in the car.

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,679
With a mouth like his

172
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,519
he shouldn't be with a beautiful girlfriend

173
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,079
You invited people from the other farm too?

174
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,720
Yes, I'm gonna go change now.

175
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,759
That girl is going to dress like that to the party?

176
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,879
I don't know.

177
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,279
Let's go.

178
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,199
Aunt Chu! Let's go say hi to her.

179
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,199
Oh!

180
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,999
-Lada,Danai. Hello
-Hello.

181
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,239
-You look beautiful today.
-Thank you.

182
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,079
How's it going Danai? Business going well?

183
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,679
The gas station is doing well.

184
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,039
As for the restaurant and food in the gas station,

185
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,679
it has attracted many customers.

186
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,879
Great.

187
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,679
Gas these days are very expensive.

188
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,399
I don't want to even drive anywhere

189
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,199
- That's true.
-Right?

190
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,159
Oh here comes Ran.

191
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,359
Orn is also here.

192
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,599
They came together too.

193
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,839
Look at her smiling.

194
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,799
Hello.

195
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,479
Ran.

196
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,399
Have you seen your sister? The guests have arrived.

197
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,519
She just went to go change earlier.

198
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,439
Oh yeah?

199
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,479
How did you two end up coming here together?

200
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,359
Well?

201
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,879
You were holding onto him so tight!

202
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,679
It's nothing.

203
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,559
Geez!

204
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,719
When you walked in here with him

205
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,879
everyone was staring.

206
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,599
Well, doesn't everyone want a piece of P'Ran?

207
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,439
-Happy birthday!
- Thank you! Thank you so much!

208
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,719
Thank you so much!

209
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,639
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you!

210
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,679
Why look so delicious?

211
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,679
What can l take home?

212
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,879
P'Ran.

213
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,719
Who's that?

214
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,319
A neighbor.

215
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,879
She's cute.

216
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,639
Who's cute?

217
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,679
Nosy!

218
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,079
She's wearing the wrong attire, Who is she?

219
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,799
I don't know. She came with Nus.

220
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,599
Excuse me for one sec.

221
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,399
Sure.

222
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,679
Hey.

223
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,639
Let's go say hi to Aunt Chu.

224
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,919
My goodness!

225
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,599
- Wow!
-Aunt Chu, this is Ravee.

226
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,919
Hello.

227
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,318
She is debuting her boyfriend here

228
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:15,399
Yeah. When did they started dating?
How come I've never seen him before?

229
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,078
But the girl that came with them.

230
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,199
is she at the wrong place?

231
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,279
I thought she was the gardener.

232
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,479
Right?

233
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,799
Hey.

234
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,719
The food

235
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,559
is for you to eat here.

236
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,119
Not take home to eat.

237
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,279
I'll put it back then.

238
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,999
What are you doing?

239
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,279
Well,

240
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,679
aren't you being possessive of it? I'm giving it back

241
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,279
You don't want it back?

242
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,879
Come here

243
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,279
What?!

244
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,679
What's your problem?!

245
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,479
Come here.

246
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,519
Let go!

247
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,159
Hey.

248
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,759
-What?!
-P'Ran left!

249
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,479
Left where?!

250
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,559
- The dog just took him.
-Where?!

251
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,039
Over there!

252
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,759
Let's just follow them.

253
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,159
Thank you everyone so much.

254
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,559
Thank you Orn for helping me set up
this party since morning.

255
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,879
Where's Orn?

256
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,719
-Right here!
-Thank you!

257
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,639
Thank you Da for this beautiful dress.

258
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,599
If you like it,you can check out her shop on her page.

259
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,279
Thank you everyone!

260
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,919
Please check it out!

261
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,399
Hey!

262
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,799
Let go!

263
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,039
Why are you and your brother here?

264
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,599
Your sister invited us.

265
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,399
Are you close?

266
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,919
Why don't you go ask your sister?

267
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,759
But the first thing you must know

268
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,399
is how to dress properly when you're attending this kind of party

269
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,399
Show some respect to the host.

270
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,120
This is my best.

271
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,799
This is your best?

272
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,559
Come here.

273
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,679
I'll dress you myself.

274
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,039
Dress for me?

275
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,479
You're going to undress me?!

276
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,159
Let go!

277
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,239
You jerk!

278
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,719
Let go! I won't go!

279
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,159
Let go!

280
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,159
If you rape me, I will file a report!

281
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,479
Wait here.

282
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,399
I won't wait for you to rape me.

283
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,799
Let go!

284
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,079
Let go you jerk!

285
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,279
Let go!

286
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,280
If you run again,

287
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,839
I will undress you ha?

288
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,119
I won't do anything to you.

289
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,799
Smelling like a sheep like this

290
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,399
I can't bring myself to do it.

291
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,679
Where do I smell like a sheep?

292
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,239
I use soap and washed myself very thoroughly

293
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,199
<i>The guy dresses nice.</i>

294
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,999
<i>But the girl that came with them,
is she at the wrong place?</i>

295
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,799
<i>I thought she was a gardener.</i>

296
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,039
<i>Right?</i>

297
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,999
Here, Go change.

298
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,599
Why?

299
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,919
Can you stop asking?!

300
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,679
You need to give me a reason then I'll stop asking

301
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,399
I didn't say dressing like this is wrong.

302
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,079
But you need to dress properly for the occasion!

303
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,879
Here.

304
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,119
No more questions?

305
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,199
No.

306
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,039
Why?

307
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,360
I ask, you complain.

308
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,599
I don't ask, you complain.

309
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,599
May be you're the one with issues here.

310
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,519
Gosh!

311
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,879
Do I really stink?

312
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,519
What are you doing?

313
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,999
Showering!

314
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,279
I told you to change.

315
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,480
-Why are you showering?
-Well...

316
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,479
you said l stink!

317
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,679
You can't just shower at someone's house.

318
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,799
You said I can use the bathroom.

319
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,639
To change!

320
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,999
Not shower!

321
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,879
Be careful when you open the door.

322
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,599
Tell me next time.

323
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,279
You...

324
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,799
complain like an old man.

325
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,479
But you are old though.

326
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,079
Because you

327
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,879
are older than me by years

328
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,479
What are you doing?!

329
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,679
Let go!

330
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,759
A gluttonous kid like you

331
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,679
aren't being careful when you eat.

332
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,599
Tie your hair.

333
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,839
So when you eat

334
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,559
your hair doesn't go in your mouth.

335
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,639
Feel free to get all the food you want

336
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,239
Don't take it home.

337
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,839
If you like anything specifically, tell Taew.

338
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,039
Taew will bag it for you.

339
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,679
Thank you.

340
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,319
Better than throwing it away.

341
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,799
Are you bipolar?

342
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,919
Let's get some food.

343
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,319
The dress is too fit.

344
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,079
My stomach will show if I eat.

345
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,959
If you like a certain menu,

346
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,679
You must bag it.

347
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,479
But if you like a chubby girl friend then you must choose me.

348
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,799
I like chubby people.

349
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,599
Do you want me to hold the plate?

350
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,279
So you can get the food more easily

351
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,399
That's okay.

352
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,679
Do you want to go sit over there?

353
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,999
Sit close by

354
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,599
so you can easily come back for some more.

355
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,999
In that case,

356
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,119
can you hold the plate?

357
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,399
-Sure.
-Thank you.

358
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,679
Too much?

359
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,519
No.

360
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,839
Also, no one will pay attention.

361
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,199
Yes.

362
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,719
Thank you.

363
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,199
What?

364
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,599
Look at him!

365
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,519
You're Nus's boyfriend's sister?

366
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,079
I don't know if he's her boyfriend.

367
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,079
Then...

368
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,239
the man over there standing with Nus,

369
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,599
is he your brother?

370
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,199
When did she get changed?

371
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,399
Probably when she left with P'Ran.

372
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,799
Because that's Nus's dress.

373
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,879
If you want to know whether they're a couple or not

374
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,679
you should go ask them

375
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,839
Why ask me?

376
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,759
Actually l don't want to know about them.

377
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,599
I just want to make conversations with you.

378
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,039
Because...

379
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,479
I want to get to know you

380
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,879
What's the deal?

381
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,879
Orn! Orn!

382
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,959
Your family has nothing but debt.

383
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,159
Are you here to catch a man around here or what?

384
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,839
No.

385
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,319
I came here for the food

386
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,679
I need to get water.

387
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,839
Okay

388
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,799
Boobs revealed!

389
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,199
Oops.

390
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,999
Sorry.

391
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,679
I was on my way back to my table then I tripped.

392
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,679
You don't like me, do you?

393
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,079
You're just assuming things.

394
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,039
It was an accident.

395
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,039
Don't get involved.

396
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,239
Come here!

397
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,199
Thank you.

398
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,119
That was a prank

399
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,879
Does being poor means l have to only catch rich men by using my boobs?!

400
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,199
Are you waiting for Nai to pick you up?

401
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,279
Do you regret

402
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,599
that it was me and not him?

403
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,279
I might be poor

404
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,399
but l don't need help from a rich man like you.

405
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,199
I can manage!

406
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,679
I'm not begging food from anyone!

407
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,039
And I don't plan to catch a rich man to level up my life

408
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,479
And even if I was, it's none of any one's business.

409
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,279
Go back to your rich party

410
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,439
Don't mess with someone who smells like sheep like me!

411
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,999
P'Vee is drunk again?

412
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,359
Open the door right now!

413
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,719
That's not P'Vee.

414
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,079
I said open the door!

415
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,239
Where is your brother?!

416
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,839
Are you crazy?!

417
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,839
Where is Vee?!

418
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,079
I don't know!

419
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,999
You and your brother were in on this weren't you?

420
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,879
In on what?!

421
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,399
Vee ran away with Nus!

422
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,999
Gosh!

423
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,359
You said my brother ran away with your sister

424
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,599
How is that possible?

425
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,599
It's possible.

426
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,599
The reason your sister ran away

427
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,919
perhaps she couldn't stand a brother like you

428
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,919
Who can tolerate with your personality?

429
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,919
Read this so you can stop arguing.

430
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,439
<i>P'Ran,</i>

431
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,479
<i>I love Vee and u know you won't let us date.</i>

432
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,759
<i>I've made my decision to spend the rest of my life with him</i>

433
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,599
<i>If there's an opportunity I will
 go back and apologize to you.</i>

434
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,279
<i>Love and respect you always.</i>

435
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,999
Shit!

436
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,879
Are you still going to say they didn't?

437
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,719
You're siblings

438
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,479
To say you didn't see or didn't know,

439
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,839
it's impossible.

440
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,399
But I really didn't know!

441
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,399
Get in the car.

442
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,879
You get in.

443
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,079
Why are you telling me?

444
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,199
Come with me!

445
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,239
No!

446
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,199
Let go you jerk!

447
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,119
Let me go!

448
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,999
Jerk!

449
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,239
Let go!

450
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,759
Let me go!

451
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,079
Gosh! You jerk!

452
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,199
Where are we going?

453
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,879
To drag your brother back.

454
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,759
How can no one see when Nus left?

455
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,439
After the party was over last night.

456
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,479
we saw Khun Nus and Khun Ravee walked
with Khun Lada.

457
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,479
After that we were busy cleaning up.

458
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,999
So we didn't notice.

459
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,439
When we were putting things away in the house,

460
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,479
I saw Khun Nus's car still parked.

461
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,399
In that case,

462
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,399
she probably didn't leave right after the party

463
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,279
When did she leave?

464
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,279
This morning around 4am

465
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,279
I came out and didn't see the car anymore.

466
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,399
Then she left after midnight but before 4am.

467
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,399
Four hours.

468
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,279
Will Ran catch up to her?

469
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,719
How do you know they're heading to Bangkok?

470
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,879
Why don't you think they might be going to Surat.

471
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,599
Yala, Amphawa, Pattani

472
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,479
-Udonthani--
-Stop!

473
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,759
The reason I came with you is because l want you to know

474
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,719
am not in on this with them!

475
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,479
You didn't willingly come

476
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,479
I dragged you here with me.

477
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,199
For this collection, they ordered 20 pieces.
Go check the stock

478
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,199
If we have in stock then deliver them right away.

479
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,519
Okay.

480
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,839
Hello Auntie.

481
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,799
Hello.

482
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,199
Hey

483
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,759
Did you get the chance to talk to Nus yesterday?

484
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,039
Not really.

485
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,599
We only talked about work and that was it.

486
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,799
Is something wrong?

487
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,999
Nus is missing.

488
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,479
Missing?!

489
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,839
She's missing?

490
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,879
Yes.

491
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,239
She said she left with Vee.

492
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,079
I saw them having lunch together before.

493
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,479
At her birthday party, they announced to everyone they were dating.

494
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,559
Yeah. After that party, they ran away with each other.

495
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,839
What?! They ran away with each other?!

496
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,279
Hey.

497
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,359
If Nus calls you, can you ask her where she's at?

498
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,799
Then tell me.

499
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,639
Sure.

500
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,999
I'll let you know.

501
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,919
Where will you look for them in Bangkok?

502
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,159
Bangkok isn't small.

503
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,159
Nus might have friends there.

504
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,279
Does your brother have any friends in Bangkok?

505
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,799
No.

506
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,799
What? Why are you staring?

507
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,279
I don't know if you're lying

508
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,479
Hey!

509
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,279
My brother and I are from Khon Kaen.

510
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,079
Why would we have friends from Bangkok?

511
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,559
It's your sister that should have friends from Bangkok!

512
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,239
Nong Pim.

513
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,039
I haven't seen him since your parents' funeral

514
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,799
Don't lie.

515
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,959
Who would lie to you?

516
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,999
It's wrong, I'll go to hell.

517
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,239
I better not find out you're lying.

518
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,479
Bye P'Tai!

519
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,279
Handsome.

520
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,599
But mean like a dog!

521
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,639
I thought you said your brother
 doesn't have friends in Bangkok?

522
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,319
I didn't know P'Utai moved to Bangkok.

523
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,319
How do you know

524
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,919
that P'Utai lives here?

525
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,919
I told you not to lie.

526
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,919
Get in the car!

527
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,679
I swear I haven't been in contact with Rave e for over two years now.

528
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,159
Give me the address and phone numbers to his other friends.

529
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,319
You heard him P'Moo.

530
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,279
How do you know this kind of person?

531
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,839
Ask me

532
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,479
what your friend did!

533
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,599
Number!

534
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,039
Is something wrong?

535
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,239
Hey!

536
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,079
Do you know more than what you're telling me?

537
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,799
I better not find out you're helping Vee.

538
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,799
Otherwise you're gonna struggle!

539
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,319
I won't go see anyone else.

540
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,319
Then why aren't you taking me home?

541
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,519
Why did you park?

542
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,839
Not yet.

543
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,999
Hey!

544
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,239
Don't. Are you trying to rape me?!

545
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,399
Oh! Are you trying to get revenge on P'Vee by doing this?!

546
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,199
Be quiet!

547
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,319
Let go!

548
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,959
- Let me go!
- Then you're gonna run away!

549
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,679
Why should I wait for you to rape me?!

550
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,919
-Let go!
-Are you crazy?!

551
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,359
Help!

552
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,759
Hey!

553
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,279
What are you doing to her?!

554
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:08,999
Hey!

555
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,799
Husband and wife quarrel.

556
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,599
They'll make up.

557
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,279
They're about to have a "featuring."

558
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,599
You know what that means?

559
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,599
Husband and wife?

560
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,479
Yeah!

561
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,599
Please don't do anything to me.

562
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,479
Are you crazy?

563
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,079
But earlier...

564
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,599
Gosh!

565
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,279
Four people were walking this way

566
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,879
If they think I'm really going to rape you,

567
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,079
they have four people and shovels.

568
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,839
I can't handle them.

569
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,359
So you...

570
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,199
Kissed me?

571
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,279
Are you crazy?!

572
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,679
-Thinking of raping me again?!
-Not thinking!

573
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,159
I'm not trying to rape you either!

574
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,599
Then why did you park the car?!

575
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,799
Evil.

576
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,479
Hey

577
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,839
Shouldn't I be the one to call you evil when suddenly you--

578
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,879
Kissed me!

579
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,159
I'm not talking about you.

580
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,999
I'm talking about your brother's
 friend who just drove passed us!n

581
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,159
Hurry! Get in the car!

582
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,039
We're gonna follow him!

583
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:22,919
Go!

584
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,279
What do you suspect?

585
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,359
Didn't you see?

586
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,399
Your brother's friends...

587
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,280
none of the mi were surprised to hear what happened

588
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,719
<i>Vee ran away with my sister.</i>

589
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,399
<i>What does that have to do with me?</i>

590
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,879
<i>Why are you asking me about it?</i>

591
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,399
<i>You're her brother, You need to look for her.</i>

592
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,599
<i>I'm the friend. What do l know?</i>

00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,159
True.

595
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,159
But are just covering for him

596
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,799
What are you doing?

597
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,279
Climbing over their gate?

598
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,519
We'll find out.

599
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,519

00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,399
<i>If you won't tell me,</i>
