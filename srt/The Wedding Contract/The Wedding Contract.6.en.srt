00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,320
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,360
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,760
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,360
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,600
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,159
P'Vee.

13
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,759
Why didn't you consider me?!

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,839
What money do l use now?!

15
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,959
And what money do I use to redeem Grandpa's farm?!

16
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,519
Thank you.

17
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,239
-Hello Khun Ran
-Hello.

18
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,759
Are you here to open your safe?

19
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,519
Oh...

20
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,679
I am.

21
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,319
And something else.

22
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,479
Okay.

23
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,479
Well...

24
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,839
Grandpa Ruj and I were very close.

25
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,279
He asked me to look after his grandchildren too.

26
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,959
That I know.

27
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,799
He told me that he depended on you when he didn't have money to pay the interest.

28
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,839
Yes.

29
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,519
So earlier, was Pim here to pay the interest?

30
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,919
No.

31
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,679
She wanted to withdraw money.

32
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,759
-Was she able to?
-No.

33
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,359
Her brother took out all the money from the account.

34
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,799
But he did say they will come redeem the land before the end of the month.

35
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,639
They're probably putting the money together right now.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,319
Do you want to go open the safe now?

37
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,319
Gosh!

38
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,759
I forgot to bring my key

39
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,599
-I'll come back some other day
-Sure.

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,759
Bye.

41
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,079
How far did she go now?

42
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,999
Which way did she go?

43
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,999
Pim.

44
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,119
Khun Ran.

45
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,359
What's wrong?

46
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,519
Why are you sitting here?

47
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,679
Why do you look pale?

48
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,599
Are you going to faint?

49
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,239
Did you eat yet?

50
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,119
I thought you were going to the market?

51
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,519
Where are the things you bought?

52
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,919
I went to withdraw money at the bank.

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,679
Then was going to go to the market.

54
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,479
Are you okay?

55
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,159
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,519
Come. My car is parked nearby.

57
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,159
What merits did these siblings get?

58
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,679
Both of them got the good stuff.

59
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,119
Wait for me in the car.

60
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,999
Don't walk around or else you're going to faint

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,159
I'll drop you off but let me go buy something first.

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,279
If you go down,

63
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,759
you'll faint in the market and will be a burden to the vendors?

64
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,999
Even if I go down, I won't have money to buy anything.

65
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,599
What was that?

66
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,999
Nothing.

67
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,959
Don't complain

68
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,959
Go wait in the car.

69
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,439
Save your energy to breathe instead.

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,479
Oh Orn.

71
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,799
The man has dumped you.

72
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,999
The products this year is excellent.

73
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,159
We used the fertilizer like you told us to.

74
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,759
Boss.

75
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,279
What is it?

76
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,119
What did the police say?

77
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,119
It seems like Ran took Vee's sister to the crime scene.

78
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,239
Ran again?

79
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,759
Sticking his nose where it shouldn't be.

80
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,479
What did Vee's sister say?

81
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,759
She told the police that someone tried to burn down the sheep pen

82
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,239
So Ran had someone go collect evidence at Vee's farm.

83
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,919
It's gonna be a problem for me.

84
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,159
But it looks like the police don't suspect us yet.

85
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,439
Do not forget to remind all our people

86
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,319
to keep their mouths shut regarding Song.

87
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,519
I had the guys go take care of his body already

88
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,519
Good.

89
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,359
Do not leave any evidence that he was our people.

90
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,479
So it doesn't trace back to us.

91
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,159
Yes Boss.

92
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,798
What is it?

93
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,119
Boss.

94
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,599
The police are here to see you.

95
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,239
Hello.

96
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,319
What's going on?

97
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,919
How can I help you?

98
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,119
It's about the deceased this morning Khun Tin.

99
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,799
What does it have to do with me?

100
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,159
I already told you

101
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,479
all my workers are present.

102
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,439
No one is missing

103
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,799
In case you have any other clues because a nearby farm was trespassed.

104
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,639
How do you know that the trespasser was the deceased?

105
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,839
Khun Pim said someone tried to burn her farm.

106
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,639
I went there to check and the sheep's pen was burnt quite a bit.

107
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,439
The culprit probably shot the gun as a threat.

108
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,359
A bullet casing was found that was the same type as the bullet found near the body

109
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,319
So?

110
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,599
It's not related to me.

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,479
I don't know the deceased and l didn't go to that farm.

112
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,839
I was at the pub.

113
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,679
You can go and ask for my alibi.

114
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,919
I haven't accused you of anything yet.

115
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,959
I'm just here to ask questions in case there's a new lead.

116
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,119
May I question your workers as well?

117
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,999
Go ahead.

118
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,439
I'll have my subordinate take you.

119
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,839
With permission.

120
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,359
Please.

121
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,279
What happened?

122
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,799
Why are there is o many police officers out there?

123
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,439
Pim's farm was on fire last night

124
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,319
Huh?!

125
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,439
Hey!

126
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,959
Why did you say "huh "so loud?!

127
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,279
Did someone die?

128
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,679
Huh?!

129
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,759
Why are you talking so low now?!

130
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,359
Why don't you talk louder so I can hear too?!

131
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,799
Did someone die Dad?

132
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,119
With that much cops,i somebody probably did die

133
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,599
-Well -
Was it Pim?!

134
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,679
I'm not i sure either.

135
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,119
If you're not sure then don't talk!

136
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,839
I'm going to tell you!

137
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,959
We don't know who died since they burned to death

138
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,759
The police took the body for an autopsy.

139
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,759
But I do think it's the perpetrator that burned Pim's farm.

140
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,439
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

141
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,760
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

142
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,959
Is it...

143
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,759
Is it what?

144
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,479
Gosh! l thought you said you were thinking the same as me?!

145
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,759
Take that!

146
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,439
When you speak, let the others know too!

147
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,999
Not just the two of you.

148
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,239
I don't know what you're thinking though.

149
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,039
Oh.

150
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,759
Go sh! It's the guy we saw at Pim's house yesterday

151
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,719
Was it him? 

152
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,359
The guy we thought he was Tinnamai's guy?

153
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,239
Oh!

154
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,959
Wait. Wait.

155
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,279
You guys better not talk nonsense.

156
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,999
Hia Tin isn't your ordinary person.

157
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,839
If we're wrong and we accused him,

158
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,159
we will all be doomed!

159
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,479
Orn!

160
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,439
What's going on? Why did you call me here?

161
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,639
Fried fish, The fish is very fresh.

162
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,319
What do you mean by fish?

163
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,519
Gossip, I just saw it with my own fresh eyes.

164
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,119
What's it about?

165
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,639
It's something that you and Nai would want to listen to!

166
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,079
Nai!

167
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,679
- Nai hurry and come here!
- What's up?

168
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,359
You called Nai here too?

169
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:53,280
I...

170
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,079
saw P'Ran

171
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,639
had his arm around that girl in town this morning!

172
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,359
What girl?

173
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,599
-That girl!
- The girl you like!

174
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,959
Pim?

175
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,759
Yes. If you saw, you would have flipped.

176
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,319
He didn't just support her to his car.

177
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,599
What else did they do?!

178
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,759
They...

179
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,479
Put it in the trunk

180
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,239
Dude there was everything.

181
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,919
Rice, vegetables,

182
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,359
fish, fruits.

183
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,839
It's like he bought everything from the market.

184
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,359
Maybe she begged P'Ran to buy it for her.

185
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,799
Pim wouldn't be the type to beg people for something.

186
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,959
Geez! Defending her like this, why don't you just say the girl paid for the stuff herself?

187
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,079
She's so poor.

188
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,439
If P'Ran didn't buy it for her then sure she bought it herself.

189
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,799
There's no way.

190
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,119
What Orn said is true.

191
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,119
What else did you see?

192
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,919
That's all.

193
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,119
You wanted me to follow them home or what?

194
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,479
Did you wanted to know how they carried the stuff down?

195
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,359
Once they're done with that,

196
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,279
what position did they do it in?

197
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,919
But with me, I went over to have a meal but he went to check on the farm

198
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,479
Hey Nai.

199
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,639
If you like her, can you officially start courting her?

200
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,639
Sol won't have to deal with her

201
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,639
She probably likes rich men. She will get with anyone that courts her.

202
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,840
But if P'Ran is courting her and I get involved

203
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,839
wouldn't there be a problem?

204
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,639
Up to you.

205
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,280
How did it go?

206
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,599
Everyone said what you told them to say.

207
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,999
-Nothing suspicious right?
-Yes.

208
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,999
Seems like they don't suspect anything.

209
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Boss.

210
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,279
-Khun Or n--
-I need to talk to you.

211
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,839
Are you here to ask me out?

212
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,079
Stop talking about this.

213
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,959
Well we used to date.

214
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,639
In case you miss me.

215
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,479
We were kids then.

216
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,839
I'm old enough now to know what is good

217
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,479
and what is bad.

218
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,519
Am I good?

219
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,999
I came to ask you about Vee's sister.

220
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,119
You're not interested in her?

221
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,799
I am.

222
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,959
But less than you.

223
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,959
Stop talking about me!

224
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,959
I won't go back to you again!

225
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,639
I keep talking about it in case you change your mind.

226
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,759
If you're interested in that girl,

227
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,159
why don't you do something?

228
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,159
If you keep on waiting,

229
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,119
someone will take her away from you.

230
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,919
Someone else?

231
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,759
Who?

232
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,839
What do you know?

233
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,519
It doesn't matter.

234
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,078
But patient like this,

235
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,359
it's not you.

236
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,679
Her farm is just across the road from yours.

237
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,679
But you're slow.

238
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,838
Fine by me if you want someone else to cut in front of you first.

239
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,078
I came to warn you as a former friend.

240
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,119
Done.

241
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,319
Good thing not a lot caught on fire.

242
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,239
Khun Ran is nice huh?

243
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,639
- He fixed it for her
- Probably pities her.

244
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,999
She has nobody.

245
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,439
Ever since her grandfather died

246
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,639
Vee left with Khun Nus.

247
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,479
Perhaps he feels guilty regarding Khun Nus?

248
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,159
Gosh! Regarding Khun Nus, Khun Ran is rather upset with Khun Vee!

249
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,280
Really?

250
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,079
It's Khun Ran!

251
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,239
Khun Ran is here!

252
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,679
Why is he here?

253
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,599
Khun Ran told us not to let Pim know that he told us to fix this.

254
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,359
Really? We should go hide lover there then.

255
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,279
Hide here

256
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,679
Thank you.

257
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,279
Are you okay?

258
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,159
I'm fine.

259
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,959
Eat something too.

260
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,839
So you can stay alive to see when I drag your brother back here.

261
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,639
Go put the stuff in the trunk in the kitchen.

262
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,479
Don't let Pim know that I gave it to her.

263
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,759
-Put it where?
-On the table?

264
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,439
What's that smell?

265
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,919
With a fridge broken like this,

266
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,999
all the fresh food will get spoiled

267
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,959
You two go get the small fridge from our house.

268
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,639
I'll buy a new one.

269
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,119
Have her use it first.

270
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,599
Okay, Come on Dad, come help me.

271
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,679
When it comes to the heavy stuff, you use me right away?

272
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,279
Take the car.

273
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,359
-Come Dad.
-Sure.

274
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,519
So stressful.

275
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,959
Stop pretending.

276
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,279
Finally you left.

277
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,839
You have money, you have power.

278
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,599
What do l use to fight against those people?

279
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,679
How can P'vee leave me here with debt and other problems like this?!

280
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,999
I don't even have money to buy food

281
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,239
Why did P'Vee do this?

282
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,079
It's Ran that Orn was trying to tell me.

283
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,759
Why did they come back so fast?

284
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,119
What do you want now?!

285
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,959
Hia Tin.

286
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,799
We need to talk.

287
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,999
About?

288
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,759
Your brother.

289
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,239
P'Vee isn't here right now

290
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,599
I know.

291
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,959
I also know he ran away.

292
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,439
I think before you did.

293
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,799
He borrowed money from you?

294
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,999
More like made a sale.

295
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,239
Sale?

296
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,639
What did he sell?

297
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,079
Your land that is mortgaged by the bank,

298
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,999
all it needs is your signature.

299
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,799
This here...

300
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,839
is the loan contract of 500K

301
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,959
that your brother loaned from me.

302
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,959
500K baht?!

303
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,839
It's not exactly a loan either.

304
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,479
At the end of the contract it stated

305
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,639
he will sell you to me

306
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,319
in exchange for the 500K.

307
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,239
Why haven't they come down yet?

308
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,839
Is it heavy?

309
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,119
Tinnamai's car.

310
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,679
Let go of me!

311
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,079
Let go! I will pay you back! I know nothing of this!

312
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,079
Come here!

313
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,239
Let go!

314
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,319
-Let go!
-Why are you screaming so much?!

315
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,159
Do not mess with Pim!

316
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,159
Don't meddle!

317
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,159
I want to meddle!

318
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,319
Her brothers old her to me

319
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,519
I paid sol must get the product!

320
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,999
Pim knew nothing about your agreement with Vee!

321
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,799
She doesn't know but she must pay back the money for her brother.

322
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,079
Khun Saran!

323
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,119
That's enough!

324
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,239
Pim!

325
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,479
She had a brain concussion

326
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,839
but nothing worrisome.

327
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,519
We shouldn't let her stress.

328
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,359
I've given her some sedative.

329
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,799
She should be sleeping more and getting some rest

330
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,759
Okay.

331
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,119
When she wakes up and there's some confusion,

332
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,599
it's the medication.

333
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,279
For how many days?

334
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,279
Two to three days.

335
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,279
If she gets better by then, I will lessen the dosage.

336
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,639
-Okay, Thank you so much.
-Sure.

337
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,999
P'Vee.

338
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,999
How could you sell me?

339
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,319
It's just us now.

340
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,839
What do I do?

341
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,839
-Where's your boss at?
-No there.

342
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,959
-Where did she go?
-I really don't know.

343
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,479
What kind of housekeeper are you?!

344
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,479
You don't know where your boss is at?!

345
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,839
What's all the noise?!

346
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,119
Why do you look like this?

347
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,759
Saran was at Pim's house

348
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,919
P'Ran saved Pim?

349
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,679
I want to kill Saran!

350
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,319
Calm down.

351
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,919
How about this?

352
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,639
I will help you with Pim.

353
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,999
But you must n't mess with P'Ran.

354
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,279
You love him so much huh?

355
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,359
Is it a deal?

356
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,839
Fine.

357
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,759
Hello Auntie.

358
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,119
Hi there.

359
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,359
Where's P'Ran?

360
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,440
Ran didn't come home last night.

361
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,599
So that means he was with Pim?

362
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,439
Pim?

363
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,839
Ruj's granddaughter next door?

364
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,919
Yes.

365
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,839
Her brother ran away and left her with his debt.

366
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,079
She's probably trying to trap P'Ran.

367
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,079
Trying to get money the short cut way.

368
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,799
Her brother did the same thing to Nus.

369
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,599
His sister is just the same perhaps.

370
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,599
Who is she?

371
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,599
She looks like a witch.

372
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,599
Oh my god!

373
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,639
They just like reading fairy tales.

374
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,319
Yes. They're cute.

375
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,239
The sea witch like in The Little Mermaid.

376
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,239
Yes! Like Ursula. So ugly!

377
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,959
My goodness kids! Why are you talking like this?

378
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,119
Porn is a lovely person

379
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:57,079
Witch! Witch! Witch!

380
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,679
Witch!

381
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,239
The Other Life

382
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,319
Jam.

383
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,919
Take the kids out.

384
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,279
Sure.

385
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,359
Come on kids, Let's go play outside.

386
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,759
She's probably going to be at the hospital for awhile.

387
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,639
Her condition is that critical?

388
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,999
Yes.

389
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,639
So?

390
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,639
Are you always going to help her like this?

391
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,119
You're not her family plus her brother has caused us problems.

392
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,319
I figured out what I'm going to do next.

393
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,479
He's at the hospital with Pim.

394
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,679
Trust me Auntie.

395
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,159
Pim is definitely trying to trap P'Ran.

396
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,319
Hello.

397
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,759
I'd like to make an appointment to sign a marriage certificate off site.

398
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,519
Yes Boss?

399
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,359
Have Toei go check on Pim's farm tonight.

400
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,519
Bring Pim's I.D. and house registration too.

401
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,639
You want me to go in her house and get it?

402
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,359
Yes.

403
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,359
Go make a photocopy of it too.

404
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,638
Right here.

405
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,638
Copy of house registration.

406
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,279
I.D. card.

407
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,799
Jay!

408
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,479
Get some people to go burn Pim's house completely

409
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,799
Don't leave any debris.

410
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,479
Yes Boss.

411
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,519
- Boss only said to burn it 
- Burn it?

412
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,119
Burn it!

413
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,519
Let's go!

414
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,159
This is bad!

415
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,479
Everything is on fire! Poor sheep!

416
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,479
Go!l You're gonna all be grilled! Go!

417
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,599
Get out!

418
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,359
Go! Go!

419
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,280
All gone!

420
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,919
All gone!

421
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,279
The fire destroyed everything!

422
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,999
What is it Uncle?

423
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,679
Last night someone went and burned Khun Pim's house completely.

424
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,079
Luckily those people didn't see you.

425
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,999
If they did,you would have burned with the house.

426
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,599
Who were those people?

427
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,319
I don't know.

428
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,639
But probably the same people that tried to burn it the other time?

429
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,279
But they really burned it this time!

430
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,639
You can't be sure

431
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,919
Bull!

432
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,319
It had to be them!

433
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,359
Where will Pim live once she's recovered?

434
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,679
Her house got burned down.

435
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,999
I know right?

436
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,360
Rong.

437
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,519
You already know don't you?

438
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,159
Why didn't you tell us?!

439
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,439
Gosh Noi! Know what?! What do I know?!

440
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,079
I have to go somewhere right now.

441
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,439
You two go check on Pim's sheep.

442
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,519
Don't Give them water and grass to eat.

443
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,119
Don't forget what Khun Ran said about not letting Khun Chu find out.

444
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,959
He'll tell her when he gets back. Got it?

445
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,079
Yes.

446
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,799
How upset will you be when you wake up?

447
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,239
Pim.

448
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,559
Drink some water first.

449
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,599
Pim.

450
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,639
Yes?

451
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,839
Can you...

452
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,759
sit up and write your name on this paper for me?

453
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,239
I need it for the doctor.

454
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,679
Okay

455
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,759
Write right here.

456
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,359
I think it'll work.

457
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,079
Now you'll know

458
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,079
what you should or shouldn't do.

459
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,479
What is it Orn?

460
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,159
You did it, didn't you?

461
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,959
The fire?

462
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,239
What else?!

463
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,999
It's my property.

464
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,999
I can burn it a hundred times a day if I want.

465
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,799
What do you mean?

466
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,159
Ravee sold the farm and his sister to me

467
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,279
-I can do anything to my property as I wish
-Vee sold his sister to you?

468
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,479
I will not give up my property to anyone so easily.

469
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,119
I'll wait and see.

470
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,119
Jay!

471
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,799
Go get two of the guys.

472
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,319
Get the skillful ones

473
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,759
I have a job for them.

474
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,239
Yes sir.

475
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,319
Kill them.

476
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,839
Make it seem like their own people did it.

477
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,359
He couldn't even take a petite girl back with him.

478
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,759
Why is P'Ran getting involved with that girl so much?!

479
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,359
Go to work.

480
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,799
Report back to me when you're done

481
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,159
Yes Boss.

482
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,519
Let's go.

483
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,319
What's wrong?

484
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,959
You were complaining so loud

485
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,919
Nothing.

486
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,359
I've been raising you since you were five.

487
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,919
I can tell you're upset.

488
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,999
You were complaining so loud

489
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,239
I'd be awful if I didn't know.

490
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,839
It's nonsense stuff.

491
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,679
But when it does make sense,

492
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,079
I'll need your help Uncle.

493
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,519
<i>From now on,</i>

494
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,999
<i>you will be my lawful wedded wife.</i>

495
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,999
<i>Who's your wife?</i>

496
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,919
<i>You.</i>

497
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,279
<i>I can't accept her.</i>

498
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,519
<i>I'm confident</i>

499
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,319
<i>that someday you will accept her.</i>

500
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,479
<i>Never!</i>

501
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,959
<i>I paid 500K for this woman.</i>

502
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,159
<i>She's mine.</i>

503
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,439
<i>Don't meddle.</i>

504
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:25,080
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

505
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:33,540
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

506
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,940
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

507
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,480
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

508
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:50,920
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
