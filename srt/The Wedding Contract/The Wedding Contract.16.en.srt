1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,720
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,760
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,920
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,320
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,160
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,560
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,200
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:05,760
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,840
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,000
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:26,120
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,439
You came here with me

13
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,439
was to spite P'Ran right?

14
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,079
Did he do something to upset you?

15
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,239
I have to go check in the stock upstairs

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,599
Wait right here.

17
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,919
Pim.

18
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,839
We may have just met

19
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,359
but I can tell that you're not the type to date many guys at once.

20
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,839
He must have upset you.

21
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,679
You wanted to spite him by coming here with me.

22
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,759
Am I right?

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,799
Is it true that Khun Orn and Khun Ran

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,439
were supposed to get married?

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,959
I don't know either.

26
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,759
But it's possible.

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,479
It may have been a conversation between them.

28
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,919
Just tell me the truth.

29
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,599
Don't spare my feelings.

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,639
Pim.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,479
You really want to hear

32
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,639
that they were supposed to get married

33
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,279
before he married you?

34
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,999
So it's not strange for them to go off and have sex.

35
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,439
This is all that is left.

36
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,919
I'll call Auntie to let her know the others aren't
done yet because it needs to get altered.

37
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,959
She'll have to wait a little.

38
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,999
Okay.

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,319
I'll hold them.

40
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,639
I'll hold it.

41
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,519
Leaving already?

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,759
Or do you plan to go somewhere else next?

43
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,439
You don't need to come get me.

44
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,839
After I'm done with your aunt's errand,
I will be heading home.

45
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,799
I won't go off and have a reconciliation like someone.

46
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,999
Da.

47
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,599
Nus called?

48
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,599
Well Da?

49
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,279
Why did she call?

50
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,319
To...share the profits with her.

51
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,999
And?

52
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,799
She wanted me to wire her the money.

53
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,959
Did you?

54
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,519
Yes.

55
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,599
She won't be running for long once her money is out.

56
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,079
Did Nus tell you where she was at?

57
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,079
She didn't.

58
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,519
But I did call back the number she used to call me.

59
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,799
But it wouldn't connect.

60
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,079
What's the number?

61
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,159
Hold on.

62
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,959
I sent it to you through Line.

63
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,479
Thank you.

64
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,119
Let's go home.

65
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,679
No.

66
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,679
I'll go with P'Nai.

67
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,599
You like Nai after briefly stepping out with him?

68
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,999
If she's out any longer with him, I think she might want to change husbands P'Ran.

69
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,599
Your husband came to pick you up but you want to leave with someone else?

70
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,359
Yes.

71
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,519
She came out with her lover so she probably doesn't want to go home with you.

72
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,679
These are how quiet sluts be have.

73
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,079
Do not forget our contract Pim.

74
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,439
Let go!

75
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,679
I'm leaving with P'Nai.

76
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,439
Nai is a good person.

77
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,239
Rich too.

78
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,959
You won't be disappointed if you get with him.

79
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,519
Give P'Ran back to me

80
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,319
and you take Nai.

81
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,239
Isn't it better for the both of us to win?

82
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,479
I want both of them

83
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,079
One person

84
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,479
to have as my husband at home.

85
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,159
The other person

86
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,479
is to keep as my driver.

87
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,119
It's hard to change one's nature.

88
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,839
These are how quiet sluts be have.

89
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,159
Quickly follow Khun Ran outside.

90
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,079
It'll be difficult to get home if you can't chase after him.

91
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,079
It's just I'm not okay sharing the car with another woman.

92
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,679
What's so funny?

93
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,159
Orn.

94
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,919
Have you ever seen Orn like this?

95
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,479
Is Pim a really good person?

96
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,799
From the way she talks, I don't think she is

97
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,079
If Orn didn't mess with her first,

98
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,839
Pim wouldn't be like this.

99
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,839
Why don't you side with your friend?!

100
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,919
Isn't it true?

101
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,999
I'm leaving now.

102
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,679
-Go, Go away!
-Okay!

103
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,599
Shall we go? I'll drop you off.

104
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,239
-Yes.
-Let's.

105
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,079
"I'm leaving with P'Nai!"

106
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,479
My tires.

107
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,839
It's flat.

108
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,759
Every single one of them.

109
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,159
Must be Khun Ran.

110
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,359
P'Nai.

111
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,279
You should call for a mechanic.

112
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,359
Then...

113
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,599
you can go wait in Da's shop.

114
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,919
I'll walk you in and then I'll call a mechanic.

115
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,159
The shop is just right here. I can get there on my own. Don't worry.

116
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,319
I think you should call a mechanic.

117
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,599
Okay.

118
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,159
Up to you.

119
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,519
Oh!

120
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,239
Can l stay in here while--

121
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,519
Don't resist if you don't wanna die!

122
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,679
Do you want your guts to come out?!

123
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,679
Don't scream!

124
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,919
Stay quiet.

125
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,439
P'Ran.

126
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,239
She doesn't care about you.

127
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,639
So why should you care about her?

128
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,759
She'll feel encouraged.

129
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,919
Did you not hear what Pim said?

130
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,359
I did.

131
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,599
I heard more than you did.

132
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,639
What do you mean?

133
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,959
Well...

134
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,639
Pim told me she wants to keep both of you guys.

135
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,359
One is to keep as her husband.

136
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,319
The other person as her driver.

137
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,799
What is it Da?

138
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,679
Pim got kidnapped!

139
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,119
Sure okay.

140
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,159
I'll let Aunt Chu know.

141
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,439
I have to go.

142
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,759
Da said to remind Aunt Chu to wire her the money for the outfit.

143
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,999
You guys work for Khun Tin right?

144
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,839
Quiet!

145
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,439
Stay still.

146
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,239
You guys will get caught!

147
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,159
Do you not understand?! You wanna get hit?!

148
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,679
Boss said not  to do anything to her.

149
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,359
Will anything happen?

150
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,759
I told her to tell P'Ran but she said she will tell Aunt Chu.

151
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,679
What do I do?!

152
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,119
What happens if Pim gets hurt or something?!

153
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,479
What do I do?!

154
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,599
Who's that?

155
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,519
All four tires are flat.

156
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,799
Nai! Nai!

157
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,639
Nai!

158
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,759
-What is it?
-Nai!

159
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,759
Someone came and kidnapped Pim!

160
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,479
What?!

161
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,919
-Someone came and kidnapped Pim!
-Wait.

162
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,999
Did you see who it was? Did you call the police?

163
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,479
I called.

164
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,639
There were two of them.

165
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,639
But l don't know who it was but they left!

166
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,119
What do we do?!

167
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,839
-Car?
-Let me borrow your car!

168
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,319
You sure you don't want me to go with you?

169
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,439
No. I'll call if I need your help.

170
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,159
What do I do?

171
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,679
Will Orn tell anyone with that kind of response?

172
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,599
She doesn't like Pim so she probably won't tell anyone

173
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,119
What if I don't say anything?

174
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,119
They'll think I'm an accomplice

175
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,839
Right there.

176
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,999
How did it go?

177
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,119
Pim left with Nai.

178
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,239
P'Ran invited her to come home with us

179
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,599
but she refused to come.

180
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,799
I think she wants to go with Nai instead.

181
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,599
Ran.

182
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,759
Did those two go patch things up or what?

183
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,639
Stepping out together like this,

184
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,999
you should tell her it's not right of her to do this.

185
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,799
Phone is ringing.

186
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,839
Hello.

187
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,319
Yes Lada.

188
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,079
Aunt Chu, Pim got kidnapped!

189
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,319
What?!

190
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,239
Why are you now just calling?!

191
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,839
Alright. Thank you for telling me.

192
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,839
Ran.

193
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,359
Pim was kidnapped in front of Lada's shop.

194
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,279
Do it nicely.

195
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,519
Here it is.

196
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,119
Guys!

197
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,839
Pim was kidnapped!

198
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,679
What?!

199
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,159
They're all looking for her!

200
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,959
Where did she get kidnapped?

201
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,319
wonder Khun Da's shop.

202
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,279
What?!

203
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,359
Why are you so extra with your shock?!

204
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,759
Do you not understand?

205
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,439
I can't even be shock now.

206
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,919
Does Khun Ran know yet?

207
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,999
wonder He took off right after he found out.

208
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,679
wonder He left Khun Orn with his aunt

209
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,599
Toei.

210
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,959
Go with Khun Ran

211
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,479
Huh?!

212
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,359
No huh! Get going!

213
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,999
Trouble after trouble.

214
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,439
Khun Ran!

215
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,159
No need.

216
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,439
I'll drive.

217
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,839
That's the road to the farm.

218
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,479
What do we do?

219
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,279
The police are i waiting in the front.

220
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,279
It's fine.

221
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,279
Call someone to come switch the car.

222
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,119
If you let me get off right here

223
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,999
you guys won't get in trouble.

224
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,319
Getting scolded by your boss is better than going to jail.

225
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,959
The police.

226
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,679
Where do we start?

227
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,239
I don't know either.

228
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,799
How about this?

229
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,679
Let's go back to Lada's shop first.

230
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,959
Okay.

231
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,799
Go.

232
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,639
If you guys let me get off right here,

233
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,679
I will not mention this

234
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,159
I won't tell the police how I go t here.

235
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,959
Hey!

236
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,639
Don't try to run

237
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,319
if you don't wanna die.

238
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,839
We're not scared of the police.

239
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,479
There's a police following us.

240
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,919
Who called them?

241
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,359
I don't know either.

242
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,999
Did anyone see you guys when you took her?

243
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,079
No one in the store saw either.

244
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,519
Where are you right now?

245
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,799
I'm on the street to the farm.

246
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,679
Three kilometers from the farm.

247
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,679
I'll come to you.

248
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,799
Go start the car Jay.

249
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,439
We'll go get Pim.

250
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,079
Reverse.

251
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,799
What's the matter?

252
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,759
If the police car is going that way, we need to follow it.

253
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,799
-Go!
-Okay

254
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,639
Boss is picking you up.

255
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,079
Can I go stand and wait outside the car?

256
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,359
You think just because we're subordinates, we're stupid?

257
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,599
If we let you wait outside and the police drive by and you wave to them,

258
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,279
won't we get in trouble?

259
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,639
Just wait in here!

260
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,439
Hey what are you doing?

261
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,759
You wanna die?

262
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,839
Stay down.

263
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,319
Don't talk.

264
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,239
Is something wrong with the car?

265
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,519
It died. It just suddenly stopped.

266
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,839
But it's okay.

267
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,959
You go ahead. Someone from the farm is picking me up

268
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,639
- Just let me go.
-Hey! I said don't talk!

269
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,319
Oh.

270
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,119
Khun Tin.

271
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,359
This car is from your farm?

272
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,839
Yeah.

273
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,159
My subordinate called and said it died.

274
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,479
Sol brought someone to come fix it.

275
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,479
Thanks for stopping to check on us.

276
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,799
Let my subordinates handle the rest.

277
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,239
I'll take off now.

278
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,959
Okay.

279
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,959
Pim!

280
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,839
Khun Ran!

281
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,439
Pim!

282
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,679
What are you doing?

283
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,999
Pim is in your car.

284
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,479
She's in my car

285
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,679
so that makes her mine.

286
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,599
Pim!

287
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,519
Get out the way!

288
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,639
Quickly get down!

289
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,479
Pim!

290
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,839
Why did you shoot?!

291
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,839
Die!

292
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,839
Come here!

293
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,599
Let me go! Let go!

294
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,999
Pim!

295
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,119
I'm okay.

296
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,999
Khun Saran!

297
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,999
It doesn't hurt.

298
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,799
Doesn't hurt?!

299
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,799
You can't defeat me.

300
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,959
P'Ran!

301
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,119
Step aside!

302
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,959
Or else you're gonna be the one to drag your boss's body home!

303
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,759
A good person like you

304
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,759
wouldn't dare shoot me.

305
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,479
Try me.

306
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,079
Maybe next time Pim.

307
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,519
These people shouldn't have interrupted our happiness.

308
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,119
Khun Ran!

309
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,799
How were you looking after Pim

310
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,359
to have them kidnap her?!

311
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,439
Don't Khun Nai

312
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,119
-Khun Nai!
-Let me go!

313
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,839
Stop!

314
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,959
Khun Ran!

315
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,759
Stop Khun Ran! Stop!

316
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,999
Stop!

317
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,839
P'Nai didn't know anything!

318
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,919
You're protecting him?

319
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,679
Yes.

320
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,239
You're acting like a thug who doesn't listen to anyone.

321
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,479
It's not right!

322
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,479
You're protecting another man in front of your husband right now!

323
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,599
Yes.

324
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,919
But if you think I'm having an affair with P'Nai

325
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,519
because I'm protecting him from a thug like you,

326
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,079
that's up to you.

327
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,919
P'Nai.

328
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,279
Let's go P'Nai.

329
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,759
Toei.

330
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,359
Yes?

331
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,439
Go open the car door.

332
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,479
Okay.

333
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,239
Pim.

334
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,799
Get in the car.

335
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,799
Go to the hospital with me.

336
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,479
No.

337
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,159
I'm going to the hospital with P'Nai.

338
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,239
Did you find Pim?

339
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,679
Yes.

340
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,799
Hey.

341
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,239
Why do you look like this?

342
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,439
Does it hurt?

343
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,079
Where did you find her?

344
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,439
On the side of the road.

345
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,519
Why was she on the side of the road?

346
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,319
Tin had his guys kidnap her.

347
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,159
Oh.

348
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,679
So the reason you look like this is because of Tin?

349
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,239
Where is Pim right now?

350
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,239
She went to the hospital with Danai.

351
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,519
Orn.

352
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,519
Time to go home. I'll drop you off.

353
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,799
I almost had Pim!

354
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,679
If you had let us shoot him, it would have been over

355
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,279
Shoot him?

356
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,599
You have a brain. Use it!

357
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,999
With the police driving around like that,

358
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,159
there will be problems if they heard gunshots

359
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,599
How lucky that no one heard the first shot?

360
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,799
I'm sorry Boss.

361
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,359
This time the police got involved

362
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,359
So they got away with it.

363
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,639
But next time I will not mess up

364
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,759
Yes.

365
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,279
Don't let the wound get wet today.

366
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,119
Okay.

367
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,319
I already placed an order on your medicine.

368
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,159
When you get home, you must clean your wound in the morning and evening.

369
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,999
Okay.

370
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,079
You're all done. You have a follow
up appointment in three days.

371
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,359
Okay.

372
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,319
Excuse me.

373
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,279
Bye.

374
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,639
Thank you.

375
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,759
Are you okay?

376
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,679
Yes

377
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,759
You choosing to come here with me

378
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,159
I think there will be problems.

379
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,359
I was thinking the same.

380
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,239
I'll help.

381
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,159
Slowly,

382
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,079
It'll trigger the wound.

383
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,639
But what Khun Ran did was wrong.

384
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,919
He doesn't ask first.

385
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,279
He doesn't know the story so he makes an assumption.

386
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,839
But it's good that this happened.

387
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,159
So he knows

388
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,919
if he doesn't take good care of you,

389
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,999
I'll be the one

390
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,439
to take care of you.

391
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,279
Come.

392
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,519
Let's go home.

393
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,759
Before your husband thinks we're doing something.

394
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,079
Okay.

395
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,319
Let's go.

396
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,079
Blow it!

397
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,079
-Why can't you blow it?!
-My goodness!

398
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,119
P'Pim is here!

399
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,919
Are you still in pain?

400
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,999
I'm no longer in pain.

401
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,599
Can I kiss where your wound is?

402
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,159
It's good you're home safe.

403
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,439
Yes.

404
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,359
Where's Daddy?

405
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,239
Daddy isn't home.

406
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,359
I haven't seen him at all.

407
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,919
Ran and Orn are another couple.

408
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,639
They stepped out together and haven't come home yet.

409
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,519
P'Orn is latching onto Daddy like a leech.

410
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,359
Huh?!

411
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,359
The leech that sucks blood?

412
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,519
Mafeuang.

413
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,079
You can't say that about P'Orn.

414
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,759
Why not?

415
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,119
I saw Uncle Rong went down to stop the water.

416
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,959
When he came up, there were leeches on his legs.

417
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,439
He couldn't take them off.

418
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,359
Oh my!

419
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,999
So you called her a leech because she hangs on to Daddy and can't take her off

420
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,439
-Just like a leech
-That's right!

421
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,319
I'm going to go shower right now.

422
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,439
-I'm coming too!
-Me too!

423
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,839
Excuse me now.

424
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,799
Yeah.

425
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,759
Let's go.

426
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,839
-Yay!
-Be careful kids.

427
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,638
P'Pim is still injured.

428
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,158
I'll take off now, Bye.

429
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,839
Wait Nai.

430
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,759
Come chat with me first.

431
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,839
I want to know what happened.

432
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,759
Okay.

433
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,158
I know you're upset.

434
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,359
Drink some wine to calm yourself down.

435
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,079
How can l calm down?

436
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,079
Your friend Nai does things without being considerate of me.

437
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,279
I understand.

438
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,319
But...

439
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,679
Pim isn't being considerate of you as her husband either.

440
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,239
She chose to go with Nai.

441
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,439
It's not strange for you to get upset.

442
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,279
But if it was me

443
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,439
I wouldn't dare do what Pim did.

444
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,919
I'm going home.

445
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,959
Oh.

446
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,799
You've sat here for so long and only drank one glass.

447
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,079
Can you stay and keep me company?

448
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,959
I don't want to drink anymore.

449
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,079
I have to drive.

450
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,919
One glass is more than enough already.

451
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,359
Actually you're more worried about Pim.

452
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,959
You say you're mad.

453
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,599
But your heart wants to go see how she's doing.

454
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,079
Am I right?

455
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,359
Thanks.

456
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,119
P'Ran!

457
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,999
Thanks.

458
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,639
Good thing you're okay.

459
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,919
Does it hurt?

460
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,759
A little.

461
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,759
A little my ass!

462
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,839
Did you put medicine on it?

463
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,359
I don't need to, It's nothing

464
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,999
Just put some on so it can heal faster.

465
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,839
Come here.

466
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,999
Hurry.

467
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,519
Little my ass.

468
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:34,999
Okay.

469
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,799
You want to act tough.

470
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,079
Don't complain.

471
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,999
Will it sting?

472
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,319
No.

473
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,759
It stings?

474
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,439
Yes.

475
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,359
-Be gentle.
-Okay.

476
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,279
Feel better?

477
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,959
Yes.

478
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,359
Weakling!

479
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,119
Do you think the reason P'Ran married Pim

480
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,079
was to get revenge on her brother for running away with Nus?

481
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,799
May be.

482
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,319
Then it's possible that

483
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,479
Pim might not really love him.

484
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,439
Right?

485
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,159
I don't know

486
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,959
Really?

487
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,239
Pim is probably uncomfortable living her life like this too.

488
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,639
I'm a woman just like her.

489
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,599
I understand how she is feeling.

490
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,919
Pim doesn't want to marry P'Ran?

491
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,159
Probably not.

492
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,159
Ran trapped her into this marriage as a hostage

493
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,599
regarding her-brother Ravee.

494
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,119
You should be able to tell that those two aren't happy.

495
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,159
Hold on.

496
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,519
What?

497
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,999
I think Pim doesn't really love P'Ran

498
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,919
What are you gonna do about it?

499
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,599
I'm going to officially court her

500
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,639
Really?

501
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,999
-Really?
-Be gentle!

502
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,359
Take it!

503
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,159
What's wrong?

504
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,519
My head hurts!

505
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,239
Take it!

506
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,919
I won't do it anymore.

507
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,319
You always criticize me

508
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,319
but you went off with Khun Orn.

509
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,239
Perhaps you might do more than me.

510
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,599
You guys are old lovers.

511
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,999
It won't be hard to reconnect.

512
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,239
Is she in the bathroom?

513
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,319
She's not in there

514
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,639
It's late and she's not even home yet.

515
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,079
They didn't just go and see the doctor for sure.

516
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,519
Let me call and see where she's at.

517
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,119
We'll just get into an argument again.

518
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,439
Whatever!

519
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,679
I won't be able to sleep if I don't call.

520
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,919
Oh!

521
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,239
You left your phone at home?!

522
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,239
What are you doing?

523
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,279
Carrying you to bed.

524
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,479
No need.

525
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,319
Did you have fun with your ex?

526
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,439
Is that why you're just coming home?

527
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,919
I was having fun with my ex

528
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,239
or were you having fun with Nai?

529
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,439
Speak properly.

530
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,799
I only dropped her off at home

531
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,319
Just dropped her off

532
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,839
or you did more afterwards?

533
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,319
Just dropped her off at home!

534
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,999
And also drank one glass of wine to relieve irritation

535
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,239
Because my wife went with another man.

536
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,439
That's all?

537
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,159
But if it was more than that, no one would see.

538
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,159
I promise

539
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,519
I won't cheat on you.

540
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,799
I will not lose the land and that huge amount of money.

541
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,759
Oh.

542
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,119
It's because of the land and money.

543
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,359
Yes.

544
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,159
What about you?

545
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,479
Why were you sleeping here?

546
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,679
I...

547
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,999
I?

548
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,999
I what?

549
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,319
I came out to look at the moon.

550
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,079
Ever since you've lived here with me,

551
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,639
I've never seen you come out to look at the moon.

552
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,319
This is the first time.

553
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,439
That's your problem if you don't believe me.

554
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,479
<i>I found your sister</i>

555
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,959
<i>Go pack my luggage.</i>

556
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,759
<i>Your luggage,</i>

557
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,999
<i>you pack it.</i>

558
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,759
<i>You're my wife so you must pack your husband's luggage!</i>

559
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,439
<i>What is this?</i>

560
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,759
<i>So you can wear it to your date with Khun Orn.</i>

561

562
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,599
<i>What am I going to wear tomorrow?</i>

<i>Your underwear of course.</i>

564
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:24,200
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

565
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:32,660
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

566
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:38,060
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

567
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,600
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

568
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:50,040
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
