1
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,320
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,360
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,520
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,920
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,760
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,800
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:04,360
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,440
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,600
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,639
Marry me.

13
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,079
We're already married.

14
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,079
I mean...

15
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,519
get married for real.

16
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,599
Like real husband and wife.

17
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:49,159
<i>♫ Today I have you beside me ♫</i>

18
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,799
<i>♫ To u were with me every day ♫</i>

19
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,119
<i>♫ As the days passed, the more anxious I became ♫</i>

20
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,599
<i>♫ Afraid that I will have feelings for you ♫</i>

21
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,919
<i>♫ I had to stop my heart ♫</i>

22
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,519
<i>♫ No matter how much I love you, that's all I can give ♫</i>

23
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,519
<i>♫ Since there will be a day where we must part ways ♫</i>

24
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,279
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

25
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:40,119
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

26
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,359
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

27
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,959
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

28
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:57,919
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>

29
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,519
How long were you awake?

30
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,518
Not long.

31
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,079
I love you.

32
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,999
Today,

33
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,639
I'm going to tell Aunt Chu

34
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,999
that I'm going to have a wedding reception

35
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,479
We signed the marriage certificate a long time ago

36
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,959
but we haven't celebrated it.

37
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,479
Orn.

38
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,839
I found out everything from Nus.

39
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,439
Don't worry.

40
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,639
I'll talk to Ran for you.

41
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,359
-But...
-As a man,

42
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,359
he must take responsibility for what he did.

43
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,999
Auntie.

44
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,999
Please don't talk to P'Ran yet.

45
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,919
Hey!

46
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,919
How come?

47
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,919
Your stomach will get big in the future.

48
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,999
If we don't talk today, what will you tell 
people when your stomach gets bigger?

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,999
I haven't included your uncle yet!

50
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,359
Aunt Chu.

51
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,679
Ill have the wedding reception
 after your birthday party

52
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,519
Save the wedding for later.

53
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,999
Follow me. I need to speak with you.

54
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,839
Pim.

55
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,679
Can I talk to you?

56
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,679
What do you need to say?

57
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,439
that it had to be like this

58
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,999
Just that one time

59
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,079
and I didn't think I would get pregnant.

60
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,079
P'Ran doesn't love me.

61
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,839
He made a mistake that day.

62
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,999
I'm only telling you

63
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,999
because I don't want you to misunderstand.

64
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,479
Over thinking about my pregnancy.

65
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,479
You're going to keep the baby?

66
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,119
I won't take the baby out.

67
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,798
They...

68
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,119
represent P'Ran.

69
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,759
Besides l have money.

70
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,319
It won't be difficult to raise a baby by myself

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,839
I heard you will have a wedding reception.

72
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,759
Congratulations.

73
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,919
Let me know if you need help with anything.

74
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,119
I didn't do it.

75
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,319
But I remember you went missing with Orn the whole night and returned close to morning.

76
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,319
I can get a DNA test done,

77
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,319
I can do anything.

78
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,279
But the father of that baby is not me

79
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,839
If you're going to force me to marry Orn because of this,

80
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,639
I won't marry her.

81
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,239
What about you having problems with Tinnamai and it led to you getting shot?

82
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,119
And now you want to have issues with Khun Yut?

83
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,239
I think Uncle Yut will understand.

84
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,079
I didn't do it!

85
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,839
If you're going to force me to marry Orn just because she's pregnant,

86
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,159
I will go talk to Uncle Yut.

87
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,079
I'll tell him l didn't do it.

88
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,119
He has to go find him himself

89
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,759
who the baby's father is.

90
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,119
But I'll tell you right here that it's not me.

91
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,279
You can't push me to be the baby's father.

92
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,519
No news on the hitman that was hired to go kill Saran.

93
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,679
Maybe it's someone else?

94
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,759
I heard Khun Saran just got back from Bangkok

95
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,279
Maybe he stepped on someone's foot there.

96
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,239
But I heard that you and Ran were having problems

97
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,159
You even called off the deal you made to each other.

98
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,799
Yes.

99
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,999
Orn told you?

100
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,919
It didn't have to be Orn.

101
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,919
Other people were talking.

102
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,279
You came to see me because of this?

103
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,599
This and about Orn.

104
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,119
What about Orn?

105
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,159
I want Orn to marry Ran

106
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,279
She wanted to marry Ran before.

107
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,759
But I don't know what happened lately

108
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,159
She doesn't even want to see him when I tell her to.

109
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,519
She's probably bored of him.

110
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,479
I don't think so.

111
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,759
But I think she feels she can't compete with Pim so she's giving up.

112
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,919
Why don't you handle Pim for Orn then?

113
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,959
I don't want Orn to feel I'm bothering her too much.

114
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,799
But this time I guess I'll have to get involved.

115
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,319
When will you do it?

116
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,639
So I'll pretend not to know anything about it.

117
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,239
Right now.

118
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,959
That fake bitch!

119
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,599
She wants you to break up with Khun Ran right?

120
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,439
No.

121
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,439
She just wanted to tell me.

122
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,279
Just wanted to tell doesn't exist in this world!

123
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,639
She expects something in return Right P'Toei?

124
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,159
Snake!

125
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,319
Look?

126
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,759
Snake!

127
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,319
I know you want me to look. Look at what?!

128
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,999
Snake!

129
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,759
I'm sorry.

130
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,639
Come. Hurry.

131
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,039
Put it nicely.

132
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,919
Pretending to be a snake! The only snake you will be is a pedophile!

133
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,359
Talking about me?!

134
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,959
No.

135
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,119
I was talking about Toei.

136
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,639
Hey!

137
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,479
Where's Pim?!

138
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,479
She was running with us.

139
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,639
What do you want me to answer?

140
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,639
Stop arguing!

141
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,759
It was only you two that ran here!

142
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,919
Pim didn't come with you!

143
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,439
Unless...

144
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,839
she got bit by the snake!

145
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,519
-We should go see
-Hurry then! Go!

146
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,159
She's not here.

147
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,599
-Where did she go?
-You guys ran without even looking

148
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,599
How will you answer if Khun Saran asks?

149
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,119
And you say Pim is your friend.

150
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,599
But don't you realize

151
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,799
Pim is the lady of this farm?

152
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,959
Hey.

153
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,999
Where's Pim?

154
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,759
She said she was coming to pick some greens to make chili sauce for lunch.

155
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,679
She's not here?

156
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,839
She came.

157
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,439
Where is he?

158
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,959
We don't know where she went after running away from a snake.

159
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,319
Snake?!

160
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,359
Try looking that way.

161
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,839
We can't find her.

162
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,159
-My goodness.
-Wait.

163
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,759
-What happened?
-Khun Pim is missing!

164
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,999
Khum Pim is missing

165
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,919
-Pim is missing?!
-Khun Pim! Khun Pim!

166
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,839
-Pim!
-Pim!

167
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,079
Pim!

168
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,679
Good thing you guys got to Pim faster.

169
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,999
We got there a little quicker than Khun Yut's people.

170
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,919
I'm sorry.

171
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,839
Go!

172
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,319
Well?

173
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,119
She's inside.

174
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,759
Very good.

175
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,279
You guys can go rest.

176
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,759
Hey stop!

177
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,919
Is aids top!

178
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,359
Did you not hear me?!

179
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,439
You kidnapped Pim didn't you?

180
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,159
Yeah I did.

181
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,079
Give me back my wife.

182
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,679
Are you sure you're one of us Vee?!

183
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,159
If I'm not, I wouldn't be standing here waiting to get kicked!

184
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,519
If you back stab Khun Saran,

185
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,598
I will kick you before I kick Tin's people.

186
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,639
Got it?

187
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,239
Yeah.

188
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,359
You're trespassing my house right now.

189
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,919
Bringing weapons like this,

190
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,919
I can finish this by...

191
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,759
a simple self defense.

192
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,078
Even if we don't bring weapons,

193
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,479
you will get my hands dirty

194
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,838
If you wanted to.

195
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,999
Smart.

196
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,639
Let me go!

197
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,479
Hey Toei help me!

198
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,759
If you want to watch, go ahead.

199

00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,319

-Okay!

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,319
Hey!

219
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,239
Catch them!

220
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,679
Don't let them leave!

221
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,119
Anyone helping them

222
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,319

Hello.

232
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,279
Boss, Khun Yut is here

233
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,359
Hello Uncle.

234
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,279
You sent your guys ahead of me!

235
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,519
I sent them before I was informed

236
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,519
You really wanna be my enemy?!

237
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,439
Uncle.

238
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,799
Who would dare be your enemy?

239
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,759
If you think about i t, it's the same thing.

240
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,239
Whether it's you or me.

241
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,079
we both want to get Pim out of the way

242
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,639
That's true.

243
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,799
Hey.

244
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,239
Bird.

245
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,079
I'll be paying all of Uncle's subordinates drinks tonight.

246
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,439
Handle it for me.

247
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,439
Yes.

248
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,159
Please Uncle.

249
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,439
Ah, nothing here. Carry on.

250
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,359
-Go.
-Please.

251
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,239
I'll help you bring that girl to you.

252
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,639
But don't touch Ran.

253
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,959
I need to use him to work with the farmers

254
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,479
But he humiliated me.

255
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,279
Whatever.

256
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,639
When it's time, you can do whatever you want with him.

257
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,239
I won't stop you.

258
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,519
P'Vee!

259
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,359
Where's P'Vee?

260
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,799
How critical is he?

261
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,639
Toei and Uncle Rong

262
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,679
took him to the hospital.

263
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,679
Vee's...

264
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,439
heart stopped

265
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,959
since he was at Tinnamai's house.

You should feel at ease now that your dead beat of a brother has died.

285
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,079
Auntie said she gave you money worth thousands and millions but you refused to leave.

286
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,639
Hey!

287
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,239
I'm talking to you. Did you not hear me?

288
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,679
Stop!

289
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,239
I heard.

290
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,519
But I'm not in the mood to answer.

291
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,839
You need to be in the mood to talk to the owner?

292
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,519
You're a tenant here.

293
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,319
You need to answer them!

294
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,439
Yes.

295
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,999
I didn't take the money.

296
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,679
I didn't take a hundred thousand.

297
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,279
I didn't take one million.

298
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,119
You love my brother a lot?

299
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,519
It has nothing to do with you.

300
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,359
It does involve me.

301
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,839
Because if you're leeching off my brother,

302
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,159
using my family's money, using my last name lam involved.

303
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,439
Yes.

304
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,159
I love your brother.

305
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,799
We married each other because we love each other very much.

306
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,239
Is this what you want to hear?

307
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,599
Is that so?

308
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,079
Isn't it a unrequited love Pim?

309
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,839
I think the reason my brother married you

310
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,919
is because he wants to keep the twins.

311
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,119
Did you know

312
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,919
he once applied to adopt the twins

313
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,679
but the judge wanted the twins to be raised in a family.

314
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,999
That's why he had to get married.

315
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,079
You never knew right

316
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,479
that you're just a tool for my brother

317
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,919
to keep the twins?

318
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,519
Otherwise P'Pat's husband side of the 
family would take custody of the twins.

319
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,359
Why don't you think about it again?

320
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:33,999
How happy can you be by marrying someone who only used you?

321
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,999
Hurry Daddy! Tell us where Mommy is

322
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,479
I won't tell you.

323
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,919
Ow!

324
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,359
Mommy will be here soon!

325
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,439
If you won't tell us

326
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,799
we won't let go!

327
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,999
Daddy!

328
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,999
Head lock!

329
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,679
Mafeuang let go of Daddy before he dies.

330
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,439
Fine.

331
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,519
Are you hurt Daddy?

332
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,279
Oh.

333
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,159
When Mommy comes,

334
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,319
you need to give her a big hug.

335
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,159
She needs lots of moral support right now.

336
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,119
So she can be happy Okay?

337
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,799
If she's not happy, will she still want to be our mommy?

338
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,679
If Mommy isn't here,will we get to stay with you?

339
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,959
Without Mommy,

340
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,999
Daddy will find a way for us to live together.

341
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,799
Mommy is here!

342
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,279
Don't cry Mommy.

343
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,639
Don't cry, I will take care of you.

344
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,079
Thank you.

345
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,679
You're not alone Pim.

346
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,119
You're my family.

347
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,439
You still have me

348
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,678
and the twins.

349
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,079
I'll go see you at the shop.

350
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,359
I'll buy some food on the way too.

351
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,919
Okay. See you.

352
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,279
Where are you going Nus?

353
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,079
To see Da.

354
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,159
Ever since you got back,

355
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,479
you're hardly home

356
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,799
I'm having Da make me an outfit for your birthday party.

357
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,679
Will you be going to Rave e's funeral service?

358
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,759
No, He's not my family

359
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,319
Excuse me now.

360
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,159
Are you sure you will go help me work?

361
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,919
Yes!

362
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,759
In case Mommy wants to be alone

363
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,239
I don't want to bother Mommy.

364
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,279
Alright,

365
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,319
fine.

366
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,239
But promise me you won't be naughty.

367
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,799
Yes!

368
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,999
Let's go get P'Jam in the kitchen.

369
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,639
Tell her you guys will be going with me.

370
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,759
Yay!

371
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,279
Let's go! Let's go!

372
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,479
Brother is leaving, sister is leaving.

373
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,839
What about your wife's brother's funeral?

374
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,919
Who's handling that?

375
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,999
I had Uncle Rong handle it.

376
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,599
Later on Toei will take Pim to pick up his body and take him to the temple.

377
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,359
Oh.

378
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,599
How many days is the service?

379
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,439
Three.

380
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,319
Pim said they don't have any relatives, Just her.

381
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,959
Nobody will come if they prolong it.

382
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,679
Okay.

383
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,999
Whatever his sister say then

384
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,679
Go to work.

385
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,959
If those two get naughty, have Jam bring them back.

386
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,919
Okay

387
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,919
Ran.

388
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,639
Be careful.

389
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,239
Yes Auntie.

390
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,999
I'll be careful.

391
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,639
Ma'am.

392
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,079
I'm sorry about Ravee.

393
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,599
Thank you.

394
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,839
But without Ravee,

395
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,159
Ran would be dead.

396
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,959
Right now it's considered

397
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,279
you're alone with no family left.

398
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,639
Yes.

399
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,599
To be frank, I've started to like you Pim.

400
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,639
You're a tough and hard working person.

401
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,279
Most importantly, l acknowledge

402
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,359
you really love Ran.

403
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,919
But l have a favor to ask you

404
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,839
I don't know if you can do it for me or not.

405
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,239
I hope you understand.

406
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,119
The favor I'm going to ask does not mean I hate you or don't like you.

407
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,599
But if you really love Ran,

408
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,479
you will understand.

409
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,919
You want me to leave this house right?

410
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,519
Yes.

411
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,919
Ever since you moved in

412
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,519
Ran has been having enemies.

413
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,799
This isn't the first time he was harmed.

414
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,479
All of this was to protect you and your family.

415
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,999
You just lost your brother.

416
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,999
You should understand how it feels.

417
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,119
I don't want Ran to be next

418
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,759
If you really love Ran,

419
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,279
you must want him to continue to live.

420
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,159
But if this continues

421
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,679
we don't know how long he will survive.

422
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,519
I understand what you're saying

423
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,239
Think about it.

424
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,799
Tell me when you have an answer.

425
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,519
Don't tell Ran about this.

426
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,159
What I told you is for Ran's safety

427
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,919
But if you disagree,

428
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,479
it's fine too.

429
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,319
Hey.

430
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,919
Be ready to scoop Pim from my brother.

431
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,999
What happened?

432
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,479
They got into a fight?

433
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,279
Geez!

434
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,959
Your eyes are bulging.

435
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,439
Hell yeah.

436
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,119
Her brother made that big sacrifice is your brother willing to let Pim go?

437
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,959
Throughout the past,people have been trying to get P'Ran to break up with her.

438
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,319
But no one has tried to get Pim to break up with P'Ran

439
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,919
So what?

440
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,679
She probably did say something to Pim to try to break up with P'Ran.

441
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,079
I only told the truth that no one has told Pim yet.

442
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,919
It's okay. Even if you're sad,

443
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,839
Vee won't be coming back.

444
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,239
I know.

445
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,519
P'Toei.

446
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,319
Do the twins come here often?

447
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,079
They only come with Khun Ran's older sister.

448
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,079
But after the accident,

449
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,519
they stopped coming. They moved to America.

450
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,679
Why did they come back here?

451
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:01,919
I don't know either but it seems like this time they'll be staying here for a long time.

452
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,599
Oh.

453
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,599
When they first got here,

454
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,479
I asked P'Jam about it.

455
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,799
How many weeks will you be staying here P'Jam?

456
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,479
A long time.

457
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,519
So they don't have to go back to school there?

458
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,959
Khun Ran will be transferring them here.

459
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,599
Khun Chu already contacted a school for them.

460
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,799
Hearing P'Jam say that, I think they're moving here permanently.

461
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,079
Why didn't you ask Khun Ran?

462
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,559
You live with him.

463
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,999
Boy.

464
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,319
Why isn't the grass in this area not growing?

465
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,999
The water pump is broken?

466
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,119
I told Uncle Rong already. He'll be fixing it soon.

467
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,759
The police are here Mafeuang!

468
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,119
Why?!

469
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,759
I was informed that you trespassed Khun Tinnamai's house.

470
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,759
Assaulted him, he had to defend himself and someone died.

471
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,959
Jam.

472
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,079
Take the kids home

473
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,239
Sure.

474
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,439
Kids, let's go tell Grandma the police are here.

475
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,759
Come on. Let's go.

476
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,479
Tinnamai didn't defend himself.

477
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,359
He went above and beyond.

478
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,359
Let the police investigate that.

479
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,479
I came to invite you to go to the station for more questionings.

480
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,959
-Mommy!
-Mommy!

481
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,759
The police came to see Daddy?

482
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,319
A huh.

483
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,159
P'Jam.

484
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,159
Why are they here for?

485
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,839
Khun Tin is having him arrested.

486
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,799
For trespassing and assault. He had to defend himself which led to someone dying.

487
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,279
My god!

488
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,959
Self defense my ass!

489
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,959
He purposely wanted to shoot Khun Ran.

490
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,639
Where is Khun Ran?

491
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,119
At the grass field.

492
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,319
Where's Khun Ran?

493
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,639
The police took him to the station already

494
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,319
Khun Pim.

495
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,239
I have something to tell you.

496
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,759
It might benefit you.

497
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,839
What is it Nuan?

498
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,919
I once saw Khun Tinnamai at the factory.

499
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,839
Dad's doll factory?

500
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,919
Yes.

501
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,639
After this batch gets exported,

502
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,919
I think I will be able to give you all the money back.

503
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,999
You said the same thing last time.

504
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,319
We got swindled last time.

505
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,439
But this time I'm confident.

506
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,639
Mom and Dad borrowed money from him?

507
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,239
Pim!

508
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,159
Let's go to the police station!

509
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,239
Hurry!

510
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,559
Nuan.

511
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,959
I'll come back and talk to you about this.

512
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,799
-Okay.
-Let's go P'Toei.

513
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,999
Ran must be busy.

514
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,519
He must be because you filed a report on him for trespassing,being armed,

515
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,959
and our people getting injured that we had to defend ourselves.

516
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,639
Will he go to jail?

517
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,959
I don't think he will get away this time.

518
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,919
This is the first time

519
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,319
that I'm using the police to handle someone for me.

520
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,679
This time Khun Yut can't criticize you

521
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,079
because you didn't do it.

522
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,239
That's right.

523
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,519
But if he goes to jail

524
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,159
you can easily get his wife.

525
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,959
To be honest,

526
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,479
I'm more satisfied now

527
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,919
than to get Pim as my wife.

528
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,079
Just seeing Ran's downfall

529
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,159
makes me content.

530
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,159
I told you

531
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,479
he kidnapped my wife first.

532
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,359
I trespassed because I needed to save her!

533
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,919
Why didn't you file a report?

534
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,079
Trespassing and you were armed, that's an offense.

535
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,239
This is why I didn't file a report!

536
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,799
Being bribed by Tin, that's how.

537
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,999
Watch your mouth!

538
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,999
You will be charged for insulting an official!

539
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,799
-You can't go in miss!
-I'm going inside! Let go!

540
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,839
I told you not to let anyone come in!

541
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,599
I'm his wife! Why can't I come in?!

542
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,079
What happened yesterday involved me too!

543
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,799
It's right of you to question me too!

544
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,839
<i>Get out!</i>

545
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,159
<i>Someone like you should be sleeping in a coffin!</i>

546
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,239
<i>You killed someone and you came to ask for forgiveness?! What did you use to think?!</i>

547
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,839
<i>No one will for give a murderer like you!</i>

548
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,359
<i>Buffalo!</i>

549
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,279
<i>What do you mean you're pregnant?</i>

550
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,079
<i>It means there's a baby inside of me!</i>

551
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,639
<i>My baby?</i>

552
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,479
<i>In order for me to go handle Tin for bothering you,</i>

553
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,279
<i>can I request a trade?</i>

554
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,759
<i>In exchange for what?</i>

555
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,119
<i>Divorce Pim.</i>

556
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:41,000
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

557
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:49,460
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

558
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,860
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

559
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,400
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

560
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:06,840
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
