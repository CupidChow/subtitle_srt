1
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,320
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,360
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,760
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,360
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,600
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,999
Ran went to go look for her.

13
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,999
Will he find her?

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,759
I don't think he will

15
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,479
But I think he went to go find clues of her whereabouts.

16
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,319
Why did he have to take the girl from next door with him?

17
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,599
In case she knows where her brother is at.

18
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,599
-Let's eat.
-Sure.

19
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,479
-Sit.
-Thank you.

20
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,079
But I think

21
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,999
he will sleep with that girl more than get Nus back.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,279
I don't think so Orn.

23
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,919
I've only seen you that goes places with Ran for years now

24
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,639
Well, only you see that.

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,319
Ran might have noticed too.

26
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,839
Let's eat.

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,999
Do you know when P'Ran will come back?

28
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,999
I heard he will go pick up the twins today I think he will be back tomorrow.

29
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,639
The twins are coming back?

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,799
They're not going to live there anymore?

31
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,599
They refused.

32
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,479
They said they miss Ran.

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,279
Good.

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,079
So you won't get so lonely.

35
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,439
She canceled her number.

36
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,359
Why did Nus elope with that kind of person?

37
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,159
But I'm curious.

38
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,439
Why was Khun Tin looking for Pim at her house?

39
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,679
-Da.
-Hmm?

40
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,119
I think there's something unusual.

41
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,518
Vi!

42
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,559
What do we do?

43
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,119
Ravee is in Chiang Mai right now.

44
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,359
I think we should stay here. l got the job

45
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,159
But with P'Ran coming here himself, I think it's unsafe.

46
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,119
We ran away together because we just want to be together.

47
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,359
Even if he finds us,

48
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,279
I don't think he will kill us.

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,679
To me, he won't do anything.

50
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,959
But to you, I'm not sure.

51
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,679
Bangkok isn't small.

52
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,799
No matter how big it is,

53
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,759
P'Ran will find us eventually!

54
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,639
It won't be that easy.

55
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,279
We changed the car and our phone numbers

56
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,919
Just don't go to them all.

57
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,919
Don't go there repeatedly

58
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,120
I knew...

59
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,679
-He... He knew he put it somewhere...
-Let's eat.

60
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,359
No! I'm not hungry.

61
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,519
Can we wait for Daddy to come to eat?

62
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,599
But I think the food will get Cold first.

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,639
Let's go eat first Mafeuang, Mafai.

64
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,799
No!

65
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,959
Their mother died for two years now.

66
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,519
I'm sorry

67
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,159
for saying things before thinking this morning.

68
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,759
It's okay.

69
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,159
But don't mention their mother again

70
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,359
Daddy is home!

71
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,359
Daddy!

72
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,959
You made me feel guilty

73
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,119
Who knew your wife died?

74
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,319
The two Mas will not eat.

75
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,799
Oh.

76
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,039
Why not?

77
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,639
Quickly eat.

78
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,439
So you can shower and brush your teeth and sleep so you can go see Grandma Chu tomorrow.

79
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,439
Can P'Pim come with us?

80
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:54,839
I promised P'Pim that we will play together but we haven't played yet.

81
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,759
She will.

82
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,999
P'Pim will take care of you during the ride there.

83
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,119
Deal?

84
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,959
Really?

85
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,359
We'll play the whole ride there, Okay?

86
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,079
Yay!

87
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,959
Are you hungry? Let's go eat.

88
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,279
Okay.

89
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,439
Let's go.

90
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,599
Can you come sit with me?

91
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,919
-Sure.
-Yay!

92
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,159
-Sit here P'Pim. Sit here.
-Okay.

93
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,119
Mafeuang and Mafai seem to get along with this woman.

94
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,999
Quicker than me.

95
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,839
That shepherd girl!

96
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,839
Those hell twins too.

97
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,239
Why did you come back?

98
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,239
Why don't you stay with your paternal grandparents?

99
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,319
Your parents all died!

100
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,159
What are you complaining about all by yourself?

101
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,279
Nothing

102
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,319
So...

103
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,158
where's your boyfriend? Why are you here alone?

104
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,279
What about you?

105
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,799
You usually are with a new woman everyday.

106
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,599
don't see one single woman today.

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,359
Those women just want money to spend

108
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,239
I can call them whenever I want.

109
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,639
They didn't come today when you called?

110
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,839
No wonder you look disappointed.

111
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,599
I don't have any one today.

112
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,399
You don't have any one.

113
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,479
Go find one someplace else

114
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,159
Or do you want to try Ravee's sister?

115
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,439
Do you want to anticipate?

116
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,439
She's pretty

117
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,479
She is filled with so many debts right now

118
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,679
Her brother is missing

119
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,479
She's alone.

120
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,679
Plus with so many debt like this

121
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,319
it won't be hard to throw her some money.

122
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,599
Wait until she comes back and then go offer her some money

123
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,959
Do you know when they will be back?

124
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,799
Tomorrow.

125
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,159
With Jack's greediness,

126
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,359
Jack didn't just want the gold egg.

127
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,239
But he wanted--

128
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,599
Khun.

129
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,519
What is it?

130
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,919
You can't sleep?

131
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,799
Are you going to ask me if you can sleep in my room for one more night?

132
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,639
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,519
Sorry for what now?

134
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,679
I didn't know that the kids' mother...

135
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,319
that your wife passed away.

136
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,119
I'm sorry.

137
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,239
Then...

138
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,519
see you tomorrow morning.

139
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,519
Pim.

140
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,119
If your brother doesn't come back,

141
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,159
will you sell the farm?

142
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,639
I thought I misjudged you today

143
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,959
In the end, you couldn't hide your tail.

144
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,359
A selfish person will always be selfish

145
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,359
You want to buy the farm at a cheap price don't you?

146
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,279
I won't sell it! At least right now I can still manage it!

147
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,919
Pim! Pim!

148
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,799
Fuck!

149
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,959
I didn't misjudge him!

150
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,519
You want to buy it a t a cheap price? I won't sell it!

151
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,479
No wonder Pim took her sheep to come eat Khun Ran's grass.

152
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,679
It's only dirt. If the sheep can eat it then they must be termites.

153
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,439
Then you must be a termite that can also eat it.

154
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,919
I might look like a termite that nibbles on the house

155
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,639
but I...

156
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,759
can nibble you away from being a spinster.

157
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,679
Enough!

158
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,319
Take the sheep back to their pen

159
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,599
You're gonna need to go help Dad fix the house too.

160
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,439
Go! Come on!

161
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,239
Go! Hurry!

162
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,079
Go!

163
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,639
Go! Go! Go!

164
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,279
Here P'Toei.

165
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,639
Are you okay?

166
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,319
I'm okay.

167
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,759
Well, then keep walking!

168
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,079
You believe me?!

169
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,079
You said i you were okay!

170
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,639
Look at me!

171
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,999
Got kicked in the little one?

172
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,959
It's not little!

173
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,119
It's big!

174
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,759
Very big right?

175
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,079
So annoying!

176
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,679
Does it hurt a lot?

177
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,679
Come. Come.

178
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,679
Go! Go! Go!

179
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,479
Who's that?

180
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,999
Came here so early, He won't leave unless he sees Pim.

181
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,799
He sit and stand here waiting for her.

182
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,999
Dad!

183
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,479
Dad, are you okay? Does it hurt?

184
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,959
Of course it-hurts!

185
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,439
You don't watch where you're going.

186
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,599
-Dad.
-What?

187
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,959
That person over there

188
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,519
he didn't go anywhere.

189
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,759
Oh him? He's here waiting to see Pim.

190
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,279
He won't answer any questions plus he doesn't go anywhere either.

191
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,319
Refreshing huh?

192
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,800
Why won't the door go in? What's wrong?

193
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,119
I haven't pressed the button. Why is there noise?

194
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,359
Toei.

195
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,239
I asked you to help me. How can you sleep?!

196
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,639
If you don't want to help then don't help at all!

197
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,239
Okay!

198
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,959
I was being sarcastic.

199
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,919
What's wrong? Why were you standing there sleeping?

200
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,319
I was thinking

201
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,239
that the guy came here since morning and hasn't moved anywhere

202
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,759
You're not suspicious?

203
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,799
Will my waist not break?

204
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,759
Don't complain

205
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,599
A window fell on me and l didn't complain about it.

206
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,599
Khun Orn!

207
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,318
That fake girl is here again.

208
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,679
Don't talk so much.

209
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,239
Right on my back.

210
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,479
You i didn't see me?!

211
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,519
I was just walking

212
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,239
What are you complaining about?

213
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,239
-Work
-Work?

214
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,239
I saw you walking from that farm

215
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,039
What work?

216
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,519
Khun Ran had us go feed the sheep and fix up Grandpa Ruj's house too.

217
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,439
So attentive.

218
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,239
Let's go.

219
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,279
So bad. It's obvious she doesn't like it

220
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,239
Gosh stop gossiping about your boss
You're a gossiper like your mom huh?

221
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,599
I'll get going now

222
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,279
Will you stop by to see me at the house?

223
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,239
Come play house with us.

224
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,319
Please?

225
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,759
P'Pim will visit you guys soon.

226
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,919
Right?

227
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,079
Why won't you answer?

228
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,079
Why did you just say yes to them like that?

229
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,839
You're lying to them.

230
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,919
Who knows?

231
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,359
In the future,

232
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,959
you might have to come play with it he kids.

233
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,679
In the future, P'Vee might come get me to go live with him.

234
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,839
Stop dreaming

235
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,919
that a selfish person like your brother will come get you!

236
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,679
If he's not selfish he would have sold me the farm!

237
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,799
You see?

238
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,319
In the end you said it yourself that it's because he won't sell the farm to you.

239
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,839
You're the selfish one here.

240
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,159
The reason he ran away

241
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,159
is because you threatened him about something

242
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,639
He left you here with a mortgage d land

243
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,119
He doesn't care at all where you will live if the land gets seized.

244
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,759
You're still going to defend him?

245
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,839
Who cleaned up the pen?

246
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,159
Who gave you grass and water too?

247
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,359
How will my sheep eat then?

248
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,479
They're not eating imaginary food.

249
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,799
The grass that your sheep came to eat

250
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,999
should make them full for years.

251
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,839
New grass.

252
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,439
Unless...

253
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,159
Why would that selfish knuckle face guy do this?

254
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,279
Electricity got cut off again.

255
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,959
All spoiled. I won't get to eat now.

256
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,759
Grandma!

257
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,279
Kids! You're finally here!

258
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,679
Let me take a look at you.

259
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,999
You haven't seen me in a year. Do you miss me?

260
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,679
Yes we do.

261
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,959
Me too!

262
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,079
Come. Let me give you a kiss.

263
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,479
More.

264
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,679
I've missed you so much!

265
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,959
You got here all late. Let's just have dinner.

266
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,679
Then you can go shower and go to bed.

267
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,319
-- Taew, go bring the chairs for the kids.
-Okay

268
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,319
How are you? You're all big now!

269
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,079
They're cute.

270
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,159
They must miss their grandma so much.

271
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,119
I'm the one that misses them.

272
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,279
Are you hungry P'Ran?

273
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,279
-Come kids. I'll take you to your seats.
-The chairs are here.

274
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,519
My spot.

275
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,999
Sit properly

276
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,519
Did you thank P'Orn yet?

277
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,079
I don't like P'Orn. I like P'Pim more.

278
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,919
Me too.

279
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,999
That was cool.

280
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,319
Khun Ran is here. Should l we go tell him about the guy that is at Khun Pim's house?

281
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,479
Khun Orn is here.

282
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,959
I don't want to go in there.

283
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,359
You don't want to go inside?

284
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,359
Choose who do you want to kick you. Me or Rong?

285
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,519
Mom.

286
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,119
You want me to step on the gas pedal?

287
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,359
You already have.

288
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,919
Why are you running to me?

289
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,079
In case you can help.

290
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,519
Gosh!

291
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,759
He can't even help himself

292
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,879
How can he help you?!

293
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,959
So cruel.

294
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,519
Go!

295
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,079
Wait.

296
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,319
Walk properly.

297
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,239
Still?!

298
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,359
More properly!

299
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,999
So irritated!

300
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,359
What's the matter Toei?

301
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,639
It's just...

302
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,479
Let's go talk outside.

303
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,839
Yes.

304
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,799
What is it Toei?

305
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,759
A guy came to wait for Pim all day.

306
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,319
Who sent him?

307
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,679
I don't know.

308
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,919
He came since morning and hasn't gone anywhere.

309
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,959
I wanted to tell you sooner but I never got the chance.

310
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,159
Who fixed the door and window for me?

311
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,239
Gosh I know!

312
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,839
You keep singing (growling ). 
Are you a singer?

313
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,519
Even if you keep growling, there's nothing to eat

314
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,639
Or did P'Vee really came back?

315
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,679
I was hearing things?

316
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,519
Anything unusual?

317
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,239
If there's anything unusual here, it's you

318
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,639
Bipolar.

319
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,359
No food.

320
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,519
lights are out.

321
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,319
Fridge can't be used either.

322
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,519
Vee, you are the worst.

323
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,159
You left your sister here with a broken house.

324
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,359
Who are you?

325
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,919
A gunshot!

326
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,959
Hey!

327
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,279
Hey! Are you trying to kill my sheep?!

328
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,679
The sheep's pen is on fire!

329
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,319
Hey stop!

330
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,759
I said stop!

331
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,559
Who sent you?!

332
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,639
Help!

333
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,359
I asked who sent you?!

334
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,319
Help!

335
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,479
Answer me!

336
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,439
Asshole. I didn't get to know who sent you.

337
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,359
Fuck!

338
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,239
Did you have to go this far to get my farm?!

339
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,279
I won't let you guys

340
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,639
be that knuckle face's assets

341
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,999
What happened?

342
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,359
I wonder too.

343
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,079
A motorcycle exploded but the driver got burned and died.

344
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,799
I don't know who they were.

345
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,799
Song didn't come home last night did he?

346
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,919
I think it was him

347
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,919
This morning, he didn't go have breakfast in the kitchen.

348
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,639
That idiot! He dragged me into this!

349
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,079
Go tell the workers not to mention Song.

350
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,759
If anyone asks, say they don't know.

351
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,319
We don't have anyone by the name of Song at the farm.

352
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,799
I'll handle the rest.

353
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,959
Does anyone recognize who the deceased is?

354
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,279
I think...

355
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,239
it's a worker in this area.

356
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,919
The whole body got burned like this,

357
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,919
whoever recognizes the person must have waited in their dream.

358
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,079
Is someone from your farm missing?

359
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,639
All my workers are present.

360
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,759
Are all the workers in your farm..

361
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,519
present?

362
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,999
Going to put this on me?

363
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,319
I'm just making guesses.

364
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,959
Making guesses of people that are here.

365
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,678
Where did my account book go?

366
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,319
I remember Grandpa put it in here

367
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,959
When I need it, I can't find it.

368
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,119
What money do I use to fix the pen?

369
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,239
I'll just go to the bank

370
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,799
I should ask for a ride into town.

371
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,599
Hey!

372
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,359
I'm in trouble!

373
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,119
You go ahead. I'll check.

374
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,479
Where can I hide?

375
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,119
Where did she go?

376
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,239
Khun.

377
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,439
Hey!

378
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,959
I came to look for some apple snail to go make som.

379
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,239
Really?

380
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,239
How many did you catch so far?

381
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,639
Hey.

382
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,759
Let me ask you.

383
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,319
Why did you cut in front of my car?

384
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,319
Who wants to cut in front of someone's car like you?

385
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,359
Why? What about me?

386
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,159
What about you?

387
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,839
You're mean. You want something in return and you're not considerate of people's feelings!

388
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,479
You're self-centered. You seem nice sometimes.

389
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,079
But l don't know if that's just a front or not.

390
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,999
I shouldn't have asked.

391
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,359
What are you doing?!

392
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,959
You were about to fall.

393
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,479
I don't need your help

394
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,639
What nice person would do it?

395
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,239
You were trying to burn my sheep pen down just because l refused to sell you my land.

396
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,119
I bet you were trying to burn my whole farm down.

397
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,159
Me?

398
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,119
Last night,

399
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,279
you barged into my farm and threatened me with a gun.

400
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,279
You poured gasoline on my sheep pen trying to burn it.

401
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,959
You were trying to scare me so that I would sell the farm to you right?

402
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,519
If l were to do it, I would have done it when your grandfather was alive!

403
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,359
If you won't stop picking fights with me, I'll go back and finish burning it You want that?

404
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,599
-You're insane!
-Yeah!

405
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,519
Come on!

406
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,519
I'll show you something insane!

407
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,079
-Let's go.
-Let me go! I won't go!

408
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,999
Khun!

409
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,479
Khun! You're hurting me!

410
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,319
Come look at this.

411
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,279
You brought me to look at grass 
debris that the villagers burned up?

412
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,679
Come look at someone that got burned and died

413
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,119
Why did you bring me here?

414
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,799
What does it have to do with me?

415
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,839
You accused me of burning your house.

416
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,519
You took me to see a person that got burned

417
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,919
and you say you didn't do it?

418
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,799
How is it connected?

419
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,479
I said I didn't do it.

420
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,119
You want to tell me that the deceased was the culprit?

421
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,759
Putting the blame on a ghost. Who says the dead can talk?

422
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,959
Hello Khun Saran.

423
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,319
Hello.

424
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,359
Is there a problem here?

425
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,119
Khun Pim thinks the person that died

426
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,479
was the person that tried to burn down her sheep pen last night.

427
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,759
How so?

428
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,679
Tell him that your sheep pen was on fire last night.

429
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,359
Yeah.

430
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,599
I didn't see the culprit.

431
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,839
But I heard a gunshot last night and the sheep was screaming.

432
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,119
There was gasoline around the place but a fire did start.

433
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,239
Good thing I saw it in time otherwise..

434
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,519
all my sheep would have died.

435
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,159
We found a gun and bullet at the crime scene.

436
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,799
- May I go take a look at your farm?
-Go ahead.

437
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,519
Khun!

438
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,599
That's my farm.

439
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,999
Shouldn't I be the one to give permission?!

440
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,479
Her farm is close by.

441
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,519
You can go take a look. Feel free to look every nook and cranny.

442
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,239
Thank you.

443
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,319
Will she be going too?

444
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,759
Pim will go into town with me.

445
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,479
But if you have more questions to ask,

446
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,479
contact Saengtawan Farm.

447
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,479
I'll take Pim there.

448
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,959
We'll have to go check out her farm first in case we get any more evidence

449
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,799
-Excuse us.
-Sure. Thank you so much.

450
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,079
Hey Khun.

451
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,159
How can you say that?

452
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,479
Let's go talk in the car.

453
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,319
No!

454
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,759
Gosh!

455
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,759
You're acting suspicious with you hurrying like this

456
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,679
What's suspicious?

457
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,159
I just wanted to help.

458
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,439
Help?

459
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,999
Help yourself?

460
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,359
Why didn't you tell him you were there last night?

461
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,279
Why should l be your witness?

462
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:50,759
The reason you won't is because you are a suspect.

463
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,959
Why would I do that?

464
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,959
To stage this whole thing up pretending someone is threatening me.

465
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,159
So that I'll get scared and sell you the farm.

466
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,359
I actually don't have to do that

467
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,759
Your farm is being mortgaged right now.

468
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,799
One day when you don't have money to pay back, it will get seized.

469
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,959
It'll be in the market.

470
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,359
I can wait to buy it then.

471
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,479
So last night...

472
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,119
what you said about the culprit is true?

473
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,359
Yes.

474
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,959
Who burned it then?

475
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,759
Did your brother caused any problems to someone?

476
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,359
They got mad so they're trying to burn your farm.

477
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,839
You.

478
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,159
Haven't?

479
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,799
You haven't stopped?

480
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,359
Well it's just you that got into an argument with P'Vee.

481
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,119
And...

482
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,159
has your brother has had any issues with Tinnamai, the owner of a farm around here?

483
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,399
No.

484
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,719
Never.

485
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,319
Can you drop me off at the market?

486
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,959
Okay.

487
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,279
-Thank you.
-Huh?

488
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,279
What did you say?

489
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,599
Thank you.

490
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,280
I'll give you 30 minutes then meet back here.
I'll pick you up.

491
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,919
No.

492
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,799
Wow! Your head is just your head. You won't listen at all

493
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,599
Where is she going now?

494
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,359
My account book is missing.

495
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,839
I wanted to get a new one and withdraw some money.

496
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,599
If it's missing you need to file a report first.

497
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,079
But you don't have to since your brother Khun Rave e has withdrawn all the money from the account.

498
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,119
All of it?

499
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,119
When?

500
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,919
A few days ago.

501
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,999
But isn't it a joint account?

502
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,839
He had the power of attorney paper and your ID card printed so he was able to withdraw.

503
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,119
Sign your name.

504
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,159
So I can withdraw some money to go pay the installments.

505
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,079
Really?

506
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,599
For the land installments,

507
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,479
perhaps...

508
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,959
Khun Rave e informed me already that in less than a month, you will come redeem the land.

509
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,759
Me?

510
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,919
Congratulations Khun Pim that the yield was good allowing you to redeem the land before the deadline.

511
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,079
Yes.

512
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,279
Thank you.

513
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,560
Bye.

514
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,679
Once you finish fixing the stable

515
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,999
connect our electricity to Grandpa Ruj's farm.

516
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,319
Try to get it done by today.

517
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,279
<i>Are you okay?</i>

518
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,519
<i>If you're interested in that girl then why won't you do something?</i>

519
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,079
<i>Before someone else takes her away</i>

520
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,679
<i>It's Ran that Orn was trying to tell me about.</i>

521
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,359
<i>Hia Tin.</i>

522
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,759
<i>We need to talk.</i>

523
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,480
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

524
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:33,940
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

525
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:39,340
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

526
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,880
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

527
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:51,320
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
