3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,520

5

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,679
With Nai,you smile all sweetly

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,999
But with your own husband,

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,359
you talk all stern as if you don't want to talk to me.

15
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,119
But to day's incident happened because you slashed P'Nai's tires.

16
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,879
I did it?!

17
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,959
If not you then who?

18
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,599
I wasn't happy that you went with Nai.

19
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,119
But I didn't do it.

20
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,639
Them.

21
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,159
Tin's guys kidnapped you.

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,679
So of course it was Tin that did it.

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,639
Okay then.

24
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,279
What's the hurry?

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,319
Why did you had to go get the outfit with him?

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,679
Try asking your aunt.

27
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,799
I did.

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,799
What did she say?

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,119
My aunt said

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,519
you volunteered to go with Nai.

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,119
If that's what she said,

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,359
the I guess so.

33
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,359
But I don't completely believe her.

34
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,999
How's your wound?

35
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,279
You remember? Don't worry about it.

36
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,519
I am worried.

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,119
That's why I asked.

38
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,639
I saw you were busy asking about P'Nai.

39
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,679
Can I take a look at it?

40
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,639
Did you clean it yet?

41
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,319
Not yet.

42
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,999
I'll do it for you.

43
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:15,359

58
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,919
Go to sleep

59
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,439
Tomorrow morning.

60
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,759
after you've shower and are dressed,

61
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,679
I'll dress your wound again.

62
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,199
So you don't have to take a peek at me again.

63
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,959
I'm going to sleep.

64
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,479
Sweet dreams.

<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

76
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,079
I got the number.

77
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,799
I think it's my sister's number she recently activated.

78
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,679
Can you take a look at it?

79
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,959
Sure.

80
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,319
Call me right away when you get an address.

81
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,599
Okay.

82
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,599
Hey!

83
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,799
Make sure you plant in every row

84
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,919
Pick up the pace a little Auntie.

85
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,799
-Okay.
-Good.

86
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,079
We're close to using our feet already.

87
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,919
All he does is walk around but doesn't help us.

88
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,079
But you want us to hurry?

89
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,319
What did you say Toei?

90
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,839
I was saying...

91
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,999
we'll be done after your quick walk.

92
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,959
Done quicker.

93
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,159
You weren't saying all I do is walk around and not work?

94
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,399
No.

95
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,799
Okay then.

96
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,439
No I was.

97
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,279
Uncle.

98
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,919
Yes?

99
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,439
Today after you're done planting the new crops,

100
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,799
go check the corn with me.

101
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,239
The worker said

102
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,319
they found mildew.

103
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,119
Really?

104
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,599
If it's true,

105
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,679
we have to extract and burn it.

106
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,239
If we let it spread, the whole field will rot.

107
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,359
Sure.

108
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,279
Pim.

109
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,959
Let me ask.

110
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,159
When you talk to Khun Saran,why do you talk to him in central dialect?

111
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,159
Why don't you talk in our language?

112
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,479
We're not close.

113
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,079
So I don't want to.

114
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,319
Not close?

115
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,319
Is that so?

116
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,919
We're really not close!

117
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,079
But what I saw is more than the word close.

118
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,959
Pim.

119
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,319
Why are you here?

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,439
To help out the farm.

121
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,439
It's boring staying at home.

122
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,759
l only take the sheep out to eat in the morning and evening.

123
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,159
So I wanted to come help you and P'Toei work.

124
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,079
How do I do it P'Toei?

125
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,999
Like this!

126
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,079
Let's go.

127
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,359
Flap the plant and squeeze it like this.

128
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,159
Like that.

129
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,519
Come look at the cornfield with me.

130
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,479
Toei can do it by himself here.

131
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,279
Uncle!

132
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,439
Huh?

133
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,319
Come here!

134
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,639
What is it Toei?

135
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,679
Help me with the work here

136
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,279
I'm going to the corn field!

137
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,239
Why? To be their third wheel?

138
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,239
Oh that's right.

139
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,599
Sit!

140
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,079
Why would I sit?!

141
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,079
I'm going to the corn field!

142
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,679
OKay.

143
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,519
I'm so irritated by you!

144
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,759
What's your problem?

145
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,119
I'm so confused by you.

146
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,759
Boss is over there now. Boss wait up!

147
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,359
Kiminoto?

148
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,679
Again?

149
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,239
What are you looking at?

150
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,599
Mildew.

151
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,839
Huh?!

152
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,159
There's no outbreak though.

153
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,079
I was thinking the same.

154
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,599
So why is it here?

155
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,159
Now that there is, you'll have to extract the plant right?

156
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,639
With a lot of it,

157
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,239
what will you do?

158
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,799
If there's a lot,

159
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,439
I'll have to burn all of it.

160
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,479
But don't you already have customers reserving orders?

161
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,599
Yes.

162
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,599
How are you going to deliver them?

163
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,159
I'll have to find a way regardless.

164
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,519
Was it your people or Tin's people that kidnapped Pim?

165
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,319
If it was me,

166
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,319
I wouldn't have messed up like that.

167
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,999
If Ran's farm is damaged,

168
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,999
things would be a lot easier.

169
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,839
Why?

170
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,679
Well,

171
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,239
if his farm is damaged,

172
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,519
he will have to come buy the product from us to deliver to the customers that ordered in advance.

173
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,799
And how do you know it will be damaged?

174
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,519
May be I'm smart.

175
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,279
Just drop some bad seeds for him.

176
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,799
So my products will sell a little better.

177
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,919
My reputation is on the line though.

178
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,999
If he finds out the seeds came from my shop,

179
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,759
the villagers will stop buying from me.

180
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,279
No one will know because mildew exists everywhere

181
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,599
But if his whole farm gets damaged

182
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,919
the price of the corn will be much higher.

183
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,359
My products in stock will be sold at a good price.

184
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,279
As for you, if the villagers all burn their crops

185
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,599
they will come to you to buy more stuff.

186
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,599
You win,

187
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,279
I win.

188
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,439
You don't like that?

189
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,599
When you go see Ran a t his house today,

190
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,119
he might want to talk to you about something.

191
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,359
I don't want to go see them be all in love Uncle.

192
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,759
Trust me

193
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,799
Today he will want to see you.

194
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,599
We probably have to throw this whole batch away.

195
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,359
But that's a lot

196
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,999
Penny-wise and pound-foolish.

197
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,239
It's better to nip the bud

198
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,439
Will we have something to deliver to them?

199
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,839
I'll try talking to Orn today

200
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,838
Last time Uncle Yut said

201
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,159
to not quickly sell the corn yet.

202
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,279
The price will go up soon

203
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,318
Especially now that this happened, we have to negotiate the price among ourselves.

204
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,839
Hey Song

205
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,439
Find anything?

206
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,839
I found where the last call was made

207
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,519
See for yourself

208
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,479
Send it.

209
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,279
Okay.

210
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,799
For you.

211
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,119
-See you later.
-Thank you so much.

212
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,759
Do you want to go buy it from the villagers first?

213
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,079
It might not be so pricey.

214
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,239
I don't think it will be enough.

215
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,959
Khun Saran.

216
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,839
I found your sister :

217
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,159
You'll need to come to Bangkok.

218
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,079
I'll go today.

219
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,999
Why is he here everyday?

220
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,119
Walked pass me like I'm air.

221
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,359
How's your arm?

222
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,759
Still hurts but not much. It's bearable.

223
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,639
Did you clean it yet?

224
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,639
Yes last night.

225
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,759
But didn't the doctor tell you to do morning and evening?

226
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,119
Come.

227
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,919
I'll clean the wound

228
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,319
You drove all the way here just to clean my wound?

229
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,079
Yeah.

230
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,359
I cleaned it for her last night and this morning...

231
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,079
I will do it again

232
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,959
She doesn't need to bother you.

233
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,959
No bother at all.

234
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,359
I'm happy to come clean the wound for her every day.

235
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,599
I can come morning and evening.

236
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,439
He'll be back soon.

237
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,559
What a great day today.

238
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,279
Here he is.

239
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,559
P'Ran.

240
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,079
Your ex-girlfriend is here to see you.

241
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,399
P'Nai.

242
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,879
I think we should go clean my wound now.

243
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,039
I think P'Ran has something to talk to Khun Orn about.

244
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,879
Sure.

245
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,999
Let's go.

246
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,239
Ran.

247
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,639
Orn has been waiting so long for you.

248
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,119
Well,

249
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,519
I came to talk to you about the corn price.

250
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,959
I wanted to talk to you about that.

251
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,039
What's the matter?

252
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,919
I want to know

253
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,039
if I want to buy corn from Uncle Yut,

254
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,599
how much would that be?

255
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,519
We're no strangers. The price will be decent.

256
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,999
I'll ask Uncle Yut about it.

257
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,919
I'm heading to Bangkok

258
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,759
Can you talk to Uncle Yut about it for me?

259
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,279
When I get back,

260
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,679
we can discuss it more.

261
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,039
Okay.

262
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,639
Auntie.

263
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,159
The investigator found Nus's address.

264
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,999
When I'm in Bangkok,

265
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,799
can you watch Pim for me?

266
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,199
Pim is probably familiar with this place already,

267
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,599
I don't need to watch her.

268
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,879
You have to!

269
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,599
Especially when she's with Nai.

270
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,599
I don't like how he's coming here to see her so often.

271
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,519
Sure.

272
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,159
I'm going to go pack up.

273
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,239
Yeah.

274
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,999
Can I take a look at your wound?

275
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,999
Go pack my luggage for me.

276
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,999
Your luggage,

277
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,519
you pack it.

278
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,879
You're my wife so you have to pack your husband's luggage.

279
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,919
I can clean your wound after you get back.

280
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,199
Hey Khun.

281
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,199
You could have asked me nicely.
You didn't have to do this.

282
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,679
I've talked nicely to you I don't know how many times already.

283
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,079
You're my wife so try to act like one.

284
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,079
How was I not acting like a wife?

285
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,599
What kind of answer do you want?

286
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,599
I'm not playing either.

287
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,039
I'm being serious

288
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,479
You're going to go broke.

289
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,639
It's just 500K and a piece of land.

290
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,039
It won't make me go broke.

291
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,799
Stop!

292
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,359
I won't do anything to you right now.

293
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,679
I'll save my energy to catch my flight instead.

294
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,999
Pack my clothes for me.

295
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,799
I'm gonna go shower.

296
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,479
Bipolar.

297
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,879
He must be bipolar.

298
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,599
You remember what I told you?

299
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,519
I remember.

300
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,959
No need to remind me so often.

301
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,119
I don't have short-term memory.

302
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,119
Pim!

303
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,959
Are you okay Pim?

304
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,879
What's the argument about this time Ran?

305
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,999
How are you?

306
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,359
Are you hurt anywhere?

307
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,199
Did you hit your head?

308
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,679
It doesn't hurt much.

309
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,799
Just a little.

310
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,999
Okay.

311
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,919
Auntie.

312
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,599
While I'm not here, please look after Pim

313
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,199
Do not let her misbehave.

314
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,879
Especially...

315
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,759
with Nai.

316
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,879
I'll drop you off at the airport.

317
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,079
Let's go.

318
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,799
Yes.

319
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,679
They're always like this.

320
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,519
Orn must be busy

321
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,599
otherwise she would have gone to Bangkok with him.

322
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,799
Or perhaps she might be going there later on.

323
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,359
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?

324
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,959
It's fine.

325
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,599
In case I can get through Nus instead.

326
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,079
Because she might not want to see you much.

327
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,119
She has to see me even if she doesn't want to.

328
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,999
I'll get going now.

329
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,119
Why are you in a bad mood?

330
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,839
How can I not be?

331
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,519
Uncle Yut wants me to go chasing after P'Ran.

332
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,879
I keep telling him he's not interested in me

333
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,999
but Uncle won't listen.

334
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,079
Why?

335
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,399
It's regarding his business.

336
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,079
I don't see a problem with that.

337
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,399
If you're bored, stop by to see me.

338
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,599
Don't.

339
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,079
I'm not in the mood today.

340
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,479
Then why are you here?

341
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,399
To tell you.

342
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,039
That?

343
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,999
P'Ran went to Bangkok.

344
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,799
He knows where Nus is at.

345
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,879
Is that so?

346
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,319
Yes.

347
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,239
I think last time you tried to kidnap Pim.

348
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,239
Now that P'Ran isn't here, it should be easier.

349
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,679
For how many days?

350
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,399
I'm not sure.

351
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,559
At least for a few days.

352
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,239
But this time,

353
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,359
can you just finish the job?

354
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,399
I won't be here tomorrow.

355
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,199
Where are you going?

356
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,599
It doesn't matter where I'm going

357
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,399
But l will be back to handle Pim

358
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,719
Don't worry.

359
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,239
But I can't help you much.

360
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,559
I plan not to go to P'Ran's house for awhile.

361
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,079
So Pim will understand that I went to Bangkok with P'Ran.

362
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,559
Can you come to my house instead?

363
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,679
Boss.

364
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,599
I'm sorry.

365
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,599
I'll come back.

366
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,919
No need.

367
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,759
What is it?

368
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,079
Well...

369
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,199
I brought you this girl

370
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,679
Also...

371
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,799
Go ahead. I'm leaving.

372
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,159
Can you not leave yet?

373
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,799
You have company now.

374
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,479
I'll leave.

375
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,079
Jay.

376
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,599
Go drop off Orn.

377
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,279
Tipsy like that, I don't want her to drive.

378
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,759
Yes Boss.

379
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,719
The product has been delivered

380
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,719
Money has been wired

381
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,679
This is the new product waiting for you to check it.

382
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,039
Good.

383
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:14,999
You there.

384
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,279
Come here.

385
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,479
Why are you resisting?

386
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,879
Are you sure it's here?

387
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,999
I'm sure.

388
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,479
Hello. Welcome to Glow Indy.

389
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,599
What can I do for you?

390
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,959
I came to see Khun Nussara who is residing in Room 198/232.

391
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,599
Khun Nus left already

392
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,799
When will she back?

393
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,639
She probably won't since she has moved out.

394
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,679
Why don't you go check with Khun Vira at the office?

395
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,999
May be she's there.

396
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,479
Where's the office?

397
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,839
Pim.

398
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,159
Where does it hurt?

399
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,079
Does it hurt because you fell down the stairs?

400
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,839
No.

401
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,759
I just miss my family.

402
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,519
Can you teach me Mommy?

403
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,119
Can I cut it?

404
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,999
Ah, you can't son.

405
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,159
You might cut your fingers.

406
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,759
But I want to try.

407
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,399
You can't.

408
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,879
I don't know if she knows what she's doing either.

409
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,039
From the sketches,

410
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,319
I think Pim is pretty skillful Aunt Chu.

411
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,839
Then continue on doing it.

412
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,159
Jam!

413
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,039
Watch the kids.

414
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,519
Don't let them cut their fingers.

415
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,279
Sure.

416
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,319
I suppose you have something to tell me after coming back from Ran's house.

417
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,599
Yes.

418
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,439
Well?

419
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,879
P'Ran wants to discuss with you about the corn in your inventory.

420
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,199
I heard that...

421
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,079
his corn got infected.

422
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,759
Really?

423
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,039
What else?

424
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,279
You were there all day This is all you know?

425
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,879
Yes.

426
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,079
P'Ran was heading to Bangkok

427
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,399
so that's all we talked about.

428
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,479
I'm gonna go shower now

429
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,439
If we want to go wait in front of his office, we need to wait until Monday.

430
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,399
What a shame.

431
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,678
Otherwise we could have seen them today.

432
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,999
Where do you think they moved to?

433
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,879
From what you told me

434
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,079
about Khun Nus borrowing money from her friend

435
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:46,759
I want to guess that she went to rent out a place that's a lot cheaper.

436
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,039
Because the condos he was at was over 10K a month.

437
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,599
Monday it is.

438
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,959
Be careful.

439
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,679
98 percent.

440
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,879
Stuff it until it looks chubby.

441
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,279
P'Jam.

442
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,039
Can I have a pin?

443
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,079
Okay.

444
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,159
It's like a spring roll.

445
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,839
Cut it.

446
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,679
Yeah!

447
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,919
It's done!

448
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,199
Look! Do you want mine?

449
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,279
It's prettier than Pim's

450
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,719
What's wrong with it?

451
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,319
So ugly!

452
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,599
Oops! Uh...

453
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,599
A premature sheep.

454
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,879
Do you want it?

455
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,599
No I don't.

456
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,479
Even the kid i doesn't want your sheep!

457
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,479
-Grandma!
-Grandma!

458
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,399
Yes my dear?

459
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,599
Look. I made it myself.

460
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,599
Oh really?!

461
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,719
Wow!

462
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,119
It looks nice.

463
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,479
I'm the one that stuffed it.

464
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,399
Really?

465
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,999
Good job dear.

466
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,679
It looks nice.

467
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,399
Yes, Khun Pim helped the kids with it.

468
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,679
Oh really?

469
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,959
Hey.

470
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,279
Can I borrow it for a moment?

471
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,079
Please?

472
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,559
I'll give it back to you.

473
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,639
I promise.

474
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,199
Okay then.

475
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,439
Thank you.

476
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,759
Sure.

477
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,199
Come on let's go.

478
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,759
Don't run please No more running.

479
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,839
This is nice.

480
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,919
He has n't called if he's arrived in Bangkok or not.

481
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,919
But he will call.

482
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,439
What is this?

483
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,479
I want to fly back and knuckle her head.

484
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,879
Yes?

485
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,559
What did you pack for me to wear?

486
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,999
You can wear it to your date with Khun Orn.

487
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,119
You packed your clothes in my luggage.

488
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,719
What am I gonna wear tomorrow?

489
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,999
Your underwear

490
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,919
Are you crazy?! You want me to just wear underwear out of the house?!

491
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,679
I'm not Superman!

492
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,439
Well,

493
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,199
who wears two underwear at the same time?

494
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,199
Everyone wears one at a time.

495
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,519
The under garment,

496
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,959
it's special.

497
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,959
If you want to wear it, go ahead.

498
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,279
I hope you like what your wife did.

499
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,199
I'm hanging up.

500
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,239
I want to go shower.

501
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,039
Hey!

502
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,599
You're just gonna hang up on me?

503
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,719
At least there's underwear.

504
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,759
I'll get you when I get back.

505
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,599
Tonight will be chilly for him.

506
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,759
This fabric is from Nong Ruea District.

507
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,479
Oh it's so beautiful.

508
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,079
You want to combine this with ours?

509
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,559
Madam.

510
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,239
Yes?

511
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,679
I think this is nice too.

512
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,359
Yes you're right.

513
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,599
Good craftsmanship

514
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,399
Yes?

515
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,799
Who made it?

516
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,599
Someone from the farm.

517
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,039
Oh.

518
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,679
Should we display this at our association banquet and see if anyone will buy it?

519
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,879
Is that a good idea?

520
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,559
It's a banquet.

521
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,119
If it's not good enough, it'll just humiliate our province.

522
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,639
You're just being humble Khun Chu.

523
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,399
With this amazing craftsmanship,

524
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,599
it's called representing than humiliating.

525
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,279
-Yes.
-That's right.

526
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,079
This is great work.

527
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,999
That's right.

528
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,999
He's here.

529
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,199
I had my subordinates follow him for days.

530
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,999
Where is he?

531
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,719
He's inside.

532
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,199
Are you gonna take him back?

533
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,519
Yes.

534
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,279
I took the first flight just to come get him.

535
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,639
Hey open the door!

536
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,879
I know you're in there!

537
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,359
Shit!

538
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,879
Hey he's over there! Follow him!

539
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,599
Hurry!

540
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,399
Don't run!

541
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,159
He's so fast!

542
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,079
Don't follow me!

543
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,399
Follow him!

544
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,599
Hurry!

545
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,359
Where are you going?!

546
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,759
He's so fast!

547
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,399
Stop running!

548
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,079
Where are you going?!

549
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,279
Stop running!

550
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,919
Move! Get out the way!

551
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,799
Bastard!

552
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,759
Stand him up!

553
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,319
Sia.

554
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,359
Yeah.

555
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,959
It's me.

556
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,439
Stand him up.

557
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,079
Sia.

558
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,599
Please don't hurt me.

559
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,559
Okay?

560
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,199
Stand up.

561
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,279
Sia!

562
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,559
Just let me go Sia!

563
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,239
Sia!

564
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,679
Your memory is still good.

565
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,479
I thought you forgot about me that's why you came to work here.

566
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,199
I couldn't contact you.

567
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,079
No I didn't Sia.

568
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,679
I just came to look for a job.

569
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,959
I saw that there were jobs here so I came.

570
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,599
You came to work

571
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,919
or you escaped from me?

572
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,719
Because you knew the contract you made your sister wasn't going to sign regardless.

573
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,359
She didn't sign?

574
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,959
Yeah!

575
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,559
That's why I had to come all the way here to get you.

576
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,599
Come here!

577
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,879
What the hell is you guys problem?!

578
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,599
Sia.

579
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,439
I'm sorry.

580
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,039
I didn't know that Pim wasn't going to sign.

581
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,599
You lied to me!

582
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,999
Your sister went off and married Ran.

583
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,199
You need to go back and fix the problem for me.

584
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,639
The money is one thing.

585
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,079
But I want your sister.

586
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,199
P'Vee!

587
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,999
<i>This house?</i>

588
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,159
<i>Vira!</i>

589
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,719
<i>Saran!</i>

590
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,159
Boss is on his way.<i></i>

591
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,319
<i>I heard he brought someone to see you too.</i>

592
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,479
<i>P'Vee!</i>

593
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,199
<i>You need to thank me.</i>

594
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,359
<i>For letting you reconnect with your family again.</i>

595
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:51,200
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

596
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:59,660
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

597
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:05,060
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

598
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,600
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

599
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:17,040
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
