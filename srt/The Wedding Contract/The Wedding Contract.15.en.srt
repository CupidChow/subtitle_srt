1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,720
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,760
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,920
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,320
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,160
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,560
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,200
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:04,760
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,840
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,000
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:25,120
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,919
Mafai! Mafai!

13
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,679
Mafai!

14
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,119
Get up.

15
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,479
Mafai.

16
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,359
-I want Mommy and Daddy to hug!
-Okay!

17
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,639
P'Jam!

18
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,959
Where's Mommy and Daddy?

19
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,279
-You're feeling better now?
-I am.

20
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,279
Then let's go shower and have breakfast.

21
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,999
Mommy and Daddy are sleeping

22
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,119
But you'll be showering in your room.

23
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,239
They're sleeping in our room.

24
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,319
We can shower later, Let's eat.

25
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,319
-Lizard!
-Lizard!

26
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,279
Hey! No running!

27
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,159
No running please!

28
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,519
You guys are awake?

29
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,439
Why didn't you shower?

30
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,119
Did you brush your teeth?

31
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,919
They said they will eat first then shower.

32
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,319
Ma,why don't you guys shower and brush your teeth then come eat?

33
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,159
Mommy and Daddy are sleeping in the room

34
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,999
Oh! They have their own room.
why don't they sleep there?

35
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,639
Don't you usually sleep with the twins?

36
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,799
Why didn't you last night?

37
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,359
Mafai had a fever last night

38
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,079
Sol had to go get Khun Pim.

39
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,519
Why didn't you come get me?

40
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,959
I knocked on your door already but you didn't wake up.

41
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,959
Sol had to go get Khun Pim

42
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,159
Ma'am!

43
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,719
Usually,

44
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,639
don't you sleep with the twins?

45
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,959
So why...

46
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,599
Yes.

47
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,639
Khun Pim was watching Mafai last night.

48
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,519
Then Khun Ran also came to watch him, right?

49
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,839
Perhaps so.

50
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,159
I have a mommy now.

51
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,799
That's right. We cuddled all night in bed.

52
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,159
Kids, Aunt Noi made shrimp congee today, Do you guys want some?

53
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,959
-No!
-No!

54
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,359
The twins?

55
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,679
What are you doing?!

56
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,639
This is void!

57
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,919
I don't have to pay and the land will be mine. Do you remember?!

58
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,359
I don't mind if the land becomes yours.

59
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,279
It was once yours anyway.

60
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,959
It's just 500,000, I won't regret it.

61
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,599
I'll consider it charity.

62
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,319
Ran!

63
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,319
Pim.

64
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,679
Go shower and get dressed and come down to see me.

65
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,519
I need to talk to you in private.

66
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,839
Always seeking problems for me.

67
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,519
You want to continue?

68
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,679
I think Aunt Chu can wait.

69
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,679
Continue what?!

70
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,119
Did she not listen to what Is aid?

71
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,639
I told her to be conservative and all she wants to do is sell her body.

72
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,439
You really can't teach a person's true nature!

73
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,999
Ma'am, you have a guest

74
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,359
Oh really?

75
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,279
Hello Khun Chuda.

76
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,679
l apologize for not informing you first.

77
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,639
But I really needed to talk to you.

78
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,519
Oh.

79
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,319
If you're in a hurry, why didn't you go use the kid's room?

80
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,839
I want to tell you first before you go talk to Aunt Chu.

81
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,599
Whatever she says,

82
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,079
if it's about us, do not pay attention to it.

83
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,359
You're my person.

84
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,439
Just listen to me.

85
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,439
You mean Saran took Orn out since 9pm

86
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,519
and dropped her off close to morning?

87
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,159
Where do you think he took her?

88
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,279
I can't remember

89
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,359
I must have been very drunk

90
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,079
The only people that would know is the person that did it and the victim.

91
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,999
But if this gets out.

92
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,639
the one that will look bad is my niece

93
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,239
Ran is a man

94
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,679
If something like this happens and he has no proof that he didn't do anything,

95
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,679
he must take responsibility

96
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,759
-Mommy! Mommy!
-No running please or else you'll fall!

97
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,599
Mommy, I took my medicine already.

98
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,319
Can you shower for me?

99
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,439
Yes.

100
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,359
Having no parents wasn't enough.

101
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,359
You also don't have manners.

102
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,799
Eavesdropping on people's conversation is called not having manners.

103
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,359
You wanted to talk.

104
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,279
-l didn't know you had a guest over.
-You didn't know but you have eyes.

105
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,319
You should have waited someplace else. Not stand there.

106
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,279
Sit down.

107
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,439
I have to thank you

108
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,439
for looking after the twins last night.

109
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,919
You're skillful for winning over their hearts.

110
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,159
But it doesn't mean that everyone here will accept you

111
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,479
You know right that Ran came home close to morning last night?

112
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,639
I do.

113
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,839
You also heard what Khun Yut said earlier too right?

114
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,119
Yes.

115
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,999
Ran and Orn left around 9pm and came home around 2am

116
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,079
Where do you think those two went?

117
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,439
I don't know.

118
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,839
A man and woman who have been close for ten years

119
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,959
going out together, what do you think they went to do?

120
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,439
Go stare at each other?

121
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,639
Without you,

122
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,959
Ran and Orn would have been married by now.

123
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,479
Her uncle had to come over What do you want me to do about that?

124
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,839
When one year is up, I will go

125
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,119
When that time comes and no matter who Khun Ran marries,

126
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,679
it's his business.

127
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,599
Why wait for one year?

128
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,079
Why wait?

129
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,479
If you plan on leaving then just go.

130
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,759
What if Orn ends up being pregnant?

131
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,479
I don't know.

132
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,519
Let me ask you.

133
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,679
Is 500K too little for you?

134
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,679
How much do you want?

135
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,999
I can give you one million.

136
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,679
Money can't buy me.

137
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,919
If you're going to keep talking about this,

138
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,679
I'll excuse myself.

139
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,839
Do you think Pim will allow it?

140
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,959
We have to wait and see.

141
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,519
What did Aunt Chu say?

142
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,079
She told me to divorce you.

143
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,639
Since you and your ex girlfriend reconciled last night.

144
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,119
So it's my fault

145
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,359
that you and her didn't get married as you should.

146
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,319
I want you to hear my side too.

147
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,279
Ran.

148
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,639
Khun Yut has been waiting

149
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,239
Okay

150
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,639
Don't over think it.

151
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,359
I'll come back and explain it to you.

152
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,519
Hello Uncle.

153
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,079
It's good you're here Ran

154
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,479
Sol can hear from you what you'll do next.

155
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,319
Do next?

156
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,279
Do what?

157
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,079
Regarding Orn.

158
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,479
I think you need to take responsibility

159
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,239
P'Ran.

160
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,838
Where did you take me?

161
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,519
To...

162
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,479
drop me off close to morning.

163
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,078
P'Ran...

164
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,279
Listen to me.

165
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,598
I didn't do anything to Orn

166
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,479
The reason l dropped her off so late was because something happened when I left the farm.

167
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,159
It's not that I want an easy life

168
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,479
to be shameless here

169
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,279
I just don't want to lose Grandpa's land.

170
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,279
When he was around,

171
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,439
he did everything to save our land.

172
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,479
So therefore,

173
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,839
I will do everything to get our land back.

174
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,639
However they badmouth me,

175
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,519
I will endure.

176
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,679
You found Orn in front of my house?

177
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,359
Yes.

178
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,959
I'm sorry I let them take Orn

179
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,759
I'm sorry I let you encounter something like this.

180
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,119
Who did it?

181
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,119
What do they want?

182
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,639
At first I thought they kidnapped you because they want money from Uncle Yut.

183
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,159
But after seeing you in the front,

184
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,439
I wasn't sure what those people actually want.

185
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,999
So you carried Orn into the house.

186
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,799
Yes.

187
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,359
But I am happy

188
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,759
if you still want Ran to be responsible for this matter.

189
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,999
But no damage was done on Orn.

190
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,839
I think we should focus on who did it.

191
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,479
Not let me take responsibility for something I didn't do.

192
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,359
I need to use the restroom.

193
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,479
<i>I only see her as a friend.</i>

194
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,599
<i>Not wife.</i>

195
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,439
<i>But no damage was done on Orn.</i>

196
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,959
<i>I think we should focus on who did it</i>

197
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,799
<i>Not let me take responsibility for something I didn't do.</i>

198
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,319
No damage was done?

199
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,519
You don't want to take responsibility

200
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,239
because you're scared your wife won't be okay with it.

201
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,119
What are you looking for?

202
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,479
You're so nosy!

203
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,759
Wait.

204
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,359
If Aunt Chu or P'Ran asks

205
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,359
say l went to take a walk outside.

206
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,079
Okay.

207
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,759
What does your people want now?

208
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,639
I'm only tolerating them

209
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,839
because of your crazy contract!

210
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,119
Khun Orn.

211
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,239
What contract?

212
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,679
It's between me and my husband.

213
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,479
It has nothing to do with you

214
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,479
-You want to know?
-Why else would l ask?

215
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,519
We vowed to love each other til death do us part

216
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,079
Once we die, we ask to reincarnate to be lovers again

217
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,159
I'll take my leave.

218
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,119
Okay.

219
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,359
You won't wait for Orn?

220
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,079
She's not back from using the restroom yet.

221
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,519
I have other business to do.

222
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,079
Can you drop her off then?

223
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,959
Sure. I'll have Ran drop her off

224
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,319
Thank you.

225
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,319
Go ahead.

226
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,799
Taew.

227
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,639
Have you seen Orn?

228
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,999
She did use the restroom but afterwards she said she was going to go take a walk.

229
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,519
What about Pim?

230
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,799
I think she went to help P'Jam shower the kids.

231
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,079
-Daddy!
-Daddy!

232
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,319
Have you eaten lunch yet?

233
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,999
Not yet.

234
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,119
Jam.

235
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,239
Is Pim upstairs?

236
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,519
She's not.

237
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,839
I'll be back.

238
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,839
I need to tell you something.

239
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,439
I don't want to listen.

240
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,599
Last night,

241
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,799
I was with P'Ran til almost morning

242
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,439
As if being with someone's husband wasn't enough

243
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,239
you have the nerves to come tell his wife?

244
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,839
How thick is your face right now?

245
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,639
The husband who you tricked into marrying you?

246
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,999
That's called shamelessly trapping the guy too.

247
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,599
I don't know what else you've done

248
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,279
to have P'Ran fall so hard for you like this.

249
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,759
What you asked,

250
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,639
what are you to Khun Ran?

251
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,519
Did he even say he still loves you?

252
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,439
Or are you being delusional thinking he still loves you?

253
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,759
Why else were we out all night?!

254
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,479
Huh?

255
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,999
With certain things, we don't need to say it.

256
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,239
Actions speaks volume

257
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,279
And last night.

258
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,679
I probably don't need to tell you

259
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,279
where we were and what we did.

260
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,519
As the wife, you probably don't want to hear about your husband sleeping with another woman.

261
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,439
He probably was just having fun.

262
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,439
In the end, he has to come home to his wife,

263
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,359
You failed at trapping him

264
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,959
You can't blame me for doing a better job at it

265
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,479
l will tell everyone about last night!

266
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,439
That P'Ran and I--

267
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,159
If you want to tell everyone you're a mistress then go ahead!

268
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,159
Look.

269
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,319
I came to ask you nicely to give P'Ran back to me

270
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,759
Just tell me how much you want!

271
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,319
You look smart.

272
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,119
But it's too bad you're dumb.

273
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,799
I'm Khun Ran's wife so that means I have money.

274
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,999
Why would I want your money?

275
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,159
However much I have these days is more than what you will offer any way.

276
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,479
It's good if you fall and die!

277
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,479
If you die, P'Ran and I will not have any third wheel!

278
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,159
Khun Orn!

279
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,119
What happened?

280
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,319
I came to explain to Pim about what happened last night.

281
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,279
I was worried she would misunderstand.

282
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,159
I don't want you guys to have any problems

283
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,639
But Pim didn't believe me

284
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,159
She's probably mad at me.

285
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,319
But it is my fault.

286
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,079
I pushed her when she slapped me without realizing how dangerous it was.

287
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,959
All you can do is says hit!

288
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,279
-You have a dirty heart!
-Pim stop!

289
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,519
That's enough!

290
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,479
I keep to myself!

291
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,679
But if anyone messes with me, even if you're God,

292
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,079
I will fight you!

293
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,839
Pim! Come with me right now!

294
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,919
Let go!

295
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,279
Let me go Khun Ran!

296
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,279
Let me go!

297
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,759
Hop on.

298
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,519
No!

299
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,439
Let me go!

300
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,959
Let me go you jerk!

301
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,279
Jerk!

302
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,999
Let go!

303
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,479
Jerk!

304
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,599
Easy

305
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,799
What happened last night?

306
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,439
What did you do for her to say that to me?

307
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,319
What kind of reconciliation was it?

308
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,839
You're mad?

309
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,759
Why are you asking?

310
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,239
What wife wouldn't get mad if their husband went out with another woman?

311
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,919
You must be really mad then.

312
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,839
I am mad!

313
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,839
She almost made me fall and die!

314
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,119
You went out with her last night.

315
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,639
When old flames collide,

316
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,839
of course there will be sparks.

317
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,839
If she gets pregnant, what will a wife like me do?

318
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,279
You're gonna stand there and smile?

319
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,839
What kind of person are you?

320
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,679
I like it

321
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,799
when you get jealous. It's diabolical.

322
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,999
Orn won't get pregnant.

323
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,519
But if you want to get pregnant,

324
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,159
you want to try it with me?

325
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,799
Tell me the truth

326
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,759
If you're going to tell me you just held her hand in bed for five to six hours,

327
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,959
no one is stupid enough to believe you!

328
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,439
Look.

329
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,999
Your ex girlfriend came to get her title as the mistress.

330
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,999
Pim.

331
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,479
If you're gonna take the horse, how will I get home?

332
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,359
With your mistress.

333
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,359
I'm bringing the sheep back into their pen.

334
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,359
Pim!

335
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,799
Your wife left you?

336
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,279
Give me that.

337
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,159
You're naughty now after you took your medicine.

338
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,759
I told you to take a nap but you refused.

339
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,279
Mommy is back!

340
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,159
Mommy brought the sheep too!

341
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,439
Kids!

342
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,519
Mommy!

343
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,279
-What are you guys doing here?
-We came to see the sheep!

344
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,919
Do you still feel hot?

345
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,959
Not anymore.

346
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,639
I came to check out the sheep so I can make my stuffed animal.

347
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,639
Oh okay.

348
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,519
Khun Pim.

349
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,839
Khun Nai has been waiting for you.

350
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,599
He came to see me?

351
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,319
Yes.

352
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,079
I saw him when I brought the twins here.

353
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,239
Kids!

354
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,079
You guys play with the sheep here first.

355
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,679
I'll put the horseback in the stable.

356
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,119
-See you at home okay?
-Okay

357
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,279
Why hasn't she put the horse back yet?

358
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,319
P'Ran.

359
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,079
I have something to tell you

360
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,279
If it's about last night

361
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,959
I thought we were clear?

362
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,079
Not that.

363
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,479
It's about Nus.

364
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,959
Nus?

365
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,959
What about Nus?

366
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,919
Well..

367
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,919
It's...

368
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,799
Nus...

369
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,639
Orn!

370
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,839
I want to be more than just a sister

371
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,839
Orn!

372
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,239
P'Ran!

373
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,519
I can only be a brother to you

374
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,919
But I love you.

375
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,119
I've loved you longer than Pim!

376
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,319
Pim has nothing. Why do you love her?

377
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,119
Orn.

378
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,239
We can't force our hearts to love or not love someone.

379
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,319
You should understand this well!

380
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,999
I didn't choose to love Pim.

381
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,919
I didn't choose not to love you either

382
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,439
I can't force myself not to love you either

383
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,639
Your water.

384
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,679
Thank you.

385
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,919
Pim went to the farm. She'll be back

386
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,279
Yes.

387
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,959
Hey.

388
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,759
Let me ask you Nai.

389
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,639
Don't you regret?

390
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,759
Regret what?

391
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,639
I know how you feel about Pim.

392
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,479
I sympathize you.

393
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,439
I actually sympathize you and Pim.

394
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,239
You sympathize me and Pim?

395
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,119
I'm old. I've seen a lot of things.

396
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,359
I think you should find an opportunity to talk to Pim.

397
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,999
I think she also feels uncomfortable.

398
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,759
She doesn't really want to be the daughter in law of this house.

399
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,359
Yes.

400
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,239
You say one thing

401
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,679
but does the opposite.

402
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,679
In the stable,you even...

403
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,159
Let your dad take you back instead.

404
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,119
Why are you here?

405
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,639
The person that rode you left you here?

406
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,919
Pim probably doesn't care.

407
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,839
You haven't told me yet

408
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,439
about Nus.

409
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,639
Nus called Lada

410
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,799
Called?

411
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,359
Yes.

412
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,279
I guess she's running out of money so she called to ask for her share from the sales

413
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,759
Here comes Pim.

414
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,799
Pim.

415
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,759
I had Lada make me an outfit for an event.

416
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,759
Can you go get it for me?

417
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,079
Sure.

418
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,439
Sorry to bother you P'Nai.

419
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,079
I'll take Pim.

420
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,679
Okay.

421
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,799
Shall we go?

422
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,279
Yes.

423
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,319
Where is Pim going?

424
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,679
Oh.

425
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,919
I don't know.

426
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,679
Pim came and saw Nai and said they were going somewhere.

427
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,159
I didn't want to intervene

428
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,999
Since our family knows Nai's family.

429
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,759
I can't look away.

430
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,279
-Let's go Orn.
-Where are you guys going?

431
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,759
To see Lada.

432
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,999
Nus called her.

433
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,959
Huh?!

434
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,799
Wait.

435
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,679
Nus called Lada?

436
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,519
Yes.

437
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,359
Pim and Nai are also heading to see Lada.

438
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,479
Can you go big on this one for me?

439
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,479
Make them break up

440
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,079
Yes.

441
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,119
Are you sure you can pay back the interest?

442
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,359
I can.

443
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,799
I will use the money to install more water system

444
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,799
If the water system is good

445
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,319
production will be abundant.

446
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,239
So you will pay me back when there's produce?

447
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,999
That's around three months?

448
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,599
Yes.

449
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,919
Jay.

450
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,639
Collect the money from him three months from now.

451
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,239
Okay.

452
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,279
I will pay you back in time.

453
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,959
Thank you so much.

454
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,519
Jay.

455
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,799
In the contract it states correct...

456
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,079
it's principal and interest?

457
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,519
Yes

458
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,759
Hello Uncle Yut.

459
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,359
Tin.

460
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,799
We need to talk.

461
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,479
How many batch for this collection?

462
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,639
Twelve.

463
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,359
Quickly pack it up for the customers and ship them.

464
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,359
Can you take care of that?

465
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,359
Thank you.

466
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,479
Da.

467
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,679
Oh hey Nai.

468
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,439
Why are you here with...

469
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,479
Pim?

470
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,959
Khun Chu told me to come get her outfit for her.

471
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,359
That's right. I heard there were more than one.

472
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,999
She feels considerate if you delivered it for her

473
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,599
-A lot of them?
-Yes.

474
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,999
Wait here then.

475
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,999
One second please.

476
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,359
-Hello.
- Aunt Chu?

477
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,679
It's just...

478
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,079
Nai and Pim are here to get your outfits?

479
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,479
Oh I told them to

480
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,119
-But--
-I haven't ordered yet right?

481
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,959
Yes.

482
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,479
Can you pack something up?

483
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,479
You know my size already

484
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,999
Just give me the total and I'll wire you the money.

485
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,679
Sure thing.

486
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,159
Okay.

487
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,519
Yes.

488
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,479
What outfit do I pack?

489
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,119
I did it.

490
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,839
But I didn't do anything to Orn

491
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,239
I didn't even know the person my subordinates brought was Orn.

492
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,839
They kidnapped the wrong person?

493
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,679
Who did you wanted to kidnap?

494
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,079
Pim.

495
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,159
Ran's wife Pim?

496
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,079
Yes.

497
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,639
You like Pim?

498
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,599
I think the correct phrase is..

499
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,239
I want Pim, Ran's wife instead.

500
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,479
Now...

501
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,319
we are on the same page

502
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,639
<i>Give P'Ran back to me.</i>

503
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,999
<i>And you take Nai.</i>

504
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,239
<i>Isn't it better for both of us to win?</i>

505
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,759
<i>I want both of them</i>

506
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,119
<i>One is to have as my husband at home</i>

507
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,279
<i>The other is for to drive me around.</i>

508
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,999
<i>Keep quiet if you don't want to die!</i>

509
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,079
<i>Pim is in your car.</i>

510
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,959
<i>She's in my car</i>

511
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,639
<i>so that makes her mine.</i>

512
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:53,200
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

513
00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:01,660
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

514
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:07,060
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

515
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,600
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

516
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:19,040
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
