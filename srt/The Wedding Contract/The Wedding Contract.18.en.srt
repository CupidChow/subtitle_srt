00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,320
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,360
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,760
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,360
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,600
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,758
-Let's make a herd of sheep
-Okay

13
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,679
Pim!

14
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,479
It's done!

15
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,199
What is that?

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,799
Why sheep of course.

17
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,479
I think...

18
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,999
you should go help P'Jam cut the fabric instead.

19
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,159
Pim.

20
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,279
Yes Ma'am?

21
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,399
Step out with me.

22
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,759
I need to talk to you

23
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,399
I've seen you like this since school days.

24
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,839
Until now,

25
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,239
you still refuse to say that you like him?

26
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,239
Nai?

27
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,439
Yeah!

28
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,039
Who did you think I was talking about?

29
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,959
Can you believe that

30
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,999
when Pim got kidnapped in my shop,

31
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,119
was hesitant to call anyone?

32
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,599
Hey.

33
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,599
So that means

34
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,599
you want that girl to disappear too?

35
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,079
But in the end i called.

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,519
If it was me,

37
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,519
I would have let them kidnap her!

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,999
I think so too.

39
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,879
Let's go waste our breath by doing some shopping to kill boredom.

40
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,399
Fine.

41
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,599
Let's go.

42
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,759
Hey Invite Nai to come too.

43
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,559
Invite what?

44
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,679
I called him this morning to have coffee with me,

45
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,078
but he said he had errands.

46
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,199
Can you make about 500 of that stuffed animal for me?

47
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,039
Pardon?

48
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,199
I want about 500 of that stuffed sheep.

49
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,439
Can you make it for me?

50
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,079
I'll pay you.

51
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,399
You're not doing it for free.

52
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,799
I think I can.

53
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,039
In that case, I'll pay for the materials needed.

54
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,479
Okay.

55
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,239
Where did you learn how to make it?

56
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,079
You must have worked at a stuffed animal factory before right?

57
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,399
Yes.

58
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,239
It was an exported stuffed animal factory.

59
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,639
Why did you quit?

60
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,079
The factory burned down.

61
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,999
Oh.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,999
Where are your parents?

63
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,759
They got stuck in the factory that was burning.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,319
Your whole family worked at a factory.

65
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,799
I don't hate you.

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,879
Grandpa Ru j was a good person.

67
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,399
But a factory girl and farm owner are different.

68
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,319
You understand what I'm referring to right?

69
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,639
Yes.

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,079
Excuse me then.

71
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,279
I have to go buy the things for the stuffed animal.

72
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,999
Oh.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,799
I called Danai to take you already

74
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,279
I can have P'Toei take me

75
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,599
He's here.

76
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,999
Hello Auntie.

77
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,719
Hello.

78
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,839
Shall we go Pim?

79
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,519
Yes.

80
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,079
Let's go.

81
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,319
You can get down from here so the walk won't be too long

82
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,759
I'll go park the car.

83
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,519
I'll come back and help you carry the things.

84
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,479
Okay.

85
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,679
Scammer?

86
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,399
Fine I'll answer.

87
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,079
For your sake of being persistent.

88
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,159
Hello.

89
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,919
Can you come out to see me?

90
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,399
Go lie to someone else.

91
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,919
I don't have money for you to scam.

92
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,799
Pim.

93
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,319
It's me.

94
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,479
P'Vee!

95
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,679
Pim.

96
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,199
Where did she go?

97
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,599
lam back!

98
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,798
Sorry it took so long. There was a lot of stuff.

99
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,679
Where should we go eat after shopping?

100
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,759
Up to you.

101
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,919
How about Italian food?

102
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,279
Hey.

103
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,999
The one about to get in the taxi cab is Pim right?

104
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,319
Yes.

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,199
Where is she going?

106
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,399
Go to hell for all I care.

107
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,599
I'll tell you the directions.

108
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,639
Does anyone know that you're back?

109
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,839
No.

110
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,279
I'm scared they might come collect the money if they found out.

111
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,919
Why did you come back then?

112
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,279
I feel guilty for abandoning you.

113
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,719
So I came to take you with me.

114
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,199
But if I leave with you.

115
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,639
he will take Grandpa's land forever.

116
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,599
We'll find a way to get it back.

117
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,439
But come see me first.

118
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,959
Yeah.

119
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,479
Did we do a lot of karma in our past life?

120
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,399
Following me like you're my bedeviled.

121
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,919
Where is she going?

122
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,479
That's the way out of town.

123
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,279
It's not the way back to P'Ran's house

124
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,839
What a pain in the ass.

125
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,839
I have to spend money buying new clothes.

126
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,079
P'Vee?

127
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,279
Sorry, the number you dialed can not be connected.

128
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,079
Last time I messed up.

129
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,839
This time I won't mess up

130
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,599
Let me go!

131
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,039
Help!

132
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,119
Let go!

133
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,159
-Help! Help!
-Gag her!

134
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,359
-Let go!
-Be quiet!

135
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,399
Boss is on the way

136
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,479
I heard he brought someone to see you too.

137
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,799
Let's go.

138
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,639
Where did she go?

139
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,439
Again?!

140
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,159
I just went to park the car for about ten minutes and when I came back, Pim wasn't there.

141
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,799
What do we do?

142
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,559
If we call the police, Ran isn't here though.

143
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,879
May be Pim decided on her own to run away.

144
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,479
Runaway?

145
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,759
Yes.

146
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,479
Like I told you before.

147
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,399
Pim isn't happy to be living here with Ran much.

148
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,679
It won't be strange for her to run away.

149
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,799
But people were around. Who would dare take her in broad daylight?

150
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,599
If she screams, people would turn around already

151
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,599
But Auntie,

152
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,599
Pim didn't take anything.

153
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,159
Only her purse.

154
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,599
That's all she brought with her.

155
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,599
It's not strange to leave with that either.

156
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,959
Hey Srinuan.

157
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,439
What's there to eat?

158
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,319
Why didn't you come eat when other people were eating in the public kitchen?

159
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,199
Look.

160
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,439
It was Boss's order.

161
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,319
Don't complain so much!

162
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,439
Maybe you missed lunch and so you're using Boss as an excuse.

163
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,479
Boss isn't home.

164
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,399
Who told you to go do what?

165
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,079
Go kidnap Pim.

166
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,679
Idiot!

167
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,919
You have a big mouth!

168
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,999
Alright.

169
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,359
I'll make you something to eat.

170
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,839
So you guys can get back to work.

171
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,279
When will Boss be back?

172
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,399
This evening.

173
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,079
Tonight, make an extra box of food too.

174
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,079
After you eat, you will carry one in your mouth too?

175
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,279
Go cook!

176
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,479
Fine.

177
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,799
Vira!

178
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,759
Let go!

179
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,999
Excuse me!

180
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,799
Move!

181
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,599
Can you hold for a sec Auntie?

182
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,159
Go! Drive!

183
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,999
What is it?

184
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,799
That was close. How did he get here?

185
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,039
Pim is missing.

186
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,599
What?!

187
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,039
How?!

188
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,599
Didn't I tell you

189
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,599
not to let her go anywhere with Nai?

190
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,999
She wanted to go. How can I stop her?

191
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,759
I'm heading back today.

192
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,078
Nai.

193
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,799
What's he doing sitting here?

194
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,399
What's going on?

195
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,598
Why are you sitting here?

196
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,559
Waiting for you.

197
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,879
Why didn't you, call us to come?

198
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,879
Yeah.

199
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,919
I wanted to do some thinking too.

200
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,799
Let's go inside.

201
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,598
Yeah.

202
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,039
What's the matter Nai?

203
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,359
Pim is missing

204
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,039
Missing?!

205
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,879
What do you mean?

206
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,399
It means she's missing!

207
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,519
What?

208
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,879
We just saw her today.

209
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,759
Where?!

210
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,239
Well...

211
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,959
on the road.

212
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,399
The road?

213
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,359
What road?

214
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,879
Um..

215
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,319
Maybe she went somewhere and didn't tell you.

216
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,079
Today we--

217
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,759
I took Pim to buy some things today.

218
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,239
But Pim didn't tell me she was going someplace else.

219
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,439
Oh.

220
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,999
The errand you mentioned was..

221
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,039
taking Pim shopping.

222
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,639
Yeah.

223
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,199
Forget it.

224
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,159
You said you saw Pim. Where did you see her?

225
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,799
The intersection.

226
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,719
Before the entrance to the market.

227
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,279
She was in a cab.

228
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,879
That means she may not have been kidnapped.

229
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,159
But it might have been what Aunt Chu said.

230
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,199
What did Aunt Chu say?

231
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,679
Pim ran away on her own.

232
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,319
Ran keeps on calling.

233
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,319
He keeps asking if we found her yet.

234
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,679
Gosh!

235
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,039
She could have told us she was leaving.

236
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,799
If she told me, I would have let her go.
She didn't have to run away like this.

237
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,639
What time does Khun Ran want me to pick him up from the airport?

238
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,799
He has n't called to tell me yet.

239
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,439
What?! You scared the shit out of me!

240
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,879
You just suddenly got up.

241
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,119
I'm going to go pray.

242
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,879
Pray?

243
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,399
Yes.

244
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,799
Come on P'Toei.

245
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,399
Hurry!

246
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,159
Okay's Fine.

247
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,279
Let's go!

248
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,999
It's awkward having her around.

249
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,799
Now we're all stressing once she left.

250
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,719
Get up and come eat.

251
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,199
Hey!

252
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,799
Get up and come eat.

253
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,519
Help!

254
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,199
I told you to eat!

255
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,039
Not for you to scream!

256
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,799
Here.

257
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,519
Eat.

258
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,199
So you'll have some energy.

259
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,759
Don't be so stubborn

260
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,159
I can not kill you

261
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,839
but I can physically hurt you.

262
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,319
This intersection?

263
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,479
Yeah.

264
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,199
Which way did she turn?

265
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,999
Over there.

266
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,199
- The right?
- Yeah.

267
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,479
Excuse me.

268
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:37,999
Yes?

269
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,719
Have you seen the person in the photo?

270
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,999
She's about this tall.

271
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,799
Try looking again in case you'll remember.

272
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,559
Da.

273
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,999
Can you come with me?

274
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,799
To where?

275
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,279
To look for Pim.

276
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,159
I'm just...

277
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,439
worried about Pim.

278
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,079
I just want to know which way she went.

279
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,479
Have you seen the person in the photo?

280
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,559
Never.

281
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,999
Thank you.

282
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,559
Well?

283
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,239
No one has seen her.

284
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,919
I told you it'll be difficult

285
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,279
Who would have seen her?

286
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,279
She was in a cab and who knows where she got off

287
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,319
Nai, just stop looking for her.

288
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,159
You won't find her.

289
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,799
If she wants to come back, she will.

290
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,439
She's probably full by now

291
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:37,839
Hey!

292
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,079
Where did she go?!

293
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,279
Where are you going?

294
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,079
Why didn't you wait for me?

295
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,479
I made the effort to rush over here to see you.

296
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,479
Let's talk first.

297
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,519
Let me go!

298
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,599
Someone came to see you.

299
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,999
Don't go yet.

300
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,399
We need to talk for a bit.

301
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,599
Go!

302
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,359
P'Vee!

303
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,599
Pim!

304
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,279
Help me Pim!

305
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,279
What happened P'Vee?

306
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,399
You need to thank me

307
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,359
for letting you reconnect with your family.

308
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,999
Are you happy?

309
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,999
Dear Lord and Holy Spirits,

310
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,719
I want no harm done on Pim.

311
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,399
I just don't want her to be my niece in law.

312
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,479
If Pim comes back safe and sound

313
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,479
I will offer you fruits

314
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,039
ducks, chickens,

315
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,279
along with redeeming the lives of cows and buffaloes.

316
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,999
Sadhu!

317
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,079
Oh.

318
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,359
What are you doing here?

319
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,359
I don't know.

320
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,599
You don't know?

321
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,719
Taew invited us to come.

322
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,879
She said to come pray with you.

323
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,079
Oh.

324
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,479
You all have your palms together.

325
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,999
What did you ask for?

326
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,079
Once you ask, you must offer.

327
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,319
If you don't offer,

328
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,399
they will go and break your neck.

329
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,719
You tricked me into selling your sister.

330
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,199
You took my money and just left

331
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,399
You took no responsibility of your sister...

332
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,679
-marrying Ran!
-P'Vee!

333
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,999
That's enough!

334
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,479
Fine.

335
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,599
Then sign it.

336
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,279
Sign the contract of giving me your grandfather's land.

337
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,279
Vee got the money already.

338
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,679
But I haven't received anything.

339
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,199
Or do you need to be my wife first?

340
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,879
Then this conversation would be a lot easier.

341
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,799
P'Vee!

342
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,039
Help me P'Vee!

343
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,199
-Pim!
- P'Vee!

344
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,279
Pim!

345
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,279
-Pim!
-P'Vee!

346
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,239
P'Vee!

347
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,599
-Help me P'Vee!
-Pim!

348
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,799
Pim!

349
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,919
You eventually came to die huh?

350
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,879
Let me go!

351
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,119
I said let me go! Help!

352
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,199
You better watch it!

353
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,159
You hurt me!

354
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,079
Right here you idiot!

355
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,919
Watch out!

356
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,199
Didn't I warn you?

357
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,799
Not to mess with Pim.

358
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,759
This time

359
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,479
I will have you arrested.

360
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,479
I'm not scared that you'll call the cops on me.

361
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,519
Be prepared to go to jail.

362
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,359
Toei!

363
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,119
You hurt me!

364
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,159
I hurt myself on this one.

365
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,559
Why aren't you going?

366
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,919
Take P'Vee with us.

367
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,999
He did this much to you

368
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,799
and you want to take him with us?

369
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,759
Yes.

370
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,399
Toei.

371
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,079
Yes?

372
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,959
Burden.

373
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,439
Go.

374
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,119
Hey.

375
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,759
You need to be careful wherever you go.

376
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,079
Can't you see you got everyone else troubled by you?

377
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,119
That's your brother Pim.

378
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,359
Yes.

379
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,639
Is Pim alone not troubling enough for you?

380
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,599
I came to tell you

381
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,079
I'm having him work here to pay off his debt.

382
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,679
Are you sure Ran?!

383
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,639
Yes.

384
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,159
Toei.

385
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,599
Go find a room for him to stay in.

386
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,439
Okay

387
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,759
When does he start work?

388
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,239
Have him start working at the farm.

389
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,678
Khun Ran.

390
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,439
The state he's in right now,

391
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,519
can he manage to work?

392
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,678
If he has to crawl to work

393
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,479
then let him crawl!

394
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,959
Go.

395
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,959
Can you manage to walk?

396
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,638
Can I go sleep with my brother?

397
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,799
No!

398
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,079
How many times have I told you

399
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,759
not to go outside alone if I'm not there with you?!

400
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,158
I'm sorry.

401
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,839
But l had to go buy the things to make the sheep toy for your aunt.

402
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,079
Geez!

403
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,279
But you wanted to step out with Nai alone.

404
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,839
Don't blame my aunt for this.

405
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,599
If you didn't want to go out.

406
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,599
no one can drag you out!

407
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,359
What's the matter?

408
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,479
You couldn't refrain yourself once you see a man?

409
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,279
Think before you say something

410
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,759
I did think

411
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,279
that's why I'm asking you.

412
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,679
You thought already?

413
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,679
What did you say?

414
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,079
Nothing.

415
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,159
You asked me, "You thought already?"

416
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,439
If you heard it.

417
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,119
why ask?

418
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,359
I asked because l want to know if you dare say it to me or not.

419
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,679
Fine.

420
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,279
I said what you said just now,

421
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,279
that was thought out already?

422
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,479
For you not to be considerate of other people's feelings!

423
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,359
How do you want me to understand it then?

424
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,799
I told you not to go out with Nai.

425
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,999
But once I'm not here,

426
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,799
you leave with him.

427
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,359
It's just for one year. Can't you just endure it?

428
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,599
Once the contract is over,

429
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,799
whoever's wife you wanna be, go ahead!

430
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,839
I actually want that stupid contract to end today or even tomorrow!

431
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,599
So I don't have to endure a thoughtless,

432
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,479
disrespectful, unreasonable person like you!

433
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,119
What a shame.

434
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,479
There's ten months left of the contract.

435
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,919
You have to endure me for a long time.

436
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,119
As for Vee,

437
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,599
while he is staying here

438
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,799
he has to work for me.

439
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,479
For helping Nus run away with a man.

440
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,239
Do it yourself.

441
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,279
How fortunate that Khun Ran is accommodating you.

442
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,439
He should have left you there and not take up space over here!

443
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,439
You're just a farmer and a servant.

444
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,919
Why are you complaining?!

445
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,119
-You bastard!
- Calm down Uncle!

446
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,159
- Let me go!
-Calm down!

447
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,839
I won't be calm! Didn't you see?!

448
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,279
Did he use his mouth or ass to speak?! Didn't you see?!

449
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,959
Calm down Uncle!

450
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,639
The previous person...

451
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,639
you already messed up his face

452
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,040
In this state,

453
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,799
he'll just end up dying.

454
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,799
Alright fine!

455
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,839
I'll do it myself!

456
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,839
It's a small task!

457
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,519
-Hurry!
-Move out the way!

458
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,159
Now he runs fast.

459
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,919
Now he won't dare boss us around.

460
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,319
Yeah. By the way,

461
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,279
who did you say I beat up?

462
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,839
No one.

463
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,759
I said it to threaten him.

464
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,999
Usually you get slap by Aunt Noi.

465
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,839
Yes.

466
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,679
Why did you say it?

467
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,119
It's my weak spot too you idiot.

468
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:15,799
Do it properly.

469
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,199
Yes Mom?

470
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,639
Three to four pants is enough.

471
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,119
Have him wash it himself.

472
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,679
Okay.

473
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,119
Luckily someone told him where Khun Pim is at.

474
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,519
-Boss is here!
-Help!

475
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,639
-Help us!
-How are you guys?

476
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,599
Go! Hurry!

477
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,799
-This way!
-Go! Hurry!

478
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,839
-Go! Go!
-Are you okay?

479
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,959
Help each other get out of here!

480
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,599
Go! Get out of here!

481
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,999
Please help the chairman and his wife!

482
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,839
Nuan!

483
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,439
Khun Tin is home.

484
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,919
Go turn on the Ac.

485
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,519
Okay.

486
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,079
I guess you're asleep already.

487
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:08,439
<i>♫ Today I have you beside me ♫</i>

488
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,959
<i>♫ You were with me every day ♫</i>

489
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,159
<i>♫ As the days passed,the more anxious I became ♫</i>

490
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,759
<i>♫ Afraid that I will have feelings for you ♫</i>

491
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,279
<i>♫ I had to stop my heart ♫</i>

492
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:37,479
<i>♫ No matter how much I love you, that's all I can give ♫</i>

493
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,599
<i>♫ Since there will be a day where we must part ways ♫</i>

494
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,759
What I told you,

495
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,079
I'm just worried.

496
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,599
You know?

497
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:59,079
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

498
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:05,079
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

499
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,239
<i>♫ Because l know that one day l will have to wake up ♫</i>

500
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:16,119
<i>♫ When I open my eyes,you might not be there that day ♫</i>

501
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,599
What is it Pim?!

502
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,479
-Is something wrong?!
-You're gonna ask?!

503
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,159
Were you pretending to sleep?!

504
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,639
Who?! Who?!

505
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,959
Who?! Who was pretending to sleep?!

506
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,919
You! Who else?!

507
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,319
Me?!

508
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,359
Yeah!

509
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,239
You took the body pillow out and crossed over to cuddle me all night!

510
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,679
Did you do more than that?

511
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,159
Tell me!

512
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,639
Hey.

513
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,479
If I really did something to you,

514
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,519
wouldn't you be naked right now?

515
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,639
You should know it yourself

516
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,359
How can someone not notice they got taken advantage of?

517
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,759
You didn't take advantage

518
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,999
but you're sure you didn't do anything that...

519
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,599
That what?

520
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,839
-That you--
-Alright.

521
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,519
Whatever you're thinking, I didn't do it.

522
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,999
Okay?

523
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,959
But regardless, you broke the rule.

524
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,119
You took the body pillow out and crossed over to cuddle me all night!

525
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,119
It doesn't state in the contract

526
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,759
that I can't cuddle

527
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,439
Or kiss you.

528
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,079
Khun Ran!

529
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,599
If I really were to do something to you,

530
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,159
I rather do it when you're conscious like this.

531
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,919
It's rather more exciting.

532
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,679
<i>Hey Nuan.</i>

533
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,359
<i>Where were you yesterday?</i>

534
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,639
<i>Now you brought your brother to leech off of us.</i>

535
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,079
<i>You're trying to suck all our money aren't you?</i>

536
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,799
<i>My brother and I don't want anyone's possession for free. </i>

537
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,279
<i>In exchange for what though?</i>

538
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,079
<i>With your body?</i>

539
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,439
<i>You can do this.</i>

540
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,519
<i>I'm about to give up!</i>

541
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,599
Holding hands?<i></i>

542
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,439
<i>In just a few months, I no longer have to play his fake wife</i>

543
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:01,000
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

544
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:09,460
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

545
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:14,860
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

546
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,400
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

547
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:26,840
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
