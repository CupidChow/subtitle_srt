1
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,520
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,560
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,720
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,120
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,960
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,360
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,000
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,560
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,640
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,800
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,920
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,399
Thank you for letting Pim come home safe.

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,679
Sadhu!

14
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,479
l didn't pray with you guys

15
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,319
so why do I have to participate?

16
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,999
I prayed on your behalf.

17
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,159
You won't do it for other things

18
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,279
but you wanted to do for this.

19
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,679
Will you dance or not?

20
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,399
No dance?

21
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,319
There's no music! I've been waiting too long!

22
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,199
Next time before you pray or make offerings, take me into consideration.

23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,199
I know what embarrassment is.

24
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,519
Why are you complaining?!

25
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,679
Go! Scoot over!

26
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,999
Okay. We're about to dance now

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,799
Sadhu! Sadhu!

28
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,999
Concentrate on the dance.

29
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,799
-P'Jam.
-Yes?

30
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,079
What are they doing?

31
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,599
Making a votive offering.

32
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,999
Mommy.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,599
They're making a votive offering.

34
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,879
Yes.

35
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,039
Grandma. Why are they doing it?

36
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,799
So that our house is free from problems and chaos.

37
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,839
Right now,we have a hapless person hanging around our house.

38
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,159
Who? P'Orn?

39
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,279
No.

40
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,479
Don't call P'Orn that.

41
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,879
Her feelings might be hurt if she hears you say that.

42
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,079
Pim.

43
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,679
Where are you going?

44
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,079
The kitchen.

45
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,839
Ever since Saran married you,

46
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,719
Saengtawan Farm has had so many enemies.

47
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,799
Do you realize you've been causing problems for everyone?

48
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,879
I do.

49
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,679
But seeing you come home safe and sound

50
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,319
makes me at ease.

51
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,799
But I don't want you to misunderstand

52
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,879
that I'm okay with you living here

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,039
as my nephew's wife.

54
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,079
Now you brought your brother to leech off of us.

55
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,399
You're trying to suck all our money aren't you?

56
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,079
One person wasn't enough

57
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,279
and now you bring your brother.

58
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,119
P'Vee will be working here in exchange for food and shelter.

59
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,479
My brother and I don't want anyone's possession for free.

60
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,279
Oh really?

61
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,159
And you living here as a tumor,

62
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,399
what exchange are you doing?

63
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,999
With your body?

64
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,599
If that's the case,

65
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,599
you're really not living here for free like you say.

66
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,319
You're not awake yet?

67
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,559
Fine.

68
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,799
You did so much to your sister

69
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,159
and you're able to fall asleep at night?

70
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,479
Hey!

71
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,399
What the hell?!

72
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,559
Get up right now!

73
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,679
Go meet me at the horse stable!

74
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,799
Don't make me have to repeat myself.

75
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,399
Wow! Are you crazy?!

76
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,879
What sane person wakes up people this way?!

77
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,239
You jerk!

78
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,399
Go, go. Let's go eat

79
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,999
Next time don't include me in your offering.

80
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,479
Speaking of which,

81
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,639
you can dance!

82
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,559
Because I'm good with my hands.

83
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,599
Look there!

84
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,119
What?

85
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,479
Don't scream or else your dad will hear you.

86
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,719
Dad!

87
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,199
Ew!

88
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,959
Toei.

89
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,879
Stop flirting with my daughter.

90
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,839
And you just stood there.

91
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,799
Stop trying to gain personal benefit little by little

92
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,879
Go wash your face so you can come eat!

93
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,038
So we can head to the corn field afterwards.

94
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,719
Bastard!

95
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,559
What are you guys playing?

96
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,479
Stop playing around with the kids.

97
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,919
I had goosebumps.

98
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,279
Oh.

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,679
Something must have happened.

100
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,999
Probably got scolded by Khun Chu.

101
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,039
Pim.

102
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,679
What's wrong?

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,079
Can I eat herewith you guys?

104
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,199
Of course

105
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,959
Why can't you?

106
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,239
You used to come here to eat plenty of times.

107
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,119
Why are you crying?

108
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,639
Pim.

109
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,039
What's wrong dear?

110
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,159
You can do it.

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,359
Don't cry dear.

112
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,759
Aren't you making me work too much?

113
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,239
You won't let me eat.

114
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,839
Compared to what you did,

115
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,559
this is considered little.

116
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,919
If you're mad regarding Nus's situation,

117
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,879
go lash it out on Vira!

118
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,599
Not lash out on me like this!

119
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,519
Because l...

120
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,159
saw how you sell your sister for money!

121
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,439
Why do you care so much about Pim?

122
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,599
Pim is my sister.

123
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,879
I can sell her however I want.

124
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,759
It has nothing to do with you!

125
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,319
I am involved.

126
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,319
am very much involved!

127
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,039
Because right now Pim is my wife!

128
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,519
And I'm the one

129
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,199
that paid Tinnamai back the money for you!

130
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,079
As for the land,

131
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,879
Grandpa Ruj sold it to me.

132
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,439
You want me to work to pay off the debt?

133
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,639
There's no contract whatsoever!

134
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,039
I won't do it.

135
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,199
Tinnamai getting fooled like that,

136
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,199
I don't think he's gonna let you walk around freely in this town.

137
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,159
As soon as you step out of this farm,

138
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,839
Tinnamai will kill you.

139
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,559
But if you don't believe me,

140
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,359
you want to leave...

141
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,399
be my guest!

142
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,039
Watch him.

143
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,519
Have him finish the job

144
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,199
Once he's done,

145
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,839
have him go cut the corn.

146
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,919
Yes sir.

147
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,799
Tell him.

148
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,399
You tell him.

149
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,079
No you!

150
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,559
What is it?

151
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,119
It's Pim.

152
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,919
What about Pim?

153
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,639
She went crying in the kitchen. I don't know what's wrong.

154
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,959
Where is she right now?

155
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,079
She went with Taew.

156
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,199
They went to take the sheep to go eat.

157
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,919
Does Boss really love Pim?

158
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,439
I guess so.

159
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,839
Why would he marry her if he doesn't?

160
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,399
Right Dad?

161
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,319
I love Taew too

162
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,839
Can I marry Taew?

163
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,839
Who's your dad?

164
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,879
I will not give up.

165
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,599
Regardless Taew will be my husband.

166
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,879
That's correct!

167
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,679
She's mine!

168
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,239
You were crying

169
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,959
but you said there's nothing.

170
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,879
Who would believe you Pim?

171
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,439
Khun Chu scolded you didn't she?

172
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,359
What's it about this time?

173
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,799
Everything.

174
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,439
Khun Chu has a bad mouth.

175
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,879
But she has a kind heart.

176
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,519
Don't mind her.

177
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,799
Yesterday when we couldn't find you,

178
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,399
she felt uneasy and went to pray for you to come home safely.

179
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,199
Prayed for my return

180
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,159
so she can scold me again?

181
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,479
Not at all.

182
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,119
Khun Pim, Khun Danai is here to see you

183
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,359
Gosh! And this dude doesn't realize how much trouble he's caused.

184
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,279
He's here again.

185
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,639
I'll take off then.

186
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,199
Thank you.

187
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,199
Don't cry anymore r Got it?

188
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,679
Pim.

189
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,399
I'm sorry I didn't take good care of you.

190
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,159
That's why the incident happened.

191
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,479
You can't be blamed.

192
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,359
It was me

193
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,999
that was gullible.

194
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,399
In a few months,

195
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,919
we will have our land back.

196
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,159
Just endure a little bit longer guys.

197
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,639
But even if we get it back,

198
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,679
we won't have the money to build a house.

199
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,199
What are we gonna eat with no money?

200
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,399
Pim.

201
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,799
If you want to sell the sheep,

202
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,039
I et me know.

203
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,319
Pardon?

204
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,759
Well,

205
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,759
I want to try raising sheep

206
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,399
I have a small farm.

207
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,999
If I have sheep, I won't need to cut the grass.

208
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,759
If!sell them,

209
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,879
how much will l get?

210
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,159
About...

211
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,439
80,000

212
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,239
I'll sell them then.

213
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,239
Really?

214
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,519
It's a deal.

215
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,239
But you have to promise

216
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,159
you will take good care of them.

217
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,919
I guarantee you

218
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,199
and I promise.

219
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,199
Holding hands?

220
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,199
How shameless

221
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,679
that you still came here.

222
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,999
Why not?

223
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,479
Yesterday,

224
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,199
you let Tinnamai kidnap Pim.

225
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,119
Did you felt any sense of concern?

226
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,999
Don't blame P'Nai!

227
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,559
P'Nai had nothing to do with it.

228
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,519
I left on my own. I got myself kidnapped.

229
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,039
You're defending him?

230
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,879
I'm just telling the truth

231
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,439
It's true Pim went with me.

232
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,799
I messed up.

233
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,239
I let Pim out of my sight

234
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,199
But don't worry.

235
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,719
From now on,

236
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,199
Pim will always be in my sight.

237
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,879
I am happy

238
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,519
to look after Pim.

239
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,519
Just Pim alone,

240
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,999
I can take care of her.

241
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,799
Let's go.

242
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,479
Why did you have to defend him like that?

243
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,919
He didn't do anything wrong.

244
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,199
He took you out

245
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,679
when I didn't allow it.

246
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,759
How is that not wrong?!

247
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,719
Wasn't it because you left with him that you got kidnapped?!

248
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,479
Why aren't you saying anything?

249
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,599
Promise me first

250
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,959
that you won't hurt P'Vee.

251
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,599
What does Vee have to do with it?

252
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,119
Fine I promise.

253
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,479
He called me.

254
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,919
He told me to go see him.

255
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,079
He said...

256
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,279
He said he came back and l went to go see him a t his rental house.

257
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,119
I didn't know it was Khun Tin's plan.

258
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,599
Vee.

259
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,679
You joined hands with Tin.

260
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,799
He pointed a gun at my head

261
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,359
If I didn't do it, I would have died.

262
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,599
Then go be my witness

263
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,799
I'll handle this for you

264
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,119
I don't want to wait.

265
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,959
I want you to handle this today.

266
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,399
These two are the witnesses?

267
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,919
Yes.

268
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,679
Tell him.

269
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,879
Yes.

270
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,599
Just because you have witnesses, it doesn't mean you can put someone in jail.

271
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,039
The witness's statement must also match the evidence.

272
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,599
I hope you understand

273
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,399
I am happy to take you to go collect evidence at the scene,

274
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,879
before you bring Tin in for questioning

275
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,479
Search everywhere.

276
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,719
Yes sir!

277
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,239
Try looking on the second floor.

278
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,559
Let's go.

279
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,879
Follow me Lieutenant.

280
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,719
Excuse me Inspector.

281
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,439
Nothing found downstairs

282
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,279
Good.

283
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,799
-Search everywhere
-Yes sir.

284
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,319
No such evidence was found

285
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,279
The whole house looks perfectly fine

286
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,839
They must've have known beforehand.

287
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,919
The police did come Boss.

288
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,039
You cleaned up everything?

289
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,519
I guarantee you the police won't trace it back to us.

290
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,999
Good.

291
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,679
Thanks for letting me know.

292
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,679
If you get caught.

293
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,879
you're gonna mention my name too.

294
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,879
I won't do that.

295
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,839
Good thing Uncle's subordinate came to let me know

296
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,879
that the police were on their way to that house.

297
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,559
But I want to know

298
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,039
how did Ran know that I put Pim there?

299
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,759
Hey Nuan.

300
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,199
Yes?

301
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,319
Where were you yesterday?

302
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,999
At the worker's house.

303
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,519
You sure?

304
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,559
Yes.

305
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,559
Even when P'Ran wasn't home.

306
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,599
you couldn't do anything to Pim.

307
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,479
If someone hadn't told Ran,

308
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,119
Pim would be sleeping in my bed by now.

309
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,679
If it wasn't for me,

310
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,879
you would be sleeping in jail by now

311
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,999
I'm leaving now

312
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,599
P'Ran is back.

313
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,439
I need to go do my job.

314
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,999
Come, come.

315
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,199
Is this all the female workers we have Noi?

316
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,559
Yes.

317
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,239
Pim is here. Pim.

318
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,599
I want everyone to come help Pim make the stuffed animal sheep.

319
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,359
It will be sold at the association banquet.

320
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,599
Everyone will work at the farm until noon.

321
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,159
After that you will all come help Pim.

322
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,039
Pim will teach you how

323
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,279
You start tomorrow.

324
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,679
Oh.

325
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,119
But today I want you to go clean up the warehouse where the sheep were staying at.

326
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,119
That's where your workstation will be at.

327
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,799
Taew and Noi can go help Pim too.

328
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,959
Yes ma'am.

329
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,879
-Alright, go on.
-Let's go.

330
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,199
If your family had about ten people,

331
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,199
all ten of you would be here leeching off of us.

332
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,479
Vee will be doing the jobs for the workers you told to go help Pim.

333
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,159
Hey Pim.

334
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,519
If he wants me to do the jobs for those people, I can't.

335
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,079
Well you're just gonna have to.

336
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,839
You haven't lived here for long

337
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,399
and you're already taking his side?

338
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,639
No.

339
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,479
No?

340
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,599
But you're agreeing with him about everything.

341
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,199
I just agree

342
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,759
that you should do some work to pay off the debt you've created.

343
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,799
Not just burden me with all the debt

344
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,919
Pim! Pim! Pim!

345
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,679
In such a hurry.

346
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,799
Khun Nai's employee have came and took the sheep.

347
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,399
He's here?

348
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,039
Yes.

349
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,599
I'll go see myself.

350
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,479
Oh.

351
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,199
Why are you here?

352
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,639
Why aren't you working?

353
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,079
-Uncle!
-What?

354
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,199
You're just a worker.

355
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,919
You can't talk to the brother of the farm owner's wife like this!

356
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,479
What a smart mouth. Save that mouth to eat instead!

357
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,279
I should break that mouth of yours you bastard!

358
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,599
Go to work!

359
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,639
You're still going to stand there?

360
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,959
Go to work!

361
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,079
He thinks he's cool.

362
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,399
Should I just trip him?

363
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,279
Asshole.

364
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,079
Refusing to work.

365
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,399
Kids.

366
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,279
When you go stay with P'Nai,

367
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,679
don't be naughty

368
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,959
If you miss them, you can go see them.

369
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,239
My farm isn't that far from here.

370
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,199
If one day I want them back,

371
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,399
can you sell it back to me?

372
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,679
Sure.

373
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,559
Just think of it as..

374
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,799
me babysitting them.

375
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,479
80,000.

376
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,879
For letting me babysit them.

377
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,959
Thank you.

378
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,679
Don't worry.

379
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,559
I'll get going now.

380
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,679
Okay.

381
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,719
Do you want to go buy fabrics for the stuffed animal?

382
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,599
Sure.

383
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,879
What's that money?

384
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,679
It's my money.

385
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,159
Poor like you have this much money?

386
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,879
When you came to this house,
you didn't have one single baht

387
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,919
You suddenly now have money so there must be an origin.

388
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,279
Did you sell something from this house?

389
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,479
I'm not a thief!

390
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,039
What's going on here?

391
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,279
I think Pim stole something from this house to sell

392
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,719
Enough Auntie.

393
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,079
Pim.

394
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,679
Where did you get the money from?

395
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,239
P'Nai.

396
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,599
You're that close that he's willing to give you money?

397
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,279
Oh my gosh Ran.

398
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,279
How close is your wife to Nai

399
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,519
for him to easily lend her this huge amount of money.

400
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,719
It looks a lot too. Must be tens of thousands.

401
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,439
Is old my sheep!

402
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,639
With that amount of money,

403
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,359
I could easily give it to you if you had asked.

404
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,359
But I don't want your money.

405
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,839
But you can ask money from another man?

406
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,279
I didn't ask.

407
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,999
I sold the sheep for the money!

408
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,639
Why do you need the money?

409
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,519
I thought you love the sheep like family?

410
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,679
I have my own reason.

411
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,399
If you want to go buy the things, should we go now?

412
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,479
Oh.

413
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,719
You probably can't go right now.

414
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,559
Khun Orn is here

415
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,999
So what if she's here?

416
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,679
You guys were in Bangkok together for days.

417
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,199
I guess it wasn't enough there

418
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,839
that's why she had to come get some more here.

419
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,879
Orn didn't go to Bangkok with me.

420
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,399
Don't make excuses.

421
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,519
Even if you did go with her, I won't mind.

422
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,239
Because no matter what,

423
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,159
I'm just your wife on paper.

424
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,679
Your real wife is here

425
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,799
So it's right of me to step aside for her.

426
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,079
As for the fabrics,

427
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,079
we can go tomorrow.

428
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,399
I'm in no hurry.

429
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,839
Ran.

430
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,879
Orn has been waiting to talk to you.

431
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,439
What is it Orn?

432
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,559
Are you irritated about Nai giving Pim money?

433
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,999
Just say what you want to talk to me about.

434
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,679
I have work to do.

435
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,919
Why are you talking to her like that?

436
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,879
It's okay Aunt Chu.

437
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,439
I scheduled an appointment for you with Uncle Yut.

438
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,679
When is it?

439
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,479
Tonight.

440
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,879
Uncle.

441
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,879
Khun Yut came to buy everything from your farm again?

442
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,359
Yes.

443
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,999
He gave us a good price just like Khun Saran said.

444
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,879
If I knew Khun Saran wanted some,

445
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,399
I would have kept some for him.

446
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,079
It's okay.

447
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,439
- Thank you so much.
-Sure.

448
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,479
I'm sorry.

449
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,879
-Yeah.
-l sold it all.

450
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,519
-All gone.
-Yes.

451
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,239
Hia Yut bought it all again?

452
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,199
Yeah.

453
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,799
He buys everything from every single farm?

454
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,159
Does he usually come buy it himself?

455
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,759
Well...

456
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,799
But he probably knows the price of the corn will be good.

457
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,039
So he buys it from every farm.

458
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,999
I sold it to Khun Yut already.

459
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,719
-All of it?!
-Yes.

460
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,199
-That's fine then. Thank you
-No problem.

461
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,999
What the hell?

462
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,479
All of it are sold?

463
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,679
That is strange.

464
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,079
What time will Uncle Yut get here?

465
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,399
He's almost here probably

466
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,439
Can I take a photo to send to Uncle Yut?

467
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,479
So he knows we're waiting for him at the restaurant

468
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,999
P'Ran smile please. I didn't force you to come here.

469
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,359
Smile.

470
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,079
That's what you call wanting to take a photo.

471
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,999
Uncle Yut said he's almost here.

472
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,239
Yeah.

473
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,639
Come on kids.

474
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,319
I'll tell you a story.

475
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,279
It's about the three little pigs!

476
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,599
Where did Daddy go?

477
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,639
Daddy went to work

478
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,799
He'll be back soon.

479
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,999
You guys should go to sleep.

480
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,319
When you wake up tomorrow morning, you will see Daddy.

481
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,279
Okay.

482
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,639
I'll tell you the story now.

483
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,279
- Once upon --
I know this story already

484
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,279
- Hmm?
-But in English.

485
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,999
-Once upon a time...
-A huh.

486
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,959
there were three little pigs.

487
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:14,319
And...they lived in a little house across the river.

488
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,799
Their mother said that this house was too small for them.

489
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,759
So they set off

490
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,119
a to build their own houses.

491
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,239
They got some wood, cement, straws and bricks to make some houses.

492
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,279
The first little pig built his house out of straws.

493
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,359
Where did I put it?

494
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,679
The kids went to sleep?

495
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,359
Yes.

496
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,119
Good.

497
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,799
I need to talk to you. Can you spare some time?

498
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,959
Yes.

499
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,919
Why were you happy to get that small amount of money from Danai for selling the sheep?

500
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,359
If you really wanted money, why didn't you take the 500K that I offered?

501
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,479
I don't expect to receive any money here.

502
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,279
If you're leaving this place in a year,

503
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,239
I want to give you some money to start your life for taking good care of the twins.

504
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,319
I won't take it.

505
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,639
Why not?

506
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,279
My money is n't as valuable as Danai's?

507
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,799
No.

508
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,119
I don't want you to think that I'm taking care of the kids because I want money.

509
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,759
But I'm happy to give you it. It's not for you to break up with Ran.

510
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,479
Thank you.

511
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,519
But I rather not take it.

512
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,839
If you leave this place in one year and go live with Danai,

513
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,599
I want you to have something with you so his family won't dislike you.

514
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,919
80,000 to you may seem little.

515
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,319
But for me, it's enough to start my life over.

516
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,999
Start your life over with 80,000?

517
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,599
What can you do with 80,000 these days?

518
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,279
Alright. Up to you.

519
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,479
I only have good intentions.

520
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,999
If you don't want it then fine.

521
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,759
Wait.

522
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,239
I want to thank you

523
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,319
for agreeing to do the stuffed animal.

524
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,919
On the day of the event, I want you to be there.

525
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,239
As the person that made it.

526
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,759
Okay.

527
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,439
I've been looking for it

528
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,519
You weren't home for days.

529
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,439
Your kids miss you and you refused to come see them before bedtime.

530
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,159
You had to go have dinner with your ex.

531
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,319
When actually you just came back from Bangkok together.

532
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,359
Good.

533
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,119
Have fun eating!

534
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,919
In a few months

535
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,799
I no longer have to play his fake wife.

536
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,279
I'll sell it to you at the cost price.

537
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,679
If you signed a contract with them and not live up to it's conditions,

538
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,959
you will be fined.

539
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,279
I was going to buy it from the villagers at first.

540
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,999
But it seemed like they sold it all to you.

541
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,759
Like I told you,

542
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,479
the price on the corn is good right now.

543
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,679
Everyone wants to sell them.

544
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,919
That means you now owe me P'Ran.

545
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,799
I got an appointment for you to see Uncle.

546
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,519
What do you mean owe?

547
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,079
You and him are like family.

548
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,359
If problems occur, you must help each other.

549
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,439
You shouldn't prank him so much.

550
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,959
There will be a time

551
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,639
when I will need help from you Ran.

552
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,839
All of this was your plan wasn't it?

553
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,159
Call it a coincidence instead

554
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,279
Sounds more pleasant.

555
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,759
Uncle.

556
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,759
That's right.

557
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,959
Nai's family does.

558
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,799
So Nail is in on this too?!

559
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,999
Hey.

560
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,839
Sometimes you don't need to know everything.

561
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,079
As long as we get what we want in the end, correct?

562
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,919
Sitting all close to him!

563
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,319
He has a wife already and doesn't even care.

564
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,639
If it was me, I would have walked up and pulled her hair!

565
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,279
And then slap, slap, slap!

566
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,919
You snake!

567
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,279
Acting like a good person by sending a photo to keep me updated!

568
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,119
I'm not a Facebook status!

569
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,959
No need to keep me updated every day!

570
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,959
-Taew!
- This way!

571
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,839
Why did you hit me?! I'm not Khun Orn!

572
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,839
Oh, I'm sorry.

573
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,999
I got way into it. I'm sorry.

574
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,159
Don't pay attention to it.

575
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,239
There's no way Khun Ran will love Khun Orn.

576
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,519
But you're not confident either right

577
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,679
that he will never love her?

578
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,319
You marrying Khun Ran,

579
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,519
do you love him?

580
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,319
Or did you marry him because he's rich?

581
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,999
I can't love him.

582
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,839
Why not?

583
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,919
Or do you love Khun Nai?

584
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,599
Hmm?

585
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,639
I see him come here all the time.

586
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,239
You're bound to soften up to him.

587
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,439
But now that you're married to Khun Ran

588
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,639
you can't love Khun Nai either.

589
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,639
If Khun Ran is still able to go places with Khun Orn,

590
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,519
if I were to really be in love with Khun Nai, it won't be wrong.

591
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,799
<i>Do you even notice the good things I've done for you?</i>

592
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,079
<i>You went out with your ex,</i>

593
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,479
<i>and you say it's something 
good you're doing for me?</i>

594
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,359
<i>In that case,men will probably 
have mistresses all over the world,</i>

595
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,479
<i>and say they're doing 
something good for their wives.</i>

596
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,639
<i>Boss is mad and 
wants me to take you back</i>

597
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,759
<i>But I won't pursue the matte</i>

598
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,519
<i>if you hand him over to me.</i>

599
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,639
<i>Can pay in installments?</i>

600
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,239
<i>It depends on...</i>

601
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,399
<i>how you will pay.</i>

602
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:05,600
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

603
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:14,060
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

604
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:19,460
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

605
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,000
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

606
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:31,440
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
