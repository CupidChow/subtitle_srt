1
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,960
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,160
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,560
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,400
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,800
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,440
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:06,000
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,080
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,240
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,360
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,279
I'll give you back the land.

13
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,239
In exchange for what?

14
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,999
For a period of one year,

15
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,359
you have to be my wife.

16
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,319
Wife by name?

17
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,279
My real wife.

18
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,519
Huh?

19
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,999
Then...

20
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,239
-I have to do wife duties?
-Yeah.

21
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,599
Huh?!

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,999
Wife duties

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,679
and also mom duties

24
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,439
Look after me and the twins.

25
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,839
And...

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,799
the duties...

27
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,119
Bed activities?

28
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,359
Regarding that,

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,439
when you're willing to do it then we'll talk.

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,359
So that means throughout the period of one year I'm not willing to...

31
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,439
Then you don't have to do it.

32
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,119
How long will it take?

33
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,799
About ten months

34
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,679
But you'll have to make sure you're married
and able to prove you're ready to raise kids.

35
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,959
Orn.

36
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,839
What's your problem?!

37
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,679
You sent someone to shoot P'Ran didn't you?!

38
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,999
I sent someone to catch Pim.

39
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,239
Why did you have to shoot them?!

40
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,079
Ran was there.

41
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,079
So they had to shoot to threaten them.

42
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,919
If I really wanted to shoot your boyfriend Ran,

43
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,639
you would have to make reservations at the temple by now

44
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,159
If you're lonely and he doesn't want you,

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,079
you can come back to your ex like me temporary

46
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,519
I won't mind.

47
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,479
Save your energy for your bed activity with Pim!

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,479
Don't you like them young ones?!

49
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,959
If you want her like this

50
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,239
I probably have to find opportunities for you to approach her much easier.

51
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,639
So nothing gets in my way either.

52
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,919
I know your type is Khun Orn

53
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,599
I'm not even an inch of your type.

54
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,239
Good that you know

55
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,599
I want you to convince everyone that we're really sleeping together.

56
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,519
Even if I am sleeping in my office to make you comfortable.

57
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,960
But you better not sleepwalk

58
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,279
Because I get aroused with a woman that sleep walks.

59
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,799
Especially the touchy ones,

60
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,999
I like it even more.

61
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,679
Are you a psychopath?

62
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,959
Do I sleep walk?

63
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,799
Or...

64
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,239
at the hospital,

65
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,639
was I sleep walking and took advantage of him?

66
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,919
I should wrap myself up.

67
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,759
In case l sleep walk and go to his room to take advantage of him.

68
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,999
-Daddy! Where are you?
-Where are you Daddy?!

69
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,079
Daddy!

70
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,119
-Daddy!
-Good morning!

71
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,359
Daddy!

72
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,679
Good morning Daddy!

73
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,999
Mommy!

74
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,919
Mama.

75
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,359
Mama, Daddy.

76
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,759
Mama.

77
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,359
-Good morning.
-Good morning Mama.

78
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,360
We love you.

79
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,599
Mommy, you haven't given Daddy a good morning kiss yet.

80
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,479
Mommy bit Daddy!

81
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,759
Very funny!

82
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,119
Come kids.

83
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,599
Go shower so you can go down stairs to eat.

84
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,639
Okay.

85
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,599
Come.

86
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,599
Let's go shower.

87
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,960
Trying to sleep until noon or what?

88
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,599
She's the daughter in law.

89
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,359
Instead of waking up early to prepare everything,

90
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,319
she still has n't come down yet by now.

91
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,359
Taew.

92
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,919
Go call her down here to come eat, It's getting late.

93
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,639
Okay.

94
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,279
Why aren't you going?

95
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,319
I've been waiting until the kids already ate and went outside to play.

96
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,479
She still hasn't come down

97
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,399
Do you want me to wait until noon?

98
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,960
Ma'am.

99
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,480
Pim was in the kitchen since early morning.

100
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,119
She probably took the kids to go play with the sheep right now.

101
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,519
Really?

102
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,479
The breakfast this morning was made by Pim and Mom too.

103
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,839
Oh, that's good

104
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,839
It's good she woke up early

105
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,919
If she's awake then go tidy Khun Ran's room.

106
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,639
Okay.

107
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,960
Once Pim was done, now it's my turn.

108
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,359
Yesterday was your doing, wasn't it?

109
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,479
What did I do yesterday?

110
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,479
Hey!

111
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,839
Don't accuse me without any proof

112
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,159
Everyone knows you desperately want Grandpa Ruj's land

113
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,159
You had your men go burn Pim's house.

114
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,959
You even sent someone to shoot me when I went to Pim's house last night.

115
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,679
This doesn't include you trying to kill me at the hospital.

116
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,479
Where's the proof?

117
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,119
If you don't have any then don't blabber.

118
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,319
Threatening me with the cops too?

119
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,599
I'm not threatening you.

120
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,479
But I have proof that a murder happened last night.

121
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,319
Really?

122
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,839
Here?

123
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,639
Pardon me. Here's the search warrant.

124
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,519
Lead the way Khun Saran.

125
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,799
Found it.

126
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,839
Where's the body? I don't see any body

127
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,279
Where's the body?

128
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,759
There's actually two bodies.

129
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,359
What's next? Will you keep digging?

130
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,599
But if you do keep digging

131
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,799
you might find the oil well

132
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,159
We didn't find the body like you reported.

133
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,839
Okay.

134
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,999
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

135
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,159
Excuse us.

136
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,799
-Sure.
-Wait Officer.

137
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,840
You won't press charges on him for filing a false report?

138
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,359
Khun Saran did not specify that you did it.

139
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,519
He only reported that an incident happened right here.

140
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,639
Is that so?

141
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,799
Excuse us.

142
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,599
I can press charges on you.

143
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,999
For filing a false report to incriminate and defame.

144
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,839
I think you did do it.

145
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,959
You just managed to get away with it.

146
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,439
Let's go.

147
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,639
I burned him here Boss

148
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,639
Good thing you knew ahead.

149
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,999
I'm sorry.

150
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,079
If not you,

151
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,439
it was going to be us.

152
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,318
Don't!

153
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,959
Forgive me.

154
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,479
Let's go.

155
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,239
Where did it fell?

156
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,799
He wanted to put me in prison

157
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,519
You can't attack him directly,

158
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,319
The bed is so firm as if no one slept on it.

159
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,959
Where did they sleep?

160
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,359
Oh!

161
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,079
Crystal clear!

162
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,919
First night and you guys had a tournament in here.

163
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,519
Their lives must be too basic and expensive so it had to be...

164
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,639
the sofa!

165
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,999
Juicy!

166
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,279
Khun Ran.

167
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,799
Come here

168
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,280
Right here.

169
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,960
Come.

170
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,320
Right here.

171
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,960
Right here.

172
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,119
With this, the twins will be getting a sibling soon!

173
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,359
Scoop more

174
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,999
Thank you

175
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,679
for saving them

176
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,319
It was Khun Ran.

177
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,839
He told me to take care of them.

178
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,639
The day of the fire, he told me to bring the sheep here first.

179
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,759
He also told me to bring more grass.

180
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,759
They like eating his grass.

181
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,839
He's actually a kind person.

182
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,519
Even though he's mean like a dog!

183
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,119
Who's mean like a dog?

184
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,239
Daddy!

185
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,479
Who are you calling a dog?

186
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,639
I meant...

187
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,319
it would be nice if there was a dog guarding the sheep.

188
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,919
Did you eat yet?

189
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,639
I made fish congee for you since you left so early.

190
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,079
I haven't.

191
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,599
I was waiting to eat with my wife.

192
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,119
But late already.

193
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,159
P'Pim ate with P'Toei and P'Taew.
I invited her to come eat but she refused

194
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,799
Really?

195
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,679
A huh.

196
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,279
Then should we invite P'Pim to have lunch with us?

197
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,119
Yay! Can I sit with you?

198
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,959
I want to sit with you too

199
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,999
We need to talk.

200
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,999
About last i night.

201
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,439
Toei.

202
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,519
Yes?

203
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,239
Take the kids to go see Jam in the kitchen.

204
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,439
Pim and!

205
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,240
-will go see the damage done at the stable.
-Okay

206
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,359
Come on guys!

207
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,159
We, the three rangers,

208
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,319
will go attack P'Jam!

209
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,599
Let's go!

210
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,639
Hurry!

211
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,319
Come on!

212
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,999
They didn't find anything at Khun Tin's farm?

213
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,919
How is that possible?

214
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,959
I know right?

215
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,319
But I saw that they were burying something.

216
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,679
I saw with my own eyes too.

217
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,839
They threw someone down there.

218
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,639
But the police went to dig and found nothing?

219
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,279
Yes.

220
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,079
So will Khun Tin not pursue the matter with you?

221
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,759
An influential person like him will not stand idly and let you attack him.

222
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,679
Think about it.

223
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,359
She said she's the wife.

224
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,760
The other day he bought my whole collection.

225
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,519
I think he's very infatuated with her.

226
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,919
You're not going to say anything?

227
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,519
What do you want me to say?

228
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,319
I thought you like Pim?

229
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,479
She has a husband and you're not gonna say anything?

230
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,119
I'm just not sure

231
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,239
if they're really married.

232
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,359
It is real. They have the marriage certificate.

233
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,759
Well, yes.

234
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,599
But isn't it too soon?

235
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,119
Have you see n P'Ran go pick up or drop off

236
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,919
or even court Pim?

237
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,599
Never.

238
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,999
Bingo.

239
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,799
Crazy!

240
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,119
If they don't love each other, why would they sign the certificate?

241
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,839
Some people don't even sign the marriage certificate when they remarried.

242
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,639
Who wants to share their assets?

243
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,759
You would need to split it in half and it's not even worth the profit you make.

244
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,239
That's another reason.

245
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,279
But I think...

246
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,519
there's something strange about it.

247
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,239
So you're just going to easily let Pim go like this?

248
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,439
Have I told you

249
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,639
that I was?

250
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,519
What are you waiting for?

251
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,759
If you say you're not sure if they got married because they love each other,

252
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,839
are you going to wait until they do love each other?

253
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,479
Because if you don't start today,

254
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,479
if they do love each other already,

255
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,319
you will lose that right!

256
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,799
Don't run or you'll fall!

257
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,439
Don't run!

258
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,159
Don't run! That's enough!

259
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,479
You see?

260
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,319
I told you not to run or this will happen.

261
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,639
Taew.

262
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,759
Go wash your face.

263
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,319
Okay.

264
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,479
Sit.

265
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,359
Kids, eat up.

266
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,359
Last night's shooting was like world war!

267
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,799
Really?!

268
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,279
Rong! Why didn't you wake me?!

269
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,159
Was that a gunshot?

270
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,519
Gunshot!

271
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,119
Noi!

272
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,239
Noi! Noi wake up!

273
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,519
There were gunshots! Wake up!

274
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,799
Wake up Noi!

275
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,679
My eyes!

276
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,519
Right in my face!

277
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,479
Aren't you exaggerating?!

278
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,440
I'm not a heavy sleeper! Why didn't you wake me?!

279
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,359
"I'm not a heavy sleeper! Why didn't you wake me?!"

280
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,959
This is proof!

281
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,159
Foot right in my face!

282
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,759
-Whose foot?
-Yours!

283
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,319
Khun Ran said she saw Khun Tin's men burying something in the back of their farm.

284
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,039
-Really?
-Yeah.

285
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,839
Speaking of that farm, it's so scary

286
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,839
It's like the Twilight Zone

287
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,599
People can enter but not leave

288
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,119
So many people died there.

289
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,359
The ghosts must be wicked!

290
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,959
The ghosts are wicked.

291
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,759
Yes, wicked.

292
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,959
Ghost! Ghost!

293
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,639
So scary!

294
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,079
What?!

295
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,960
It's me! Why are you scared?!! Scaredy cat!

296
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,479
You freak! What are you doing?! You scared me!

297
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,159
Yes?

298
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,039
My wife.

299
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,999
Gosh! Why do you mind the kid?!

300
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,479
He was just scared!

301
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,599
What happened dear?

302
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,279
I fell.

303
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,359
What mud did you fell in to?

304
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,079
You have lemon grass all over your face.

305
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,919
These are seaweed from vegetable soup Dad! It's not lemongrass!

306
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,119
My goodness! Go and wash your face!

307
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,279
Why would you put your face in vegetable soup?!

308
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,679
Crazy daughter!

309
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,599
Your daughter Mom!

310
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,159
Your dad's daughter!

311
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,279
My daughter now?

312
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,599
Go! Get going!

313
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,279
Crazy just like your father.

314
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,440
Wait.

315
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,439
Throw this away too.

316
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,479
You freak!

317
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,679
What freak?

318
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,359
The food isn't good?

319
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,239
No.

320
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,519
Then eat.

321
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,319
She's probably not familiar with it.

322
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,999
Don't you usually eat sticky rice with chopped fermented fish?

323
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,599
So she's not used to eating other proteins.

324
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,079
Hello Auntie.

325
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,599
Hello Orn, Danai.

326
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,439
-Hello P'Ran.
-Hello.

327
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,079
The witch is here.

328
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,519
-I'm full.
-Me too.

329
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,240
You guys are full?

330
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,639
I bought snacks for you guys too.

331
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,159
Here.

332
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,159
Thank you.

333
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,839
When I'm done talking to your dad.
I'll go play with you okay?

334
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,799
Okay.

335
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,319
The twins seems to like you.

336
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,799
You have a job, nice family,

337
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,679
you have an education.

338
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,919
I regret you so much.

339
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,679
Uncle had me come discuss the price of the corn for next batch.

340
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,079
Oh really?

341
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,079
Let's go talk in the living room.

342
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,479
-Ran, come with us.
-Okay.

343
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,800
Why are you here Nai?

344
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,439
I came to accompany Orn.

345
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,480
Why don't you come with us then?

346
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,640
I'll wait here.

347
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,640
Up to you.

348
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,519
I heard you got married?

349
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,239
That's enough! You're full now! Stop!

350
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,799
Gosh!

351
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,679
Go! I need to wash the dishes.

352
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,799
I was just enjoying it.

353
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,479
Dig in.

354
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,239
Thanks.

355
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,439
I want to be the sticky rice.

356
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,839
So your hands can touch me, feel me.

357
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,079
Pim's aura is screaming madam.

358
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,959
Khun Ran must be really in love with her.

359
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,199
Why do you say that?

360
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,919
This morning, I went to tidy Khun Ran's bedroom.

361
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,319
And then?

362
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,279
Bed so firm!

363
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,959
What does the bed being firm has to do with being a madam?

364
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,520
-Yeah.
-The bed is firm Dad

365
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,479
but the sofa in his office...

366
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,319
it was like world war three!

367
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,839
Were they like in those boat race with full force and what not?

368
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,239
I don't know either but...

369
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,119
II just saw what was left after the deed!

370
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,279
This boy!

371
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,359
We're gossiping right now!

372
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,519
Do you think they did it all night?

373
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,239
I don't know either!

374
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,319
-Auntie.
-You talk as if you're familiar with it.

375
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,439
-Auntie.
-What?! Not now!

376
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,519
I'm gossiping right now.

377
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,999
They probably did do it all night.

378
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,119
What are you guys talking about here?

379
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,519
I'm going to go fix the stable

380
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,519
-I'll help.
-Okay come on.

381
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,159
We were in the middle of gossiping.

382
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,279
You're not going to help me wash' the dish?

383
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,119
-You two go ahead. I'm leaving.
-Gosh Dad!a

384
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,919
-P'Toei too.
-Right?

385
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,839
Oops!

386
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,359
So close

387
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,279
She probably heard everything.

388
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,839
I think so!

389
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,599
I came to tell you

390
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,519
they're done eating.

391
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,799
Oh really?

392
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,119
Mom, let's go get the plates.

393
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,519
-Where did I leave the tray?
-Where is it?

394
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,799
Where is the tray?

395
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,919
-Where is it?
-Where did you leave it?

396
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,079
-I'm just gonna go!
-Mom! Wait for me!

397
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,800
How is it being the madam of Saengtawan Farm?

398
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,519
The same.

399
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,119
Don't call me madam. Just call me like before

400
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,759
How can I?

401
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,479
Right now you have...

402
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,519
Khun Ran as a husband?

403
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,799
Yeah.

404
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,959
Is it not true?

405
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,678
It's true.

406
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,999
But it's not.

407
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,839
Perhaps next year l might be an employee selling fertilizers at your shop instead!

408
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,959
If you want to be my employee,

409
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,079
I'll look after you in P'Ran's place.

410
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,079
If I were to have a wife

411
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,599
I would not let my wife struggle.

412
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,079
Taking the guest on a walk?

413
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,959
Yes.

414
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,479
Nai is no stranger here. He can go walking by himself.

415
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,678
I asked Pim to take me

416
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,359
I wanted to check out the corn.

417
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,479
I wanted to see how it was doing.

418
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,639
Na i's organic fertilizer is working right?

419
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,679
Yes.

420
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,839
But too much worms.

421
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,359
Too much worms?

422
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,479
That means the soil is perfect.

423
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,279
The new fertilizer goes well with the soil here then.

424
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,119
Sometimes suitability doesn't mean we like it.

425
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,639
But some things are n't suitable and are bad.

426
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,839
Plus it's not likable either.

427
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,439
I'm going to go check on the kids.

428
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,599
So you can continue with your business.

429
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,279
Orn.

430
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,839
I won't walk you out.

431
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,279
See you at the meeting this afternoon.

432
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,599
Didn't I tell you

433
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,639
if we let them be, P'Ran will fall for her even more?

434
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,279
He's already crazy about her right now.

435
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,639
You guys seem close.

436
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,159
If you guys are any closer, he can be your husband!

437
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,679
Khun Ran!

438
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,159
Or is it not?

439
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,479
You guys were being chummy out there.

440
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,439
You weren't being considerate of your husband like me!

441
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,359
Is that your mouth talking?!

442
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,279
You tested it.

443
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,799
Do you think it was my mouth?

444
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,759
I might be your husband by name

445
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,279
but you should be considerate of me too!

446
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,319
You can't just flirt with other men like that!

447
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,759
You just ignored my existence!

448
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,639
I wasn't doing like you said

449
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,439
Good that you didn't.

450
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,759
But if I see you two walking alone again,

451
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,079
I will kiss you!

452
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,999
I will show him that you're mine!

453
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,439
Just for one year.

454
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,079
When I get my property back,

455
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,759
I will leave!

456
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,479
You have to go to the Provincial Agriculture Committee Meeting with me.

457
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,119
-I won't go.
-You have to!

458
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,519
You have to go!

459
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,160
Dress nicely too!

460
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,119
Can't you smile a little?

461
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,319
Why do I have to smile?

462
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,279
You came here with your newly wedded husband.

463
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,279
You should be a little happy.

464
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,759
Smile.

465
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,959
Smile like you're happy.

466
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
I'm not happy!

467
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,439
If you're happy then you smile.

468
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,479
Today I'm happy.

469
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,799
If you're not happy then that's your problem

470
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,639
Excuse me.

471
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,319
P'Ran.

472
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,599
I go there a while ago. I thought you would be here already

473
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,679
Why didn't you bring your sister this time?

474
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,999
Yes Ran, where's Nus?

475
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,959
Nus couldn't make it.

476
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,519
But I brought my wife to introduce to you all today

477
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,799
Wife?

478
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,119
Congratulations Khun Orn.

479
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,279
You didn't tell us you had a private wedding

480
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,119
This is her.

481
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,279
Pim is my wife.

482
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,919
Isn't she Grandpa Ruj's granddaughter?

483
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,319
Yeah.

484
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,919
How did she marry Khun Ran?

485
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,799
Trying to leech off his money.

486
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,439
She probably took the money to pay off her grandfather's debt.

487
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,799
I heard they owe the bank as well?

488
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,439
P'Ran, they want to discuss the price on the corn.

489
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,359
Let's go.

490
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,479
Do you want water?

491
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,599
I didn't put any sleeping pill in it.

492
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,279
Get away from me.

493
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,439
You announced to everyone that you're the wife of the most eligible bachelor.

494
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,959
There should be some competition

495
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,679
But don't forget

496
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,479
your brother sold you to me already.

497
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,439
I already bought you too.

498
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,479
Bastard!

499
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,359
How much did you spend?

500
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,639
A little.

501
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,279
How much is little?

502
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,799
A little over 300K baht.

503
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,599
Nus.

504
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,679
They froze your credit card.

505
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,799
If you saved up your money, you will have enough to pay rent for months.

506
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,600
So what if it's frozen?

507
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,799
I still have a lot in my account and this is my happiness.

508
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,239
We'll struggle if you run out.

509
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,999
You won't earn money but you want to spend.

510
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,279
Hey!

511
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,079
What's the matter with you?

512
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,959
You won't go anywhere with me You won't go shopping with me.

513
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,639
You criticize me when I buy some little stuff!

514
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,519
You're boring.

515
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,160
You just splurge!

516
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,239
You won't listen to me!

517
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,959
Hey!

518
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,279
You're bored of me?! What exactly is boring to you?!

519
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,479
What?! Tell me!

520
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,279
What the hell is wrong with you Nus?!

521
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,279
I'm your husband not your servant!

522
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,759
You can't boss me around!

523
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,239
If you're still going to act like this I don't think we can be together!

524
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,079
Jerk!

525
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,319
Go then!

526
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,639
<i>There will be a day when you soften up to me</i>

527
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,759
<i>Where is Pim?</i>

528
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,999
<i>What you're doing is not okay?</i>

529
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,160
<i>And what you did is okay taking my wife like that?</i>

530
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,360
<i>I came to collect the promise your brother made.</i>

531
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,079
<i>I have nothing to do with that!</i>

532
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,280
<i>Khun Tin probably took her home with him.</i>

533
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:13,120
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

534
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:21,580
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

535
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:26,980
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

536
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,520
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

537
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:38,960
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
