1
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,920
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,960
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,120
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,520
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,360
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,760
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,400
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:04,960
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,040
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,200
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,320
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,239
Hey, why are you in the way Toei?

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,919
You can't enter.

14
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,319
Khun Ran for bids you

15
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,879
How can he not let me?

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,159
I have deliveries for him. There's a bunch in the trunk. Go see.

17
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,079
Khun Ran said if it's you,

18
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,079
you can't enter whatsoever.

19
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,839
In that case,

20
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,959
can I put the stuff right here?

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,319
If it's convenient for you,

22
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,919
go ahead.!!

23
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,439
Toei.

24
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,519
Toei.

25
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,599
4,000.

26
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,239
4,000?

27
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,679
-Mm.
-Nope.

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,399
He's greedy.

29
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,239
Max, 5,000.

30
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,639
5,000.

31
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,079
-5000?
-Mm.

32
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,239
Hurry!

33
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,679
Hurry up and get out of here!

34
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,839
This country is in shambles is because 
of corrupted people like you!

35
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,919
Go! Hurry! Drive away!

36
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,159
Come on Toei.

37
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,599
I have morals you know!

38
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,679
Thanks.

39
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,159
Grandma, can I go help Mommy work?

40
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,519
You can't. P'Pim will be busy today.

41
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,759
They have to finish making the doll today

42
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,239
It'll be done right?

43
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,439
Yes.

44
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,759
Why don't you two come with me instead?

45
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,839
It's almost my birthday.

46
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,439
I plan to have a party but you two don't have outfits yet.

47
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,439
I'll take you to get your outfits made with P'Da.

48
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,839
Then afterwards we can go get ice cream. Sounds good?

49
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,679
Okay!

50
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,639
Oh Jam.

51
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,079
The kids will step out with me.

52
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,279
Go let Uncle Rong know

53
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,319
Sure.

54
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,079
Kids,stay with Mommy first. I'll be back

55
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,439
Mommy.

56
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,679
Where's Daddy?

57
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,999
I don't know.

58
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,359
You're busy everyday.

59
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,479
Once I'm done working, I can come play with you all day okay?

60
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,519
Promise?

61
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,439
Mafeuang, Mafai.

62
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,359
Let's go.

63
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,439
We will miss you.

64
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,319
Very much?

65
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,079
Thank you.

66
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,079
Come.

67
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,599
Bye bye.

68
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,679
-Bye bye. See you later.
-Bye bye.

69
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,639
Bye!

70
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,479
This you won't see.

71
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,439
So how would you know how I feel?

72
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,999
Is all of this fabric here?

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,959
Yes.

74
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,319
Is it? Okay you can start cutting then.

75
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,519
As Mode A and Model B.

76
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,079
Okay that will be it.

77
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,719
Oh.

78
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,279
You're here early.

79
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,359
I had deliveries

80
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,479
but the owner won't let me enter.

81
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,679
P'Ran?

82
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,079
Yeah.

83
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,079
He forbids you but you're still persistent

84
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,279
I want to see Pim.

85
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,759
You can't see her so you come to see me instead.

86
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,999
Yeah.

87
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,919
Be careful dear.

88
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,279
Hello.
-Hello Lada.

89
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,159
-Oh hey Nai.
-Hello.

90
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,639
Why are you here?

91
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,079
I haven't seen you in a while.

92
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,759
Yes.

93
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,159
P'Ran probably doesn't want to see me

94
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,159
so he forbade me from entering the farm.

95
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,999
-Oh Lada.
-Yes?

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,439
Can you take the twins measurements?

97
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,119
I want an outfit for them for my birthday party.

98
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,079
Sure.

99
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,359
Come on.

100
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,639
- I'll take you guys upstairs.
-Please watch them.

101
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,279
Nai.

102
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,079
Come talk with me outside.

103
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,439
Sure.

104
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,599
I'll be selling the dolls tomorrow at the association.

105
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,519
If you want to see Pim,you can see her there.

106
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,439
What about P'Ran?

107
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,359
I'll find a way for him to catch up later.

108
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,919
Why are you helping me?

109
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,639
I'm not helping you.

110
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,759
I think Pim wants it to be like that.

111
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,159
Why?

112
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,319
I think there's some kind of deal between her and Ran.

113
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,799
-A year?
-Yeah.

114
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,119
You're thinking the same as me right?

115
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,158
It's like there's an agreement between those two.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,839
Yes.

117
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,079
If it's what I'm thinking

118
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,399
whether Pim stays or go is no different.

119
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,359
She has no future.

120
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,479
If you like her,

121
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,319
they will probably break up after a year.

122
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,119
But it won't be strange if she breaks up with him now and starts dating you.

123
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,599
We just have to find out what agreement they have.

124
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,279
Pick up the pace

125
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,359
It's finally done!

126
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,919
How's it going? Did you finish?

127
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,919
Yes.

128
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,479
P'Toei.

129
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,279
Gosh what?!

130
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,839
Toei.

131
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,839
What?!

132
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,279
Ma'am.

133
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,799
Help pack the dolls in the bag.

134
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,439
Yes.

135
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,679
Once you're done,deliver them at the event. Make sure you get there in time.

136
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,479
Yes Ma'am.

137
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,479
Go to the event with me Pim.

138
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,159
In case the people there are interested.

139
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,519
Yes.

140
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,279
Can't you go faster Uncle?

141
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,319
I have other business.

142
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,519
You really want to go to that association thing?

143
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,079
You knew that so why did you schedule to meet the customer?

144
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,319
I didn't but Khun Chu gave me the order.

145
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,759
Aunt Chu gave you the order?

146
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,159
Correct.

147
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,959
You go help in front of the shop

148
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,519
In case there's more orders.

149
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,439
Don't you want the money?

150
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,999
Yes.

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,639
By the time the one year is up and before you go,

152
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,639
you should be earning a lot of money.

153
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,839
Let me ask. Why one year?

154
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,279
What you'll learn today will be more than what you will save in a year.

155
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,359
Why don't you ask Khun Ran?

156
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,479
He should have a better answer than me.

157
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,959
-Hello Aunt Chu.
-Hello.

158
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,999
Pim.

159
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,999
-Setting up the shop?
-Yes.

160
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,759
Good. I'll help.

161
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,239
Sure, Come on.

162
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,119
What's wrong?

163
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,639
Hey

164
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,839
There's an event happening with the association. You never missed it.

165
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,639
I want to stay home today.

166
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,119
Hmm?

167
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,599
You're tired of attending events?

168
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,759
Is something wrong?

169
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,839
You haven't gone out in like a couple days now.

170
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,279
Hey.

171
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,799
Why don't you go see Ran?

172
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,239
You guys will become distant

173
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,279
Go get dressed and head to the event.

174
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,359
I think Ran will be attending the event

175
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,759
I want to stay home today.

176
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,119
Too lazy to get dressed.

177
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,959
Why do you want to be home?

178
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,679
Dress up nicely and go see Ran.

179
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,319
But l have nothing to talk to him about

180
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,839
Then tell him I will offer him corn seeds for free.

181
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,239
But the villagers must grow them and sell the corn back to me.

182
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,439
Let's see what Ran thinks.

183
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,479
Go, Get up. Hurry

184
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,799
Get up! Go.

185
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,519
Okay.

186
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,319
-Hello Madam
-Hello.

187
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,839
Aren't you Khun Kullachat's daughter?

188
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,279
Yes.

189
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,279
I was your father's customer.

190
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,679
You've opened up your own factory now?

191
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,839
Pim is working with me.

192
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,639
How lucky of you to have her help you.

193
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,239
I still remember her father's doll

194
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,119
were good quality, affordable. l ordered like 300 of them.

195
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,479
Yes. Thank you.

196
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,799
Let's go discuss the details at the cafe

197
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,279
-Yes.
-Right this way.

198
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,519
-Okay.
-Please.

199
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,279
Wow.

200
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,959
The daughter of the owner of a doll factory?

201
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,999
But right now I'm just an employee.

202
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,439
Why did your dad stopped?

203
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,599
The factory burned down.

204
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,679
Mom and Dad didn't survive.

205
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,239
Just me and brother that did.

206
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,639
Sol had to...

207
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,599
move in with Grandpa at the farm

208
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,799
Pim.

209
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,599
Are you okay?

210
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,319
I just miss my parents

211
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,439
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

212
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,759
Don't cry.

213
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,999
Look at these sheep.

214
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,159
People still remember and said they look like they just came out of your dad's factory

215
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,959
Did you forget

216
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,999
that your parents are always with you?

217
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,639
In here.

218
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,759
You say it's not.

219
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,318
Khun Ran!

220
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,679
You say it's not

221
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,479
but what I saw it is!

222
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,318
Nai likes you.

223
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,759
Seems like you like him too.

224
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,159
You're able to think for yourself so why are you asking me?

225
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,519
Can you stop speaking " Thai "to me?

226
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,359
However Is peak is my business.

227
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,599
In that case, however I speak is my business too right?

228
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,439
That's your business.

229
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,119
If I say I love you

230
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,639
and want to call off that contract,

231
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,679
I will do everything to have you stay with me.

232
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,279
Will you marry me for real this time?

233
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,079
Hey!

234
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,119
Don't let go of my hand.

235
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,319
I won't let go!

236
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,439
Khun Ran!

237
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,639
P'Nai call the ambulance! Khun Ran got shot!

238
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,319
Please be okay Khun Ran.

239
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,679
I have an answer!

240
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,919
I have an answer Khun Ran!

241
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,799
Open your eyes!

242
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,319
Open your eyes! Don't lie still

243
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,799
Don't lie still! 

244
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,759
Khun Ran!

245
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,599
The job is done.

246
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,639
I don't owe you anything now

247
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,919
Is he dead?

248
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,999
I couldn't do another hit

249
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,839
because people came to help him

250
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,159
If he's not dead,

251
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,239
the debt is still on the table.

252
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,479
What a shame.

253
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,919
He should have died.

254
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,279
I told you to kill Pim so why did P'Ran get shot?!

255
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,919
Why won't you answer me?!

256
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,839
You gave the order.

257
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,319
But I told you to kill Pim.

258
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,799
He probably missed the shot.

259
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,479
The nature in you never misses!

260
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,519
You're the one that told him to kill P'Ran didn't you?!

261
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,959
Yes.

262
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,119
You have no right to do this!

263
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,079
I do.

264
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,639
You want to kill Pim

265
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,839
because she married Ran.

266
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,079
I want to kill Ran

267
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,359
because he's in my way of happiness

268
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,959
And since the deal to coexist is off,

269
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,999
whatever I want to do

270
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,919
I will do.

271
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,279
I will file a report.

272
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,759
Try me.

273
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,079
That clip

274
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,839
isn't just for me to watch.

275
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,839
You...

276
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,599
-You are--
-Evil?

277
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,999
You know me best.

278
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,439
I've missed you.

279
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,679
Let's go talk in my bedroom

280
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,079
Let go!

281
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,759
Do you wanna do it here

282
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,119
or go do it quietly in my room?

283
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,839
Don't let anyone disturb me.

284
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,319
I want to be alone with Orn

285
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,119
This happened because Ran helped you and your brother!

286
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,599
If Ran dies,

287
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,919
just know that it will be your fault!

288
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,599
I'm sorry.

289
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,839
I didn't want it to turn out like this.

290
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,239
Drink some water first.

291
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,079
Thank you.

292
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,519
Nai likes you.

293
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,759
Do you want to reconsider?

294
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,999
Leave now

295
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,759
so you won't create more problems for us.

296
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,999
No need to wait for a year.

297
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,519
-I took out the bullet already
-Okay.

298
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,959
But the patient lost a lot of blood.

299
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,999
AB Rh negative blood type is very rare.

300
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,759
The hospital ran out too.

301
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,919
I can give him some.

302
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,279
AB Rh negative blood type?

303
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,639
Yes.

304
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,999
What do I have to do?

305
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,359
Follow me.

306
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,919
You!

307
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,279
Whether we live or die, you don't seem to know anything!

308
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,999
What?

309
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,679
I'm hungry!

310
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,359
What's there to eat?

311
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,279
Nothing!

312
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,799
You don't know that our boss was shot and is hospitalized right now?

313
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,959
Gosh, he's only injured.

314
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,959
He didn't die!

315
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,279
Why is your mouth like this?!

316
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,639
Let me kick you just once!

317
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,839
Why are you stopping me?!

318
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,119
Le time!l

319
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,959
Mom!

320
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,079
Come here!

321
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,319
Mom!

322
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,119
Get up!

323
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,679
Don't! i Don't!

324
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,439
Mom stop! That's enough!

325
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,319
-What?!
-That's enough!

326
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,119
Are you still human?!

327
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,919
He saved your life

328
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,679
and you're gonna talk like this?!

329
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,479
You asshole.

330
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,519
Go pack up and leave right now!

331
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,119
You son of a bitch!

332
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,999
You bastard!

333
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,839
Auntie.

334
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,679
You're just a servant.

335
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,959
If you want to kick the brother of your boss's wife.

336
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,079
I think you need to be more than a servant.

337
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,279
Are you using your mouth to talk?!

338
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,239
Do you want me to use my feet?

339
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,519
-Stop.
- Why are you stopping me?!

340
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,999
He deserves to get kicked!

341
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,479
So he can stop talking shitty!

342
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,079
Don't mess with him.

343
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,319
Khun Ran shouldn't have saved him.

344
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,119
Snake!

345
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,999
think they're back.

346
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,759
Your purse.

347
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,359
Oh.

348
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,559
-Thank you.
-Sure.

349
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,639
How's Khun Saran doing?

350
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,359
Still not good.

351
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,119
Where's Pim Khun Danai?

352
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,119
Still at the hospital.

353
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,999
Noi.

354
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,599
Pack some clothes.

355
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,599
Have Toei or Rong take it to the hospital for Pim.

356
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,639
Sure.

357
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,279
Thank you so much Nai.

358
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,519
Sure.

359
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,119
You're not worried about Khun Saran?

360
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,959
I know you're bad

361
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,159
but I didn't think you would be this bad.

362
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,679
Believe me

363
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,839
there's still some good in me.

364
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,639
You should know it in your heart.

365
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,959
No one will be hurt at all

366
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,799
if everything didn't start with you

367
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,799
Khun Saran's family?

368
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,759
The patient is doing a lot better.

369
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,439
We'll be moving him to the recovery room.

370
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,759
Yes.

371
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,919
Thank you!

372
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,079
You've been sleeping for days now.

373
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,239
When will you wake up?

374
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,999
Can you wake up to hear the answer to your question?

375
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,639
I want to marry you

376
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,479
and l promise

377
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,639
never to let go of your hand.

378
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,319
Lunch Khun Orn.

379
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,079
I'll put it in front of your room then.

380
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,759
How will you survive if you won't eat anything?

381
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,239
Bunga.

382
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,879
Yes?

383
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,638
She didn't eat anything at all?

384
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,638
Yes.

385
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,599
How long?

386
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,599
A few days now.

387
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,239
Khun Orn refuses to eat anything

388
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,479
I knocked on her door but she wouldn't open it.

389
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,119
Orn.

390
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,639
Hurry!

391
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,919
Orn.

392
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,919
The patient overdosed.

393
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,959
Nus.

394
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,959
I bought you dinner.

395
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,759
Come eat.

396
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,119
I bought extra for tomorrow too.

397
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,479
You got paid and this is what you want me to eat?

398
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,839
The money

399
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,119
is saved for the rent, water, and electric bill.

400
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,599
We can't splurge.

401
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,439
Why?

402
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,159
It's the end of the month where you get paid so we should be eating good food!

403
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,079
We're not rich.

404
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,319
We need to save!

405
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,119
Save?!

406
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,519
I used to live an easy life!

407
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,159
I can pay whatever I want to wear and eat!

408
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,639
But now l have to spend only five, ten baht on things?!

409
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,919
Then get a job! Help me earn some money!

410
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,639
-So you'll have money to spend!
-l want it easy!

411
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,479
If I knew I was going to struggle, I wouldn't have come!

412
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,959
If you want it easy,

413
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,319
you don't want to work, you want money to spend then find a new man!

414
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,959
Thank you

415
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,159
for not letting go of my hand.

416
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,359
What are you doing?

417
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,479
Can you come up and sleep with me?

418
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,479
No.

419
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,599
You'll be in pain.

420
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,519
Cuddling you

421
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,319
will make me heal faster.

422
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,359
It hurts?

423
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,319
I'm sorry.

424
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,599
You see?

425
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,999
I told you you were going to be in pain.

426
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,239
A little.

427
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,119
Can you scoot closer?

428
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,959
I've missed you so much

429
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,319
By the time you woke up.

430
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,759
do you realize how long you've slept?

431
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,239
No.

432
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,439
But it feels like

433
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,479
I haven't hugged you in so long

434
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,119
If it's that long.

435
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,999
do you have an answer for me?

436
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,159
If you can marry-me for real.

437
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,999
I think l heard you say yes

438
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,999
But I don't know if I was dreaming or not.

439
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,439
You weren't dreaming.

440
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,119
Can you look at me?

441
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,439
Will you marry me?

442
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,079
Nodding

443
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,919
means okay?

444
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,159
Yes.

445
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,839
How's Ran doing?

446
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,279
Still not home.

447
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,959
I think he's not awake yet.

448
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,279
Can you visit him?

449
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,079
Why?

450
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,839
If he's not awake yet,

451
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,679
go make him not wake up anymore.

452
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,239
But I went to shoot him just like you told me to.

453
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,799
I thought you said it will be over?

454
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,799
I told you if he's not dead,

455
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,479
the debt isn't off.

456
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,239
But if I do it right now

457
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,279
Pim will know that it's me.

458
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,279
If he won't die

459
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,119
then you will.

460
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,479
Why did you do this to yourself?

461
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,799
I don't want to wake up anymore

462
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,919
You shouldn't have brought me to the hospital

463
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,759
Because of Ran?

464
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,519
Or because of his wife?

465
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,119
Latching on to him like a tick

466
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,079
If she was n't around

467
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,839
you will be much happier right?

468
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,639
You won't hurt yourself either.

469
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,319
If you want him.

470
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,839
you have to get him

471
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,759
Don't care about whether it's right or wrong.

472
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,679
If you really ran out of options,

473
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,359
my guys can help end this problem.

474
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,799
Just let me know.

475
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,759
I will help you.

476
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,599
<i>You ran out of money?</i>

477
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,479
<i>Is that why you're back?</i>

478
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,519
<i>You can leave.</i>

479
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,839
<i>I came to visit you but you're kicking me out. Isn't that kind of rude?</i>

480
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,839
<i>To someone like you,</i>

481
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,839
<i>I don't need to have manners!</i>

482
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,839
<i>Get well soon.</i>

483
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,799
<i>Take care of the people around you.</i>

484
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,479
<i>If you know you don't suit P'Ran,</i>

485
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,479
<i>then break up with him!</i>

486
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,239
<i>You're pregnant.</i>

487
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:26,400
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

488
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:34,860
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

489
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:40,260
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

490
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,800
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

491
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:52,240
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
