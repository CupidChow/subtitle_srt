1
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,320
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,360
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,760
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,360
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,600
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,359
It's because you act this way

13
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,479
that's why I don't like you.

14
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,479
But you still come here often.

15
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,239
But l wouldn't want to marry you.

16
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,279
But you want to marry Ran?

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,359
Yes.

18
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,999
If he chose you,

19
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,079
you wouldn't be sleeping in my bed like this.

20
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,959
I'm leaving now.

21
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,359
Drive safe.

22
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,839
I know!

23
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,679
Just make sure you do what you say you will do.

24
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,999
When that time comes, I might not have to sleep on this bed anymore.

25
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,319
Oh the bone broth smells so good.

26
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,319
Praising yourself.

27
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,359
Do you need me to go help you tidy Khun Ran's room today?

28
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,078
There's no need.

29
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,559
Oh?

30
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,639
You want to see the battlefield I've told you about right?

31
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,679
This girl!

32
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,439
Whose business do I meddle in if not my boss?

33
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,439
Hey look if they get it on every day like this,

34
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,919
we will be holding a young boss pretty soon!

35
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,439
For this morning's war, I'm not sure if they will end up on the sofa or desk.

36
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,159
I don't want to think about it
-What war?!

37
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,319
Oh no!

38
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,959
What is it Taew?

39
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,679
Hmm?

40
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,239
Noi don't.

41
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,359
Stay put.

42
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,079
Tell me right now!

43
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,799
When I went to clean Khun Ran's room the other day...

44
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,959
They have a bedroom.

45
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,599
Why get it on on the sofa?

46
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,279
The desk too?

47
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,439
Absurd!

48
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,959
Is that girl's...

49
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,079
type this way? Is that why Ran likes her?

50
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,279
Ow! Be gentle!

51
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,319
In the morning already?!

52
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,079
Why do you have to be so rough?

53
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,319
Ow!

54
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,519
Good morning Chuda!

55
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,759
Good morning Grandma. What are you doing?

56
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,359
Nothing. Come on kids, let's go with me.

57
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,439
But we haven't good morning kiss Daddy yet.

58
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,639
We have n't given Daddy his good morning kiss yet.

59
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,439
You don't need to do that today.

60
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,919
Daddy is kissing someone else right now.

61
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,279
Huh?!

62
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,799
Come, Let's go wait for him down stairs.

63
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,439
Watch your steps.

64
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,519
Ow!

65
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,439
Who taught you to pour alcohol on fresh wound?!

66
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,799
Why?

67
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,599
It stings! Geez!

68
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,639
Here.

69
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,279
Rub medicine on.

70
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,079
You don't need to do it.

71
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,799
You make it sting. I'll do it myself.

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,759
If you won't use alcohol then what do you want to use?

73
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,119
Saline.

74
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,439
I'll put saline on you then.

75
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,359
This is better.

76
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,159
Done. Let's go down stairs to eat.

77
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,959
Aunt Chu is this kind of person.

78
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,279
She might have a bad mouth

79
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,439
-but she's kind 
-Only to you.

80
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,279
To me, she has a bad mouth.

81
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,719
Bad heart too.

82
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,079
You have me.

83
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,839
You'll be fine.

84
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,799
Daddy! Mommy!

85
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,839
Morning!

86
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,279
You didn't go give me a good morning kiss today.

87
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,479
Grandma didn't let us.

88
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,999
P'Pim,can I go play with the sheep?

89
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,679
-Sure.
-Can you go with us?

90
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,839
Sure.

91
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,239
-Yay!
-Let P'Pim eat first.

92
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,759
After she sends me off to work,
she will catch up to you guys.

93
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,479
-Okay!
-Okay!

94
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,119
Come on let's go!

95
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,479
-Let's go play with the sheep
-You come sit next to me.

96
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,319
Whatever you two do, do not let it be so obscene.

97
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,919
Know how to be embarrassed for the old lady in this house.

98
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,759
What did I do?

99
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,319
You don't know?!

100
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,519
I don't.

101
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,519
I don't know anything.

102
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,759
The servants in this house was talking about 
how you two were having sex in the office.

103
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,959
Take down your newlyweds activities a notch.

104
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,919
Okay.

105
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,679
But...

106
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,679
I won't make it obscene next time.

107
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,519
But you and l didn't --

108
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,279
We didn't do what she thinks we did.

109
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,079
It's better to let her think that way.

110
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,799
As a married couple, we need to have sex.

111
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,239
Especially for newly weds,

112
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,639
it's not strange to do it from morning til night.

113
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,439
Then walk me out to the front.

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,759
Why do l have to walk you out?
Just go wherever you need to go.

115
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,799
I can't.

116
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,919
You need to walk me out every time.

117
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,359
Kiss me on the cheek

118
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,159
and say "have fun with work honey."

119
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,479
Are you insane?!

120
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,279
Are you lacking love?

121
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,479
When I get home,

122
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,839
no matter where you are,

123
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,679
you need to rush over to see me with excitement.

124
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,839
Then you need to say " You're home, honey?"

125
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,239
Give me your cheek sol can kiss it too.

126
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,639
Wow!

127
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,639
Did your mother let you watch too much TV as a kid?

128
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,599
No one does that!

129
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,159
So people will think we love each other very much.

130
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,519
Kiss my cheek.

131
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,359
Huh?!

132
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,359
Give me a kiss on the cheek.

133
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,639
There's no one around so why do I have to?

134
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,919
So you can get used to it.

135
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,519
Where are you going P'Ran?

136
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,319
There were people trying to cut
 down trees in the mountains.

137
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,359
I'm going to go check it out.

138
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,999
I'll take off.

139
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,679
Bye honey.

140
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,159
Take care of the house for me.

141
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,679
Bye.

142
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,239
What's up?

143
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,959
What hotel did P'Ran find you in last night?

144
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,319
I didn't go to a hotel.

145
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,959
You were gone with Nai.

146
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,479
What did you guys go do?

147
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,599
Shameless!

148
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,839
Who's the shameless one here?

149
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,839
I'm not boy crazy like you.

150
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,519
You already know he's married and yet here you are chasing after him.

151
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,359
I didn't just get here.

152
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,159
But I know these people before a wife who sells her body like you showed up looking pitiful!

153
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,159
You married for money

154
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,959
The word prostitution suits you better.

155
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,479
-Pim!
-Do not insult me!

156
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,439
I might be poor but I'm not selling my body

157
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,679
If you are Khun Ran's girlfriend you need to accept

158
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,239
that he didn't pick you as his wife!

159
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,239
That's enough Pim!

160
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,919
Don't use your low life behavior around here!

161
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,479
Auntie.

162
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,279
Orn.

163
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,679
I saw her slapped you.

164
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,759
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

165
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,639
But she bad mouthed me first.

166
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,319
I said enough!

167
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,079
Go wait for me in the house.

168
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,159
I need to talk to you.

169
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,839
How are you?

170
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,759
-It hurts a lot?
-I'm fine Auntie.

171
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,479
Thanks Uncle.

172
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:21,919
Sure.

173
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,759
Do you want me to gather the workers at the farm?

174
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,800
It's okay.

175
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Let e go check it out first then we'll discuss it.

176
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,159
Okay

177
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,759
You think you're Ran's wife

178
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,759
you can do anything you want?

179
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,079
I for one won't accept that you're the lady of this house.

180
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,078
But I never thought of being the lady of this house though.

181
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,318
You're poor,

182
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,759
we're rich. You have nothing

183
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,759
But not my family

184
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,838
I might have nothing but I have dignity.

185
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,119
Dignity?

186
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,279
Having dignity by being out with a man all day and night

187
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,598
and then ended up trapping him?

188
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,959
That's what Khun Ran told you?

189
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,439
May be.

190
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,959
Why else would I say it?

191
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,440
Ran was probably scared to be honest with you.

192
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,079
He only married you out of responsibility 
for being out with you all day and night.

193
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,479
He probably wanted to save your image when he didn't have to.

194
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,479
You don't have parents.

195
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,599
You don't have any social friends.

196
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,639
If he dumped you after he slept with you no one will care.

197
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,679
You're trying to say

198
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,319
Khun Ran doesn't have to marry me?

199
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,359
That's right.

200
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,279
How much do you want for the divorce?

201
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,999
Didn't you marry for money?

202
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,239
Take the money today. How much do you think you're worth

203
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,239
if you have to divorce today?

204
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,319
Divorce?

205
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,319
<i>I give you back the land.</i>

206
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,799
<i>In exchange for what?</i>

207
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,679
<i>For a period of one year,</i>

208
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,759
<i>you have to be my wife.</i>

209
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,679
<i>...and also mom duties. Look after me and the twins.</i>

210
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,119
Is 500K enough?

211
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,639
P'Pim!

212
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,279
I've been waiting long for you.

213
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,999
Mafeuang.

214
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,759
P'Pim is talking to me right now.

215
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,759
Why is P'Orn eavesdropping then?

216
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,239
Really?

217
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,959
I wanted to ask you what time will P'Ran be back?

218
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,159
I don't know if I should wait or not.

219
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,999
Ma'am.

220
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,279
What you asked me, I won't accept it.

221
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,319
Accept what?

222
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,280
-Mafeuang, you've been waiting long for me right?
-Yes.

223
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,599
Let's go play with the sheep then.

224
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,999
Let's go.

225
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,119
You think you won't get a divorce if the kid gets attached to you?

226
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,679
Let's go.

227
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,079
What were you talking to Pim about?
She looked sullen walking out of here.

228
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,319
I wanted to pay her so she can divorce Ran.

229
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,119
And will Pim agree to that?

230
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,919
She seemed like she wanted to take the 500K.

231
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,919
But I don't know why she changed her mind.

232
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,639
I have to lose the land and the 500K

233
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,239
to this family for free again?

234
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,239
This family has left unpaid debt in the millions.

235
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,239
When her parents came to take out a loan, they didn't pay you back.

236
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,679
<i>Please give me some more time.</i>

237
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,159
<i>I know that the money I borrowed is a lot.</i>

238
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,999
<i>I've postponed the payment for over a month now.</i>

239
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,079
<i>But I still need to pay the employees their salaries too.</i>

240
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,839
<i>So there's not enough to pay you back..</i>

241
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,359
<i>But why didn't you guys answer my subordinate's phone call?</i>

242
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,319
<i>My subordinate said he couldn't get a hold of you.</i>

243
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,239
<i>I don't have the money yet so I was scared to answer.</i>

244
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,679
<i>By doing this,</i>

245
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,599
<i>it's like you're avoiding me.</i>

246
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,759
<i>Can we have another month?</i>

247
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,839
<i>At the end of this month, we will handle it for you.</i>

248
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,679
They paid off the debt by dying already

249
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,760
There's just Ravee left.

250
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,279
Did he not learn from his parents

251
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,119
of what happens if he can't pay me back the money he borrowed?

252
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,799
Did you find the person we sent to look for in Bangkok?

253
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,399
No.

254
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,039
He couldn't have gone far

255
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,239
Give our men his photo.

256
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,319
If anyone finds him,

257
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,439
I have a reward for them

258
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,439
I will beat him to death.

259
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,359
I don't want it to grow up!

260
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,079
They'll have to grow up big like you

261
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,319
That's right.

262
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,639
Eat a lot so you can grow up faster!

263
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,119
Do you two want to eat with the sheep here?

264
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,359
Yes!

265
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,959
-Do you want to?
-Yes!

266
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,359
I'll go bring the food here.

267
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,959
That's okay.

268
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,919
I'll get it.

269
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,639
-You stay with the kids here.
-Okay

270
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,279
Do you want to go drink water?

271
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,279
You're all sweating.

272
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,639
Let's drink some water.

273
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,519
Mafeuang!

274
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,839
Khun Pim!

275
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,599
P'Pim!

276
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,959
-You put it in the same place?
-It's all done.

277
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,439
Danai.

278
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,999
Hello Auntie.

279
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,519
Where did you take Pim yesterday?

280
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,239
You were gone until dark.

281
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,519
I just dropped Pim off in front of her farm.

282
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,999
She wanted to get off.

283
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,799
Sol didn't walk her to her house.

284
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,839
Ma'am!

285
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,639
Khun Feuang got hit by a horse!

286
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,639
What?! Is she okay?!

287
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,999
She's fine but Khun Pim got hit by the horse that she's unconscious right now.

288
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,479
Oh!

289
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,919
-Rong, take the car there right now
-Okay

290
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,759
Sure

291
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,799
Take my car.

292
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,679
-You lead the way
-Sure.

293
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,479
-Khun Pim!
-P'Pim!

294
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,959
P'Pim!

295
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,239
P'Jam.

296
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,799
What's wrong with P'Pim?

297
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,799
Khun Pim!

298
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,799
Mafeuang, were you startled?

299
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,279
P'Pim won't wake up.

300
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,799
Pim shouldn't have pushed Mafeuang.
I was going to pull the horse back.

301
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,239
If everyone stayed put, no one would have gotten hurt.

302
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,519
P'Pim pushed me to evade the horse.

303
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,959
Pim!

304
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,359
Pim! Pim!

305
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,759
Are you alright kids?!

306
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,159
Grand ma, P'Pim hasn't moved yet.

307
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,999
-Let me take a look at you.
-I'm taking Pim to the hospital.

308
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,839
Okay.

309
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,959
-I'm coming to o!
-No you can't.

310
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,519
She pushed you so the horse can hit you and you're going to worry about her?

311
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,919
Pim pushed Mafeuang so the horse can hit her?

312
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,319
-Ma'am.
-There's going to be a problem.

313
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,159
Grandma.

314
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,679
It's okay. I understand everything now.

315
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,759
It's fresh and hot!

316
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,519
Come eat.

317
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,759
What a fake bitch!

318
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,759
She intentionally rode the horse to hit her!

319
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,359
When it comes to Khun Orn, I've seen it with my own eyes!

320
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,679
She's definitely a fake bitch!

321
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,799
What you just told us,

322
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,839
I have no doubt.

323
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,959
A million percent true!

324
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,799
Oh Uncle, is Ma'am going to go visit Khun Pim at the hospital?

325
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,359
She didn't go at all?

326
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,239
No.

327
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,439
She took the kids home though.

328
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,639
Then why are you stressed?

329
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,999
You're stressing out as if your wife died

330
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,839
If my wife died, I wouldn't be stressed.

331
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,519
I will close the farm and have a big celebration.

332
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,359
You're going to have a party?

333
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,319
Yeah.

334
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,239
You want a party? How about having my foot first?!

335
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,319
-Take that!
-Mom!

336
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,959
I was kidding but you got so serious! Geez!

337
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,520
I was just kidding.

338
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,519
So why are you stressed?

339
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,359
That Khun Ran might scold me.

340
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,679
Why would he scold you?

341
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,239
I was busy with the fertilizers.

342
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,359
Sol didn't stop Khun Orn from taking the horse.

343
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,479
Will you tell him?

344
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,519
Oh I forgot.

345
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,959
I have to tell him. See you later

346
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,239
I have to tell Khun Ran!

347
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,839
-You're not going to eat?
-Yeah Dad.

348
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,519
Pim.

349
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,239
Mafeuang.

350
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,959
You're awake?

351
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,159
Where's Mafeuang?

352
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,479
Mafeuang is safe.

353
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,639
But you passed out and is now just waking up.

354
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,319
Where's the others?

355
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,279
No one is here.

356
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,079
Just me.

357
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,279
I brought you here.

358
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,479
You're injured. Don't get up yet

359
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,479
You fractured your ribs.

360
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,999
It's not broken though. Don't worry.

361
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,279
The rest are just bruises.

362
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,919
Will the doctor let me go home?

363
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,159
Sure.

364
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,279
But they have to monitor you for the night.

365
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,759
If you're okay then you can go home tomorrow.

366
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,959
Thank you for bringing me to the hospital.

367
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,479
Sure.

368
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,279
I'm fine now.

369
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,479
You can leave first.

370
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,479
I can be alone.

371
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,279
That's okay.

372
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,960
I'll stay.

373
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,159
In case you need something.

374
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,119
But I can manage

375
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,319
Even if you can manage,

376
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,119
but I'm worried about you.

377
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,479
You're a small girl.

378
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,599
Even with minor injuries, it doesn't make me feel good.

379
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,639
Let me stay.

380
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,639
Don't be stubborn

381
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,279
Okay.

382
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,439
Does it still hurt?

383
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,759
A little.

384
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,999
It's okay Orn.

385
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,759
What she did is not acceptable.

386
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,799
Where's Mafeuang and Pim at?

387
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,999
Mafeuang is sleeping upstairs.

388
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,679
How did you find out?

389
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,359
Uncle Rong came to tell me.

390
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,239
He reports to you quick when it comes to these things.

391
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,439
What happened?

392
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,519
Orn took the horse to go see the kids where the sheep was.

393
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,759
Where did you take the horse from?

394
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,479
The stable.

395
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,759
I saw that it was a long walk sol took the horse

396
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,319
The horse situation isn't important

397
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,239
What's important is

398
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,759
Pim pushed Mafeuang so the horse can run her over.

399
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,159
But messed up so she got herself injured

400
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,159
Why would Pim do that?

401
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,319
She's using the kids as tools so she can live here longer.

402
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,479
That girl is very aggressive.

403
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,799
She just doesn't do it in front of you.

404
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,959
Aggressive how?

405
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,799
She slapped Orn. I saw her do it.

406
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,319
Where is Pim right now?

407
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,679
Nai took her to the hospital.

408
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,359
Pim sure is charming.

409
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,479
I pity Nai who is in love with a married woman.

410
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,519
The truth is

411
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,079
if Pim gets a divorce,

412
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,439
and Nai doesn't mind that she was once married,

413
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,799
those two would be a good couple.

414
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,159
You're going to pave way for those two?

415
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,079
What do you think?

416
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,359
Here.

417
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,639
Did Pim really go with Nai?

418
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,280
Yes.

419
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,599
But Jam told me that

420
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,799
-Pim pushed--
-I know!

421
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,359
Aunt Chu told me.

422
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,159
You didn't let me finish!

423
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,919
Oh Pim, what karma did you commit to be unfortunate like this?

424
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,638
Go to sleep.

425
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,158
I'll stay here with you.

426
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,479
P'Ran.

427
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,119
What are you guys doing huh?!

428
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,239
If you're going to do this,

429
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,239
don't address me as your senior.

430
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,799
Thanks for dropping off my wife.

431
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,519
But she's my wife.

432
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,479
I'll look after her.

433
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,359
P'Nai just dropped me off.

434
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,479
But I'm your husband!

435
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,919
What kind of husband look after their wife like this?

436
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,839
Hmm?

437
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,479
If you still consider me your brother,

438
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,679
you can leave!

439
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,519
Do not mess with my family!

440
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,079
When there's something unusual

441
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,599
about this family of yours?

442
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,279
And the reason you won't let me get involved

443
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,359
is because you're scared.

444
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,279
Scared I'll know what's unusual about it

445
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,679
But I'm not stupid.

446
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,279
But I think

447
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,359
I'm not the only one

448
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:03,599
that is curious when you fell in love with Pim to even marry her.

449
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,519
Just be careful.

450
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,959
Why did you push Mafeuang so the horse can hit her?

451
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,359
I didn't.

452
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,519
You didn't?

453
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,119
But everyone said that.

454
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,279
Because those people don't like me!

455
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,239
The person that told you, were they there?

456
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,079
Yes.

457
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,119
Who?

458
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,679
Aunt Chu and Orn.

459
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,279
If you're going to listen to your ex,

460
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,919
you can leave.

461
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,319
You're chasing me away

462
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,759
so that Nai can come watch over you right?!

463
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,119
The reason I'm telling you to leave

464
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,519
is because you're siding with your ex!

465
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,759
If you're going to listen to her then don't come pick a fight with me.

466
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,000
If you want to get back with her then call off our contract.

467
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,679
Just give me back my property today.

468
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,599
I don't understand it either.

469
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,359
If you don't like me and you still love Khun Orn that much,

470
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,479
why force me to marry you?!

471
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,759
I will never let you go

472
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,919
until one year is up.

473
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,839
You mean...

474
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,439
if I can't find the money to buy the land back, you won't call off the contract?

475
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,239
Yes.

476
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,439
You're insane!

477
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,119
Stay and wait for him first, Don't leave yet.

478
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,799
Okay.

479
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,959
Good so you can stay and have dinner with me.

480
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,159
Grandma!

481
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,079
You're awake kids?

482
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,599
How are you? Does it still hurt?

483
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,639
No.

484
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,079
Can I go visit P'Pim at the hospital?

485
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,159
Why go visit her?

486
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,359
P'Pim got hit by the horse.

487
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,959
Oh.

488
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,119
Taew.

489
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,759
-Where's the kids?
Inside.

490
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,359
P'Pim pushed you so that you can get hit by the horse.

491
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,519
But she messed up.

492
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,439
You still want to go visit her?

493
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,759
How were you watching her to let her do that?

494
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,959
No Grandma.

495
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,439
Listen to me first.

496
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,959
Forget it Auntie. It's in the past now.

497
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,639
The kids will just have nightmares.

498
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,279
But P'Pim really pushed you right Mafeuang?

499
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,999
Yes.

500
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,759
She pushed me so that I wouldn't get hit by the horse.

501
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,519
So P'Pim got hit by the horse and flew far back!

502
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,599
Huh?

503
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,359
You just let me be the insane one.

504
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:51,079
But why did Uncle Rong said Pim pushed her?

505
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,319
Why didn't you tell him everything?

506
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,479
Huh?!

507
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,239
Why do you have a mouth for?!

508
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,759
Gosh calm down Noi!

509
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,599
I wanted to tell him but he just started the car and took off.

510
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,679
Geez.

511
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,440
With Khun Ran being temperamental like this,

512
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,799
Pim is going to be in trouble.

513
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,519
Khun Ran came to get some clothes.
I think he will stay i at the hospital.

514
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,999
To watch over Pim?

515
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,359
Really?

516
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,319
Should l go tell him everything then?

517
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,479
Good.

518
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,759
Okay.

519
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,439
You tell me everything.

520
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,159
I didn't try to run over anyone P'Ran.

521
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,079
Really?

522
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,679
The horse just went crazy.

523
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,239
So why did you blame Pim?

524
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,119
I didn't blame her.

525
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,519
It's what I saw.

526
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,599
Orn probably didn't mean to do it.

527
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,479
Orn loves the kids. Why would she do it on purpose?

528
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,759
It's true P'Ran.

529
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,799
I would never hurt the kids.

530
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,519
But you and Aunt Chu

531
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,519
made me misunderstood Pim.

532
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,839
I also saw that Khun Pim pushed
Mafeuang so that the horse doesn't hit her.

533
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,999
Huh? Why didn't you say anything?!

534
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,639
You let everyone misunderstood for so long!

535
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,159
Because you only listened to POrn!

536
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,999
She was lying and you believed her.

537
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,519
It's true P'Jam!

538
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,439
P'Orn probably didn't mean to lie It was just a misunderstanding.

539
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,479
But the one that understood I just stayed quiet and didn't say one word!

540
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,479
Seriously you!

541
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,839
I'm embarrassed now!

542
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,119
I got humiliated because of you!

543
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,439
Seriously!

544
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,759
She was the gullible one and is now blaming other people?

545
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,319
Khun Orn probably thinks the kids won't know anything.

546
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,519
These kids knows better than the adults!

547
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,519
What did you say P'Jam?

548
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,079
Knows better than the adults.

549
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,759
They sure do know.

550
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,479
Smart!

551
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,239
That's enough. Why drink so much?

552
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,159
Are you crazy?!

553
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,319
Sol can no longer feel pissed!

554
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,319
Once you sober up you'll feel pissed again.

555
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,519
Orn.

556
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,999
You were trying to run Pim over weren't you?

557
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,119
Yeah.

558
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,639
It was on purpose!

559
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,639
I knew it.

560
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,279
Knew what?

561
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,679
Someone like you shouldn't have missed

562
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,359
I've known you since we were kids.

563
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,439
I know you ride horses and you're going to say...

564
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,479
the horse was out of control and you couldn't tame it. Impossible.

565
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,079
-Put it in my tab.
-Okay.

566
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,079
My treat.

567
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,999
Without Ran, you and I would be great competitors.<i></i>

568
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,479
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

569
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,359
<i>Just act like you didn't see</i>

570
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,439
<i>if l were to do it.</i>

571
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,239
<i>How fortunate that I didn't press charges on
 you for trying to rape my wife the other day?</i>

572
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,079
<i>Don't mess with my wife again.</i>

573
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:48,000
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

574
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:56,460
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

575
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,860
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

576
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,400
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

577
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:13,840
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
