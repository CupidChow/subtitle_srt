00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,320
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,360
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,760
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,360
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,600
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,759
No matter what you say.

13
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,758
I won't join hands with you.

14
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,079
I know you want Pim too.

15
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,999
So why are you talking to me?

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,079
Because we have the same enemy.

17
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,799
P'Ran?

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,079
Yeah.

19
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,799
Ran isn't playing by the books

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,159
He trapped the girl into marrying him when probably she doesn't want to.

21
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,519
Without Ran,

22
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,479
you and I would be great competitors.

23
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,519
I'm sorry

24
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,839
for being temperamental

25
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,959
and bad mouthed you like that.

26
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,439
If Grandpa Ruj found out

27
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,959
I did that to you,

28
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,279
he would probably think

29
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,439
he entrusted his granddaughter to the wrong person.

30
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,279
I didn't want to be temperamental

31
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,599
But I saw you with Nai.

32
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,959
I couldn't stand it

33
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,639
The way Nai looks at you

34
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,799
tells me...

35
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,999
he likes you a lot.

36
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,639
You didn't seem to reject him

37
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,119
I'm just scared that

38
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,439
you will end up liking him.

39
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,839
Khun!

40
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,879
Why are you doing this at a hospital?!

41
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,319
Why are you smiling?!

42
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,919
I don't want to wake up.

43
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,159
Visitors can not sleep on the patient's bed.

44
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,599
Right.

45
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,359
It's just..

46
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,959
I'm sorry.

47
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,639
I just want to cuddle her.

48
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,119
I couldn't go to sleep alone

49
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,079
Your medication before breakfast.

50
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,919
He's cute. He's a big guy but can't sleep alone.

51
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,439
When can the doctor let me go home?

52
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,319
The doctor already prescribe your medicine.

53
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,599
If you want to go home, you can just go pay for your medications and then leave.

54
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,839
Sol can finally cuddle my wife tonight without breaking any rules?

55
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,119
Stop!

56
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,759
That hurts!

57
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,119
So cute.

58
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,839
Yeah, I came to visit Pim.

59
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,799
Gosh!

60
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,279
Why visit her?

61
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,999
Her husband will kick you out. You won't get to visit her.

62
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,839
I just came to check if her condition has gotten better or not.

63
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,639
Up to you.

64
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,599
Hey.

65
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,799
I have to go.

66
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,079
Khun Tin's men?

67
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,679
<i>Ran isn't playing by the books.</i>

68
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,079
<i>He trapped the girl into marrying him when probably she doesn't want to.</i>

69
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,239
<i>Without Ran,</i>

70
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,759
<i>you and I would be great competitors.</i>

71
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,158
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

72
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,999
<i>But let me tell you first. I won't do anything illegal</i>

73
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,159
<i>You don't have to do anything.</i>

74
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,479
<i>Just pretend you didn't see anything</i>

75
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,839
<i>if I were to do something.</i>

76
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,079
The truth is you didn't have to pick me up. I can get home on my own.

77
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,119
Hey.

78
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,919
As a husband, it's my job to look after my wife.

79
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,599
Really?

80
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,759
You didn't do your job yesterday

81
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,479
But you sure did a great job as the ex-boyfriend.

82
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,240
I didn't know.

83
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,439
You didn't know

84
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,319
but scolded me first?

85
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,599
I'm sorry.

86
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,639
The basics of living together

87
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,759
is trusting each other.

88
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,919
But sometimes you can't be trusted.

89
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,959
P'Nai just brought me to the hospital

90
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,519
If he didn't,

91
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,359
your family would have just left me there.

92
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,759
To be frank,you should be thanking him

93
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,679
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

94
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,839
Can we leave yet?

95
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,079
About Grandpa's land...

96
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,319
About that,

97
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,679
I stand by my word that I won't take your money.

98
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,799
You must stay with me for one year.

99
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,639
Then our contract will be completely finished.

100
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,159
What's wrong?

101
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,799
Is it that uncomfortable living with me?

102
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,799
I'm more uncomfortable being around your family.

103
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,119
Are you still in pain?

104
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,959
Let's just go.

105
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,679
If I stay any longer,

106
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,159
your aunt will think I'm weak and need you to take care of me.

107
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,959
I'm here for the patient.

108
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,279
I'll push her.

109
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,239
Sure.

110
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,679
Alright.

111
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,319
Stay with me for a year.

112
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,119
Just try to tolerate me.

113
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,759
-Come with us.
-Hey

114
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,959
Why didn't you push the patient?

115
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,079
-He wanted to do it.
-Oh really?

116
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,319
-They're the ones I said were cuddling.
-Oh yeah?

117
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,239
Like this

118
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,639
Get well soon.

119
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,519
You don't have to sleep alone tonight.

120
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,279
-Good luck.
--Thank you.

121
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,599
They're such acute couple!

122
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,239
"Thank you"

123
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,359
They said to get well soon.

124
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,639
You sure they don't mean how you don't have to sleep alone?

125
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,279
That's something to be thankful for.

126
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,919
But it's true, I slept with you for one night.

127
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,079
From now on,

128
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,279
I probably can't sleep alone anymore.

129
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,159
If it were me, I would not mention having fractured ribs.

130
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,319
Why?

131
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,279
Your husband will come stay with you from morning til night?

132
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,279
No. It's because he kicked me.

133
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,159
Hey. Hey.

134
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,159
What? Your husband will kick you too?

135
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,079
No. The medicine bag!

136
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,079
-It was for that patient!
-Hurry up and go give it to them!

137
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,319
Before we go home, I need to run errands first.

138
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,799
Up to you.

139
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,479
You're the boss.

140
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,639
Whatever you say or do, I must obey you anyway

141
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,439
In the contract, it says you're my wife not slave

142
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,639
Here he comes!

143
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,359
Thank you. I completely forgot too.

144
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,479
I'll take the wheelchair back now.

145
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,239
Okay.

146
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,239
-Thank you so much
-Sure.

147
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,479
Can you grab the document from the car?

148
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,639
Sure.

149
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,679
He went there by himself so why couldn't you kill him?!

150
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,119
This 500K is for you

151
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,839
so you'll stop thinking that you bought my wife.

152
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,999
The more you're possessive,

153
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,999
the morel want her

154
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,319
Hey!

155
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,119
How fortunate that I didn't press charges on you for trying to rape my wife the other day?

156
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,799
Even hell

157
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,919
doesn't want someone like you.

158
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,519
Hell doesn't want me

159
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,759
but if your wife gave me a try just once,

160
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,919
she might want to go for seconds.

161
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,919
I'm calling the cops if you won't stop!

162
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,839
So they can come arrest your husband for trespassing?

163
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,479
To arrest you

164
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,279
for assaulting me the other day.

165
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,639
Hey that's enough!

166
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,639
I don't want him to be a ghost in my farm

167
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,159
Don't mess with my wife again.

168
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,999
Are you in pain?

169
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,999
Thank you.

170
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,919
Don't thank me.

171
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,919
You'll have to sign the contract regarding that money anyway.

172
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,799
You're home Ran?

173
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,919
You're feeling better?

174
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,639
Yes.

175
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,359
Thank you for saving Mafeuang yesterday.

176
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,359
Sure.

177
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,239
I'm sorry for misunderstanding

178
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,959
that you pushed Mafeuang to the horse.

179
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,159
No problem.

180
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,839
Ill take Pim to go put our things away.

181
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,479
Okay.

182
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,519
Let's go.

183
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,319
You can shower and then get some rest.

184
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,159
What about you?

185
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,079
Do you want me to clean your wound first?

186
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,319
It's okay.

187
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,239
Where are you going?

188
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,599
To my office to write up the contract for you to sign.

189
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,919
In regards to paying Tinnamai 500K.

190
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,279
Wow!

191
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,919
You seem to care about the benefit before anything like always.

192
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,839
It's my money.

193
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,479
If I don't pay then I get benefits,

194
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,639
what should I get?

195
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,519
Diploma?

196
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,959
Declaration of good merit or what?

197
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,519
I shouldn't have considered you a good person!

198
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,959
You're no different from Tinnamai!

199
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,159
-Daddy!
-What's up kids?

200
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,599
Daddy, where's P'Pim?

201
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,479
I told them to wait but they refused.

202
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,319
Can we go see P'Pim?

203
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,759
She's upstairs

204
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,679
You can go see her but don't play so rough

205
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,839
She's in pain.

206
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,439
Khun Pim is still in pain?

207
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,439
Jam.

208
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,319
Watch the kids

209
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,239
Her ribs are fractured.

210
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,519
She probably can't carry the kids yet

211
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,119
Sure.

212
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,999
-Do not let P'Pim carry you.
-A huh.

213
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,079
Good job.

214
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,639
Don't run!

215
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,839
What do you want?!

216
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,079
Do you miss me?

217
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,359
Does it hurt?

218
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,319
Is the pain gone?

219
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,319
Do you want to come inside and play?

220
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,319
-Come in.
-Yay!

221
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,079
Are you really going to be our mommy?

222
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,599
P'Pim will help your father look after you two.

223
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,159
But P'Orn said P'Pim will be our evil stepmother.

224
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,200
Do you think I'm evil?

225
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,799
When you think I'm evil,

226
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,279
just tell me.

227
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,239
Okay?

228
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,639
You're not evil but P'Orn is.

229
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,999
She squeezed my arm really hard.

230
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,799
She squeezed your arm?!

231
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,519
Where did she squeezed you?

232
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,519
Right here.

233
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,159
If she does it again let me know.

234
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,439
I'll handle it.

235
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,279
Okay

236
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,079
I told you P'Pim isn't the evil stepmother.

237
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,639
Am I right?

238
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,119
Who's there?

239
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,479
Kids.

240
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,159
Go play downstairs.

241
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,999
I need to talk to P'Pim.

242
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,359
Come on kids. Let's go play with the sheep.

243
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,999
come see us after you're done P'Pim.

244
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,479
I can just go with you.

245
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,639
Let's go.

246
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,439
You guys go ahead

247
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,319
P'Pim and I will catch up to you soon.

248
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,599
Let's go.

249
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,839
Here we come sheep!

250
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,079
I have nothing to say to you.

251
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,959
But I do.

252
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,999
Sit.

253
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,159
Sign.

254
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,759
Scared I'll runaway or what? What's the hurry?

255
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,359
I'm scared you will act like your brother.

256
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,319
What about my brother?

257
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,519
What did my brother do to you?

258
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,439
You got the farm.

259
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,079
As for your sister, she left with someone else.

260
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,759
There's many more evil deeds your brother did that you don't know about.

261
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,359
Besides disappearing

262
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,919
and selling you to Tinnamai.

263
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,679
Sign it.

264
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,119
This is too much.

265
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,439
The debt was 500K but the fine is five times more?!

266
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,919
If you don't, do anything scandalous,

267
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,159
commit adultery,

268
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,159
this isn't as scary.

269
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,439
If you do your wife duties well for one year,

270
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,799
you don't need to pay me back the 500K.

271
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,079
The land as well.

272
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,159
It's a win win!

273
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,599
If you're going to do this,

274
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,159
fine.

275
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,359
Within one year according to the contract,

276
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,119
Khun Saran Suriyalaksa,

277
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,599
will not take advantage of Khun
Pimpika Nirachara doesn't consent to.

278
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,919
If Khun Saran Suriyalaksa takes advantage,

279
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,959
everything in this contract is void.

280
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,279
The land and money must go to Khun Pimpika Nirachara.

281
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,359
Are we clear?

282
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,679
You're going to play tricks with me?

283
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,799
What if l didn't do anything to you

284
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,919
and you lie and say that I did?

285
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,519
I'm not that kind of person.

286
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,919
Are you sure

287
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,079
that you're not like your brother?

288
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,999
If you keep your tail in check and not do anything to me,

289
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,439
the contract will not be void.

290
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,599
Am I right?

291
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,599
Khun Ran!

292
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,519
A little kiss like this

293
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,639
isn't taking advantage right?

294
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,279
A smart ass.

295
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,759
Pervert!

296
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,079
It has n't been long and you stole a kiss!

297
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,599
Talking about me?

298
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,479
Mafeuang and Mafai wants us to go together

299
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,799
Look, act like we love each other in front of the kids.

300
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,159
I know!

301
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,639
Why are you holding my hand?!

302
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,359
Well,

303
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,239
so the kids will see we came together from afar.

304
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,359
You're not being smooth at all.

305
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,919
Go for it.

306
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,919
Kids!

307
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,359
P'Pim!

308
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,479
P'Pim, can I take one of them as my pet?

309
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,439
Sure!

310
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,919
Yay!

311
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,599
You can't.

312
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,439
No.

313
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,679
But if they have a pet.

314
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,279
the kids will become gentle

315
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,639
But not sheep!

316
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,479
I'm sure you've had a pet before as a kid.

317
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,479
Are you psychic?

318
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,759
You can see through my past.

319
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,519
But it's not strange that someone like you never had a pet before.

320
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,839
That's why you're so rough like this.

321
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,759
Who said?

322
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,319
I did.

323
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,079
I may have raised horses since I was a kid

324
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,679
but I never took them inside the house.

325
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,159
Mafeuang

326
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,799
Do you want to get a stuffed animal sheep as a pet instead?

327
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,679
Yay!

328
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,239
-You want that?
-Yes l do!

329
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,599
-Okay
-Thank you Daddy!

330
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,679
Thank you Daddy.

331
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,319
We don't have any, It's not as popular anymore so no one sells them.

332
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,839
No one sells it P'Pim

333
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,999
If they don't sell any then should we make our own?

334
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,279
Can we?!

335
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,439
Sure. We have wool.

336
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,279
Won't it hurt the sheep?

337
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,759
No. They like us cutting their fur so they can grow new ones.

338
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,999
Hey Khun.

339
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,479
Don't blabber nonsense.

340
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,479
You know how to make stuffed animals or what?

341
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,239
Where is the embroidery department?

342
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,959
The second floor.

343
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,319
He didn't make a report but he had you put it in the record book?

344
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,119
You let him do it Inspector?!

345
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,439
Yes he didn't file a report.

346
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,119
He just had me write it in the journal.

347
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,839
If you don't do it again then you should be fine

348
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,239
I shouldn't have any record!

349
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,679
But don't forget that Khun Saran isn't ordinary.

350
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,359
But he's not close to you as lam!

351
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,279
True.

352
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,359
But if l don't write it in the journal

353
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,999
someone will think I'm helping you

354
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,359
In the end.

355
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,159
someone will file a complaint.

356
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,959
Why should I pay you every month

357
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,359
if you can't do anything for me?

358
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,799
Come on. If there's any updates, I will look into it for you.

359
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,639
Lego!

360
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,479
Daddy, can I go check it out?

361
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,279
I can take him.

362
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,799
It'll be quick.

363
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,319
Can I go too?

364
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,239
I'll take them back to the car afterwards.

365
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,319
Okay.

366
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,599
-Yay!
-Watch them Jam.

367
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,279
How's that for wanting to make stuffed animals?

368
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,638
If you're that bored,

369
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,519
go cut the vegetables and sell them.

370
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,839
Your daughter wanted it!

371
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,079
You bought so many stuff, You can make a herd out of it

372
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,479
Why are you complaining so much?
I'm going as fast as l can!

373
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,479
Hold on.

374
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,439
Sorry I wasn't looking.

375
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,839
Pim.

376
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,239
P'Nai.

377
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,919
What a coincidence.

378
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,519
Yes.

379
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,359
guess I made a lot of merits

380
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,359
so I get to see you often.

381
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,919
But you did it from the wrong.

382
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,079
You happen to see her when she's with her husband.

383
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,079
Let me help you.

384
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,519
Why?

385
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,319
Are you heading to the car? I'll walk you there.

386
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,799
Thank you.

387
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,479
Next time let me know if you will be delivering fertilizers at Khun Ran's house.

388
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,239
Okay.

389
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,319
I can ask you to get coffee with me.

390
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,599
Wow!

391
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,839
Okay.

392
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,759
-This one?
-Yes.

393
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,759
Did you forget about our contract?

394
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,919
500,000 times five is 2,500,000.

395
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,239
Thank you P'Nai.

396
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,519
-I'll handle the rest
-Sure.

397
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,599
I'll stop by to see you at the house sometimes.

398
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,279
Okay.

399
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,959
-P'Nai!
-Mafeuang! Mafai!

400
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,319
Why don't you come play with me at the house?

401
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,159
I'll go play with you another time.

402
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,759
-Okay!
-Okay then!

403
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,239
-Okay.
-Okay.

404
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,359
I'm leaving now.

405
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,959
-Bye!
-Bye!

406
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,959
Why are you so happy?

407
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,839
Finally you left!

408
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,639
Come on. Get in the car.

409
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,479
Go.

410
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,479
Come on.

411
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,159
You're a traitor.

412
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,439
- I'll carry it myself.
-Me too!

413
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,599
It's okay.

414
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,439
Jam.

415
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,319
Take the kids to go shower.

416
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,159
Sure.

417
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,959
Here let me help

418
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,959
Tornado!

419
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,519
Don't run.

420
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,119
Ran.

421
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,359
Come talk with me

422
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,519
Leave the stuff here, I'll have Toei come get it.

423
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,439
Okay.

424
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,159
I know I shouldn't get involved in your business.

425
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,639
Just say what you want to say.

426
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,639
I'll be honest then.

427
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,839
I don't like Pim.

428
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,999
I know.

429
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,599
So why did you bring her here and made her your wife?

430
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,439
I raised you well like you were my son.

431
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,279
I want you to marry someone suitable.

432
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,119
What is suitable?

433
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,439
Someone from a good family

434
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,479
good education, someone who
 was raised in a good society

435
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,159
Not so different from you like Pim.

436
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,759
You're talking about money?

437
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,079
Pim doesn't have money like us.

438
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,919
That too.

439
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,679
Ran.

440
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,959
Someone who was born differently from you,

441
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,599
they will have different opinions from you too.

442
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,159
If you marry her now, soon you will divorce her.

443
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,479
Just because you're not compatible with each other

444
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,519
I don't want you two to regret it

445
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,999
because in the end,

446
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,599
you two are really not compatible.

447
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:35,959
But I think

448
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,519
if we love each other, we can make adjustments.

449
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,799
But she doesn't love you, she loves your money!

450
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,999
Why don't you understand?!

451
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,919
And how do you know that?

452
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,799
Well, I once offered her 500,000.

453
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,439
Why did you do that?

454
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,519
Well...

455
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,759
I wanted to know what she will do.

456
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,959
Did she take it?

457
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,279
No.

458
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,639
She wanted more!

459
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,959
She knows to be the lady of this house,it cost more than 500,000.

460
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,759
Or maybe she doesn't care about our money at all.

461
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,599
You've really falling for her hard.

462
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,159
Perhaps so.

463
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,759
Why are you standing here?

464
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,279
Waiting for you.

465
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,479
Why are you smiling?

466
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,279
I can't smile now?

467
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,119
You looked like a knuckle face earlier.

468
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,639
I'm in a good mood now.

469
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,999
Are you bipolar or what?

470
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,279
I came to wait for you

471
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,759
so that I can take you to go help out with the farm.

472
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,439
Why are we here?

473
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,279
I have to shower for Mok today.

474
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,599
Uncle Rong and Toei are busy

475
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,599
They have to clean the sheep pen.

476
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,279
So I want you to take Uncle Rong's place.

477
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,439
And do what?

478
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,439
Wash the stable

479
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,519
Uncle.

480
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,639
You're not cleaning the stable?

481
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,479
I was but Iran into Khun Ran.

482
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,919
-He said he was going to do it.
-Huh?

483
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,279
Do it himself?

484
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,519
It's tiring!

485
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,159
He said it. You want me to argue with him?

486
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,439
Besides,

487
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,079
-he went with Pim.
-What?! 

488
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,799
Or maybe...

489
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,799
Or maybe what?

490
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,639
Taew used to tell me they like battling off site.

491
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,519
Battle off site?

492
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,319
I will kick you!

493
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,279
Uncle!

494
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,639
Always thinking bad stuff.

495
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,159
That wasn't a will!

496
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,799
Go help Khun Ran.

497
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,279
I'm almost done here.

498
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,999
Okay.

499
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,679
I'll go check on them then.

500
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,959
Wait Uncle.

501
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,479
Slowly open it.

502
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,959
Before you get a surprise.

503
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,239
-Oh.
-Like a peek a boo.

504
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,439
Again?! You're doing it again?!

505
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,679
Toei!

506
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,239
You never think about appropriate stuff!

507
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,799
Enjoy your bath.

508
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,439
She probably got herself dirty cleaning your poop Mok.

509
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,279
We should go back and help Pim.

510
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,119
You really wanted me to help or trick me into cleaning the stable?

511
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,839
Have you fallen from grace?

512
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,159
He doesn't want you anymore so he had you come clean the horses table?

513
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,439
Why are you here again?

514
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,159
Are you still not ashamed from last incident?

515
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,839
Why should l be ashamed?

516
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,279
You purposely rode the horse to hit the kid.

517
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,119
I wanted to hit you.

518
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,840
By risking a child's life?!

519
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,639
It was all your fault!

520
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,639
You wanted Aunt Chu and P'Ran to misunderstand me

521
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,519
and side an injured person who saved a child's life like you right?

522
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,639
Other people might not be able to tell.

523
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,799
But I can tell.

524
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,679
You're greedy.

525
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,479
You want to trap rich men so that's why you're doing this!

526
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,759
I think you should see a doctor.

527
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,279
You come up with these ridiculous assumptions.

528
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,279
You're close to being crazy!

529
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,639
You're badmouthing me?!

530
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,079
Oh...

531
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,639
Are you just realizing it?

532
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,079
You have a smart mouth!

533
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,359
You dare slap me?!

534
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:39,919
Yeah!

535
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,359
I have hands and feet too!

536
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,079
You slap me, Is lap you back. No cheating!

537
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,839
<i>If you want to snitch on me again to Khun Ran or his aunt again</i>

538
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,159
<i>you're gonna get hurt like this again!</i>

539
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,239
<i>Pim.</i>

540
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,119
<i>Always showing up at the end and misunderstanding.</i>

541
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,599
<i>I found the person you're looking for.</i>

542
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,679
<i>He's hiding in Chiang Mai?</i>

543
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,839
<i>I punished myself by using the horse's poop as a mask.</i>

544
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,959
<i>I also came to ask for forgiveness from Khun Orn for making her fall.</i>

545
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,359
<i>Wash away some of your bad personality!</i>

546
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,839
<i>Then we'll talk outside!</i>

547
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,680
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

548
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:25,140
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>
