Sheep.

30
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,985
Your sheep.

31
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,238
You're raising my sheep here?

32
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,365
Yeah.

33
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,838
How are you guys?

34
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,674
Are you doing well?

35
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,014
I bought a land.

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,601
And built a small house

37
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,478
In case you change your mind

38
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,856
Stay here.

39
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,028
Thank you.

40
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,490
But I probably can't live here.

41
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,993
Can you drop me off at a bus station?

42
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,162
Wait Pim.

43
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,293
If you go to Bangkok

44
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,087
where will you live?

45
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,757
The money you got from selling the sheep to me

46
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,759
and the profit you made from making the stuffed animal

47
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,845
how long before that runs out?

48
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,937
I'm not going to live here with you

49
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,273
I just want to have a place for you to stay

50
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,109
You can make stuffed animal to sell

51
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,069
But stay.

52
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,988
Don't go anywhere.

53
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,992
You can't get over P'Ran right now

54
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,705
But once you do and want a new boyfriend

55
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,999
it won't be that inappropriate

56
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,834
I took nothing with me.

57
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,384
It's already prepared for me?

58
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,487
It has all my size

59
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,121
When you went to serve water to the police, did you hear anything'

60
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,588
-I heard nothing.
-Damn!

61
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,799
Should I wake up your mother to come cuss you out?!

62
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,513
The police already finished talking to Khun Chu.

63
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,682
So what took you so long to come back?

64
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,975
Your have nothing to tell us?

65
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,853
Do you?

66
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,813
Come to think of it

67
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,107
I do have something.

68
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,277
Tell us.

69
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,532
Too close! Too close!

70
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,950
Your nose s areiabout to touch each other.

71
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,285
- I'm sorry Dad.
" Yeah!

72
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,078
What is it?

73
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,121
Wel...

74
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:54,830
Huh?!

75
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,540
aai Really?!?a

76
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,834
She hasn't. said anything yet!

77
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,712
You're already shocked! She i hasn't said anything yet!

78
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,464
Geez!

79
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,883
Here's the thing

80
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,217
an Really?!ra

81
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,304
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,765
Will I get to tell you or what?

83
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,518
Officer

84
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,812
This is the way to the back

85
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,273
Yes. I'll take a look around

86
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,316
Go ahead.

87
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,742
I knew it was going to be like this

88
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,495
Where did she go?

89
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,372
How come P'Rancame home by himself?

90
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,460
At first I wanted Pim to leave this house

91
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,545
But now..

92
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,464
I pity Ran.

93
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:46,632
Oh.

94
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,928
I thought you said if Pim continues to stay here, P'Ranwil I just be in trouble?

95
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:51,845
So...

96
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,639
Why do you regret it now?

97
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,393
Because your brother loves her very much

98
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,688
If he can love her,he can forget her

99
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,480
Look at me.

100
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,442
Especially if she walked out on him like this P'Ran shouldn't even be looking for her.

101
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,194
It's better to just let her leave like this

102
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,283
So that's the story.

103
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,747
Why are you just standing still?!

104
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,419
It's'me!

105
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,380
I know. ill won't doy it

106
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,257
You scared i me :

107
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,010
Dad,

108
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,012
Pim really walked out?

109
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,806
Ir guess so.

110
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,518
Oh!

111
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,103
I figured it'out!

112
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,814
No wonder she was in a hurry to finish the stuffed animals

113
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,735
She probably waited until Vee's funeral was over.

114
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,987
She took the chance when the i shooting happened

115
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,616
But Pim...

116
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,952
really love Khun Saran

117
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,288
That's true.

118
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:03,042
Khun Saran has never cared about anyone as much as he does with Pim.

119
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,463
But Khun Chu did have r some regret.over Pim

120
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,758
Where would Pim go?

121
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,594
I don't know.

122
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,012
But I guarantee you

123
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,890
Khun Saran will go and bring'her back

124
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:25,731
P Today r I have you beside me

125
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:32,529
P Tou were with me every day?

126
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,408
As the days passed, the more anxious I became

127
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,037
P Afraid that I will have feelings for you

128
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:44,374
PI had to stop my heart?

129
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:54,760
P No matter how much I love you, that's all I can give

130
00:09:54,761 --> 00:10:00,641
P Since there will be a day where we must part ways

131
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:07,689
P The reason we got to meet today?

132
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,691
Why am I thinking of him?

133
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:16,281
is because something happened and that is I love you&

134
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:21,870
Ii can only be a dream, I can only think of you

135
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,207
P Because I know that.one day I will have to wake up!

136
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:32,923
& When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day?

137
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,690
Daddy is awake.

138
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,068

-Daddy!

139
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,820

141
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,784
Where's Mommy?

142
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,250
Why are you crying?

143
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,548
It's real tears Maf eu ang.

144

Hug him Mafai.

146
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,347
I'll go look for Mommy

147
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,479
Mommy isn't here anymore.

148
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,524
When will Mommy come back?

149
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,788
I don't know.

150
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,127
Don't cry Daddy.

151
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:28,497
Pim.

152
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,249
Have a seat.

153
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,877
Thank you.

154
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,548
Are you hungry?

155
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,384
You didn't eat since last night

156
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,932
I'm not that hungry.

157
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,642
Even if you're not hungry

158
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,310
you need to eat.

159
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,229
Your stomach wil I just hurt

160
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,116
Did you buy the thing I asked you to buy?

161
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,415
I did.

162
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,501
Thank you.

163
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,616
I was just on my way to see you

164
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,410
I'm stepping out.

165
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,371
I probably won't be back for dinner.

166
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,624
Can you watch the kids?

167
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,209
Okay.

168
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,508
Kids.

169
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,218
Wait for P'Jam to make you your food

170
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,095
I'm not hungry.

171
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:48,804
Oh

172
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,263
Why?

173
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,807
-Grandma.
-Hmm?

174
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,392
Daddy was crying.

175
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,481
Grandma.

176
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,443
Can we go bring Mommy back?

177
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,780
I pity Daddy.

178
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,698
I can tell.

179
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,507
Well Captain?

180
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,092
Nothing in the house Inspector.

181
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,511
Nothing upstairs

182
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,139

Yes sir.

185
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,770
He probably didn't go too far yet

186
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,980
I think he's still in town.

187
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,064

189
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,890
Hey bike man.

190
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,266
Follow that car.

191
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:21,855
You saw Tin?

192
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,565
Where?

193
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:12,780
K hun Tin.

194
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,617
Are you here to check if I'm having the abortion or not?

195
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,745
No.

196
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,580
Then why are you here?

197
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,963
Who are you running from?

198
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,009
The police.

199
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,849
I'm sorry.

200
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,610
I shouldn't have told you to do it.

201
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,948
I shouldn't have told you to get an abortion

202
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,079
I'm really sorry.

203
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,425
If you will give me the chance.

204
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,386
I will quit.

205
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,431
And I'll raise the baby with you.

206
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,318
Turn yourself in Khun Tinnama i!

207
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,197
Turn yourself in!

208
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,658
Quickly!

209
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,090
Freeze!

210
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Put the weapon down!

211
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,593
Turn yourself in!

212
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,803
Quickly!

213
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,474
Don't K hun Tin!

214
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:14,944
Don't take the baby out.

215
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,553
Is it done?

216
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,304
The job is done.

217
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,222
Good.

218
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,808
Come get the rest of the money.

219
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,226
Yes Boss.

220
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,496
Move!

221
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,100
Your guy.

222
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,147
Get up.

223
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,069
Don't count every hitman here as my people.

224
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,825
Don't deny it Uncle.

225
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,621
Orn confirmed that he's your guy.

226
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,628
What does Orn know?

227
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,263
The last number he called

228
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,099
was your number.

229
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,564
He got Orn pregnant!

230
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,108
Then had her get an abortion!

231
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,243
I want Orn to get with a good man like you

232
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,578
to take care of her.

233
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,293
Finding nonsense reasons as an excuse

234
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,295
to have her go see...

235
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,298
you.

236
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,596
I was worried that if one day I'm no longer here.

237
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,016
how will Orn survive?

238
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,696
Ornis like my daughter

239
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,618
The apple of my eye.

240
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,292
Did you think l will let Tin harass her

241
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,754
and do nothing about it?

242
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,431
Uncle.

243
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,322
I'm sorry Uncle

244
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,533
that I have to do this.

245
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,441
I knew that you would do this.

246
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,823
With permission sir.

247
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,594
But I'm not going to give up all because of this

248
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,343
Chan.

249
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,636
Watch the shop.

250
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:37,428
Okay,

251
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,013
Take it.

252
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,553
When did Nai have a farm house?

253
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,860
Pim.

254
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,990
I informed the temple already that the family wants to preserve the body for 100 days then cremate.

255
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,368
As for the expenses, I gave it to the temple already

256
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,787
Thank you.

257
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,916
Did you wait long? I made many stops so it took a while.

258
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:49,959
Look.

259
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,128
I bought you so many stuff.

260
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,090
I'm not that hungry.

261
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,386
But you haven't eaten anything

262
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,433
Here.

263
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,355
What's wrong?

264
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,110
I think

265
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,197
I'm going to go look for a job in Bangkok

266
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,875
You're pregnant aren't you?

267
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,733
How are you gonna go if you're pregnant?

268
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,322
Stay here.

269
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,912
I'll sign the papers to be the father.

270
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:23,094
T Today I have you beside me.

271
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:29,892
PP ou were with me every day

272
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,854
P As the days passed, the more anxious I became

273
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,234
I'm going to go look for a job in Bangkok.

274
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,447
You're pregnant aren't you?

275
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,912
Stay here.

276
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,291
Il sign the papers to be the father.

277
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:58,087
P Since there will be a day where we must part ways I

278
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:05,011
P The reason we got to meet today!

279
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:13,728
P is because something happened and that is I love you 1

280
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:19,400
H It can only be a dream, I can only think of you J

281
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,486
S Because I know that one day I will have to wake up J

282
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:31,495
S When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day!

283
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:39,712
F I want to love, love you for a long time

284
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:45,968
T For billions of minutes J

285
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:53,726
I I don't know if it's possible to have you by my side J

286
00:30:53,977 --> 00:31:00,691
I What should I do to not have you go anywhere?

287
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:08,240
T No matter how much I love you, that's all I can give I

288
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:15,289
5 Since there will be a day where we must part ways?

289
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:21,170
5 The reason we got to meet today

290
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:30,137
I is because something happened and that is I love you J

291
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:36,102
PIt can only be a dream, I can only think of you J

292

293

I When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day?

294
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,533
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

295
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,327
Wait kids. Wait.

296
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,415
I think you shouldn't bother Daddy yet

297
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,749
TORIC Why not?

298
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,920
Let them go see their dad

299
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,883
But it seems like he doesn't want to see anyone

300
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,220
Maybe they will make him feel better.

301
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:14,932
Okay.

302
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,891
Go.

303
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,694
Are you crying?

304
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:29,989
No.

305
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,282
I'm not crying.

306
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,077
Did you find Mommy yet?

307
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,291
You didn't find her?

308
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:41,917
I did.

309
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,670
Why didn't you go see her then?

310
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,506
Let's go get Mommy.

311
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,220
May be...

312
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,350
Mommy doesn't want to come back

313
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,727
That's not true!

314
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,354
Mommy loves us so much!

315
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,148
Why wouldn't she want to come back?

316
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,196
Kids.

317
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,114
Go take a shower.

318
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,199
P'Jam is waiting.

319
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,118
Tomorrow okay?

320
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,504
Ran.

321
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,965
Come talk with me

322
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,814
What will you do about Pim?

323
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,193
Will you go get her

324
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,487
Or let her go?

325
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,281
I will go bring her back.

326
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,911
Don't you not like her?

327
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,122
At first yes.

328
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,752
But when I found out she loved you very much

329
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,796
so much she's willing to make sacrifices.

330
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,466
I realized I misjudged her.

331
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,220
Sacrifices?

332
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,683
I told her that if she continues to stay here,

333
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:22,434
your life will be at risk.

334
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,689
Auntie.

335
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,276
Even if Pim wasn't here,

336
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,903
Tin nama i wasn't going to stop.

337
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,155
It had nothing to do with Pim.

338
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:44,248
Pim is pregnant.

339
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,294
She walked out while pregnant with my child

340
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,871
Thinking about what we talked earlier?

341
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,335
Yes.

342
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,886
I know you have good intentions

343
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,014
But I don't want you to misunderstand.

344
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,855
I love Khun Ran.

345
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,941
I still do.

346
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,490
I'm not ready to have someone new right now.

347
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,414
can wait.

348
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,837
I will wait until you're ready to open your heart to me

349
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,552
I'm not ready to be with anyone anymore

350
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,024
Why are you calling so late at night?

351
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,285
I was going to go see you in the morning

352
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,536
What's up?

353
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,622
I couldn't sleep.

354
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,002
With so much happening

355
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,795
it'd beweird if you did fell asleep

356
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,006
Can I go see you?

357
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,425
Sure.

358
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,343
Do you want me to call Nai too?

359
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:44,762
No.

360
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,390
I just want to talk to you

361
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:50,476
Okay.

362
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:51,977
See you soon.

363
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,297
Why are you calling?

364
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,593
If you can't give me a good life then don't call again!

365
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,060
Was that Vira?

366
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,132
I don't want you to lose the person you love

367
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,509
over a small matter.

368
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,234
Do you see me?

369
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,278
It's good you broke up with Pim

370
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,240
Why don't you like Pim?

371
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,036
Because she got everything!

372
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,417
She got herself a good man and a good life!

373
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,588
But in her life,
