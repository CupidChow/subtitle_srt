Pim.

30
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,093
Wait.

31
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,973
Just tell me the truth

32
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,352
that you only used me for :i your-benefit by marrying me

33
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,000
I married you

34
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,794
because I love you.

35
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,969
It has nothing to do with filing for adoption of the twins

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,685
You put the marriage certificate paper with the documents

37
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,981
Because I got married. I have to report it

38
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,945
I would be lying

39
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,697
if I say that didn't matter.

40
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:25,705
Being married has a nady ant age when filing

41
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,166
But it's fine if. I'm not.

42
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,697
Believe me

43
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,949
If I didn't love you

44
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,993
I wouldn't have married you

45
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,668
But right now

46
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,464
I do want kids with you.

47
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,481
Pol lives next door to me.

48
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,317
He came to borrow thousands from me the other day.

49
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,110
Who would have that kind of money?

50
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,363
- Uncle came and borrowed thousands from you?
-Yes.

51
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,241
I think it's passed his due date to pay back the money

52
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,035
That's why he's desperately trying to get money right now

53
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,171
Pol hasn't paid the money back?

54
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,672
Not yet.

55
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,341
How many times did you call?

56
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,801
Many times.

57
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,344
He said he'll pay us back

58
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,179
but he doesn't have the money yet.

59
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,352
What do we do Boss?

60
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,481
Take his land.

61
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,025
'll do like l always do then

62
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,236
Yeah.

63
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:26,867
You were stressing over that because you do love me, don't you?

64
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,994
Yeah.

65
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,080
Hey.

66
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,167
I know.

67
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,961
No need to repeat it.

68
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,844
Since you love me,

69
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,472
we can actually get married now?

70
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,483

71
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,281

72
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,782
What's the matter?

73
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,825
Found it.

74
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:08,951
You'did?

75
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,871
Found what?

76
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,626
Go continue making the dolls.

77
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,462
I need to go do something with Toei.

78
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,844
Let's go.

79
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,433
You're sure To ei?

80
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:33,392
Yes

81
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,605
Who's coming?

82
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,398
Oh.

83
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,942
Uncle Rong went to give more seed samples.

84
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,236
It's done?

85
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,989
Toe i, did you find anything?

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,157

87
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,617
Uncle.

88
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:53,621
Can you take my car and drop off Pim at the temple tonight?

89
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,330
Sure.

90
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,372
Toei.

91
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,457
-Yes?
-Let's go.

92
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,803
Uncle has missed the payment with Tin many times

93
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,850
We just want proof that Tin nama i has been burning houses down to chase away his debtors

94
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,373
Put the fire out right here first

95
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:37,998
a is Okay.iau

96
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,008
Uncle! Uncle!

97
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,759
Uncle!

98
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,927
Fire!

99
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,387
-Huh?
-Wake up!

100
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,984
just thought the price will be good

101
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,237
Once I sell my crops, I will have the money to pay him back.

102
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,781
But my crops have been infested

103
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,658
So money isn't coming in

104
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,785
and I didn't have enough to pay K hun Tin back

105
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,664
Infested?

106
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:20,666
Mildew.

107
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,091
This time,

108
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,968
did you buy the seeds?

109
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,679
K hun Tin gave me free credits to buy from Khun Na i's shop.

110
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,516
He said the seeds are great. Vegetables will grow out long with lots of seeds.

111
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,312
How about this Uncle?

112
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,150
will let you borrow money from me

113
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,320
But can you go give the police a statement

114
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,157
that Tin nama i..

115
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,284
burned your house?

116
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,790
Will the police believe me?

117
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,179
I'mvirritated!

118
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:28,150
I don't want to believe that Tin and Nai joined hands

119
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,363
What took so long?

120
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,992
I was going to go look for you if you didn't come home in ten minutes.

121
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,790
It takes a long time to put out a fire

122
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,791
He really burned the house?!

123
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,794
Did you get evidence?

124
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,551
Yes.

125
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,764
At least we found out that Khun Nai has been selling infested seeds to the villagers

126
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,849
Why is he so i evil?

127
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,142
Alright.

128
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,645
We need proof of what Nai did

129
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,438
We'll talk once the!lab t results come out

130
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,193
You two take my car tomorrow to go get the results

131
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,778
Take Nu an with i you.

132
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,530
Okay.

133
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,489
Ill leave it in your hands

134
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,912
You okay?

135
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:22,746
76

136
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,975
You're not sleeping yet?

137
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,106
I just barely finished making the teddy bear

138
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,131
Hey!

139
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:23,307
Can I treat the workers to barbecued pork tomorrow?

140
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,603
I want to thank them for helping me work so late every night.

141
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,358
Let me think about it.

142
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,611
Why do you need to think?

143
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,945
It's just barbecued pork!

144
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,661
Let me shower first.

145
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,663
Then'll tell you.

146
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,554
What's there to think about barbecued pork?

147
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,162
a So can I?

148
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,377
Yes :

149
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,004
That's all you had to say

150
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,465
Why did I have to wait until i you were finished showering?

151
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,848
J wanted to shower first

152
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,393
so I don't :stink when we hug.

153
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,529
Go get the'sheep "back from Nai already.

154
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,282
We'll be :getting married soon.

155
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:07,160
Why can't lraise my wife's sheep?

156
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,342
How did you know that I'm trying to file for adoption?

157
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,802
Al Khun Nus told me

158
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,184
I need to find time to talk to Nus.

159
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,523
It's fine.

160
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,986
already know it's not i like what Khun Nus said

161
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,093
Khun Ran.

162
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,804
I won't do anything.

163
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,849
I just want to lie down while we talk

164
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,863
I want to adopt and raise the twins here

165
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,949
as a representation of my sister who passed away

166
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,247
My sister's husband family want them too.

167
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:39,378
But if they want them, we have to come to some kind of agreement in court

168
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,839
It's true that by getting married

169
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,675
there's an advantage

170
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,596
But it's not everything

171
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,313
But the kids are very close to you

172
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,859
If they have to move to America they'll probably be lonely

173
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,633
I was thinking the same

174
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,473
That's why I'm trying to have them stay here

175
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,696
And now,

176
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,366
I finally have a mother for them.

177
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,522
P Today I have you beside me!

178
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:29,613
P Tou were with me every day

179
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,158
5 As the days passed, the more anxious I became

180
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,745
Afraid that I will have feelings for you

181
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,832
I Ihad to stop my heart

182
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:51,676
No matter how much I love you, that's all i I can give

183
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:57,516
5 Since there will be a day where we must part ways

184
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:04,648
& The reason we got to meet today?

185
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:13,155
P is because something happened and that is I love you

186
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:19,078
H It can only be a dream, I can only think of you J

187
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,332
P Because I know that.one day I will have to wake up

188
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:30,131
P When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day?

189
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:03,999
Khun Ran.

190
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,152
I'm going to miss you so much

191
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,452
Can you sleep in the middle?

192
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,082
Sure.

193
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,940
Maf eu ang.

194
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,485
I made you a teddy bear

195
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,112
Thank you.

196
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,947
Where's mine?

197
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,659
Yours isn't done yet.

198
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,329
Ill give it to you once it's done.

199
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,331
Okay. Love you.

200
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,501
I love you.

201
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,479
Why are you crying Mommy?

202
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,940
Are you sick?

203
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,236
My eyes just hurts.

204
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,828
It's okay. I'll blow it for you

205
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,337
Are you better?

206
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,174
I'm all better.

207
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,117
Someone is going to file a report on Tin nama i?

208
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,788
Good.

209
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,082
Keep an eye on it and report back to me

210
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,670
Where are you going so early?

211
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,305
I was going to go get a health check up.

212
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,599
Is anyone accompanying you?

213
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,310
No.

214
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,146
Why don't you invite Da?

215
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,106
So you'll have someone to wait with

216
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,987
Okay.

217
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,599
I won't go!

218
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,016
Go!

219
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,393
-Go! Hurry!
-I won't go!

220
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,311
Go! Walk faster!

221
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,229
Go!

222
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,107
Go! Get in!

223
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,984
Hurry!

224
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,654
All done!

225
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,079
Last night was taken care of?

226
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,373
I sent someone to check since dawn

227
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,083
I think the fire didn't burn it all

228
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,168
You'll have to send someone to go finish it

229
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,134
Why aren't things going smoothly right now?

230
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,513
The situation with Ran, the debtors, and then --

231
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,348
What is it?

232
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,144
Nothing.

233
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,855
Go tell Jay to finish the job

234
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,315
I'l go see Na i.

235
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:21,941
Yes Boss.

236
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,249
All done?
-Yes.

237
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,667
Thank you.
. Sure.

238
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,962
Let's go.

239
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,444
I told you not to come to the shop.

240
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,655
I need to talk to you.

241
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,699
Meet me at the usual cafe shop.

242
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,084
What's the matter?

243
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,629
Why aren't there any villagers having problems with their crops?

244
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,464
We discussed this already

245
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,466
I do want there to be problems.

246
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,636
Fertilizers are selling great. So are the seeds

247
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,764
Why wouldn't I want the villagers to have problems?

248
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,265
Yes.

249
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:40,019
If there are problems where crops aren't growing as expected

250
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,355
they will come take out a loan.

251
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,149
P'Ran.

252
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,027
All the villagers are relying on him now

253
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:49,612
You...

254
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,282
need to go handle him, not me

255
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,744
We agreed on this.

256
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,955
You think I'm not doing it?!

257
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,957
Calm down.

258
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,258
Ran isn't ordinary.

259
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,926
Not only is he lucky

260
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,928
but his skin is thick.

261
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:18,474
thought you would have handled him since the day he decided to save Pim and Rave e

262
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,520
He survived a gunshot.

263
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,024
I don't know how long he will keep getting in my way

264
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,112
Try again.

265
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,864
In case this time

266
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,948
I it ends.

267
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,495
I won't let him stand in my way for long

268
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,455
Good.

269
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,000
The villagers are watching

270
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,670
whether your influential power can do anything to him or not.

271
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,176
As for my part.

272
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,094
if you send your people over.

273
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,264
I will do everything just like we agreed on

274
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,518
If you're done here,

275
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,437
I'll take off.

276
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,498
Nai.

277
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,000
Yes?

278
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,669
Have you see n Orn lately?

279
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:30,755
No.

280
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:31,923
Really?

281
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,095
But I heard Uncle Y ut say she isn't doing okay.

282
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,473
Really?

283
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,767
Why do you ask?

284
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,854
T haven't seen her at the pub

285
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,316
It's nothing.

286
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,943
If you see Orn

287
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,779
invite her to the pub, My treat.

288
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,531
May be she'll feel better.

289
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,658
Sure.

290
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,974
Grandma! Grandma!

291
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,476
Why did you guys wake up early today?

292
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,603
Why didn't you shower yet?

293
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,857
Mommy made me a teddy bear. Isn't it cute?

294
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,109
Very cute!

295
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:34,777
It's soft too.

296
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,613
Go see P Jam. Have her shower for you

297
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,239
Okay.

298
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,533
P Jam.

299
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,953
The kids came down stairs. They haven't showered yet

300
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,163
Okay,

301
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,169
Go shower kids.

302
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,629
Let's go shower and get you dressed

303
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,632
Mommy's eyes hurt.

304
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:01,387
But we blew on it and it's all better now

305
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,097
-Really?
-Yes!

306
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,640
Good job!

307
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,391
Let's go.

308
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,317
Pim

309
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,818
Yes?

310
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,113
You made that teddy bear for Ma feu ang?

311
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,616
Yes.

312
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,997
I finished the order we received at the association banquet last night

313
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,124
That was fast.

314
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,918
Delivery isn't for a long time though

315
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,796
In that case,

316
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,966
I'm going to go prepare for P'Vee'scremation

317
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,309
She's on her way to her brother's funeral?

318
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,685
Yeah.

319
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,021
It's his cremation today.

320
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,857
She should leave today and never come back

321
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,537
Do you not want her to leave any more?

322
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,667
Your brother loves her very much

323
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,752
So do the kids.

324
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,005
But ever since she got here, she's been causing problems for us.

325
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,300
P'Ran almost died many times because of her.

326
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,516
Don't hesitate Aunt Chu.

327
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,853
I think if she leaves, PRan and the kids will eventually forget her

328
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,774
Especially the kids, if they find something or someone to play with, they'll forget her

329
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,278
I'm afraid that if she really leaves

330
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,446
no one will forget her.

331
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,376
Vira

332
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:04,427
But I think if she just disappears, P'Ran will forget her.

333
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,973
No one wants to love someone who betrays them

334
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:24,780
Is it us that is betraying Ran and the kids?

335
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,241
PROVINCIAL POLICE REGION

336
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,910
They said they will have an arrest warrant Will that be soon?

337
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,918
From the looks of it, yes

338
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,550
f he's out on bail, these two will be in trouble

339
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:16,248
You're not 12weeks pregnant yet but you can do it here

340
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:20,127
But are you sure you want to do this?

341
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,098
Yes.

342
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,975
Your appointment is first thing tomorrow morning then.

343
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:14,974
Da.

344
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,016
What?

345
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,855
That's a pretty dress.

346
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:21,939
Yes.

347
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,484
The design P'Ranchose is beautiful

348
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,282
Can you stop beating around the bush

349
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,452
trying to tell me they're getting married?

350
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,915
Fine.

351
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,294
I'l be direct.

352
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,547
They're getting married after Aunt Ch u's birthday.

353
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,428
What you and K hun Tin are doing.

354
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:53,929
I think you should stop.

355
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,935
What am I doing?

356
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:07,276
I'd like one iced americano

357
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,197
Nai.

358
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:14,325
Why aren't there any villagers having problems with their crops?

359
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,660
We discussed this already

360
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,746
I do want there to be problems.

361
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,707
Fertilizers are selling great. So are the seeds.

362
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,460
Why wouldn't : I want the villagers to have problems?

363
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,091
What you're doing

364
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,011
is not just causing problems for other people

365
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,472
It's just business Da.

366
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,481
When did you change?

367
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,245
Questioning me about what?

368
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:43,622
I won't go.

369
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,628
You're having me arrested?

370
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,256
You're such a meddler Ran!

371
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,780
I rushed here because ll know you'd be waiting

372
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,285
Pim.

373
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,954
Who invited you?

374
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,957
You don't need invitations to funerals

375
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,252
People come to pay respect to the deceased

376
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:51,482
91054

377
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,285
I thought you would hold it for seven days.

378
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,371
Three days is enough.

379
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,498
There are no guests.

380
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,668
Just making merits for P'Vee to take is enough

381
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,504
Then make some merits for Ran too.

382
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,006
So he'll have some to take before he dies

383
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,968
He's surrounded Khun Ran.

384
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,683
wu a.lt'swhat Khun i Rani predicted nui

385
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,313
If he's out on bail, these two will be in trouble

386
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,775
I'l go tell the police

387
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,986
to have him i come in for questioning

388
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,196
He knows we'll be *at the funeral.

389
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,824
He's going to r go there to attack

390
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,492
Stop smiling Toei!

391
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,664
Right now you need to be bait to have them follow you as much as possible

392
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,458
-Me?
Yes!

393
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,167
Huh?

394
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:33,917
Go!

395
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,464
Pim.

396
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,381
Go with Nai first.

397
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,300
You come with me

398
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,385
If I run, Ill have to run for the rest of my life.

399
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,553
Come on Pim.

400
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,679
Pim.

401
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,265
Go wait for me at home and I'll be there soon

402
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,142
You have to come back

403
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:50,851
Nai.

404
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:51,935
Watch Pim for me.

405
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,644
Sure.

406
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,937
Go.
Come on Pim.

407
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,120
You won't exclude not even a funeral?

408
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,705
Yeah!

409
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,249
You're in my way.

410
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,130
Khun Ran!

411
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:20,964
Pim!

412
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,007
Let's go.

413
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,801
I don't want you getting caught in the crossfire

414
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,760
But...

415
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,011
You should worry about yourself first.

416
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,514
No! What if Khun Ran gets shot?

417
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,641
He told me to take you away.

418
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,352
Trust me. You'll only cause more problems by staying here.

419
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,395
Let'sjust go.

420
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,319
659
You're having me arrested!

421
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,946
Are you pretending to forget?

422
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,784
Someone like you

423
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,661
deserves to rot in jail!

424
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,694
Can you take me to Khun Ran's house?

425
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,113
Pim.

426
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,076
I know you love him.

427
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,704
But having you there with him

428
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,832
Is like rubbing it in in Khun Tin's face all the time.

429
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,796
I know.

430
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,965
Then don't go back there.

431
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,477
Rave e took Khun Tin's money

432
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,854
in exchange for you.

433
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,106
K hun Tin lost the money

434
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,692
but he didn't get the product because it's with P'Ran

435
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,279
Someone very powerful like K hun Tin

436
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,074
wil I just let someone cross him like he's achess piece?

437
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,794
But I just want to know

438
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,672
if Khun Ran is safe or not.

439
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,309
I'l take you there.

440
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,480
But promise me you won't get down from the car

441
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,621
Good thing you knew what they were going to do

442
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,383
Freeze! Put the weapons down!

443
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,344
Turn yourself in!

444
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:46,962
It's me.

445
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,763

You should go home.

00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,784
As for your subordinates.

456
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,620
I'll have the officials drop them off

457
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,288
Okay.

458
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,958

You're home late.

467
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,252
Why are the police here?

468
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,129
They'll be staying for the night

469
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,764
