We need to find a lawyer.

The police are siding with him

30
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,334
They won't even listen to what happened prior.

31
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,755
Gosh! No doubt! Money buys everything in this area.

32
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,509
How come you won't do something like this?

33
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,305
Their side throws money, our side throws money

34
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,474
People will get rich here but the case won't end

35
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,268
Perhaps they will continue to ask for money.

Okay.

00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,872
Toei wait here.

40
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,123
Okay.

41
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,838
Why did you come here?

42
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,260
There's three influential people here.

43
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,639
You're here to ask Khu n Yut for help?

44
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,271
Hello.

45
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,816
Sit.

46
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,122
I knew

47
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,915
but I didn't want to get involved

48
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,751
So that means you agree

49
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,545
to let Tinnama i attack me.

50
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,338
What did you want me to do?

51
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,799
You should at least use the power you have

52
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,010
Order your men to do something right.

53
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,642
You guys are having all these problems all because of one girl?

54
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,441
Yes.

55
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,990
The prey is walking in broad daylight

56
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:07,163
We don't know when the predator will attack

57
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:12,251
Tin isn't a stupid person and isn't someone that will let things go easily

58
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,796
He is waiting for the right moment to attack you.

59
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,672
Who knows when we'll miss

60
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,011
But if we miss, we die

61
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,311
How about this?

62
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,691
In order for me to go handle Tin for bothering you.

63
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,820
can I request a trade?

64
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,655
In exchange for what?

65
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,993
Divorce Pim

66
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,830
and marry Orn.

67
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,462
When it comes to death

68
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:57,880
it's not a joke.

69
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,126
Don't over think it

70
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,337
about what i Uncle : Y ut said

71
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,803
How can I not over think?

72
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,805
Right now,

73
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,766
you're'my only family

74
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,854
You're risking your life saving me and my brother's life.

75
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:04,238
You won't come up with any solutions by over thinking

76
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,368
Should you divorce me?

77
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,252
I will never divorce you

78
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,756
Scared no one will be the twin's mother?

79
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,636
That'stone "reason.

80
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,694
He has the'audacity to come

81
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:49,617
Someone like him, even the water monitor would be embarrassed.

82
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,631
Get out!

83
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,467
You should be sleeping in a coffin instead!

84
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,344
You killed someone and you came to ask for forgiveness?!

85
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,470
What are you thinking?!

86
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,264
No one will for give a murderer like you!

87
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,102
Vee died because of Ran.

88
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,520
Not because of me.

89
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,024
I intended to shoot Ran.

90
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,361
If that day you let me shoot you,

91
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,156
your brother wouldn't have died.

92
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,660
Pim. Pim.

93
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,619
- Let go!
- Pim.

94
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,079
Let me go Khun Ran!

95
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,502
Get out of here right now.

96
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,546
Otherwise I will shoot you

97
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,677
Someone like you

98
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,262
wouldn't dare shoot me

99
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,168
You're still thinking about it?

100
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,968
If I wasn't around.

101
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,763
your life would be much safer

102
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,525
I can leave this house

103
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,320
That's not the solution.

104
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,990
I told you

105
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,909
even though Uncle Yu t won't help me

106
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,454
there's gotta be another way

107
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,795
Another way?

108
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,547
What way?

109
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,474
I don't have an answer for you if you're gonna ask right now.

110
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,518
But there is.

111
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,523
Every problem has a solution.

112
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,115
Stop stressing.

113
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,788
I won't die that easily

114
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,794
Go shower and then!go to bed

115
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,505
Don't you need to prepare things for the temple tomorrow?

116
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,260
I can leave this house

117
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,744
You're awake?

118
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,467
What's the matter?

119
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,850
What are you doing right here?

120
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:31,815
I couldn't sleep sol came to tidy up your things

121
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,360
Go take a shower.

122
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,989
I'm gonna go finish up the new orders for

123
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,000
Go. Quickly.

124
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,178
'll go shower now.

125
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,964
If what Khun Nus said was true,
there has to be some documents

126
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,253
You married me

127
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,007
so you can have an advantage

128
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,553
of being the twins'guardian?

129
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,104
We were able to do 400 of them last time in three days

130
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,272
We can'do it this time too.

131
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,650
Delivery isn't for awhile : What's the rush?

132
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,360
Yeah.

133
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,820
Last time we worked over night

134
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,323
You're gonna do it again this time?

135
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,949
Can it be seven days?

136
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,078
It's so we can start on another order.

137
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,499
You, Aunt Noi, and other people here can get more income.

138
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,084
Okay,

139
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,294
We're rushing it again.

140
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,088
Just like that.

141
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,764
Continue on P'Nuan

142
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,476
I saw Khun Tin going to the factory a few times.

143
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:59,147
But the last time l saw your father, he looked so stressed

144
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,025
He tried to collect the money from the customers.

145
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,861
I guess he wanted to collect the money for Tin

146
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,699
But he never got the chance to pay him back because the factory burned down.

147
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,940
Take the sample to Khon kaen Research Center.

148
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,358
a.contacted them already.

149
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,610
Why do you want me to take it?

150
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,950
I'm just curious if it can be infected from the seed or not

151
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,869
iwa Last.time a?

152
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,080
the seed we prepared to plant wasn't enough

153
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,374
So we ordered more from Nai

154
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,127
And all of them had mildew

155
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,674
You suspect that

156
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,803
Khun Nai sent the infected seeds to us?

157
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,180
Yeah.

158
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,601
s that possible since Khun Nai is one of us

159
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,104
We need to be careful l right now

160
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,690
Even with ouir own people

161
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:25,609
Yes.

162
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,821
Khun Ran! Khun Ran!

163
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:30,947
Khun Ran!

164
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,573
What.is it?

165
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,326
I heard Sri nu an talking to Pimt about her family's factory.

166
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,496
She told Pim that'Pim's parents Once borrowed money from Tin

167
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,080
Do you know

168
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,500
what happened to Pim's family factory?

169
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,250
No.

170
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,252
It burned down.

171
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,757
Did...

172
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,383
la Tin do "it?

173
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,020
I think so.

174
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,775
Later go in the city with me.

175
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,609
Okay,

176
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,435
What is it?

177
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,272
I can't miss my wife?

178
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,523
Who's your wife?!

179
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,441
Come see me

180
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,069
Why do you want me to?! I'm --

181
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,820
I miss you.

182
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,280
Come see me.

183
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,365
See you in the evening. I'll be waiting.

184
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,371
Wife?

185
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,525
Do you need something Uncle?

186
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,820
Are you sick?

187
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,697
You've been throwing up every day

188
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,037
Yes.

189
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,464
If you're sick then rest.

190
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,011
I'm going to step out for a bit.

191
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,521
Why are you stepping out when you're sick?

192
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,649
You're meeting Ran?

193
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,323
I'm meeting a friend

194
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,247
Up to you.

195
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,920
Did you need something? Why did you come to see me?

196
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,047
I was going to invite you to go have a meal in the city with me.

197
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,134
But if you're busy then I can go by myself

198
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,704
You don't miss me?

199
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,997
Why do I have to miss you?

200
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,125
I'm your husband.

201
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,671
I want you dead!

202
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,173
Don't be so harsh.

203
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,928
Don't forget I have the clip

204
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,348
If you don't want to be embarrassed then follow me.

205
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,483
I'm pregnant.

206
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,455
What do you mean you're pregnant?

207
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,665
It means there's a baby inside me!

208
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,593
The baby inside you

209
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,928
is my child?

210
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,514
Yes.

211
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,643
Your child that I didn't want

212
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,668
Why did you come to the police station in the city?

213
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,086
We i have one vin the district.

214
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,340
Origin a
Tin bribed everyone in the district already

215
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,135
Only this place that his money hasn't reached yet

216
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,935
Nai has to go back and watch his shop?

217
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,353
He has employees.

218
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,271
Why is he acting like his shop will disappear?

219
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,398
He has a job.

220
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,152
Who can be like you? You get money by just walking around.

221
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,492
Someone is having you make a wedding dress?

222
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,160
Yeah.

223
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,502
The design is nice.

224
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,093
P'Ran?!

225
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,475
P'Ran is having you make Pim's dress?!

226
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,685
Yeah.

227
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,603
He came by the other day

228
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,148
And you weren't going to say anything to me?!

229
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,693
You want P'Ran to marry Pim?

230
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,237
They love each other.

231
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,822
Why do you have a problem with that?

232
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,449
I don't want him marrying her!

233
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:54,122
What did Pim do to you or is it because she comes from a poor family?

234
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,540
That's why you hate her?

235
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:00,753
Being poor is a reason but I think her brother was in on it with Vira.

236
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,465
Deceiving me that Vira was a good person and I made the mistake by running away with him.

237
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,134
Her brother dying.

238
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,095
I have no pity, They deserve it!

239
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,305
Karma caught up fast.

240
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,142
I think you should blame yourself.

241
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,935
No one deceived you

242
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,480
You loved him that's why you ran away with him.

243
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,941
But you couldn't stay with him because he's not rich.

244
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:31,910
The reason you came back because there's not enough money to spend like how you used to.

245
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:39,500
You need to let your brother marry Pim

246
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,128
If Pim is a bad person or they can't go together

247
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,379
they'll break up.

248
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,632
Just like you and Vira.

249
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,348
Same goes for you.

250
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,602
You're not trying to be a good person y wanting what's best for my brother.

251
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:02,649
You want my brother to marry Pim because you like Nai!

252
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,153
If Pim is married,

253
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,657
you no longer have competition. Am I right?

254
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,452
Yes.

255
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,622
But at least I'm leaving it as their business.

256
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,124
However it ends, I will accept it

257
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,460
That's you.

258
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,003
But this is me.

259
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,756
However I want it,

260
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,549
Will have it!

261
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,017
I don't want a kid right now

262
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,855
I never thought

263
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,066
that you would say that.

264
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,442
I thought you would terminate it

265
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,029
You want to keep this baby?

266
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,284
Consider it my responsibility

267
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,665
Ill see you another time.

268
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,127
I promise

269
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,462
I will use protection next time

270
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,920
Khun Ran.

271
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,840
What evidence do we get to show the police

272
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,676
that Tin burned i Pim's father factory down?

273
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,139
He did it once, He'll do it again.

274
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,311
You want me to go ask around

275
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,022
who has borrowed money from him?

276
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,815
Sounds good.

277
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,484
If he's doing it again

278
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,944
we'll have evidence to have him arrested

279
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,852
Sir.

280
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,105
What is it?

281
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,648
Who did Or n go see?

282
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,024
Tin nama i

283
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:09,919
P'Vee.

284
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,839
Come eat.

285
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,968
1025

286
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,761
Did you see Grandpa yet?

287
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,763
Please look after Grandpa

288
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,685
Tell Grandpa

289
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,229
not to worry about me.

290
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,775
I can take care of myself now

291
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,537
The person Grandpa had me marry

292
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:49,292
only wants to find someone to do the duty of a wife

293
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,381
so he can adopt his niece and nephew.

294
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,515
I think

295
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,476
I will do my duty the best that l can

296
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,107
Pay back the gratitude that he had for our family

297
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,616
Then I will leave.

298
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,552
You've cried so much that there's probably no fluid in you right now

299
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,808
Thank you.

300
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,325
What color do you like?

301
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,078
Why?

302
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,997

Bold pink?

306
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,100
Pastel.

307
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,936
Pastel i pink

308
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,191
And music?

309
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,151

313
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,536
Can you not ask any more?

314
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,499
Fine I won't ask.

315
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,844
I'm not asking anymore

316
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,516
We're in :a temple

317
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,435
So you'll know

318
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,520
I'm right beside you.

319
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,192
Ill go make the dolls.

320
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,079
You're not going to rest?

321
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:18,834
It won't be done.

322
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,505
Delivery isn't for a long time.

323
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,091
What's the hurry to get it done?

324
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:49,907
I'm going now.

325
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,759
Poking a tiger like that.

326
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,511
aren't you i afraid i problems will :follow?

327
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,097
If what Khun Ran thinks is true

328
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,474
we can then put the tiger in a cage

329
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,601
a Uncle'1v

330
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,311
How's it going? Did you find anything?

331
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,152
I went and asked people I know but.
none of them borrowed money from Tin

332
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,241
We can try again tomorrow then.

333
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,328
Lately the crops are selling wel

334
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,247
so it.ll be difficult.

335
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:38,831
The Original.

336
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,013
Everyone.

337
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:54,972

338
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,432

339
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,808
We can do it "again tomorrow.

340
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,785
Khun Ran

341
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,377
How can I let you do the work alone?

342
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,839
Come a What can I do toi help?

343
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,307
You can fill it.

344
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,936
Can I fill your heart?

345
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,845
Tomorrow is Vee's cremation.

346
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,472
Yes

347
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,140
Fast.huh?

348
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,977
I was shocked when I heard the news

349
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,396
How can Pim accept it?

350
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,356
I know right?.

351
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,776
Good thing she's focusing on the orders right now

352
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:34,946
But once that is done and she has nothing to occupy her, she'll be sad.

353
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,323
Oh.

354
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:41,995
The corn seed we sent to the research center in Khon kaen

355
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,372
when will we rget. the'results?

356
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,499
They said they will quickly test it for us.

357
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,376
They're afraid it will spread to other farms

358
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,462
P'Ran just bought ther corn's'eeds from me the other day.

359
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,384
You're still doing what we agreed on right?

360
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:57,303
Yes.

361
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,932
You called me here to talk about this?

362
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,268
Yes.

363
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,770
There's something else too.

364
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,314
Something else?

365
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,232
What is it?

366
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,694
haven't seen Orn hang out with her friends lately

367
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,530
I don't know if something happened or not

368
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,326
Or did Orn get close with someone?

369
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,787
I don't see that she got close with anyone.

370
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,665
May be she's not in the mood to hang out with us.

371
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,127
What about with Tin?

372
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,254
Tin?

373
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,340
Tin nama i?

374
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,342
Yes

375
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,761
We see him sometimes at the pub

376
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,971
He always pays for our drinks

377
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,973
But nothing else.

378
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,350
Really?

379
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,601
Yes.

380
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,706
Or n's friend told me Orn isn't close to Tin

381
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,250
But I think there is something

382
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,170
Go find someone skillful on standby

383
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,965
I think what I'm thinking isn't wrong

384
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,260
Call me when you've found someone

385
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,449
What's wrong Aunt Chu?

386
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,496
It's about Pim and Ran.

387
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,625
I told Pim already.

388
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,253
We just have to wait when she'll realize it.

389
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,255
Is that so?

390
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,381
Yes.

391
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,259
I think once she realizes it, she'll leave

392
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,595
I was thinking the same.

393
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,597
Pim has to leave.

394
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,391
If she loves him.

395
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,363
It's done?

396
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:22,656
Not yet.

397
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,658
But I want her to come try it out.

398
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,452
How about today?

399
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,537
Sure.

400
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:29,621
Any time works.

00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,498

402
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,541

408
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,523
No.

409
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:00,861
You and P'Toei would always treat me to barbecued pork before

410
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,071

413
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,458
You don't need to do anything

414
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,085
Give me ther money. I'll go buy the stuff.

415
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,128

00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,007

422
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,314
How can I go when there's so much work to do?

423

It's just a fitting.

428
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,624
You have to be in a hurry like this?

429
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,544
It won't be finished in time for Auntie's party

430
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,924
Let's just be quick then.

431
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,343

Pim, let's go try on the outfit.

440
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,914
Wait here P'Ran.

441
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,959
The groom isn't supposed to see

442
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,476
Try on the rough draft first

443
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:58,645
Rough draft?

444
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,647
I'm not trying the finished product?

445
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,692
No. I just want to get the right size

446
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,944
I'll alter it. Come. Let'sget changed.

447

In here.

449
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,092
That's all of it.

450
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:30,844
Good.

451
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,347
I'l go investigate more on Tin.

452
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,102
The research center?

453
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,270
Yeah.

454
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:42,522
Hello.

455
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,024
Sure.

456
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,151
I'll drop it off today

457
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,111
Yes. Thank you

458
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,367
The seed we bought from Khun Na i's shop

459
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,619
.did haven mildew.

460
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,621
They want more samples

461
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,624
-Damn! I knew it!
uni Wait To ei!an

462
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,542
Why are you acting tough?!

463
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,795
You're just gonna do there and die right now

464
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,923
Is it not true?

465
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:11,176
The y're not100 percent.sure though

466
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,135
How many percent then?

467
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,804
There's no percent.

468
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,806
It was just one day.

469
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,099
But right now,

470
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,935
go find out who else borrowed money from Tin

471
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,020
The sooner we find I them, the better

472
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,858
Quickly do it. The customers are waiting.

473
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,079
You're lucky to have someone be attentive like this

474
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,257
Have you been eating a lot lately?

475
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:52,759
Why?

476
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,845
Your waist has gotten bigger

477
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,808
Someone is living a good life, right?

478
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,103
I will make this dress a beautiful one.

479
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,446
I probably won't get to wear it no matter how beautiful it is.

480
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,827
Why?

481
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,460
I'm probably helping out in the back

482
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,837
I probably won't be inside the party

483
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,760
You're trying to break up with P'Ran?

484
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:48,106
You're going to regret breaking up with him over other people'swords

485
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,861
You listened to what Nus said?

486
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,448
It might be true.

487
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,910
But if you won't listen to the truth from PRan

488
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,371
don't make your own decision by assuming things

489
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:13,298
Why don't you try asking P'Ran first

490
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,343
if that's how he really feels or not

491
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,348
You know about this?

492
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,266
Not all.

493
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,393
But I know Nus.

494
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,949
Okay. All done. Let me see

495
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,161
Okay.

496
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:47,374
You can go change, When it's close to being done, I'll call you in for the final details.

497
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,959
Go.

498
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,098
I've been having bad luck this year.

499
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:06,685
Can I go in and pray first?

500
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,116
You can look. I won't mind

501
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,956
I need to talk to you

502
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,920
After we pray and pay homage

503
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,380
Lna a let's go eat.oua

504
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,507
Then we can talk

505
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,248
You're not.talking

506
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,797
The reason you married me

507
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:22,761
was it to just get custody of the twins?

508
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,067
I was going to go get a health check up.

509
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,777
Is anyone accompanying you?

510
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,656
Just making merits for P'Vee to take is enough

511
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,116
2396

512
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,870
Make some merits for Ran too.

513
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,498
So he'll have some to take before he dies

514
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,500
You won't exclude not even a funeral?

515
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:56,795
Khun Ran!

516
00:45:56,963 --> 00:46:03,385
