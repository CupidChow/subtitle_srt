Go where?

31
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,524
Take the baby out.

32
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,028
Huh?

33
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,285
I don't want to do it.

34
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,832
I thought Uncle Y ut said to keep the baby?

35
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,091
I know that..

36
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,427
the baby is innocent.

37
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:06,435
But there is n't any woman that gets pregnant just to get an abortion.

38
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,030
I...

39
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,289
I was raped.

00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,476
It's okay.

We'll get through this together

00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:38,861
Pim.

45
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,997
You're pregnant with me.

46
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,713
You love me.

47
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,799
So why did you walk out on me?

48
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,134
If 1 stay

00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,928

00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,138
I don't want you to die.

Khun Ran!

52
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,354
That's my problem for me to handle

53
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,610
Your family probably wanted me to leave too

54
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,863
But I won't let you go.

55
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,699
Just let me go.

56
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,867
Come home with me Pim

57
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,452
Let go of me!

58
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,246
Come home with me.

59
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,957
Let go!

60
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,347
Hey what are you doing?!

61
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,432
I came to take my wife home.

62
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,600
Pim!

63
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,021
A wife that is unconscious?

64
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,315
Pim!

65
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,159
She doesn't want to stay with you

66
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,828
Why did you follow her here?

67
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,499
If you're her husband and this is the best you can do.

68
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,799
You can do better?

69
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,677
I trusted you

70
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,429
to take Pim away.

71
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,848
Because l thought at least you love Pim

72
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,268
I thought you would be able to keep her safe.

73
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,187
Safe from you.

74
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,315
-Safe from me?!
-Yes!

75
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,110
I didn't lock her up!

76
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,447
If she wanted to go back to you, she could!

77
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,615
But she didn't!

78
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,010
So why don't you just leave now that you know?

79
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,471
Hey!

80
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,356
When there's issues between the couple

81
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,024
they talk it out.

82
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,777
Not talk through a third person

83
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,781
Especially a third person that's always ready

84
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,658
to get in between.

85
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,334
Pim.

86
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:36,974
Don't be sad about it.

87
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,794
I've secretly liked Nai for years

88
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,007
He didn't like me.

89
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,302
But I can live without him.

90
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,600
If I tell him, I was scared our friendship will be ruined.

91
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,189
But even if I tell him, he won't like me back

92
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,361
He just doesn't feel the same.

93
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,533
No matter how good I treat him, he won't love me back.

94
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,341
Nai isn't stupid.

95
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,345
He just knows his own feelings.

96
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,140
He's honest with his feelings

97
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,520
Gosh.

98
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,940
You're defending him

99
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,115
I feel at ease thinking that way

100
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,918
What about you?

101
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,171
Ready?

102
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,975
Pim.

103
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,957
Pim! Pim!

104
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,002
Pim.

105
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,297
Are you okay?

106
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,760
Pim.

107
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,345
Water.

108
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,639
Thanks.

109
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,240
Pim.

110
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,038
You should go.

111
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,998
I want to'rest.

112
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,301
I told you.

113
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,275
Nai.

114
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,781
The seeds you delivered to me the other time

115
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,658
was infected.

116
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,994
I had to cut down the whole farm

117
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,789
Really?

118
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,377
didn't know it was infected. I'll send you new ones

119
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,087
Free of charge.

120
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,174
Why did you sell infected seeds to the villagers?

121
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,385
And who would have known..

122
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,681
which seeds were infected and which we ren't?

123
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,101
Do not make me show you the documents

124
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,982
You're threatening me with this

125
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,943
so you can take Pim home?

126
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,945
You can say that.

127
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,494
But you can also say lam threatening you for the villagers'sake

128
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,083
Do you think they would still want to buy from your shop

129
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,003
if they found out you did this?

130
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,591
Doing business

131
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,802
is about trust.

132
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,804
If your shop can't be trusted

133
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,974
they will stop buying.

134
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,609
If it's a mistake on my end

135
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,237
I will take responsibility

136
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,011
Pim.

137
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,264
Can I come in?

138
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,758
Do you want to go live someplace elsewhere P'Ran can't find you?

139
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,191
You still love him a lot don't you?

140
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,503
-You're really not going to go wait inside?
-No.

141
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,131
Aren't you hot?

142
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:06,965
No.

143
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:11,094
Daddy promised me he will bring Mommy home today

144
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,985
Daddy is here!
- Daddy is here!

145
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,778
Don't run!

146
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,281
Don't run! Wait until he parks the car!

147
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,866
Don't run!

148
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,291
Daddy, where's Mommy?

149
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,342
You lied!

150
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,678
Let's go Ma fai. Mommy isn't here!

151
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,517
Jam.

152
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,519
Go after the kids

153
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,603
Okay,

154
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,609
She won't come back?

155
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,866
She has to no matter what.

156
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,953
I will bring her back here.

157
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,103
Mommy will be back soon

158
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,095
Mommy doesn't love us anymore?

159
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,642
She does.

160
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,021
She loves the both of you very much.

161
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,148
So why isn't she coming home?

162
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,818
She promised me she will make me a teddy bear

163
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,618
Daddy.

164
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,997
Mommy didn't finish making the teddy bear for me.

165
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:48,543
Look right here. It's not sewn yet.

166
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,378
Da isn't here?

167
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,837
No she isn't.

168
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,132
Do you know where she went?

169
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,344
I don't know, She didn't tell us anything

170
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:40,470
Let's go.

171
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,350
CLOSED

172
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,524
Stay strong.

173
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,284
One moment.

174
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,664
What's up?

175
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,499
Are you busy?

176
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,169
I'm busy

177
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,296
I want to see you.

178
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,807
I can't today.

179
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,435
Then...

180
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,770
can I go see you tomorrow morning at your shop?

181
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,856
Yeah.

182
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,191
Tomorrow morning is fine

183
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,776
But it has to be very early.

184
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,070
T have errands afterwards

185
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,614
Okay,

186
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,616
See you tomorrow.

187
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,910
Yeah.

188
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,254
Keep busy.

189
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,799
So he'll realize he can't live without you.

190
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,928
When he has problems, I always see him running to you

191
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,932
But he loves another woman

192
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,601
Absurd.

193
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,112
What about you?

194
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,490
How are you?

195
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,868
Well..

196
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,665
Physically not so bad.

197
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,256
But emotionally not well

198
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,919
She secretly put the ring in Maf euan g's teddy bear

199
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,964
She gave back the ring

200
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,841
Do you guys think she i will come back?

201
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:23,800
I say no.

202
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,468
I say yes.

203
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,137
Will she though?

204
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,515
Pim is very stubborn.

205
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,015
Better late

206
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,769
Before she left, she was very hesitant.

207
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,771
How do you know?

208
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,274
A nomen.

209
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,820
A nomen?! Why didn't you tell Khun Ran?

210
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,282
It's a nomen. It's not clear

211
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,658
If it was clear I would have told him!

212
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,371
- Mom!
- Is now the time?!

213
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,832
Stop arguing!
Better late

214
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,835
The problem is that she's staying at Khun Nai's house.

215
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,630
'Sugarcane into the elephant's mouth "( A fait accompli )

216
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,261
Why can't I get eaten by an elephant?

217
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:09,929
What about me?

218
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,683
You're ca lled ad*ck.

219
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,184
Buffalo!

220
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,395
Extend the word. It's not d*ck.

221
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,273
that's what we call it in our langauge.

222
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:26,821
Hi Boss?

223
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,805
Thanks.

224
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,849
What's wrong?

225
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,185
Heartbroken?

226
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,189
Loving someone who doesn't love you back

227
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,942
no matter how hard you try, they won't love you

228
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,036
So?

229
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,542
Pim probably went back to be with P'Ran by now.

230
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,462
Good.

231
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,799
At least the dress I made won't go to waste

232
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,635
How do you know that?

233
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,512
Pim called.

234
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,764
She said

235
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,100
if K hun Tin died

236
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,477
P'Ran's life isn't at risk.

237
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,106
So she wants to go back to him

238
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,409
Did you go get the key'?

239
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,287
You don't want to see Pim?

240
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,258
What about the thing you discussed with K hun Tin?

241
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,676
What are you gonna do?

242
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,344
Still gonna do it?

243
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,308
P'Ranwill tell the villagers

244
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,268
if I continue to do it.

245
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,020
You deserve it.

246
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,983
Well, it's true!

247
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,526
You'll still have money without swindling.

248
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,653
Why swindle them to cause hardship

249
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,281
and make them struggle even more

250
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,534
know now

251
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,915
I'm helping them fix the problem I've caused

252
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,500
Good.

253
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,878
I'm passing out free seeds

254
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,755
Not infected?

255
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:31,255
Yes.

256
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,840
Not the infected ones.

257
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,135
Also helping the farms that got infected

258
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:40,848
Is this all..

259
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,810
you came to tell me?

260
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,899
I have something to ask you too

261
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,779
All because you love this gir!

262
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,864
who is married by the way.

263
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,451
you had to do this despicable thing'

264
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,964
That's all.

265
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,465
T have to get back to work

266
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,385
Da wait.

267
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,431
What?

268
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,767
I know

269
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,895
that you like me.

270
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,863
So what if you know?

271
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,161
I also know

272
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,539
When you're not around

273
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,545
I don't know who to confide with

274
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,780
Mommy!

275
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,309
I'm not sure

276
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,312
if you had left us for good

277
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,274
how will my'life and the twins'life be?

278
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,944
Stay with me.

279
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,612
I promise

280
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,448
I will be your family.

281
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,242
your friend,

282
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,370
and your lover.

283
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,666
I will make you happy

284
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:01,299
I will hold your hands in times of need.

285
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,969
I will not let go of.your hands

286
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,264
and I will not make you sad

287
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,000
Will you marry me?

288
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,301
You didn't have to do this

289
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,305
I was afraid you would leave me again

290
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,018
I wasn't leaving.

291
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,645
I was coming home

292
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,905
You didn't answer my question yet.

293
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,451
Will you marry me?

294
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,250
Yes.

295
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,636
So...

296
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,140
you did all of this last night?

297
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,477
I didn't do it alone.

298
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,116
Hi Boss.

299
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,159
Uncle.

300
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,703
I need your help with something.

301
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,078
Sure.

302
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,165
But we need all the workers to help

303
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,835
So they saw everything then I supposed.

304
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,590
Aren't you shy?

305
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,091
No.

306
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,138
Even if I have to say it in front of.
hundreds and thousands of people

307
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,849
I won't be shy.

308
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,270
Because I love you.

309
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,442
Let's go set up your prenatal care tomorrow

310
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,155
Okay,

311
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:00,829
What's wrong?

312
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,122
You're going to puke again?

313
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:03,624
Mm.

314
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,169
I think it's you.

315
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:08,837
Oh.

316
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,004
Watch your steps.

317
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:11,298
Be'rcareful.

318
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,512
Out of other things.

319
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,556
you puke because of me.

320
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,690
How are you?

321
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,277
Tonight,

322
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,486
can you sleep here instead?

323
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,117
Of course.

324
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:40,995
But can'you...

325
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,455
recover quickly from this morning sickness?

326
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,376
I just started.

327
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,838
When will you recover?

328
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:55,175
They said in four months.

329
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,511
Four months?!

330
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,528
Can I talk to Pim?

331
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,655
Go ahead.

332
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,264
Khun Chu.

333
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,433
It's me.

334
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,817
I came to apologize

335
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,862
for everything in the past.

336
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,117
gave you so many hardships

337
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,123
I'm not mad at you.

338
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,252
I understand that you did it out of love for Khun Ran.

339
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,297
You can stop addressing me so formally

340
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,925
You're my niece in law

341
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,322
I'l entrust Ran to you.

342
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,660
May you love each other, take care of one another

343
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,621
and talk things out when there are problems

344
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,623
That's all I'm asking.

345
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,966
As for your wedding.

346
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,968
if you're ready

347
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,595
you can have it on my birthday

348
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,849
Ran wants to marry you today, even tomorrow.

349
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,159
Everyone's love journey is different.

350
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,956
We are all looking for the right person.

351
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:36,754
Some are lucky to have met the one as a friend,an acquaintance

352
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:44,428
Just waiting for the day that love will get passed the friend zone into becoming lovers.

353
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,920
Congratulations P'Ran.

354
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:19,838
Thank you for coming.

355
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:27,095
But some people have been searching for the right person all their life

356
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,514
but couldn't.

357
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,101
It's not because they're not good enough

358
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,813
but because they haven't found the right person

359
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,362
In addition to compatibility

360
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:46,031
understanding is probably eg ually important

361
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,784
Because no matter how well fitted the two are,

362
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:53,080
not understanding each other can destroy everything

363
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,134
I went and talked to him.

364
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,930
I asked him to come talk to you today.

365
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,272
But I don't want to talk to him

366
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:23,277
Go talk to him and figure it out together.

367
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,508
You have my support.

368
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,552
Go talk it out.

369
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,305
I think she wants to talk to you too.

370
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,349
Yes.

371
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:16,872
Nus.

372
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,004
Why are you here?

373
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,309
I'm sorry for...

374
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,520
doing things without taking your feelings into consideration

375
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,619
I'm the one that needs to apologize

376
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,373
I didn't try to change myself

377
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,502
I didn't help you work. I was self-centered

378
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,004
L only thought about myself

379
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,639
I want to come home and see you there

380
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:21,269
I want to wake up next to you

381
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,650
A house without you

382
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,529
is not home.

383
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,827
Go home with me.

384
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,666
Let's start over.

385
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,527
Ran.

386
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,611
Are you ready?

387
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,539
We are all waiting for that love.

388
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:28,545
When we know we might get hurt or lose tears because of it.

389
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,984
But we are all willing to trade that

390
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:55,363
in case one day we meet someone.

391
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,159
Someone who will walk this path with us

392
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,703
In happiness and sorrow

393
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:07,084
I met the right person for me

394
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:11,171
And I'm ready to be his everything

395
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:48,250
I hope you all will find the right person.

396
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:59,511
THE END

397
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:06,101
