1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,520
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,560
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:38,720
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,120
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,960
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,360
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,000
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,560
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,640
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,800
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,920
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,159
Do you think we should tell P'Ran about this?

13
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,159
I would.

14
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,758
But I think Nus wouldn't want us to

15
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,119
But if P'Ran finds out later on

16
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,519
that Nus contacted us and we didn't tell him,

17
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,759
how do you think he would feel?

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,479
That's true.

19
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,239
If you guys won't tell him then I will

20
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,439
-Hey
-If Nus finds out later on,

21
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,839
I'll say you guys weren't in on it.

22
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,279
Are you going to go see P'Ran?

23
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,639
Yeah.

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,239
About P'Ran and that girl,

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,519
how are they? Didn't you say you saw them at them all together Nai?

26
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,519
It looked like...

27
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,159
Pim didn't want to be with P'Ran.

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,279
Why do you like a married woman?

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,999
I don't know.

30
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,999
I liked her since Nus's birthday party.

31
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,439
She didn't seem fake.

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,079
She is fake!

33
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,239
She's been seeking attention since the beginning.

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,239
She's probably trying to act different from the others.

35
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,239
Other people are trying to act rich.

36
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,599
So she acts humble, easy to approach.

37
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,919
She knows there were rich men at Nus's birthday party

38
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,079
So what she had hoped came true.

39
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,159
She trapped two men.

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,639
Both are rich.

41
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,319
No one has seen that girl's true colors like l have.

42
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,839
So no one knows that the truth is

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,839
she's not adorable or has a good personality.

44
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,999
No one will understand.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,119
You guys didn't encounter it yourself.

46
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,919
Oh

47
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,519
You're going to leave too?

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,639
Yeah. I have deliveries. Bye.

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,919
Orn.

50
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,639
Nus can't run away for long

51
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,679
Her money is running out. She will come home soon.

52
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,479
May be.

53
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,679
You followed me to tell me not to go tell P'Ran?

54
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,519
I just pity Nus.

55
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,479
If P'Ran finds out

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,959
her boyfriend will be dead.

57
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,119
That's her problem!

58
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,319
Hey.

59
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,119
What's wrong?

60
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,599
Bummed.

61
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,759
About?

62
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,518
I don't want to see P'Ran.

63
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,679
But I have to

64
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,599
Why?

65
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,839
If you don't want to go then don't go.

66
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,159
If someone like you want to do something,

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,359
who would dare stop you?

68
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,639
Really?

69
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,999
Is it not true?

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,959
Not true

71
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,799
Why?

72
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,679
Forget it.

73
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,439
Is something wrong?

74
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,599
Look Orn,

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,999
as a man myself,

76
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,279
You're beautiful.

77
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,279
More beautiful than Pim.

78
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,639
If you don't give up first,

79
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,439
I think it would be easy for P'Ran to change his mind and like you instead.

80
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,439
The reason you're giving me moral support

81
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,759
because if P'Ran breaks it off. with Pim you will have a chance.

82
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,919
But thank you.

83
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,639
I came to give you mangoes.

84
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,519
-Thank you so much Uncle
-When will you sell the corns?

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,599
The price is good right now. Will you sell it?

86
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,239
I'll hold it for later Uncle.

87
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,679
They said it will be a shortage at the stores.

88
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,919
The price will be better then.

89
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,359
Really?

90
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,639
That's right.

91
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,679
Just wait a little.

92
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,959
If you tell me to wait then I will wait.

93
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,439
Thank you so much.

94
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,919
But when you do sell it.

95
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,359
So we can sell it together

96
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,839
Sure thing.

97
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,359
-I'll take off now
-Okay

98
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,319
Khun Saran.

99
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,679
I think you should be the middleman here.

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,159
The villagers listens to you so whatever you sell, they will buy it.

101
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,999
Khun Yut is already doing it. I don't want to hurt him.

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,399
Here, go share the mangoes.

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,959
Okay.

104
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,959
It's still not ripe though.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,759
Mangoes.

106
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,479
Hey.

107
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,999
Pim poured the whole horse poop on Khun Orn's head!

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,519
-Really?!
-Yes!

109
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,439
What a pity!

110
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:54,119
If I were there, I would have helped Pimp our the poop on her until her fakeness is gone!

111
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,319
I'm guessing she won't becoming here for days!

112
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,999
I hope so?

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,599
Someone like Khun Orn,

114
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,519
even if you collect the poop from the whole stable, it can not stop her.

115
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,119
Because the power of sluttiness is too powerful!

116
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,079
You guys can not have any free time huh?

117
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,679
What do you need Ma'am?

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,119
Where's Ran?

119
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,759
Oh, he went to the garden with Uncle Rong.

120
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,639
I think he went to check on the farmers picking the vegetables because tomorrow. is delivery day.

121
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,919
Go get him to come eat.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
Tell him Or n will be joining us.

123
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
 Okay.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,319
" The power of sluttiness is too powerful!"

125
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,319
See? l told you!

126
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,159
Orn.

127
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,839
I had someone go get Ran already.

128
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,319
I told him to come eat dinner at home since you'll be joining us.

129
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,639
-Okay
-Did you guys have a long chat yesterday?

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,799
We didn't talk.

131
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,359
How come?

132
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,799
His wife probably doesn't want him talking to me.

133
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,359
Can we not call her his wife?

134
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,079
It hurts me hearing that.

135
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,679
Sometimes I'm embarrassed

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,159
having to come here to see him when he's already married.

137
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,439
But in my eyes, you are the most suitable person for him.

138
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,519
I don't count other people.

139
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,239
Certain people suit more as a servant.

140
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,479
Eat a lot of grass you guys!

141
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,798
It's once in a while you get to sunbathe.

142
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,359
-Why did you come?
-You fractured your ribs.

143
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,679
I thought you wouldn't be able to work.

144
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,639
Yesterday you told me to wash the horses table

145
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,959
Today you're scared l won't be able to take the sheep to come eat.

146
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,839
Are you okay?

147
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,319
What do you want from me?

148
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,079
So I came to help you take the sheep back

149
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,759
Taking a peek at me?

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,279
Who was?

151
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,639
I saw earlier that you were.

152
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,439
Yes!

153
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,319
I was peeking.

154
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,599
Because I'm trying to figure out what you want from me

155
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,839
to have you follow me here.

156
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:03,799
Orn came.

157
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,079
So I escaped to help you take care of the sheep.

158
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,679
Really?

159
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,959
What's the matter? You don't believe me?

160
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,839
Who would believe you?

161
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,439
You were babying her yesterday

162
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,999
You took her to go shower. She couldn't walk so you carried her.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,999
You even blow dried her hair

164
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,439
You don't like that?

165
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,319
What about you kicking her that she fell on the horse poop?

166
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,599
You haven't told me yet why you did it.

167
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,079
Oh.

168
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,079
I thought you said you saw?

169
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,759
You said I didn't see from the beginning.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,639
Will you tell me or not?

171
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,759
She slapped me first.

172
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,919
And you want me to stand there and let her slap me?

173
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,439
Why did she slap you?

174
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,319
Would you believe me if I told you?

175
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,279
Try me.

176
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,239
She slapped me because I told you guys that she rode the horse to hit Mafeuang.

177
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,759
But she said it wasn't intentional

178
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,319
Gosh!

179
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,519
If you're going to defend her like this, next time don't ask! It's tiring for my mouth!

180
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,159
I tell you but you won't believe me So why do you want me to tell you?!

181
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,119
I want you to

182
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,999
so that I'll know what your side of the story is

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,279
Before you accuse me of listening to only one side of the story like last time.

184
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,999
Listening to both sides but you will still side with her.

185
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,319
I haven't told you what I thought.

186
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,519
You don't have to.

187
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,359
What you did yesterday made me understand that you think it was my fault.

188
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,999
At the horse stable, yes.

189
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,119
You see?

190
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,159
But right now, no.

191
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,359
So you think I was right?

192
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,759
Both of you were wrong.

193
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,679
Hey!

194
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,439
Orn was wrong because she started it.

195
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,799
But you were wrong because you went to get back at her inside the house!

196
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,639
If you're done interrogating then leave!

197
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,159
I can't yet.

198
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,079
What now?

199
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,759
you need to go have dinner with me at the house.

200
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,239
As husband and wife.

201
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,519
Fake husband and wife?

202
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,359
That's right.

203
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,639
I'll eat in the kitchen.

204
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,679
You can't.

205
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,999
Because today, Orn will be joining us here

206
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,759
My goodness!

207
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,799
If I knew since yesterday, I would have handled it.

208
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,119
Don't Auntie.

209
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,599
If P'Ran finds out I told you,

210
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,279
he will not be happy

211
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,279
Then we're going to have a long conversation.

212
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,239
Why let your own people harass someone in front of you?

213
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,599
It's not right.

214
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,679
Finally they're back.

215
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,919
Khun Yut asked Orn to come give us a gift.

216
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,919
Sol asked her to join us for dinner.

217
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,639
Pim.

218
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,279
What did you do to Orn yesterday?

219
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,959
l offered a tray of incense candles to go ask for Khun Orn's forgiveness.

220
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,479
Are you sure it was just that?

221
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,919
Pim came to apologize to Orn about last night too.

222
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,959
I didn't come to apologize

223
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,839
If you're wrong then you should apologize.

224
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,079
It's okay Auntie.

225
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,079
Pim probably didn't mean to.

226
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,439
She didn't mean to pour horse poop on you?

227
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,479
You're being too kind Orn.

228
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,839
The one in the wrong must apologize.

229
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,959
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,279
It's okay. I'm not mad.

231
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,959
But I want Orn to apologize to Pim too

232
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,479
For what happened at the stable.

233
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,439
At the stable?

234
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,679
You slapped Pim

235
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,279
Well...

236
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,959
I slipped sol held on to Pim.

237
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,439
Yes Ran. That's called unintentional.

238
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,759
You don't need to apologize Orn. I understand.

239
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,959
-But Auntie --
-Alright.

240
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,119
Let's go eat Orn.

241
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,999
They went to keep an eye on him already?

242
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,079
Yes.

243
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,279
This batch looks good.

244
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,999
Very good.

245
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,319
I guess we need to head to the border again.

246
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,519
Once he comes out,

247
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,599
just blow his head to end the problem!

248
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,759
Yes Boss.

249
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,319
Mr. Yut is here.

250
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,639
Hello.

251
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,839
Are you doing well Tin?

252
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,639
Yes.

253
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,599
What brings you here Uncle Yut?

254
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,079
I'm worried about something

255
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,799
What is it?

256
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,359
It's about Saran.

257
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,159
Hey, who's that?

258
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,159
I don't know.

259
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,919
Boss only told us two to come tonight

260
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,519
Khun Yut's subordinate.

261
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,119
What can I do for you?

262
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,959
You guys don't need to use guns.

263
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,799
Orn said you promised her not to touch Saran.

264
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,799
Yes.

265
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,279
I heard you sent a hitman to the hospital?

266
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,919
Just to threaten him.

267
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,279
Because Ran went to have me get written up in the record journal

268
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,799
Regarding that girl?

269
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,679
Don't do it during broad daylight then

270
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,599
As for having you in the record journal

271
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,279
I'll handle it.

272
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,639
You've briefly talked with Inspector correct?

273
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,839
Then...

274
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,279
about Saran,

275
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,639
it's a favor from me

276
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,239
I hope tonight I don't get the news that I don't want to hear.

277
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,479
Yes.

278
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,999
That's what I'm talking about!

279
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,599
Five pairs!

280
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,999
I can earn back the money with this kind of luck!

281
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,359
Plus I'll have money to pay back the loan!

282
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,799
You're awesome Ravee!

283
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,679
Cheers!

284
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,639
I'm kind of getting drunk now.

285
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,319
Can you manage?

286
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,759
Can you leave being drunk like this?

287
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,679
Here we go Mom.

288
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,519
Drunk like this, let's see what fake behavior she will come up with next.

289
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,959
You're talking nonsense!

290
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,079
You talk too loud. The bosses will hear you!

291
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,999
I never thought

292
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,159
that suddenly

293
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,479
P'Ran will marry someone else.

294
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,679
I was shocked.

295
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,239
You're not the only one that was shocked.

296
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,759
was more shocked than you!

297
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,639
He disappeared for three days

298
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,839
He brings home a wife on his return.

299
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,679
And his wife is...

300
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,479
I think I was more shocked than everyone.

301
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,919
I woke up one day and ended up having a husband without my knowledge

302
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,519
What?!

303
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,239
Without your knowledge?!

304
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,799
Auntie.

305
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,599
Pim probably meant her marriage to me was like a dream.

306
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,279
Right Pim?

307
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,839
Orn!

308
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,159
Are you alright dear?

309
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,999
Ran!

310
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,599
What are you doing?

311
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,319
Pim was gesturing me.

312
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,119
She needs to talk to me.

313
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,599
Right?

314
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,319
What's his problem?

315
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,759
Newlyweds.

316
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,439
The fire is hot.

317
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,479
What fire?

318
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,359
Fire of lust Mom.

319
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,759
That's enough.

320
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,119
You two, go wherever you need to go.

321
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,359
Yes.

322
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,359
That girl have the audacity!

323
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,759
Gesturing him at the dining table where everyone is at!

324
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,599
Why did you drag me here? Are you insane?

325
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,959
You're insane!

326
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,839
That's why I dragged you here.

327
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,119
How can you say that you got yourself a husband right after you woke up?!

328
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,839
Are you trying to let other people know

329
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,919
-that our marriage--
-Everything was a lie!

330
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,479
So they can stop saying I'm trying to trap you!

331
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,759
Is that real enough?

332
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,079
Who does that?

333
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,599
Gesturing your husband to leave the dining table in front of everyone?

334
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,799
Or maybe...

335
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,919
they went to make some kind of deal?

336
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,159
Hmm?

337
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,519
Gesturing?

338
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,799
Is Pim going to..

339
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,639
They're kissing right here?!

340
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,319
Yes!

341
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,839
Hugging and kissing!

342
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,479
No stunt double

343
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,959
No stunt whatsoever!

344
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,759
What is it?!

345
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,679
Why didn't you tell me?!

346
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,279
did! Come here!

347
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,519
I was enjoying it!

348
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,239
Don't.

349
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,599
Now do you think is real?

350
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,319
I've never kissed Orn like this

351
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,679
only see Orn as a friend.

352
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,679
Not wife.

353
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,839
So?

354
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,639
You don't need to get jealous of her.

355
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,479
There's no reason to get jealous.

356
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,679
You're my wife.

357
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,919
l will only

358
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,519
look at you.

359
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,639
Orn!

360
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,439
-Orn!
-Auntie.

361
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,759
When were you there?

362
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,359
When?

363
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,239
I don't want to say it!

364
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,639
This girl was seducing you wasn't she?!

365
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,119
That's why you're doing something disgusting and obscene like this!

366
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,679
Auntie.

367
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,359
Pim is a millennial.

368
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,679
So she doesn't really care about things like that.

369
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,679
Whatever generation she's from,

370
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,479
non-traditional,

371
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,799
kissing a guy anywhere in the house like this, I can't accept that either!

372
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,999
Orn.

373
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,239
Orn! Honey! Orn!

374
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,239
Orn, are you okay?

375
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,239
Orn!

376
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,679
Hey.

377
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,079
Ran.

378
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,079
You need to take responsibility!

379
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,279
Go drop her off at home!

380
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,959
Don't let Khun Yut

381
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,999
criticize us for not taking good care of his only niece!

382
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,119
Pim.

383
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,679
You come with me.
-No!

384
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,639
Go by yourself!

385
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,439
How attach can you get?!

386
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,639
You won't take the money

387
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,679
You won't go away.

388
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,799
So what's it going to take for you to get out of my house?!

389
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,079
When one year is up I will go.

390
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,839
You don't need to worry that I will be sticking around like fleas and tick for long.

391
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,359
Good thing they attached a brain to your skull

392
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,959
to know that you're fleas and ticks in this house!

393
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,479
But if you are only here for a year,

394
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,639
try to be conservative.

395
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,999
So when you're sold to Danai, you'll be worth something.

396
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,959
Because nobody wants

397
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,519
a flawed product.

398
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,159
It'll be stuck on the shelf, can't be sold,because it expired!

399
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,479
Excuse me now.

400
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,119
Why did she say she will only be here for a year?

401
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,439
But that's good.

402
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,439
At least she will leave.

403
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,639
She won't be here permanently.

404
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,839
Hello.

405
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,159
Saran came out Boss.

406
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,919
Boss

407
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,519
Chai said Saran left his farm

408
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,319
What do we do?

409
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,079
Jay, Deaw.

410
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,439
-Yes?
-Yes?

411
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,959
Go be back up for those guys.

412
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,279
Do not mess this up.

413
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,519
If you can't kill Saran then bring Pim here.

414
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,999
So I can hurt Ran

415
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,919
Make him suffer even better.

416
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,639
Yes Boss.

417
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,799
Let's go.

418
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,239
Bird.

419
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,479
Yes?

420
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,999
Go watch the bar for me.

421
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,439
I won't go today.

422
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,519
Sure Boss.

423
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,519
Brother!

424
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,279
Stay still. I'll take you to the hospital.

425
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,839
Why don't t you go to hell instead?

426
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,759
You're kidnappers?!

427
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,999
When will Daddy come?

428
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,599
I want to cuddle with him.

429
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,439
When will Daddy come?

430
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,159
I want to cuddle with Daddy.

431
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,959
When will Daddy come?

432
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,279
You're burning up.

433
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,759
Daddy.

434
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,759
Daddy isn't home yet.

435
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,759
Just wait a moment

436
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,839
- Daddy.
-What do l do?

437
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,959
Where are you Daddy?

438
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,479
Finally you're back.

439
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,839
With Orn acting fragile like that,

440
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,599
you probably did more than just dropping her off.

441
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,919
P'Jam.

442
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,799
Mafai is burning up.

443
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,079
Daddy.

444
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,519
P'Jam, go bring a bowl of water and a cloth.

445
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,999
He'll go into seizure if his body gets any hotter.

446
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,599
Sure.

447
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,279
Mommy, Is that you?

448
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,839
Yes.

449
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,759
P'Jam, let's just go to the hospital. Go let P'Toei know.

450
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,759
Afterwards, can you watch Mafeuang?

451
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,119
Sure.

452
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,759
Can I not get any shots?

453
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,959
Okay.

454
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,159
No shots.

455
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,679
Hello.

456
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,959
-Hello.
-How are you feeling?

457
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,959
If you're going to give me a shot,
can you give it to Mommy instead?

458
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,159
No shots.

459
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,919
Can you open your mouth for me?

460
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,919
Open your mouth.

461
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,119
Good job!

462
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,319
Throat is a little red.

463
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,519
From the tests, there's no other symptoms.

464
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,759
I think it's just the flu.

465
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,519
I'll give him medicine for that.

466
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:00,239
But if he doesn't get better or have other symptoms like...

467
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,599
red spots or rashes on his body,

468
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,639
quickly bring him back here.

469
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,639
Okay.

470
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,759
Get well soon

471
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,119
-Thank you Doctor.
-Thank you.

472
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,839
Bye.

473
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,519
Good job.

474
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,839
All done Boss.

475
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,079
Take her to my bedroom.

476
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,079
Come on.

477
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,439
Pim.

478
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,119
Ran will go mad crazy

479
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,678
if he finds out you're with me

480
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,519
Orn!

481
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,319
P'Jam.

482
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,599
Yes?

483
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,159
Go to bed.

484
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,999
Mafai has cooled down. I'll watch him for you.

485
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,959
Thank you Khun Pim.

486
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,519
Mommy.

487
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,959
Yes?

488
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,079
Their mother died for two years now.

489
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,199
Why did you guys kidnap Khun Orn?

490
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,439
Khun Orn?

491
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,799
Open your eyes and see!

492
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,359
Go drop her of fat her front porch.

493
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,999
Do not let anyone see that we dropped her off.

494
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,319
I'm sorry.

495
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,759
I didn't think it was Khun Orn that came with Khun Ran.

496
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,839
If you're going to blindly kidnap people like this, we'll all get in trouble!

497
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,119
If Uncle Yut found out we kidnapped his niece

498
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,079
we'll be in trouble!

499
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,439
Quickly drop her off.

500
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,919
-Go!
-Yes sir!

501
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,079
Come on.

502
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,239
Can you sleep with me Mommy?

503
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,479
What was that?

504
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,639
Can you sleep with me?

505
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,599
Sure.

506
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,479
Is it done?

507
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,079
I dropped her off in the front.

508
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,839
No one saw right?

509
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,359
No.

510
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,519
I've looked everywhere but can't find them.

511
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,639
Will those people contact Uncle Yut for ransom?

512
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,919
Orn.

513
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,319
What happened?!

514
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,439
Why did Orn come home in this state?

515
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,239
Probably drunk from the wine.

516
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,919
What time did she drink?!

517
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,839
Why are you just bringing her home now?
It's almost 2am!

518
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,839
Take her to her bedroom then

519
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,639
We'll talk tomorrow.

520
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,919
Bunga.

521
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,959
-Yes?
-Lead the way.

522
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,639
This way please.

523
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,599
Jam.

524
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,759
Khun Ran.

525
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,839
Why aren't you sleeping with the kids?

526
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,919
Why are you sleeping here?

527
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,319
Mafai was burning up.

528
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,439
If you're here, who's watching him?

529
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,119
Khun Pim.

530
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,999
Khun Pim took him to the hospital but he's still feeling kind of hot.

531
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,799
So she has been wiping him down all night and told me to come get some rest.

532
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,879
But I came to wait here so that when you get home, I can inform you.

533
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,079
Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good

534
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,959
<i>♫ Just your normal average man ♫</i>

535
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:59,799

537

538

545
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,639

547
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:05,679

549
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,279
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

550
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,119
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

551
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,759
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

552
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:33,159
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night ♫</i>

553
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,679
Khun orn.

554
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,959
Khun Yut is waiting for you in the dining room.

555
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,319
You wanted to talk to me?

556
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,519
How much did you drink last night?

557
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,439
You came home in the morning.

558
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,839
Who dropped me off?

559
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,519
You were so drunk that you don't know who's been carrying you around?!

560
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,679
Ran dropped you off close to morning

561
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,839
Close to morning?

562
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,599
But last night...

563
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,999
the last thing l remember was having a drink at his house around 9pm.

564
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,839
Then I got up to...

565
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,679
Where did you go?

566
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,519
<i>I only see her as a friend.</i>

567
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,959
<i>Not wife.</i>

568
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,479
<i>I can't remember</i>

569
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,279
I probably blanked out then.

570
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,839
From 9pm to 2am when Ran dropped you off,

571
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,759
what happened?!

572
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,239
<i>I think you need to take responsibility.</i>

573
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,439
<i>I think Pim is uncomfortable too.</i>

574
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,159
<i>I don't think she is happy to be the daughter in law of this house</i>

575
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,319
<i>You failed at trapping him.</i>

576
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,599
<i>You can't blame me for doing a better job at it.</i>

577
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,439
<i>It's good if you fall and die!</i>

578
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,839
<i>So P'Ran and I will not have any third wheel!</i>

579
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,839
<i>-Khun Orn!
-Let go</i>

580
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,999
<i>Let me go!</i>

581
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:56,600
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

582
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:05,060
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

583
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:10,460
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

584
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,000
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

585
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:22,440
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
