00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,320
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,360
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,520
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,920
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,760
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,800
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:04,360
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,440
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,600
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,119
Orn!

13
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,439
If you can't handle her,

14
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,999
then I will!

15
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,279
Pim!

16
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,479
Orn.

17
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,999
Yes?

18
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,599
Did you need something?

19
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,839
Aunt Chu asked me to come talk to you about...

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,799
about...

21
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,759
about the people's safety here.

22
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,959
Auntie asked you to come speak to me

23
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,359
about handing over Vee to Tinnamai?

24
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,519
She's just worried.

25
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,519
She doesn't know what Khun Tin will do.

26
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,599
Especially with the twins here.

27
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,479
She's probably scared that

28
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,119
he will do something to them.

29
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,119
I've thought it through.

30
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,919
Let's go Pim.

31
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,279
Hello.

32
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,279
What are you here to buy?

33
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,599
A ring.

34
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,839
May I see this diamond ring?

35
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,999
Sure.

36
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,119
Diamond ring?

37
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,799
For yourself?

38
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,319
I'd like this one.

39
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,879
Do you know the size?

40
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,799
About that.

41
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,359
Can I have your hand?

42
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,599
Can I try?

43
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,239
Sure.

44
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,759
Perfect.

45
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,319
The size fits perfectly.

46
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,919
I'd like this size.

47
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,119
But I want the diamond to be about two karats.

48
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,159
Sure.

49
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,639
-Come eat!
-Come eat!

50
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,959
Help yourself.

51
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,999
Come

52
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,799
Scoop a lot.

53
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,279
What did you make? It looks good

54
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,519
Of course it's something delicious!

55
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,319
Thank you so much.

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,759
Orn.

57
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,319
Do you want to join us?

58
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,839
No thank you.

59
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,439
I'll take off. I can go eat with Da and Nai.

60
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,959
Drive safe.

61
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,239
Okay.

62
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,359
Wait here. I'll go get your food.

63
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,679
Looks good.

64
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,839
Pim.

65
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,919
Any message for Nai?

66
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,999
No.

67
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,159
You won't tell him to get over you?

68
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,439
Because you're going to latch on to P'Ran and never let go.

69
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,359
I'll leave a message for you

70
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,599
Stop messing with my husband already

71
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,359
Because he loves me very much

72
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,479
I think he won't go back to you anymore.

73
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,079
Because he knows what's good for him and what's not.

74
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,079
What's the matter?

75
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,679
Nothing!

76
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,359
Come, Let's go eat.

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,279
Well?

78
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,799
You invited me to go eat but we ended up at a bar.

79
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,919
Aunt Chu said

80
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,119
Pim doesn't really wanna be with P'Ran.

81
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,439
And?

82
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,799
Do you think...

83
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,079
they will break up?

84
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,679
Whether they break up or not.
it has nothing to do with me.

85
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,239
I want to propose to Pim.

86
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,799
Someone like you can like any woman you want.

87
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,839
But why do you want a married woman?

88
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,519
Pim might not love P'Ran.

89
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,279
She might have a reason to marry him.

90
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,079
But they're living together.

91
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,839
Feelings are bound to develop.

92
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,519
It already has!

93
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,279
They kissed right in front of me.
I saw with my own eyes!

94
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,559
Orn.

95
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,319
Who are you talking about?

96
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,479
That pure innocent girl like Pim. Who else?

97
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,639
I told you. They live and sleep in the same room. It will be strange if no feelings are there!

98
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,359
She told me that P'Ran is her husband that loves her very much

99
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,159
He will never want me!

100
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,999
Wow, Nai likes someone who talks that way?

101
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,479
Hearing her say that makes me want to pull her hair!

102
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,159
Excuse me, I want On the Rocks

103
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,479
It's late. You're still going to make it?

104
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,079
It won't be finished if I don't do it

105
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,959
400 of them.

106
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,639
We've been making it since noon

107
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,599
I think we made about 60 or 70 of them.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,159
All ruined!

109
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,959
What we started from morning til now,

110
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,679
we have to start everything from scratch again.

111
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,759
What happened here?

112
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,359
After we came back from having dinner,

113
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,039
Mn never we just saw the mess like this.

114
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,279
Alright. Help cleanup.

115
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,279
Keep the ones that look decent.

116
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,399
How much is left?

117
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,599
About ten of them.

118
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,519
Tonight, let's help each other make about 50.

119
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,319
We can do more tomorrow.

120
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,359
There's only two days left.

121
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
150 a day, If we do it nonstop, I think we can make it.

122
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,159
Pim.

123
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,639
If you really can't do it,

124
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,639
go tell Aunt Chu.

125
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,159
I think she will understand.

126
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,639
No.

127
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,239
It has to be done.

128
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,599
Who did this?

129
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,639
So I gave them a big one.

130
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,999
So they won't have any time to sleep or be romantic!

131
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,759
Can I have the same one again?

132
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,239
What did you do?

133
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,639
He loves you very much?!

134
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,479
Imagine Pim's reaction right now.

135
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,679
So satisfying!

136
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,079
She's probably going to sit and sleep to sew to make it in time.

137
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,319
But I'm still mad at her.

138
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,799
I think you've drank too much.

139
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,119
Khun Tin.

140
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,239
Hello.

141
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,279
Make yourselves comfortable. My treat tonight.

142
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,519
Thank you.

143
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,119
What's wrong Nai?

144
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,919
You're not feeling okay?

145
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,439
I'm okay.

146
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,839
Make yourselves comfortable

147
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,999
Okay.

148
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,439
Khun Tin.

149
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,319
I need to talk to you.

150
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,159
Sure.

151
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,159
Where is she going?

152
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,759
What's wrong?

153
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,119
I'm leaving.

154
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,999
Excuse me.

155
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,159
Bill please.

156
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,999
Why?

157
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,519
I don't want him to pay.

158
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,479
Let's go.

159
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,479
Why did you give up so easily?

160
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,919
I didn't give up

161
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,079
Don't talk.

162
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,359
You backing away so easily like that isn't you.

163
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,839
Sometimes when you back away,

164
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,679
it doesn't mean surrender.

165
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,799
But we back away

166
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,959
because maybe we got something we wanted.

167
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,799
Whatever.

168
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,279
If you say you got what you wanted

169
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,319
then help me with something.

170
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,119
What can I do for you?

171
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,119
Find a hitman for me.

172
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,839
Hitman?

173
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,839
Uncle Yut has plenty

174
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,759
Why do you need my help?

175
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,239
Because I don't want Uncle Yut to know

176
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,359
I want to kill Pim.

177
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,279
I want her dead.

178
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,679
Sure.

179
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,159
I can do that for you

180
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,359
I'll do it. I'll do it for you

181
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,919
Go to sleep.

182
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,600
I can do it.

183
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,239
When did I fall asleep?

184
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,319
Just a minute ago.

185
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,839
I came here to help you.

186
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,959
But instead I fell asleep

187
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,959
You can go to sleep

188
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,319
I'll wake you up when I'm done.

189
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,999
Let me keep you company.

190
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,639
Why did you wake up so soon?

191
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,999
Come back to sleep. It's still early.

192
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,839
Why didn't you drop me off?!

193
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,319
You said you didn't want to go home.

194
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,279
Let's go home. I'll drop you off.

195
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,959
I don't want to go home.

196
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,119
Then where do you want to go? You're very drunk right now.

197
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,839
I'll sleep here!

198
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,639
But even if I said I want to go back to your house,

199
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,079
you have no right to do anything to me!

200
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,799
Just because I was drunk, you can't just drag me on your bed!

201
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,359
We've talked about this.

202
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,959
If l don't give consent, you have no right to do anything to me!

203
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,479
I did everything we agreed on.

204
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,839
You didn't break any promises?

205
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,279
Why am I in this state then?!

206
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,679
I didn't just get drunk and you slept with me.

207
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,479
But you didn't use a condom!

208
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,799
You started it.

209
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,159
Whoever started it,

210
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,519
I don't know.

211
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,279
But even if it was me, you had to look after me!

212
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,319
Did you record us?

213
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,119
Khun Tin!

214
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,119
Did you record us?!

215
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,439
Delete it right now!

216
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,239
Give it to me!

217
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,279
I said delete it!

218
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,519
- Delete it!
-No!

219
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,639
I won't delete it!

220
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,679
When I call you from now on,

221
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,479
you need to come see me.

222
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,759
If you don't want anyone to see this clip.

223
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,159
From now on,

224
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,639
you can't play hard to get with me anymore.

225
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,439
Go. Walk faster.

226
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,519
Run!

227
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,119
Go on in.

228
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,519
Oh.

229
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,839
What's the matter now?!

230
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,759
Why aren't you going in?!

231
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,759
Can't go in yet.

232
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,759
Why not? Trying to procrastinate now?

233
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,239
I'm not procrastinating!

234
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,599
But...

235
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,319
Move out the way!

236
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,159
P'Taew!

237
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,159
Aunt Noi!

238
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,639
We have someone to wake them up.

239
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,759
Where's Mommy and Daddy?

240
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,119
They're inside.

241
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,919
Go wake them up.

242
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,079
Tip toe inside.

243
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,440
Tip toe

244
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,639
Oh my god!

245
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,279
Jam!

246
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,839
Go bring the kids out!

247
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,999
Is that a good idea?

248
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,159
Just go!

249
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,959
Good morning!

250
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,079
How did you get here?

251
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,319
Grandma.

252
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,239
Go shower so you can get back to work.

253
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,599
Okay.

254
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,919
Why didn't you call me?

255
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,319
Who would dare?

256
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,239
You saw too?

257
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,679
Why of course!

258
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,759
All four eyes, both me and Mom.

259
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,079
How was it? Cuddling all night.

260
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,119
Were you warm?

261
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,079
Must be very warm.

262
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,239
I'm so cold!

263
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,919
Enough!

264
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,319
Did you cuddle Mommy all night?

265
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,439
of course he did. He cuddled her very tightly

266
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,079
Jam.

267
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,319
I think we should go see P'Taew outside

268
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,079
I think she wants to play tag with you

269
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,359
Let's go.

270
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,359
Come on let's go.

271
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,839
Let's go outside.

272
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,079
Those are my i shoes!

273
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,359
Let's go.

274
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,479
Whatever you do, try to save my face.

275
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,479
If the workers came and saw, how much will they gossip?

276
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,159
I don't see a problem with it.

277
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,679
We're husband and wife

278
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,119
Cuddling is a normal thing.

279
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,679
This is a warehouse.

280
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,679
Yes.

281
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,119
Innocent on the outside but fierce in bed.

282
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,319
That's why so many men like her.

283
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,079
I'm gonna go shower.

284
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,319
I have errands to do.

285
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,079
Why did I fall asleep like that?

286
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,279
And the person that saw was Khun Chu!

287
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,439
P'Taew and Aunt Noi also saw!

288
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,319
What's the matter?

289
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,959
Can we cuddle some more?

290
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,839
I didn't want to wake up yet.

291
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,919
You can go back to sleep.

292
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,799
I'm gonna go shower and get back to making the sheep.

293
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,679
We have workers.

294
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,239
They'll come do the work soon.

295
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,639
I think it's fine if you're a little late.

296
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,079
Khun Ran.

297
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,679
400 isn't so little.

298
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,639
It won't be done if I don't get it done.

299
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,239
The question I asked,

300
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,079
I still need an answer.

301
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,839
If you won't answer,

302
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,599
I won't let you go.

303
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,959
Finally 60 of them!

304
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,159
Khun Ran.

305
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,800
I'm done.

306
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,679
Go sleep in your room.

307
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,799
Khun Ran.

308
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,799
You won't wake up?

309
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,119
Sleep here then.

310
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,999
Sleep with me here

311
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,519
It would be more comfortable sleeping on the bed.

312
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,239
My back hurts from sitting making all the sheep.

313
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,919
When you sleep with me,

314
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,119
anywhere is comfortable.

315
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,239
Can I call off the contract?

316
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,639
You can't!

317
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,439
Trying to have sex with me?!

318
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,279
I'm not trying to have sex with you.

319
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,759
I just don't want you to go.

320
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,679
Can you stay with me forever

321
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,079
without the contract?

322
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,519
Well?

323
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,679
When the one year is up,

324
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,439
then we'll talk about it.

325
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,599
Pim.

326
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,319
P'Nai.

327
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,319
I was on my way to see you.

328
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,639
What is it?

329
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,639
I came to see if you need any help.

330
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,279
I heard you had to make hundreds of sheep.

331
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,559
I came to help.

332
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,639
Okay?

333
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,959
Can you help by going home then?

334
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,519
Can you go home first?

335
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,639
Before there's any problems.

336
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,639
Okay.

337
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,239
But it's good that you're here.

338
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,759
Can I buy back Pim's sheep?

339
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,639
Buy back?

340
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,119
Why do you want to buy it back?

341
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,639
It's my sheep not yours.

342
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,639
I sold them to P'Nai already

343
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,639
Why are you meddling?!

344
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,479
What's yours is mine.

345
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,999
I can't buy it back?

346
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,599
But I won't sell it to you.

347
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,959
But if you want it back,

348
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,159
I'm happy to give it to you for free.

349
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,999
If I want them back,

350
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,079
I'll buy them back with my own money

351
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,159
Wait Pim.

352
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,119
I think

353
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,959
you're coming in and out of here like it's your home way too much.

354
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,679
Toei.

355
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,679
Yes?

356
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,799
Walk Khun Danai to his car.

357
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,359
From now on let everyone know

358
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,119
Khun Danai is forbidden from coming here.

359
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,079
Oh.

360
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,599
How do I deliver the products for you?

361
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,839
That's a must.

362
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,999
Yes it's a must.

363
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,599
But you don't need to come.

364
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,599
Let your subordinate come instead.

365
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,159
I don't mind.

366
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,079
Let's go Khun Nai.

367
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,719
You're really going to obey his order?

368
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,039
He's my boss. An order is an order.

369
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,279
Please.

370
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,359
Toei.

371
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,799
Pim.

372
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,439
Hey Pim!

373
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,799
What?

374
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,519
What I asked you,

375
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,159
you can never give me an answer.

376
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,519
Is it really because of Nai?

377
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,239
I told you many times that it's not.

378
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,439
Then why can't you give me an answer

379
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,319
whether you can stay here with me or not?

380
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,599
Because the people here do not welcome me.

381
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,479
Can i be honest?

382
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,599
Your aunt doesn't want me to stay here.

383
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,519
She hates that I'm the granddaughter of a poor person.

384
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,519
In the past,

385
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,799
she tried to pay me sol can leave

386
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,679
But I didn't take her money.

387
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,519
She listens to whatever Khun Orn say to her

388
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,759
because she prefers Khun Orn as her niece in law.

389
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,759
As for me,

390
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,079
I'm the person she wants to get rid of!

391
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,999
With that,

392
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,479
you still want to ask me to stay here with you?

393
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,479
I think

394
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,359
we should stop talking about the impossible

395
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,639
He forbade me from going to his farm.

396
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,359
He even had his subordinate walk me to my car.

397
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,079
That's his wife. It's normal for him to get possessive.

398
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,239
How did Pim even marry him?

399
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,799
I don't know.

400
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,119
Hey.

401
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,959
So what should I do?

402
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,959
Stop messing with his wife.

403
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,519
You guys are doing business together.
Plus he's your big customer too.

404
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,519
He orders batches of products from you.

405
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,959
Getting into an argument with him will make you lose a good customer.

406
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,519
I guess you can't give her the ring now

407
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,599
Give it to me instead.

408
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,279
I guarantee you I'm single,

409
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,599
easy to court, can look after myself,

410
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,079
I'm not complicated.

411
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,759
With your high standards

412
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,799
you're better off with a rich man.

413
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,439
I don't want a rich man.

414
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,119
I want a good man.

415
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,919
Good as you is fine.

416
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,959
You can find someone better than me.

417
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,759
I don't want someone better

418
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,279
I want you.

419
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,479
Kidding!

420
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,959
Lightning will strike if I get with you.

421
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,079
Did I not take good care of you?!

422
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,479
Why did you do this to me?!

423
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,479
You...

424
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,999
If I can't take care of you

425
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,919
I will sell you.

426
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,999
No! Please don't sell me!

427
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,439
I'm begging you,a please don't sell me!

428
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,079
If you don't want me to sell you,

429
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,479
what will you do for me?

430
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,439
Boss.

431
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,839
The hitman that will kill Ran is here.

432
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,839
Thanks.

433
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,519
Untie Nuan for me.

434
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,359
Throw her out in front of the farm.

435
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,159
Boss.

436
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,599
She betrayed you. You're just gonna let her go?

437
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,159
Someone like me won't let anyone go so easily

438
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,279
Get down!

439
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,959
Who's shooting around here?

440
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,119
Take the car and go check.

441
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,159
Okay

442
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,959
Why did  you run towards the car?!

443
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,359
My goodness!

444
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,359
Again Ran?

445
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,239
We can't take in everyone that has a problem.

446
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,239
We already have enough problems in our hands.

447
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,119
But she saved Pim before.

448
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,679
So?

449
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,639
Do you want to give her money?

450
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,519
Just reward her and this can be over

451
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,319
She can go wherever she wants to go.

452
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,599
No.

453
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,439
She helped us before.

454
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,839
Now that she's in trouble,

455
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,839
we need to help her.

456
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,959
It's been hours. Who knows if the pill will work or not.

457
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,799
Can Pim do it?

458
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,999
She didn't sleep last night. She probably won't be sleeping tonight either.

459
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,519
Khun Chu shouldn't have agreed to do 400 of them.

460
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,159
Toei.

461
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,119
What are you doing here?!

462
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,999
P'Toei! P'Toei!

463
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,999
P'Toei!

464
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,919
Geez!

465
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,039
Why are you sleeping here?

466
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,439
Waiting for you.

467
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,639
Are you done?

468
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,999
I'll continue tomorrow.

469
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,239
I'm too sleepy today, I can't do it anymore.

470
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,559
Why are you waiting for me?

471
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,359
Well..

472
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,319
if I love you, I must wait.

473
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,639
That's what Aunt Noi told me.

474
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,759
Gosh!...

475
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,559
I meant if you love Taew then you must wait!

476
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,119
Wait for the day you can take care of her!

477
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,959
Then you can get married!

478
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,079
Not wait in front of the room like this you asshole!

479
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,319
Oh really?

480
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,839
Let me just spit on you!

481
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,839
thought you were romantic!

482
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,319
Where did Rong go?

483
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,479
Khun Ran told him to go guard in front of the farm.

484
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,159
So Khun Nai doesn't come in.

485
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,079
He gets the night shift while I take the day shift.

486
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,079
I'm going to bed. I'm sleepy.

487
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,919
You guys go to sleep too.

488
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,519
Okay.

489
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,639
I'm going to bed now.

490
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,439
Wait.

491
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,519
I need to tell you something

492
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,239
What is it?

493
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,799
Look!

494
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,239
P'Toei!

495
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,999
I'm going to bed. I'm sleepy.

496
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,799
Sweet dreams

497
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,159
Pim!

498
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,639
Why are you sleeping right here?

499
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,319
Wow!

500
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,679
You've done that much already? And it was just one night.

501
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,839
Was I making it while sleeping?

502
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,639
While sleeping?!

503
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,879
If you're going to make this much then go for it!

504
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,359
If it's going to be fast like this,

505
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,079
you'll be finished by tomorrow.

506
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,759
You're really not going to talk to me?

507
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,759
There's nothing to talk about.

508
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,079
Wait.

509
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,159
You're speaking " Thai " to me now?

510
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,359
I don't want to be close to you anymore.

511
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,839
We've become close.

512
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,159
Now you say you don't want to be close? 
Can you do that?

513
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,439
Yes.

514
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,239
Pim.

515
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,799
Can you not talk sarcasm with me?

516
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,479
No!

517
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,079
Why?

518
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,679
Because you don't understand my situation.

519
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,319
You don't understand anything!

520
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,159
And you hope to get the answer that you like?

521
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,479
If you're going to be like this

522
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,359
then you're way too selfish!

523
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,079
Everything l do is wrong!

524
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,119
<i>It's like there's an agreement between those two.</i>

525
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,159
<i>Yes.</i>

526
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,279
<i>We just need to find out what deal they made with each other.</i>

527
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,079
<i>If I say that I love you</i>

528
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,279
<i>and I want to call off that contract,</i>

529
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,959
<i>I will do everything to have you stay with me.</i>

530
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,639
<i>Will you marry me for real this time?</i>

531
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:07,200
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

532
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:15,660
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

533
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,060
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

534
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,600
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

535
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:33,040
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
