1
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,320
<i>♫ Because I'm this kind of person, not so very good ♫</i>

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,360
<i>♫ Just your normal l average man ♫</i>

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>♫ I'm not a weak person, never was sensitive until I met you ♫</i>

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>♫ It was strange when we first locked eyes ♫</i>

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,760
<i>♫ You made me realize I'm not the same ♫</i>

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
<i>♫ You made someone like me understand ♫</i>

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
<i>♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫</i>

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,360
<i>♫ You've changed the life of my day and night? ♫</i>

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>♫ I like the way I am ♫</i>

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,600
<i>♫ I like it when you're close to me ♫</i>

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,720
<i>♫ Do you know why? I've changed because of you ♫</i>

12
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,999
Ran isn't here

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679
so I have to come check on the crops myself.

14
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,319
Toei!

15
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,079
Where are you taking the grass?

16
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,439
The chicken pen is that way.

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,239
Drying it to make hay.

18
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,199
Move. Come on.

19
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,599
Come.

20
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,759
Here.

21
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,799
That was close.

22
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,279
If Khun Chu finds out,

23
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,599
I will get scolded until my children ordains.

24
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,120
Calm down. Here.

25
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,160
He said he will make hay from the grass.

26
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,079
But he's actually giving it to the sheep

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,239
Eat up.

28
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,439
Your Pim will come get you soon.

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,519
If you guys get skinny,

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,759
Khun Ran will scold me.

31
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,079
Eat up. Hurry.

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,279
It's my turn now.

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,319
I'll get this one.

34
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,079
You can't use two hands

35
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,239
Really?

36
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,119
I'll be back.

37
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,279
Grandma, when will Daddy be back?

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,639
I know right? I want to know too.

39
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,479
Go play with Mafeuang.

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,279
When Daddy comes, I'll let someone come get you.

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,359
I miss Daddy

42
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,119
You do? He'll be back soon okay?

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,439
Take it out Take it out!

44
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,159
The ones that are blocked inside are easy.

45
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,119
Put it right here.

46
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,759
-Taew.
-Yes?

47
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,519
Where's your dad?

48
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,759
I don't know.

49
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,759
But I heard he went to run errands.

50
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,119
I saw that you guys go over to that farm often. To do what?

51
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,319
To...

52
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,599
Go bring in more stuff

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,279
Okay.

54
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,999
Well Noi?

55
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,079
What were you guys doing at Ruj's farm so often?

56
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,359
Lately I've seen you guys go there every day.

57
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,479
Sometimes you're there all day.

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,759
Hmm?

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,679
We went to check on Pim.

60
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,279
Don't act like I'm stupid.

61
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,439
Yes Ma'am.

62
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,119
Where's Rong?

63
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,679
He went to see Khun Ran at the hospital.

64
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,519
Ran likes that girl?

65
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,639
Is she trying to trap Ran just like Orn said?

66
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,359
Here's all the documents.

67
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,679
Here.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,839
A copy of her photo l D, and house registration.

69
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,519
Sign right here.

70
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,239
Sure.

71
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,800
-Uncle
-Yes?

72
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,560
-Can you help put this down?
-Sure.

73
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,599
-Excuse me Uncle
-Go ahead.

74
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,959
Pim.

75
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,159
Can you write your name?

76
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,239
Write your name right here.

77
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,959
Why do I have to?

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,239
The doctor wants to know if you remember your name or not.

79
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,679
All done.

80
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,759
One moment please.

81
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,919
Can l have the two witness sign right here?

82
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,080
Sure.

83
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,239
If you say witness,l really like that term.

84
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,359
I can't really see clearly Right here?

85
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,279
-All done.
-Please, Manager.

86
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,359
Congratulations Khun Saran.

87
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,919
Congratulations Pim.

88
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,519
Grandpa Ru j isn't here anymore so now you have Saran to look after you.

89
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,239
Congratulations.

90
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,599
Thank you.

91
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,639
Uncle Rong.

92
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,279
. Yes?
-Can you drop off the registrar at the district office?

93
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,759
Do you want me to put it away?

94
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,599
It's okay.

95
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,279
I'll do it. Take this with you.

96
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,918
Okay.

97
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,079
-I'll do it.
-Okay.

98
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,959
-Right this way.
-Okay

99
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,239
-Manager.
Yes?

100
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,959
-Did you bring the document?
-l did.

101
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,599
-Shall we go discuss this at a cafe? I'll be there shortly
-Sure.

102
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,439
I was wondering why you went to the bank to see me.

103
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,999
Yes.

104
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,479
We actually got engaged shortly before Grandpa Ru j passed.

105
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,359
But no one knows about it

106
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,079
No wonder!

107
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,799
That's why Khun Ravee said Khun
Pimpika will come redeem the land herself.

108
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,239
So that's the story

109
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,639
But anyway, congratulations Khun Ran.

110
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,599
Thank you.

111
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,320
I'll let you handle the rest.

112
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,919
Once it's finished, I'll call to let you know.

113
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,959
Okay.

114
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,239
From now on,

115
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,239
you will be my lawful wedded wife.

116
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,279
Who's your wife?

117
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,799
You.

118
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,439
He's still not back?

119
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,799
Yeah.

120
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,479
He's still at the hospital

121
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,759
With who?

122
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,439
Pim.

123
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,959
I'm starting to think what you're thinking too now.

124
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,799
Are you going to let her fix her financial problem by trapping your nephew?

125
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,639
Orn.

126
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,439
Come to the hospital with me.

127
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,119
Wait one moment please.

128
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,479
Sure.

129
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,959
I have a favor to ask

130
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,519
What :is it?

131
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,919
If l can help you,l will do it.

132
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,239
I'm selling you my land.

133
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,079
Please look after Pim for me.

134
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,639
She's a good kid.

135
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,999
I'm worried she will get taken advantage of by Vee.

136
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,519
Vee doesn't care about his sibling.

137
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,519
He only cares about himself.

138
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,479
I'm scared she will struggle.

139
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,240
<i>This land..</i>

140
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,359
<i>is mortgage dfor500 K.</i>

141
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,959
<i>Please give this letter-to Pim.</i>

142
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,479
<i>If anything happens to me.</i>

143
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,599
Ran.

144
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,239
Why do you have to watch over her all day and night?

145
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,799
I think just dropping her off at the hospital is enough

146
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,919
When you called me yesterday, I thought you would be done and would be coming home.

147
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,999
I didn't want to leave Pim alone at the hospital.

148
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,439
I'm worried that when she wakes up,

149
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,439
she will get startled.

150
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,119
Pim would be even more startled to know her house was burned.

151
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,919
That I know.

152
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,919
And you're still going to help her?

153
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,679
I'm thinking of having Pim move in with us.

154
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,839
What?!

155
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,439
Ran!

156
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,279
How can you let a woman who isn't your wife move in?!

157
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,159
-What?!
-Pim and la remarried.

158
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,519
You're disrespecting me by doing this.

159
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,479
But I think this is the best solution

160
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,359
For me

161
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,759
and for Pim.

162
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,319
Best solution for Pim, yes. But not for you.

163
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,679
You have Orn who suits you more than Pim.

164
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,839
How about this?

165
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,839
Take Pim to get a divorce tomorrow.

166
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,999
So this can be over.

167
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,959
No.

168
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,119
I think I made the right decision Auntie.

169
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,359
Ran!

170
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,838
Auntie.

171
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,159
If Orn was the one,

172
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,598
we would have been together already.

173
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,279
So you're saying Pim is the one?

174
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,439
Yes.

175
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,279
Why can't I compete with a poor girl like you?

176
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,079
I never thought that that girl would trap Ran like you said

177
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,279
Who would imagine that Ran would sign the marriage certificate?

178
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,279
It's okay Auntie.

179
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,119
one day P'Ran will know he made the wrong decision.

180
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,639
Whether he breaks up with her now or later, the results will be the same.

181
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,639
Orn.

182
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,759
Don't give up yet.

183
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,799
One day Ran will see that you suit him the most more than that girl.

184
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,279
Yes.

185
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,919
Is this all you're capable of?

186
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,599
What?

187
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,639
All you're able to do was burn her house and threaten her?

188
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,079
Is this all you came to tell me?

189
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,759
Usually, when you want something you never let it slip away.

190
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,319
But how come you let Pim go be with P'Ran this time?

191
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,279
You burned her house so she has nowhere to go

192
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,119
But you didn't think P'Ran would be her shelter, right?

193
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,639
Do you know

194
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,639
where they are?

195
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,759
The hospital.

196
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,919
Sia.

197
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,519
The doctor just left that room.

198
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,999
Wait a bit.

199
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,519
You guys prepared your nurse scrubs already right?

200
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,799
Yes.

201
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,839
Don't forget the wheelchair.

202
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,239
Khun Ran!

203
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,839
You can't save Pim.

204
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,439
What are you going to do?

205
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,679
I paid 500K for this woman.

206
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,599
She's mine.

207
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,959
Don't get involved.

208
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,239
Let me handle my business quietly

209
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,919
You paid P'Vee.

210
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:04,840
I didn't know about it.

211
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,999
I won't go with you!

212
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,759
Then I'll just have to drag you.

213
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,359
Help!

214
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,799
You wouldn't dare shoot me.

215
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,319
Because you're just a backbiting dog!

216
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,639
What happened?!

217
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,999
Pim was dreaming.

218
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,799
She was yelling across the room.

219
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,119
So I called the male nurse outside to come help her.

220
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,919
The patient took some medication.
There might be some side effects.

221
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,319
But would l her condition be this bad?

222
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,999
I'll take my leave then.

223
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,159
If the patient is like this, it will be inconvenient.

224
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,440
Let the doctor know

225
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,800
I will be taking the patient home!

226
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,759
We'll be leaving tonight!

227
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,839
Hey.

228
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,519
Are you hurt anywhere?

229
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,839
Why couldn't you guys get her?! She's just a small girl!

230
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,479
Boss.

231
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,439
She might be small but she has a lot of strength

232
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,999
Ran is taking her home

233
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,519
It'll be hard to take her now.

234
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,839
Compress this and I'll go get your medicine to take home.

235
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,639
You'll be going home soon.

236
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,999
Okay.

237
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,839
Just a little crack. No need for stitches but don't let the wound get wet.

238
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,599
Okay.

239
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,999
--Thank you so much
-Excuse me now.

240
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
You're taking me home?

241
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,280
Does your face hurt a lot?

242
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,919
It hurts.

243
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,999
But not much.

244
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,599
A ring?!

245
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,119
You're married to me.

246
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,319
Married?!

247
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,279
When did I marry you?!

248
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,159
Why can't I remember?

249
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,719
A few days ago.

250
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,239
You signed your name. Why can't you remember?

251
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,959
Whether you remember it or not, who cares?

252
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,279
Regardless...

253
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,479
you're my wife.

254
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,159
What wife?

255
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,239
To be married, the couple must love each other first.

256
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,999
Other than not loving you, I hate you!

257
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,079
Hate me all you want.

258
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,959
I have the marriage i certificate.

259
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,279
You're my wife

260
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,919
You need to go home with me

261
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,679
Whose home?!

262
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,279
My homer of course.

263
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,999
You're my wife.

264
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,919
I'm your husband.

265
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,919
If you don't go live at your husband's
house then where will you live?

266
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,639
Let's go.

267
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,999
Go change.

268
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,239
Or do you want me to change for you?

269
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,119
Miss.

270
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,359
I was just about to go give you your medicine.

271
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,599
Thank you so much.

272
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,319
Gosh look at them. They probably want to go home so bad.

273
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,239
That's what happens when you're newlyweds

274
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,319
His girlfriend was hospitalized so he brought the registrar here.

275
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,799
So romantic!

276
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,159
They make me jealous.

277
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,959
I'm jealous too, I want what they have.

278
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,799
Kids, do you miss your daddy?

279
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,279
-We do!
-Daddy doesn't miss me!

280
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,999
Oh!

281
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,159
Why not?

282
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,279
Because Daddy never called me

283
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,359
Aww you poor thing. I'll have to go scold him then.

284
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,959
-Go put it in the backyard
- Sure thing.

285
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,239
Noi, Taew.

286
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,839
What did you guys go do?

287
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,279
Khun Ran told us to go tidy his room and prepare things.

288
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,919
Prepare for who?

289
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,519
For Pim.

290
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,319
The guest room right?

291
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,759
You two are keeping this secret of letting that girl be the madam of this house?!

292
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,639
Regarding the sheep and the room she is sleeping in!

293
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,039
Girls Don't

294
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,759
-Daddy!
-What's up kids?

295
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,079
What are you guys playing?

296
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,359
P'Pim is here too!

297
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,079
Yay!

298
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,519
Are you going to live here?

299
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,159
If P'Pim lives here, I'll get to play with her every day right Daddy?

300
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,239
P'Pim.

301
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,999
Stay here please?

302
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,919
Saran.

303
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,599
Can I talk to you?

304
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,959
Sure.

305
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,159
Just the two of us

306
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,359
Jam.

307
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,999
Take Pim up to my room

308
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,679
Sure.

309
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,839
Come on kids. Let's go upstairs.

310
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,279
Please.

311
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,959
Do you see me as invincible here?

312
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,079
You do whatever you please

313
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,839
You marry whoever you want.

314
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,439
Do you even see my head? The gray head that is standing right here.

315
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,799
I know you're not happy

316
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,439
But I made my decision.

317
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,439
I'm asking you to understand.

318
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,279
Understand that you made the shepherd girl who doesn't come from a good family your wife?

319
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,159
You know where Pim came from.

320
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,159
Whose daughter and granddaughter she is.

321
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,599
She doesn't suit you.

322
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,599
Auntie.

323
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,119
Love isn't about suitability

324
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
It's about happiness.

325
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,159
It's about my own content who I want to be with.

326
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,799
What about Orn?

327
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,079
She's been pursuing you for years.
Why don't you want her?

328
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,079
If I wanted her, I would have a long time ago

329
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,919
I wouldn't let this goon for years.

330
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,759
Pim just woke up. I'm going to go check on her.

331
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,519
Oh Jam.

332
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,439
The kids fell asleep?

333
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,079
Yes. They fell asleep shortly after Khun Pim read them a book.

334
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,999
Feuang!

335
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,919
Did she die?

336
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,159
She's still breathing

337
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,959
But she won't open her eyes.

338
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,839
Is she dead?

339
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,239
P'Pim isn't dead!

340
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,679
Not yet. I'm not dead yet.

341
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,319
Hurry Mafeuang! Go tell Daddy P'Pim isn't dead yet!

342
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,319
Wait! Wait!

343
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,159
Where is your daddy anyway?

344
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,239
I'm going to take this tray up to Pim.

345
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,079
Can you put the rest on the table?

346
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,959
Sure.

347
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,119
Mom.

348
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,079
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

349
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,240
Yes.

350
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,800
Pim will definitely get Khun Ran as her husband!

351
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,079
How can you think that?

352
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,839
Pim just moved in here.

353
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,479
Hey!

354
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,479
I thought you were thinking the same Mom?

355
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,960
Khun Ran is being attentive towards Pim.

356
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,959
Pim is lucky.

357
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,678
That's what I'm saying Mom!

358
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,479
Pim is lucky which means you think Khun Ran will definitely make Pim his wife!

359
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,319
They signed the marriage certificate.

360
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,119
They signed it at the hospital.

361
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,279
What?!

362
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,279
Don't be so shocked

363
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,198
He's met the one.

364
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,280
-His wife?
-Yeah.

365
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,959
I've met the one too

366
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,079
You've met my foot!

367
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,359
You're being inappropriate!

368
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,119
I haven't given her to you yet.

369
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,839
You're taking good care of her.

370
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,839
I invited Orn over for lunch.

371
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,479
Why did you?

372
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,759
Nus isn't here.

373
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,639
So you can see

374
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,439
what is good for you.

375
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,999
But I've chosen already

376
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,159
You slept with her?

377
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,839
Auntie.

378
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,079
I respect you as a mother

379
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,279
because you've raised me but your question is too much.

380
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,079
Give her a stash of money.

381
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,079
No.

382
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,759
She was tricked and you had to make her your wife?

383
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,839
You make anyone your wife that you pity

384
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,959
Wouldn't you have a hundred wife by then?

385
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,439
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

386
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,919
I'm going to be honest.

387
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,999
I can't accept that girl.

388
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,359
I'm confident

389
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,359
that someday you will accept her.

390
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,479
Never!

391
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,319
Let me go kids.

392
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,159
I'll play with you some other time.

393
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,159
No!

394
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,159
Where are you going?

395
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,959
I'm going home.

396
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,159
But Daddy said you're going to live here.

397
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,639
Daddy said this is your home.

398
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,679
How can he say that?

399
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,279
He didn't even ask me.

400
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,799
-Daddy!
-Yes?

401
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,079
P'Pim is going home.

402
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,159
What a snitch.

403
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,159
Well?

404
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,439
You're leaving?

405
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,439
No.

406
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,759
She's lying.

407
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,759
Aren't you embarrassed?

408
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,319
I thought Daddy said lying is bad?

409
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,759
P'Pim is lying!

410
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,439
I came to get the kids.

411
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,999
Mafeuang, Mafai.

412
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,439
Go shower and brush your teeth so you can eat

413
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,799
What about P'Pim?

414
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,799
She'll catch up to you when she's done eating.

415
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,999
Come play with us soon!

416
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,639
Where are you going?

417
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,839
A place to stay.

418
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,999
There's no place for you to go.

419
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,319
You signed a marriage certificate.

420
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,319
You must live at your husband's house.

421
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,319
If you're going some place else,

422
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,679
it's equivalent to being someone's side chick.

423
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,279
I don't even know when I signed the certificate.

424
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,839
I don't even know if you're making it up or not.

425
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,519
Well, see for yourself.

426
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,599
I'll expose you with this marriage certificate.

427
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,999
That you have a husband already.

428
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,999
But you don't know when is enough so you go fooling around i someone else's house.

429
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,319
Are you crazy?!

430
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,919
Try me.

431
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,679
Go.

432
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,839
Go shower and get dressed so you can eat.

433
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,279
Once you're done, I'll take you to go buy clothes.

434
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,679
But before we go shopping,

435
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,759
I'll take you to the bank to do something first.

436
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,959
This is the title and power of attorney.

437
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,439
You two can go to the land and take care of it there.

438
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,239
Thank you.

439
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,319
As for the matter of freezing the credit card, the bank has already frozen it.

440
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,079
Thank you so much.

441
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,759
You're a little late.

442
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,439
I'll see to it if you and your brother will cheat off of me like this.

443
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,959
Khun Pim hasn't signed it yet.

444
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,599
But Vee got the money already.

445
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,639
Khun Pim was just here with Khun Saran.

446
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,799
They came to redeem the land so if you want the land, you need to go buy it from Khun Pim.

447
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,439
This is cheating!

448
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,799
The one that cheated you is Khun Ravee not Khun Saran.

449
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,519
What place is this?

450
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,959
Lada's office, Nus's friend

451
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,959
You brought me to buy clothes at your sister's friend's office?

452
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,999
Yes.

453
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,759
I want everyone to know that you're with me right now.

454
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,959
Why?

455
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,359
So the news can travel to your brother Vee.

456
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,919
You had to do this much just to get revenge on him?

457
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,599
Let's go inside.

458
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,959
This is pretty.

459
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,679
How many colors?

460
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,959
Two more colors.

461
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,519
Da.

462
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,079
P'Ran!

463
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,759
I need some clothes for Pim.

464
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,759
Get all the designs that you have

465
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,119
You're going to buy...

466
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,119
Pim clothes?

467
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,519
That's what happens when you're newlyweds.

468
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,079
One orders, the other person listens.

469
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,999
Whatever one wants, the other person gets.

470
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,839
You're good for being able to make the guy fall for you this hard

471
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,119
Newlyweds? What do you mean?

472
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,400
They signed the marriage certificate.

473
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,479
You guys signed the marriage certificate?

474
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,839
Yes.

475
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,439
Pim and I are officially married

476
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,639
Yes.

477
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,359
Orn.

478
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,439
Orn!

479
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,480
You look innocent

480
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,679
but you're actually a slut.

481
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,279
It's just...

482
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,679
the guy was interested in me.

483
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,239
I didn't have to do anything

484
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,799
Here,let me measure you Pim so I'll know what size you wear.

485
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,839
Orn, can I borrow Pim for one moment?

486
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,959
Come.

487
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,120
What did you say to Pim?

488
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,239
Oh I was telling her

489
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,359
congratulations for getting with a love and warming guy like you.

490
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,999
<i>If you can't get Pim back,</i>

491
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,319
<i>no one here will respect you.</i>

492
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,239
<i>Khun Ran!</i>

493
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:50,280
<i>♫ The reason we got to meet today ♫</i>

494
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:58,740
<i>♫ is because something happened and that is I love you ♫</i>

495
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:04,140
<i>♫ It can only be a dream, I can only think of you ♫</i>

496
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,680
<i>♫ Because I know that one day I will have to wake up ♫</i>

497
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:16,120
<i>♫ When I open my eyes, you might not be there that day ♫</i>
