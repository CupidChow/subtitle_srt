[Techno: You're just showing off your invitation.]

171
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,750
[Thorn: You like to brag, Tharn.]

172

[Champ: Don't worry about the food. I promise I'll arrange it for you properly.]

173

[Phugun: Cirrus and I will not miss it.]

174
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,470
Hey. Hey. Hey.

175
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,940
What's going on? What time did we agree to meet? What time is it now?

176
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,260
Please check the time.

177
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,820
Have a seat.

178
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,280
Sorry, we're late.

179
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,410
Did you start your honeymoon

180
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,860
before getting married, resulting in being late?

181
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,810
Champ, Champ, do you have half-cooked eggs in your restaurant?

182
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,020
-What do you want them for?
-Give them two boxes...

183
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,700
To replenish their energy. They have used too much energy.

184
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,890
No.

185
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,160
What's wrong, friend?

186
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,880
-I want to tell you...
-Say it.

187
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,100
Even if we don't get married,

188
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,110
we spend our honeymoon every day.

189
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,840
Spend our honeymoon every day...

190
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,620
-What are you saying?
-No, friend.

191
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,620
How is it?

192
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,690
You made fun of him and he tricked back.

193
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,320
Oh, Champ.

194
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,050
Are you laughing at me?

195
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,420
You're so good at making fun of me.

196
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,940
Are you my friend or not?

197
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,030
I don't want to be your friend if I can choose.

198
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,800
Bastard. What are you talking about?

199
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,720
-He's a jerk.
-He's only like this to you.

200
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,200
What?

201
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,460
By the way, so in terms of food,

202
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,820
you are going to let me prepare it, right?

203
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,550
Yes.

204
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,090
We trust you the most in food.

205
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,820
Of course, my restaurant is of good quality.

206
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,870
-It is my restaurant.
-Okay, I didn't behave myself. I'm sorry.

207
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,660
-I should be the one to say this.
-Yes.

208
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,530
Of course, in terms of food,

209
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,890
you can always leave it to me.

210
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,060
I may be a little clumsy in some aspects,

211
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,370
but I won't lose to anyone in food.

212
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,340
-I trust you.
-You can count on me.

213
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,200
OK. I want to eat it too. After you finish cooking it, give it to me to eat.

214
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,310
Mind your own business.

215
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,000
Bastard!

216
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,190
I couldn't believe I would see you guys like this today.

217
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,920
You two are so busy with the wedding.

218
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,830
Oh, so is it a small wedding?

219
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,880
Yes. We only invited friends and family members.

220
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,590
-I am your friend.
-Really?

221
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,200
Of course. We are so close.

222
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,390
Yes, I didn't help much.

223
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,870
Your friend was busy.

224
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,960
What's going on, Type?

225
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,390
I'm your friend.

226
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,310
I want to be the bridesmaid for this wedding.

227
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,070
I have prepared my clothes.

228
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,700
-Bridesmaid.
-Damn it.

229
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,960
I'm a groom too.

230
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,340
-Is this your hand or your foot?
-You deserve it.

231
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,060
Fine.

232
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,360
I have a favor to ask.

233
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,400
If you two adopt a child later,

234
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,980
don't let him see you hit my head like this.

235
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,120
I will be embarrassed.

236
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,380
-I'll definitely beat you.
-Beat me.

237
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,100
I'll get going, everyone.

238
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,060
Where are you going? Isn't this your restaurant?

239
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,150
You're late. Actually, I made an appointment with Doctor.

240
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,770
I'm leaving. I don't want him to wait long.

241
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,730
-Bye.
-Okay.

242
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,150
Good luck. Be happy.

243
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,020
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello, Doctor.

244
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,579
Doctor...

245
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,030
You always love to laugh at others.

246
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:17,990
No.

247
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,839
-What?
-So how are they?

248
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,589
I don't know. To be honest, I don't know anything.

249
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,970
You don't know?

250
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,310
You don't know anything?

251
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,620
But if you two often come here for food,

252
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,230
you'll see a handsome doctor

253
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,230
come to help place orders and sit at the cash register,

254
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,320
making a living together like a husband and wife.

255
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,620
You don't know anything.

256
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,460
-You don't know.
Was the sound in my heart too loud?

257
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,150
I know a little.

258
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,730
As long as he's happy...

259
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,570
Yes, as long as he's happy.

260
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,760
Are you going to see the wedding venue later?

261
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:08,790
Yes.

262
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,770
-Are you going too?
-No.

263
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,490
Look at the sun. The sun almost killed me.

264
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,320
-Then, why did you ask? 
-Can't I ask?

265
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,500
Well, take photos for me later.

266
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,130
OK?

267
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,860
-No.
-Why?

268
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,620
Let's go together.

269
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,510
No, it's hot.

270
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,050
I happen to have something to do later.

271
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,010
Take photos for me. Send them to the group chat. Bye.

272
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,720
Sorry, Champ, have you been waiting long?

273
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,740
No, I have just arrived for a while.

274
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,120
Actually, you don't have to rush here.

275
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,040
Look, you're sweating profusely.

276
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,260
Do I look that bad?

277
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,540
That's not what I meant.

278
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,040
You're already very cute.

279
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,360
Let's go.

280
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,450
We need to go shopping.

281
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,490
Yes.

282
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,810
Thank you for helping me try the dishes.

283
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,290
I want to do my best

284
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,600
for Tharn and Type's wedding.

285
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,470
It's okay. I'm willing to do it.

286
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,790
I want to eat candy.

287
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,990
Feed me.

288
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,960
Okay?

289
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,630
Why don't you eat it yourself?

290
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,540
Well...

291
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,490
I'm reading.

292
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,080
[Two weeks before the wedding]

293
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,950
Guys, is our wedding venue beautiful?

294
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,450
I think it's pretty.

295
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:09,040
Because this is the house where Type and I live after we get married.

296
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,530
We need to build this house.

297
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,890
Our bride got mad several times.

298
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,330
I'm a groom too.

299
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,420
Here he is.

300
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,380
Look, a groom is angry.

301
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,640
Tharn.

302
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,670
Can you stop talking to the camera and then talk to me?

303
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,690
Why? Are you jealous of the camera?

304
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,590
Yes, I'm jealous. Are you satisfied?

305
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,770
Okay.

306
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,240
It's going to rain.

307
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,350
We still need to see the furniture.

308
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,570
-I'm not going.
-Don't go.

309
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,650
What's wrong with you again?

310
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,140
I want to take a shower at home.

311
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,650
I want to say

312
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,130
I'm happy that we're getting married.

313
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,790
Yes, I know you're happy.

314
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,800
Then... Aren't you happy?

315
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,170
If I were not happy,

316
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,620
I wouldn't have come with you to deal with everything.

317
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,330
I...

318
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,500
I'm very happy.

319
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,820
Brother Tharn, you went to see your new house.

320
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,810
How is it?

321
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,890
It's so hot.

322
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,960
You went there at noon. How could it not be hot?

323
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,120
No wonder Brother Type jumped into the swimming pool as soon as he came back.

324
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,310
He's been wanting to swim for days.

325
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,390
What about you? Aren't you going out today?

326
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,910
Yes. But I'm going to try on clothes this evening.

327
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,350
Buy the best one.

328
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,540
Also, Type's dad, please...

329
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,130
The success of this wedding depends on you.

330
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:57,820
Got it?

331
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,170
Got it. I will definitely make the wedding go smoothly.

332
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,780
I'll make Type's dad laugh at the wedding.

333
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,660
Thank you.

334
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,600
It seems that someone has been captivated by the charm of the groom-to-be.

335
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,110
Oh.

336
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,980
I'm leaving.

337
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,400
Thanya, what are you doing?

338
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,590
Didn't you say you would go at four? I haven't changed clothes yet.

339
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,280
I want to eat desserts, Thorn.

340
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,940
You're already very handsome.

341
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,690
Shall we have desserts first

342
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,280
and then try on clothes?

343
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,090
But I'm almost done with my work.

344
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,460
Can you give me another 20 minutes?

345
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,790
No.

346
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,800
Do it when we get back.

347
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,650
Let's go now. We need to pick up our parents.

348
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,590
What about Tharn and Type?

349
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,230
Brother Thorn, why are you so talkative?

350
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,350
Let's go.

351
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,860
Okay. Okay. Okay.

352
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,380
What are you playing?

353
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,850
I'm hot.

354
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,030
Why are you touching my waist when you're hot?

355
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,550
Tharn.

356
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,770
The house is full of people.

357
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,970
What if

358
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,070
no one is home?

359
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,200
What do you mean?

360
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,660
I asked Thanya to arrange for it.

361
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:43,490
There are only the two of us at home now.

362
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,960
Come on, Type.

363
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,680
This is my answer.

364
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,140
-Let go of me!
-No!

365
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,380
I can't stand it anymore.

366
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,510
I won't say anything if you cry.

367
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,500
But you wake up at four in the morning to apply a mask

368
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,800
and dance at 5.

369
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,460
-I want to sleep. Do you hear me?
-Khlui!

370
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,240
What?

371
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,340
I usually practice at this time.

372
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,360
Don't kick me out.

373
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,120
I don't mind if you practice.

374
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,570
But you even sing.

375
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,410
You sing while eating and also when taking a shower.

376
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,690
I need to sell goods through live broadcasts. Do you hear me?

377
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,010
Why do you sing?

378
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,980
I won't sing anymore.

379
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,880
What are you doing?

380
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,430
I won't do it again.

381
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,970
You said the same thing last time.

382
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,690
I don't believe you anymore.

383
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,440
-Let me go!
-Khlui!

384
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,390
Khlui, I won't sing like this.

385
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,600
Khlui, I really won't sing.

386
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,600
Khlui!

387
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,760
I really won't sing.

388
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,390
I've liked him for a long time.

389
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,490
I planned to let him know it first when I would get back...

390
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,900
If I had made my debut this time...

391
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,410
But...

392
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,580
But as you can see...

393
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,000
I’m so sad.

394
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,000
It's okay, Seo Duang.

395
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,870
I think it has nothing to do with liking someone.

396
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,790
It's more about the manners of living together.

397
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,710
Right?

398
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,070
If you don't apply facial masks at 4 a.m., don't dance at 5,

399
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,760
and don't sing while eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom...

400
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,660
Brother Khlui won't kick you out.

401
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,650
It's okay, Seo Duang.

402
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,780
Even if you sing while bathing,

403
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,760
I won't be mad at you.

404
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,110
Actually, the room is empty during this period.

405
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,640
Are you going to stay here for now?

406
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,000
-Phugun.
-What?

407
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,380
No.

408
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,120
Seo Duang, you're here.

409
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,390
-Come here, my lucky star.
-What's wrong with you?

410
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,210
I won the lottery.

411
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,100
It was the lottery you asked me to buy.

412
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,460
And I won a lot.

413
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,020
I just realized that since you came back to live with me,

414
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,040
I have won several times.

415
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,550
So,

416
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,360
you must live with me.

417
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,910
Because I want to be rich.

418
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,960
-Do you think I'm a cash cow?
-Yes.

419
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,610
I'm going to get my roommate back.

420
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,150
Because I want him to pick numbers for me.

421
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,110
Please.

422
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,580
Let's go.

423
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,850
-Lucky star, let's go.
-Bye.

424
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,300
-Bye.
-Bye.

425
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,220
-Phu.
-What?

426
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,700
How did he get into our home?

427
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,370
Oh.

428
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,320
I think I forgot to close the door.

429
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,990
Phugun.

430
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,320
Again?

431
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,160
Yes. I forgot about it.

432
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,080
My sister asked you to apply it. Don't forget it.

433
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:58,820
Come on.

434
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,270
Can I not apply it?

435
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,950
She won't know if you don't tell her.

436
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,760
No.

437
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,580
Because you refused my mom's wedding package,

438
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,090
Thanya gave you this set.

439
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,960
If you don't use it,

440
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,000
she will hire a team to take care of you.

441
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,100
Do you want it?

442
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,620
Then do whatever you want to do.

443
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,710
It's not me.

444
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,650
It's Thanya.

445
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,550
She said we are old, you know...

446
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,830
We need to take care of ourselves.

447
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,490
How is it?

448
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,610
Done.

449
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,610
Hold on.

450
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,700
What are you going to do?

451
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,160
Hello, everyone.

452
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:07,400
We're preparing for the wedding now.

453
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,540
What are we preparing?

454
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,980
Look at my face.

455
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,199
We are getting your face ready.

456
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,389
Type.

457
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,000
Yes.

458
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:28,900
I...

459
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,449
On our wedding day,

460
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,370
I want to be the most handsome person in your eyes.

461
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,340
You too.

462
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,510
I also want you

463
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,600
to be the most handsome person in my eyes.

464
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,130
Why are you laughing?

465
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,760
Sorry.

466
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,420
You were suddenly so serious.

467
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,070
-I won't say it.
-Tharn.

468
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,170
What are you doing? You are not done yet.

469
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,120
This is good.

470
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,420
What?

471
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,570
I can kiss my handsome groom.

472
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,460
You...

473
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,900
[Thara and Tiwat]

474
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,330
Good morning, everyone.

475
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:15,410
Today is the day I've been looking forward to.

476
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,070
I'm finally getting married to Type.

477
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,960
To be honest,

478
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,660
now,

479
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,460
I'm nervous.

480
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,970
But my most important person is still sleeping.

481
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,370
Type.

482
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,350
Type.

483
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,870
Get up.

484
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,230
Type.

485
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,040
Groom.

486
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,530
Get up.

487
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,730
What are you doing?

488
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,520
Go take a shower,

489
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,300
or you'll be late.

490
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,350
Oh.

491
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,760
Aren't you going to take a shower?

492
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,120
Give me five minutes.

493
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,580
Okay.

494
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,000
Then get up.

495
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,140
You have got up.

496
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,200
Are you ready today?

497
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,200
Yes.

498
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:39,500
[Thara and Tiwat]

499
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,690
I don't know where you, rich men, come from,

500
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,600
but if that foreigner can't take care of my son well,

501
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,220
I will definitely not let him go.

502
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,570
Okay, I'll tell my son.

503
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,210
That's right.

504
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,470
Don't look down on me.

505
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,880
Look at me, I also love my son very much.

506
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,750
I took good care of him.

507
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,550
If he wants to find a life partner,

508
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,930
he has to find a good person and someone who can take care of him.

509
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,190
I'm confident that Tharn is a good person.

510
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,680
And he is ready to take care of Type.

511
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:54,110
-Best. He must be the best.
-Hello, uncle.

512
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,720
You're so handsome today.

513
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,140
You came at the right time.

514
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,960
I was just talking about your brother.

515
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,520
He's a good man. He's a perfect match for my son.

516
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,520
You know what...

517
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,340
People at the wedding said

518
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,980
they are a perfect match.

519
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,860
I agree.

520
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,340
Right? They look perfect together.

521
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,760
Yes, they are a perfect match. I agree.

522
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,170
I apologize on behalf of Type's father.

523
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,180
He's just like this. What he said is not true...

524
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,100
But he's actually very happy that

525
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,470
Tharn and Type are getting married.

526
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,180
-Really?
-Yes.

527
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,770
But he was so happy that he told his neighbors.

528
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,930
It's okay.

529
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,880
As long as you like my second son, we'll be happy.

530
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,260
But it might be a bit tiring. Because he's not someone to be trifled with.

531
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,560
This is good. Their lives can be colorful.

532
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,140
-Yes.
-Mom, I think their lives are too colorful.

533
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,150
Every time Tharn comes home,

534
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,400
he looks half-dead.

535
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:11,060
Thorn, how could you say that?

536
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,210
It's the truth. Say it.

537
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,760
The last time when Tharn came to our house, Type's father made fun of him.

538
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,280
Type's father almost threw Tharn into the sea last time.

539
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,590
-Really?
-Yes.

540
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,640
I have to hear it from you.

541
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,110
Type's dad likes to tease people,

542
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,160
but he loves his son very much.

543
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,110
When Son comes home, he spoils his son so much.

544
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,510
But Son didn't stay at home. He always went out with Tharn.

545
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,130
So he got angry and asked Tharn to eat chili.

546
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,560
-And he let Tharn do this and that.
-Really?

547
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,180
He's good at making fun of people.

548
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,440
How was Type when he went to your house?

549
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,360
What do you think, kid?

550
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,560
Very polite.

551
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,250
That's good.

552
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,180
Please take care of him.

553
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,240
-OK. No problem.
-No problem.

554
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,250
He talks all the time. Can you see that?

555
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,080
Hurry up, Mai. Go in and congratulate Type.

556
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,290
Puifai, we're already here.

557
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,860
You... Why are you so excited about

558
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,960
the wedding of someone you've loved before?

559
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:14,200
Because I've given up on Type.

560
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,040
Champ called and told me

561
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,770
that Type wants me to attend the wedding. I am very happy

562
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,970
I think I should go back.

563
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,430
Wait.

564
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,970
No way. We're already here.

565
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,450
Don't tell me that

566
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,170
you still have feelings for Champ, do you?

567
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,390
You are insane. Who's thinking about him?

568
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,010
No, I don't have feelings for Champ.

569
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,840
Who will miss someone as unreasonable as him?

570
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,760
-You're so evidently happy.
-I'm hungry.

571
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,470
Of course, I'm happy. At least Type will think of me.

572
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,720
He only remembers the beautiful feelings between us.

573
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,660
But just that, it turned into friendship.

574
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,600
Really?

575
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,150
Of course.

576
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,490
But the wedding scene is beautiful.

577
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,850
Hey, you're here. Let's go in.

578
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,230
How are you?

579
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,340
I'm fine. What about you?

580
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,640
Not bad.

581
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,720
I'm glad you're here. I'll introduce you to a friend.

582
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,640
Are you really friends?

583
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:25,760
Just kidding.

584
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,000
Yes, I'm pursuing him.

585
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,150
Let's go. I'll introduce you to him.

586
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,010
Are you okay?

587
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,080
Yes.

588
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,090
This wedding scene is really beautiful.

589
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,370
-Phu.
-Yes?

590
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,570
What?

591
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,180
I think he does not just pick numbers.

592
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,660
-What?
-Look.

593
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,880
Brother Seo Duang's three-colored dress.

594
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,710
-Phugun.
-What?

595
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:23,740
Don't laugh at him.

596
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,270
Finally.

597
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,390
Yes, finally.

598
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,440
Yes, finally.

599
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,190
You know what...

600
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,000
I was so looking forward to this wedding that my buttocks itched.

601
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,390
I think you should go and check

602
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,100
if you have tinea cruris or something.

603
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,420
You have tinea cruris, Doctor.

604
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,100
Doctor, long time no see.

605
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,130
Do you want me to wash you up?

606
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,250
If you hadn't come with your husband,

607
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,310
I would have beaten you to the ground.

608
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,710
No, what did you just say?

609
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,510
-Nothing, bro.
-What are you going to do?

610
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,680
I didn't do anything. I was just saying hi. I miss him.

611
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,880
You have sharp ears.

612
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,540
Anyway, today I'm also happy for both of them.

613
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:23,240
Really?

614
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:29,340
I think you should be happy.

615
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,460
When we came in,

616
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,820
girls were following Champ.

617
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,180
But he didn't even turn around to take a look.

618
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,590
Who are you referring to, No?

619
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:48,440
Can we release animals around here? I want to do good deeds.

620
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,000
Forget it.

621
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,620
But over there...

622
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,850
Poor Mai.

623
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,890
Her gaze at Champ is so disappointed.

624
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:08,350
Especially when your husband introduces his ex-girlfriend

625
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,970
to his current wife...

626
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:16,310
Oh, my. I can only say it's amazing.

627
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,760
If I had had a camera,

628
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,330
I would've filmed it as the behind-the-scenes video for Type.

629
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,460
I think it's good.

630
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,260
No, don’t talk nonsense.

631
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:29,380
I have nothing to do with Mai.

632
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:31,450
We’re just old friends.

633
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,590
Nonsense.

634
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:36,640
Really?

635
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,250
-Don't you have any relationship?
-Yes. Don't you have any relationship?

636
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,200
Yes.

637
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:49,150
Because I only have you in my eyes.

638
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:57,140
♫Can you only look at me?♫

639
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,430
-It's so sweet
-Today is finally coming.

640
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:17,570
Long time no see, my old friend.

641
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,760
Hello, Jeed, Khong.

642
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:25,510
I can't see you now. You don't even drink in my bar.

643
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,890
The economy isn't good these days and I don't have much money.

644
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,050
And I'm busy at work.

645
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,580
That's great. You have work to do.

646
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,440
I'll ask Tharn to treat me next time.

647
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,220
Let's keep the account first.

648
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,720
Oh. You're crying there.

649
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,790
Hey! Hey!

650
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,300
What's the matter?

651
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:50,460
Why is your husband crying?

652
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,440
Don't tell me...

653
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,350
Can your child climb now?

654
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,570
Or can he walk?

655
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,360
Or can your child call him Dad?

656
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,400
I understand.

657
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,710
Every time I enter Brother Khong's social media page...

658
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,460
Every photo, every movement, and every video...

659
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,420
You know... He cries every time.

660
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,930
Every time your child makes progress... He can climb, walk, and sit...

661
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,110
After changing his diapers... He cried again. Oh, my.

662
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,800
Let me ask you sincerely.

663
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,800
Do you want to change your husband? Since you have a husband who loves to cry so much...

664
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,510
-You're asking me seriously, right?
-Yes.

665
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:26,820
-I want a new husband.
-Hey!

666
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:27,900
You bastard, No!

667
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,630
Every time you appear, you destroy someone else's family.

668
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,860
-Yes, it's you.
-Look carefully.

669
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,490
I'm just happy for Tharn.

670
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,190
I've known Tharn since he was as big as a shell.

671
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,310
-What about now?
-The shell has grown to the size of the roof.

672
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:47,200
-Stop joking.
-Honey.

673
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,970
-I still have tissues.
-It's cheap. I won't use it.

674
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,900
-Oh, no.
-I've known him since his first year in high school.

675
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,980
Every time he broke up, he came to my bar to drink.

676
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:59,710
I didn’t expect him to get married today and have a husband.

677
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,450
Hey, Khong.

678
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:03,480
Take your hand away from my husband.

679
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:06,900
Let me ask you. Are you happy,

680
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,810
or are you resentful

681
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,500
because Tharn has been drinking free wine for so long?

682
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,030
How can you ask this? Of course, I hate him.

683
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,240
Honey, you're joking again.

684
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,490
I'm just touched.

685
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:22,990
So you've known Tharn for more than ten years? Right?

686
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:23,550
Yes.

687
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,030
He's my precious little brother.

688
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,590
You still call him "precious little brother".

689
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,270
Your precious little brother is getting married.

690
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,980
Does the most handsome Khong have any special gifts

691
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,810
for his precious little brother?

692
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,010
-I have one.
-What is it?

693
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,170
Think for me.

694
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:42,220
Now?

695
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,510
How about this?

696
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,960
Pretend to close the store for one day. Don't tell Jeed.

697
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,110
-My wife is right here. I will hit your head.
-She might have not heard me.

698
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,900
Pretend to close the store for one day, right?

699
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,990
And then invite us to drink at a post-wedding party.

700
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,380
Sure.

701
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,790
Tell me when you are going to come. I'll close the bar and treat you.

702
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,100
Okay.

703
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,110
Hey, you two.

704
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,850
-I have a baby now.
-Yes.

705
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,250
-Khong.
-Yes,honey.

706
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,570
We're different. We have a baby.

707
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,870
If you want to keep buying your brothers drinks for free,

708
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,350
we need to send the child to our mothers' house.

709
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,360
-Okay?
-We don't need to send.

710
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,850
We don't need to send. I won't treat them.

711
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,590
Let's welcome the husband and the wife to continue fighting.

712
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,380
It has nothing to do with the kid next door.

713
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,220
Oh, Tharn, my bro!

714
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,600
It seems that Tharn wants me to get changed.

715
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,180
Good luck. I have a medical kit.

716
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,440
I'm leaving. Bye.

717
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,910
Don't come to our bar again.

718
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:37,590
-I love you, honey.
-Really?

719
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,210
Yes.

720
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:39,900
I'm happy for my brother.

721
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,240
Yes. It's a good day.

722
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,850
Come on. Let me help you.

723
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:04,920
Are you ready?

724
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,540
I'm so nervous, Type.

725
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:14,830
Me too.

726
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,330
My heart is about to jump out.

727
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,470
Are you satisfied?

728
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,370
This is not enough.

729
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,850
♫When I woke up and opened my eyes this morning♫

730

♫Woke me up as it used to♫

735

Don't smirk.

♫You're still in your slumber♫

You have to make up for your mistake.

Yes.

756
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,080
What do you want?

757
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,160

993
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:38,990
Type first.

994
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:39,680
I don't know how to sing.

995
01:15:56,990 --> 01:16:00,110
Hello, I'm Thara Khirikun.

996
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,290
I'm getting married.

997
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:04,440
I'm so nervous.

998
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:09,000
Actually, I don't know how to start.

999
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,220
I'm very happy now.

1000
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:14,320
I just want to record our story.

1001
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:16,420
What are you filming?

1002
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,990
Oh.

1003
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,300
Everyone.

1004
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:22,300
This...

1005
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,090
What?

1006
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:23,830
Don't go.

1007
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:26,270
This is my life partner.

1008
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:28,070
What's wrong with you?

1009
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,230
Stop.

1010
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:31,560
Stop.

1011
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:40,490
Why are you laughing?

1012
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:42,910
Stop.

1013
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,030
Stop.

1014
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:50,240
Wipe it for Type.

1015
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,970
Wipe it for Type. There are water beads.

1016
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:54,250
This way.

1017
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,120
Okay. Okay.

1018
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:56,770
Let's eat.

1019
01:16:57,470 --> 01:16:58,330
All right.

1020
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:59,830
I'm full. It is my treat.

1021
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:01,880
But put it on Champ's bill.

1022
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,250
Bye.

1023
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,660
I will go shopping.

1024
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:07,720
Stop.

1025
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,730
Stop.

1026
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:09,580
What?

1027
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:11,600
What is he acting?

1028
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,730
Stop.

1029
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,090
[No need to say.]

1030
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,560
Stop.

1031
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:07,930
There's salt water.

1032
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,020
Thanya.

1033
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:11,120
I don't know how the place is.

1034
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,240
Oh.

1035
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,790
Stop.

1036
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:17,590
Stop.

1037
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:33,080
I love you.

1038
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:35,990
I love you, Type.

1039
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,810
Let's be together forever.

1040
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,750
Stop.

1041
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:45,770
Okay.

1042
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:48,740
Action.

1043
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,590
One, two, three.

1044
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,950
[The end]
