19
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,900
Ai Qing.

20
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
Oh, no…

21
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,620
Come on,

22
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,900
don’t propose to me for now.

23
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,500
My God. I just put on

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,340
a casual dress.

25
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,620
I didn’t have a shower
after I got out of the stadium.

26
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,500
I beg you do not
propose to me for now.

27
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,820
Please don’t.

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,580
Han Shangyan proposed to me.

29
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,780
Proposed?

30
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,740
But I wasn’t prepared,

31
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,420
so I turned him down.

32
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,220
Would he…?

33
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,780
No.

34
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,820
To propose right after the competition
is a really bad idea.

35
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,420
I should be more prepared.

36
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,460
I…

37
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,540
What is it?

38
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,700
I… I was starving.

39
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,060
One bowl is not enough.

40
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,860
Can I have another bowl?

41
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,940
You want more?

42
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,820
Sir, another bowl of Shrimp Noodles.

43
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,540
Thanks.

44
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,060
Sure. One second.

45
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,980
Eat.

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,580
You, too.

47
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,420
Han just called me.

48
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,740
He praised our performance

49
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,260
this time.

50
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,140
That’s not his style.

51
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,020
Come on, he can have

52
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,540
a little human touch sometimes.

53
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,700
I’m here to deliver a decision
from the headquarters.

54
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,820
Our players haven’t
gone back home for long

55
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,340
due to the closed training.

56
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,300
So, they decided to

57
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,020
give us a three-day holiday

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,020
to go back home

59
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,420
and take a break.

60
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,620
That’s reasonable.

61
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,340
Okay. I’ll go inform them.

62
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,580
During the following holiday,

63
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,020
enjoy your date.

64
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,740
Ai Qing has been your girlfriend so long

65
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,580
but never dated you without scruple.

66
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,580
I said this for your own good.

67
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,980
Have yourself fully relaxed.

68
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,940
Only then can you be fully devoted

69
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,220
to preparing for the World Championships
after the holiday.

70
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,260
All right. That’s all.

71
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,540
I have faith in you.

72
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,900
Wu Bai.

73
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,340
Boss just told all of us

74
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,220
to stop all our work

75
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,700
and to go on a date with girlfriend,

76
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,740
or to go on a blind date.

77
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,820
What’s going on?

78
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,380
Did he suffer from anything?

79
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,220
Probably.

80
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,900
People like him who are happy in love

81
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,580
just want people around them
to be in love as well.

82
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,700
What was I going to tell you?

83
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,460
My mom was out of hospital.

84
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,180
I’m going back home with Ai Jing.

85
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,100
For the next three days,

86
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,580
Ai Qing’s apartment is yours.

87
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,220
Why are you not excited?

88
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,300
About what?

89
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,180
I mean that

90
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,220
you can stay at Ai Qing’s place
for three days.

91
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,940
Understand?

92
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,460
Seize the chance.

93
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,580
Come on.

94
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,100
Bai.

95
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,020
How long have you been waiting here?

96
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,540
Half an hour.

97
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,620
Why didn’t you let me know earlier?

98
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,580
Waiting is fine.

99
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,900
Not a bit.

100
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,700
The sun beats down
and the temperature is high.

101
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,260
Let’s get on the car.

102
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,980
Let’s go.

103
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,340
Go home?

104
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,580
My team

105
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,100
will have three days off.

106
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,860
Mine will have two.

107
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,580
So…

108
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,740
So, you can finally

109
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,300
have a good rest.

110
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,940
The games are tiring.

111
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,580
Aren’t we setting off?

112
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,140
Your sister and Shen Zhe

113
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,300
are going on a trip.

114
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,660
Really?

115
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,860
I had no idea.

116
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,620
She didn’t tell me.

117
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,100
Good, since she left,

118
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,060
I can finally

119
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,180
enjoy a peaceful time alone.

120
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,060
Let’s go home.

121
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,180
Come on in.

122
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,380
I’ll get you some water.

123
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:08,940
Okay.

124
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,980
I heard you and Wu Bai
will live together for three days.

125
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,860
Enjoy your time.

126
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,940
You…

127
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,580
You want to live with me?

128
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,540
Your sister… She must have got it wrong.

129
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,860
So…

130
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,980
Did it ever come to your mind?

131
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,020
Be honest with me.

132
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,380
I want to…

133
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,980
I want to discuss tactics with you.

134
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,900
We are off work.

135
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,140
Why should we discuss tactics?

136
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,020
So…

137
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,340
Have you brought a change of clothes?

138
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,220
A change of clothes.

139
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,100
If you’re going to stay here
for three days,

140
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,380
you can’t wear the same clothes
all the time, can you?

141
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,620
I have new toothbrushes and towels here,

142
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,700
but not any men’s wear.

143
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,180
Really, you didn’t bring any?

144
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,820
Then if you didn’t,

145
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,380
you can just go back…

146
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,100
They’re on my car. I’ll go get them.

147
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,780
She’s drying her hair.

148
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,820
Bai.

149
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,140
I’m done with the shower.

150
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,620
You may go in now.

151
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,740
All right.

152
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,940
Wait.

153
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,260
You don’t need to change your clothes?

154
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,340
I forgot them.

155
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,700
Wait. I’ll get them for you.

156
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,260
So…

157
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,060
I’m going in.

158
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,860
Go ahead.

159
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,260
Ai Qing.

160
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,140
What’s wrong?

161
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,980
Give me about ten minutes.

162
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,620
No need to hurry.

163
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,580
Take your time.

164
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,620
Gotta go.

165
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,380
Okay.

166
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,900
Look at this game.

167
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Why can’t I

168
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,060
get past this level?

169
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,300
I’m so pissed off.

170
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,180
Hello?

171
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,300
Ai Jing.

172
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,940
You know, the game Jellipop Match.

173
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,460
There’s a level
that I just can’t get past.

174
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,900
Tell me how to get past it,

175
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,700
or my neighbor, Li,

176
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,340
will be too much ahead of me.

177
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,100
I’m busy now.

178
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,220
Turn to Wu Bai and Ai Qing.

179
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,540
They are tactic masters

180
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,060
and have time to help you.
They are on holiday.

181
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,380
On holiday?

182
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,980
So, what’re their plans for the holiday?

183
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,180
(Ai Jing)
What plans could they have

184
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,740
(Ai Jing)
other than staying at home?

185
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,420
Staying at home?

186
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,420
No, no!

187
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,340
I made a slip of the tongue…

188
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,700
I made a mistake, Dad.

189
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,980
Staying at… At their own homes.

190
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,180
Yeah, their own homes.

191
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,860
Ai Jing, I found that

192
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,500
you both have become disobedient.

193
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,100
I’ll call her right now!

194
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,420
Please don’t, Dad.

195
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,540
I really made a mistake.

196
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,980
They are not staying together.

197
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,620
And you, Ai Jing,

198
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,860
you should be open

199
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
with me.

200
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,820
I’m telling you,

201
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,740
don’t sleep in the same room
with Shen Zhe.

202
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,260
Get back as soon as possible.

203
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
Fine. I got it, Dad.

204
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,900
I’ll play with you when I get back.

205
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,300
What a mess.

206
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,300
What are you doing?

207
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,980
I’m putting the sheet for you.

208
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,740
You took the bath so fast?

209
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,820
All right, Bai,

210
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,220
tonight,

211
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,500
just sleep on this bed of mine.

212
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,980
What about you?

213
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,180
Me?

214
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,420
I… I’ll sleep on my sister’s bed.

215
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,340
Actually…

216
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,100
We can both sleep here.

217
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,060
Someone is knocking at the door.

218
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,540
I’ll go have a check.

219
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,620
Coming!

220
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
Coming.

221
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,380
Dad?

222
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,980
Mr. Ai.

223
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,500
Wu Bai is also here.

224
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,140
Dad, why did you suddenly come here

225
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,180
without notice?

226
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,300
What do you mean?

227
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,860
You don’t want me here?

228
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,420
That’s not what I mean.

229
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,380
Get me some water.

230
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,500
Come on in.

231
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,620
I’m exhausted.

232
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,660
I’m exhausted.

233
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:20,980
Bai.

234
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,300
This isn’t the first time
we’ve met here.

235
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,980
Don’t be so restraint.

236
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,060
Come here, sit.

237
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,940
Sit.

238
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,500
You’re here to play?

239
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,700
And have taken a bath?

240
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,260
It’s so hot today, Dad.

241
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,420
So, I allowed him to take a cool bath.

242
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,860
By the way,

243
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,260
the water heater at my place is broken

244
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,820
and I can’t take a bath there.

245
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,940
I have to stay here for a few days.

246
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,540
Didn’t you fix it the other day?

247
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,540
It’s broken again.

248
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,500
Again…

249
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
But, Dad...

250
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,860
Bai…

251
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,420
What? Bai,

252
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,860
is your water heater also broken?

253
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,860
Mr. Ai.

254
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,060
It’s pretty late.

255
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,300
I’d better go home.

256
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,820
No, no, no, no rush.

257
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,380
Sit, sit.

258
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,220
Let me ask you something.

259
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,380
You

260
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,980
have dated my daughter for some time.

261
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,740
Do you have any plans next?

262
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,060
Do you just want a relationship,

263
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,540
or do you want

264
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,980
a marriage?

265
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,180
A marriage.

266
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,420
I want to marry her.

267
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,900
Don’t kick him.

268
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,100
Bai.

269
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,420
Ask your grandfather

270
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,380
if it’s convenient to meet me formally.

271
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,620
Mr. Ai, you mean…?

272
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,980
Your grandfather

273
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,980
is my elder.

274
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,100
I want you

275
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,380
to set up a time

276
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,180
for me to visit him.

277
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,380
Dad.

278
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,820
Why do you want to
visit his grandfather all of a sudden?

279
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,940
As the young lovers’ elders,

280
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,780
we should meet formally.

281
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,420
But isn’t it too early

282
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,940
for that?

283
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,660
The two of you
are going to live together.

284
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,420
How can you call it early?

285
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,500
Who told you
we are going to live together?

286
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
We are not.

287
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,180
All right. Bai,

288
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,940
set a time for us.

289
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,660
Either Saturday or Sunday is fine.

290
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,860
Okay.

291
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,420
I’ll ask my grandfather

292
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,980
and reply to you as soon as possible.

293
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,620
I like you being forthright, kid.

294
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,380
Alright then.

295
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,620
It’s late.

296
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,620
And you live far from here.

297
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,900
So, I won’t keep you longer.

298
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,260
Drive safe on your way back home.

299
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,380
Okay.

300
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,500
So, Mr. Ai,

301
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,580
I’ll leave then.

302
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,060
Dad, I’ll walk him out.

303
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,140
Okay.

304
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,300
Bai.

305
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,860
Are you really going to
talk with your grandfather?

306
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,540
Since your dad has requested,

307
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,300
I should tell my grandfather about it.

308
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,300
But…

309
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,540
Isn’t it too early?

310
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,500
No. It’s just a meeting.

311
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,780
All right.

312
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,580
That was a rare chance,

313
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,900
but was ruined by a water heater.

314
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,620
It’s not the water heater at all.

315
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,540
It’s my sister.

316
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,140
She texted me that

317
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,340
she slipped it out.

318
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,020
I’ll call her boyfriend right now

319
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,620
to get him back for the training.

320
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,060
Aren’t you childish?

321
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,300
All right. It’s late.

322
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,380
You gotta go back.

323
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,380
Drive safe

324
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,980
on your way back.

325
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,460
I’ll go back then.

326
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,700
Bye-bye.

327
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Bye-bye.

328
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,740
All right. Bye-bye.

329
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,020
Did you forget something?

330
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,380
What is it?

331
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,940
I gotta go.

332
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,940
Bye-bye.

333
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,340
Bye-bye.

334
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,780
Be careful on the road.

335
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,220
Let me know when you get home.

336
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,100
Bye.

337
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Grandpa.

338
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,620
Grandpa.

339
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,140
You’re here. Come here.

340
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,260
Sit.

341
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,900
Come on.

342
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,420
What… What is it?

343
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,100
Is it about your cousin again?

344
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,300
No.

345
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,260
Did he break up with Nian?

346
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,020
No.

347
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,540
Then tell me.

348
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,940
Your grandpa has a fragile heart.

349
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,900
You know, he is

350
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,220
not young but still unmarried.

351
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,020
It’s not easy for him
to finally have a girlfriend.

352
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,620
I’m expecting day and night

353
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,460
that he can get married.

354
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,740
Grandpa.

355
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,740
It’s about me.

356
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,260
I have a girlfriend now.

357
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,420
You and Ai Qing are together?

358
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,020
Great, great!

359
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,940
Well, grandpa,

360
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,460
are you free this weekend?

361
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,740
Either Saturday or Sunday is fine.

362
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,900
Her dad wants to visit you.

363
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,180
Visiting me?

364
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,580
But I’m the bridegroom’s side.

365
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,180
I should host him.

366
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,060
All right, that’s not the point.

367
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,220
I’m free the whole weekend.

368
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,340
It depends on your future father-in-law.

369
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,220
Whenever it’s convenient for him.

370
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,180
Okay.

371
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,060
What are you waiting for?

372
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,220
Make the call.

373
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,020
Oh, right.

374
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,580
Good morning, Bai.

375
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,540
Morning.

376
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,260
About what your dad mentioned yesterday,

377
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,300
I’ve told my grandpa.

378
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,140
He’s free the whole weekend.

379
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,780
It depends on
when it’s convenient for you two.

380
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,100
You are so efficient.

381
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,340
Then…

382
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,500
How about Sunday?

383
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,740
And

384
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,700
whose place shall we go to?

385
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,780
My grandpa thinks
we should meet at your place.

386
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,100
No.

387
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,740
Grandpa is the elder.

388
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,180
That would be impolite of us.

389
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,060
How about this?

390
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,300
Let’s not make it too formal.

391
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,060
Let’s meet outside.

392
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,500
I’ll book a restaurant.

393
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,260
Okay.

394
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,980
Wait for my message then.

395
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,620
Bye-bye.

396
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,700
Bye-bye.

397
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,540
You’ve really grown up.

398
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,940
Much more reliable than your cousin.

399
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,260
Wait.

400
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,740
I should pick out the clothes to wear.

401
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:12,980
Oh right,

402
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,300
make the call and book the restaurant.

403
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,260
Come on. Hurry.

404
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,340
How do your noodles taste?

405
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,220
Everything tastes good
when people get hungry.

406
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,180
What’s your plan for tomorrow’s meeting?

407
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,300
What’s there to plan?

408
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,140
Dad’s really headstrong.

409
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,060
And he came up with the idea
out of nowhere.

410
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,500
I think it’s a good idea.

411
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,060
The sooner to meet, the better.

412
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,980
And this meeting means

413
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,860
the relationship between you two

414
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,820
has made progress.

415
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,420
Are you nervous?

416
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,340
How can I not be?

417
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,620
But you don’t look like that.

418
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,940
Look how much you’re enjoying the food.

419
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,380
Eating can help me relax

420
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,060
and ease my nervousness.

421
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,460
You can’t understand my feelings.

422
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,740
Meeting boyfriend’s family

423
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,900
is no big deal.

424
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,300
Listen.

425
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,500
Say hello to his family warmly
when meeting them.

426
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,220
Then, the key is

427
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,300
to speak less and smile more.

428
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,260
I’ll show you. Look.

429
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,420
Yes, yes, just like this.

430
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,380
What’s more,

431
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,620
you need to be observant.

432
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,500
If his mom gets thirsty,

433
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
get water for her.

434
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
If his dad wants to eat some fruit,

435
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,940
get fruit for him.

436
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,580
When they’re leaving,

437
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,020
make sure not to turn around and leave

438
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,460
before they get on the car.

439
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,500
Get it?

440
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,260
Sister.

441
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,660
You’ve seen his family?

442
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,500
No. Not yet.

443
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,980
Then why are you messing up

444
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,060
by saying all that?

445
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,100
Eat you noodles.

446
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,420
Just do as I told you.

447
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,780
One more thing.

448
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,620
Dressing is important.

449
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,140
I’ll help you pick out the clothes.

450
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,740
Bai. You called right on time.

451
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,900
I need your advice here.

452
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,860
What do you say
if I wear this dress tomorrow?

453
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,460
Then, to match with you better,

454
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,860
should I wear a suit tomorrow?

455
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,220
I was about to ask
whether you feel nervous,

456
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,180
but now it seems there’s no need.

457
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,180
To be honest,

458
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,900
I get nervous
just by thinking of tomorrow.

459
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,900
I was watching

460
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,580
match videos to divert attention.

461
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,260
No need to worry.

462
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,900
Grandpa is very fond of you.

463
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,780
And no need to be meticulous
about your clothes.

464
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,020
Just dress comfortably.

465
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,900
You, too.

466
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,860
Don’t go out this late to buy a suit.

467
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,180
Then,

468
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,060
see you tomorrow.

469
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,780
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

470
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,460
Bye-bye.

471
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,100
Bai, be quick.

472
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,340
The bridegroom’s side
should arrive first

473
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,540
for politeness.

474
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,700
Coming.

475
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,660
What do you think?

476
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,420
Do I look good?

477
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,340
Pretty good.

478
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,940
Dad, why are you wearing a suit?

479
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,100
A suit is more formal

480
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,140
when meeting
my future son-in-law’s grandpa.

481
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,580
But you’ve seen him before.

482
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,940
This time is different.

483
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,660
This time is formal.

484
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,980
Dear, you’d better hurry.

485
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,340
Time is running out.

486
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,940
Okay, Dad, I got it.

487
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,260
I’ll go groom myself more.

488
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,540
Just ignore me.

489
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,260
Sister, I need your advice.

490
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,340
I really don’t know which one to choose.

491
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,940
How about this one?

492
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,220
Its brand is one of my favorites.

493
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,180
Their clothes look better when dressing.

494
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,500
I’m sure the elders
will like you wearing it.

495
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,140
Let’s see.

496
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,460
This one?

497
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,700
Pretty indeed.

498
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,340
I’ll go try it.

499
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,940
Bai.

500
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,820
Your grandpa

501
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,100
is extremely happy today.

502
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,980
Mr. Han.

503
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,420
Hello, grandpa.

504
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,500
Hello, hello.

505
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,620
Take a seat beside me.

506
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,980
Sure.

507
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,860
Please sit, Mr. Han.

508
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,260
At first,

509
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,660
I wanted to pay you a visit,

510
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,780
but Ai Qing stopped me.

511
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,180
At first, I wanted

512
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,020
to pay you a visit

513
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,300
on behalf of Bai’s parents,

514
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,980
but he also stopped me.

515
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,460
You know these kids.

516
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,060
By the way, sorry, grandpa,

517
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,220
there was a jam on our way here.

518
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,500
That’s why we arrived a little late.

519
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,860
I checked the road conditions.

520
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,140
Their way here has a severe traffic jam.

521
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,820
Yeah.

522
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,820
Mr. Ai,

523
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,460
do you know how long they’ve been dating?

524
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
I didn’t know that until recently.

525
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,940
It’s been a while, I guess.

526
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,420
Bai,

527
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,740
how long have you been dating?

528
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,780
Since the competition in Chicago

529
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,300
was over.

530
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,740
That’s been a long time.

531
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,660
Mr. Ai,

532
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,100
will you think it’s too early
if we talk about their marriage now?

533
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,500
What’s wrong?

534
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,820
Nothing. Nothing.

535
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
Nothing, grandpa.

536
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,740
I just choked when drinking water.

537
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,580
Mr. Han,

538
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,660
before we talk about the marriage,

539
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,820
am I supposed to meet

540
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,500
Bai’s parents first?

541
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,140
Bai.

542
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,940
Come on, interrupt your grandpa.

543
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,860
Don’t worry. Grandpa is just joking.

544
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,940
Bai grew up under my guardianship.

545
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,900
I have the final say.

546
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,580
You know, Mr. Han,

547
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,740
my daughter is older than your grandson.

548
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,380
So, what do you think of that?

549
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,740
As the saying goes,

550
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,220
an older wife just brings more fortune.

551
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,820
Good.

552
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,220
So,

553
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,420
what do you think of their marriage?

554
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,460
As long as my daughter is happy,

555
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,020
I’ll give my full support.

556
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,740
They are talking serious stuff!

557
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,620
Mr. Ai, please drink some tea.

558
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,300
Let me fill your cup.

559
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,660
Thank you. Good.

560
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,060
Grandpa, you too.

561
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,300
Let’s start eating, shall we?

562
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,780
Sure.

563
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,620
Let’s eat.

564
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,300
You acted on purpose, didn’t you?

565
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,940
No. Grandpa is just…

566
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,180
Why didn’t you interrupt him?

567
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,060
-You go first.
-Sure.

568
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,460
Thanks, thanks.

569
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,700
Let’s dig in.

570
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,540
By the way,

571
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,420
I suggest that

572
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,060
we make arrangements for their marriage
as soon as possible.

573
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,180
Personally, I want to have

574
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,460
a great-grandchild as soon as possible.

575
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,180
Mr. Han,

576
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,660
you’re thinking too far ahead.

577
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,220
No, not far ahead at all.

578
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,580
Even in my dreams,

579
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,300
I long for seeing
a family of four generations.

580
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,140
So, let’s speed up

581
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,580
the process of
preparing for the marriage,

582
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,060
such as the betrothal gifts,

583
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,300
the customs from your hometown,

584
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,420
and so on.

585
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,940
No, no need for them all.

586
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,060
No betrothal gifts are needed.

587
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,180
It’s modern society now.

588
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,700
No need for those things.

589
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,980
How come?

590
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,220
Those things are essential for a bride.

591
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,260
Bai has prepared them all.

592
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,100
Such as the golden bracelet,
the golden necklace…

593
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,660
Oh, right. Bai.

594
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,060
You’ve prepared the gifts, right?

595
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,740
I haven’t bought the golden jewelry yet.

596
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,220
Look at you!

597
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,780
Why are you like your cousin now?

598
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,700
You both let me worry.

599
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,460
In the future,

600
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,780
don’t be thrifty on necessary things.

601
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,100
Okay, I got it.

602
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,180
Mr. Han,

603
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,700
Bai is generous and thoughtful enough.

604
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,900
He brought me many gifts
when he first visited me.

605
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,300
He’s been too polite.

606
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,460
That’s necessary.

607
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,940
He even talked about great-grandchild.

608
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,420
I…

609
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,580
But he’s happy.

610
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,820
Grandpa. Your cup is empty.

611
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,420
Let me fill it with water.

612
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,540
Sure.

613
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,540
By the way,

614
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,100
about the postnatal care center…

615
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,580
Well…

616
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,100
What is it?

617
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,180
Bai, are you all right?

618
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,100
Are you all right?

619
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,460
I’m fine.

620
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,420
Grandpa, Dad,

621
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,220
I’m taking Bai out to clean up.

622
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,060
Go on eating

623
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,860
-and chatting.
-Go on eating.

624
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,780
Well,

625
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,060
do you want their child to be a boy

626
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,020
or a girl?

627
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,100
I prefer a boy.

628
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,300
I prefer a girl.

629
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,660
Then let them have both.

630
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,220
Yeah!

631
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,780
In Chinese,
a boy plus a girl have good meaning.

632
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,420
-Good.
-Good.

633
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,020
Come on, cheers.

634
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,500
Cheers.

635
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,300
Let me ask you.

636
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,020
What did you tell grandfather?

637
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,060
Why did he

638
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,220
suddenly bring up marriage?

639
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,780
And children?

640
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,940
Besides,

641
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,580
I was trying to remind you

642
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,540
to interrupt grandfather,

643
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,660
but why were you ignoring me?

644
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,540
I told him nothing particular.

645
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,420
But grandpa always hopes that

646
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,340
both my cousin and I
can get married earlier.

647
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,300
Well, your cousin is older than you,

648
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,460
it’s not surprising
if he gets married earlier.

649
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,020
But…

650
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,420
We don’t need to get married
that early, right?

651
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,300
You…

652
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,580
You really want to
get married that early?

653
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,100
You don’t want to?

654
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,940
It’s not that I don’t want to.

655
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,700
It’s just that
they suddenly bring it up.

656
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,420
I’m not ready yet.

657
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,860
Then I will wait

658
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,180
till you are ready.

659
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,420
Let’s go back.

660
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,900
Grandpa, have some beef.

661
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,340
Okay.

662
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,340
The beef tastes good.

663
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,540
Yeah.

664
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:33,980
Eat some.

665
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,580
Thanks.

666
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,620
Mr. Ai,

667
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,060
the girlfriend of
the other grandson of mine

668
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,260
also lives in Shanghai.

669
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,540
So, I’m thinking,

670
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,220
why not hold one wedding

671
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,300
for two couples?

672
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,060
How is it?

673
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,300
You agree, right?

674
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,540
Yeah, I agree, grandpa.

675
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,180
Yeah, it’s a good suggestion.

676
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,420
Mr. Han, I like your suggestion.

677
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,740
Later, let us three families
sit together

678
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,180
and discuss the details.

679
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,460
Yes. Good.

680
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,660
One wedding for two couples?

681
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,860
They wish so.

682
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,060
But how to achieve it?

683
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,700
Do you have any plans after eating?

684
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,180
I don’t.

685
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,460
Well then,

686
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,660
go play mahjong with me.

687
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,820
Leave some space

688
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,020
to the young people.

689
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,780
Sure.

690
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,780
So, you kids

691
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,340
have a nice talk.

692
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,340
Eat.

693
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,700
Eat, grandpa.

694
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,860
Here. Have some fruit.

695
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,460
Okay.

696
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,020
What do you think of

697
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,580
grandpa’s suggestion?

698
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,980
What suggestion?

699
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,180
To hold the wedding
together with Han Shangyan.

700
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,540
But before that,

701
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,580
there’re still some steps missing.

702
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,340
What steps?

703
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,660
Such as…

704
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,220
Such as making a proposal,

705
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,380
getting marriage certificates, etc.

706
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,140
I don’t mean that

707
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,860
I want you to make a proposal right now.

708
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,380
And I don’t mean

709
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,060
we should get the marriage certificates
right now.

710
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,820
I just mean you…

711
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,260
You… Well…

712
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,020
I just can’t make it clear.

713
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,900
Just by thinking about this,

714
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,860
I begin to have a headache.

715
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,820
I can’t make it clear.

716
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,620
Headache?

717
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,980
Lie down.

718
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,140
Let me massage your temples.

719
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,300
I’m feeling quite comfortable.

720
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,540
Enjoying your massage,

721
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,620
I seem to have all my troubles gone.

722
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,340
Who is it?

723
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,380
It’s a neighbor.

724
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,420
He would walk his dog at this time.

725
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,460
Will your dad suddenly…?

726
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,700
He already said that

727
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,620
he wouldn’t be back.

728
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,780
Who’s the one that felt so excited
when they were

729
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,380
talking about the marriage?

730
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,900
Why has he become so timid now?

731
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,420
I’m timid?

732
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,860
Bai, what’s wrong?

733
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,420
Is it your eyes?

734
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,780
Maybe I had a sudden drop

735
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,140
in blood pressure…

736
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,940
Is your eye disease coming back?

737
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,780
Not likely.

738
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,340
When I had my eyes examined,

739
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,700
the doctor told me

740
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,180
that there’s no big problem.

741
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,100
No. We have to go to the hospital

742
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,380
and have a thorough examination.

743
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,900
Press your chin against it.

744
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,380
Good.

745
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,380
Not a big problem.

746
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,700
I’ll give you a prescription.

747
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,580
But doctor,

748
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,380
he has a history of fundus varices.

749
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,020
Is the intraocular pressure
check enough?

750
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,820
How about a thorough examination?

751
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,420
Since you have concerns,

752
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,660
have a thorough examination then.

753
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,500
Pay in the hall first.

754
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,700
Then make reservations
for each examination.

755
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,580
After having all the examinations,

756
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
bring me the reports.

757
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,140
Okay. Thanks, doctor.

758
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,860
I’ll go pay downstairs.
Wait for me here.

759
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,740
(Shanghai Huimin Hospital)

760
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,940
The patient has a medical history,

761
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,300
but according to the reports,

762
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,420
he’s just having
a slight high intraocular pressure

763
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,580
due to eye overuse.

764
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,420
What a relief.

765
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,580
Rest assured.

766
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,500
Your boyfriend’s eyes

767
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,900
have no big problem.

768
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,500
For safety,

769
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,980
I’ll give you a sick leave certificate

770
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,700
for him to rest for three days.

771
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,860
Thank you, doctor.

772
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,180
Thanks a lot.

773
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,420
Young man, you are so lucky

774
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,140
to have such a good wife.

775
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,140
I think so.

776
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,540
The yellow one.
One or two drops at a time,

777
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,380
every three to four hours.

778
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,260
Don’t forget.

779
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,340
The blue one. Four to six times a day.

780
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,940
Two or three drops
at a time if necessary.

781
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,460
And don’t forget the capsule.

782
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,020
Take it three times a day.

783
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,060
You need…

784
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,220
Why are you smiling?

785
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,020
Now I know what it’s like

786
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,540
to be nagged by wife.

787
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,620
What wife?

788
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,140
In your dream.

789
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,220
Being nagged by wife

790
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,900
feels really good.

791
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,860
The doctor said

792
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,020
the cause is eye overuse.

793
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,060
You have to take much rest, understand?

794
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,420
Then from today on,

795
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,940
you must listen to me on everything.

796
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,740
Okay.

797
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,940
Deal?

798
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,340
Deal.

799
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,300
Go back to rest.

800
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,780
Come on.

801
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,260
Zhou Yi, your cooking has been

802
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,180
going down lately.

803
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,260
-Is it because
-Really?

804
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,300
you got too proud
after winning the championship?

805
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:11,820
No.

806
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,140
Don’t you like the supper lately?

807
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,340
It’s just…

808
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,220
Captain.

809
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,940
What is it?

810
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,820
Nothing.

811
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,540
Captain, you finally decided to propose?

812
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,740
How do you know that?

813
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,780
That’s not a secret in K&K at all.

814
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,980
We thought you would propose

815
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,980
right after the AMC,

816
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,820
but nothing has happened,
which confused us.

817
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,660
Did

818
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,780
the experience of Boss’s failed proposal

819
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,300
make you cringe?

820
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,700
Listen,

821
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,620
Wu Bai,

822
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,940
you can’t let some small difficulties
bring you down.

823
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,260
You should bring them down instead!

824
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,620
That’s right.

825
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,780
Otherwise, how are you able to
marry Appledog, the Goddess?

826
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,300
How do you know

827
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,180
I’m not prepared?

828
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,580
Tell us what you have prepared.

829
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,460
Yeah.

830
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,900
There’s a kind of chocolate

831
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,140
which Ai Qing loves.

832
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,500
-Chocolate?
-Chocolate…

833
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,580
Captain.

834
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,620
Are you going to put the ring

835
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,140
in that chocolate?

836
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,100
That’s too old-fashioned.

837
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,260
I’ve delivered the ring to
the chocolate maker.

838
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,420
Tomorrow, I’ll get
the tailor-made chocolate.

839
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,740
And then, I’ll go to Ai Qing.

840
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,900
Old-fashioned,

841
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,300
but classic.

842
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,140
-Yeah.
-Go for it!

843
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,740
We have faith in you.

844
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,860
-Come on!
-Come on!

845
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,780
Today’s breakfast is sumptuous, Zhou Yi.

846
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,460
That’s right.

847
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,220
Zhou Yi, why don’t we have

848
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,500
Egg and Pork Congee today?

849
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,620
That dish is fabulous.

850
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,180
Really?

851
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,180
I’ll cook it tomorrow.

852
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,060
Good.

853
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,620
Name your dish, 97.

854
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,540
I’m not picky with food…

855
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,220
Ai Qing?

856
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,900
Now SP has marched straight into

857
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,140
our nest and is ready to take us down.

858
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,940
She’s not here to take us down.

859
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,140
She’s here to side with us.

860
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,580
She’s here to join our K&K

861
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,180
and create a brighter future with us.

862
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,180
What brings you here?

863
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,580
Didn’t we agree on this yesterday?

864
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,260
You must listen to me on everything
from now on.

865
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,980
So, I moved here to look after you.

866
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,660
Come in.

867
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,820
Hi.

868
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,580
Hello, Ai Qing.

869
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,260
Morning, guys.

870
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,540
I want to move here
to look after your captain.

871
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,540
Would you mind?

872
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,220
-Not at all!
-Of course not!

873
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,100
Sit, sit.

874
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,900
You haven’t eaten, right?

875
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,380
Join us.

876
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,060
I’ll get you bowl and chopsticks.

877
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,740
Join us and eat.

878
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,940
Thanks.

879
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,420
Now that Ai Qing’s here,

880
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,660
what to do with
Captain’s proposal plan?

881
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,340
Be ready-witted.

882
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,420
Okay.

883
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,380
Here, Ai Qing.

884
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,740
-Have some soya milk.
-Thanks.

885
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,300
Thanks a lot.

886
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,660
Your chopsticks.

887
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,540
Try this.

888
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,500
Your breakfast is really rich.

889
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,500
Try this.

890
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,020
Thanks.

891
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,980
Did you

892
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,100
use the eye drops on time last night?

893
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,420
I did.

894
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,380
Are you sure?

895
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,220
Are we all full?

896
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,220
Yes.

897
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,020
Well then,

898
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,340
let’s have a meeting
at the training area in five minutes.

899
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,380
-No problem.
-Okay.

900
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,260
Okay.

901
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,820
I’ll do the dishes first.

902
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,420
Put them down. I’ll do it.

903
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,060
You have a meeting to attend.

904
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,620
No, Ai Qing. You are a guest here.

905
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,340
Just listen to me. It’s okay.

906
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,900
Go get ready for your meeting.

907
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,100
Thank you then, Ai Qing.

908
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,140
How virtuous.

909
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,300
Let’s go.

910
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,140
Go.

911
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,660
Wait! Wait a sec.

912
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,060
Take this.

913
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:43,860
What?

914
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,620
What’s this?

915
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,540
Glasses?

916
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,460
Specially prepared for you.

917
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,740
They look good on you.

918
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,220
Hey, Captain,

919
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,580
after wearing them,

920
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,140
you look like a… What is it?

921
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,500
A refined scum!

922
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,780
What are you talking about?

923
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,620
You used the wrong word.

924
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,700
He is a… He’s a refined gentleman!

925
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,380
That’s right.

926
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,980
-Shen Zhe is the sweet-talker here.
-At least I used one word correctly.

927
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,740
Why does he need glasses?

928
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,860
They are blue light proof,

929
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,460
which can protect his eyes.

930
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,700
Ai Qing,

931
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,060
you’re so considerate.

932
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,020
I

933
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,740
just worry he may
feel uncomfortable with his eyes.

934
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,900
All right, let’s go training.

935
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,020
-Let’s go.
-Come on.

936
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,260
One more second!

937
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,900
What else?

938
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,060
What’s this?

939
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,700
Matters needing atten…

940
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,860
Matters needing attention!

941
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,500
Number one.
Wear blue light proof glasses

942
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,100
and don’t watch screen for too long.

943
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,260
Number two. Pay attention to eye rest.

944
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,220
Take a rest every 45 minutes

945
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,500
by doing eye exercises
or looking into the distance.

946
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,940
Number three. Eat nutritiously.

947
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,580
Supply more vitamin B group.

948
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,020
Number four. To avoid eye overuse,

949
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,660
you can’t work over an hour at a time.

950
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,860
How detailed.

951
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,300
One more thing.

952
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,460
Still more?

953
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,580
Apart from that,
there’s a daily schedule.

954
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,460
A daily schedule?

955
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,300
Use eye drops the first time at 9 a.m.

956
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,060
Rest with eyes closed at 10 a.m.

957
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:22,060
11 a.m. is time for eye massage?

958
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,420
You must eat nutritious lunch at twelve.

959
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,700
Ai Qing.

960
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,940
This is too professional,
don’t you think so?

961
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,860
Of course.

962
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,740
I specifically consulted the doctor
before making it.

963
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,780
But I guess

964
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,580
if Captain doesn’t do as it says,

965
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,740
he will be in trouble.

966
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,020
Wu Bai.

967
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,420
From now on,

968
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,940
I’m going to strictly supervise you

969
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,900
in every item on this schedule.

970
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,300
You hear that?

971
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,220
I promise to fully cooperate.
