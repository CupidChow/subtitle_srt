19

What? Are you here for Ai Qing’s matter?

20
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,180
Given Ai Qing’s character,

21
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,300
I’m afraid she’ll blame herself
for all of this.

22
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,100
Did she say anything?

23
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,740
Not yet.

24
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,740
But she’s been blaming herself

25
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,540
for Solo Team’s disbanding
ten years ago.

26
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,300
I’m afraid she’s feeling guilty again.

27
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,980
Tomorrow, she may...

28
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,780
Tomorrow, she may resign because of it.

29
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,380
I hope you can stop her.

30
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,540
The point is that I’m an active player

31
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,580
and also the captain.

32
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,220
I’ll give an explanation to the public.

33
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:19,980
Rest assured.

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,660
SP won’t sacrifice its members

35
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,300
just for some

36
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,540
public opinions.

37
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,020
Thank you.

38
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,020
You’re welcome.

39
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,020
Ai Qing is also my...

40
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,980
Buddy.

41
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,100
This is what I should do.

42
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:56,820
Hello.

43
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,500
Hello.

44
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,300
Have you known

45
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,900
what happened tonight?

46
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,380
Of course.

47
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,980
The thing has gone big.

48
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,980
The club must do something.

49
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,060
I’ll accept the board’s decision.

50
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,020
Please punish me as soon as possible.

51
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,380
You brat.

52
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
Are you afraid that

53
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,700
Ai Qing gets punished for it?

54
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,420
She did nothing wrong.

55
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,860
I don’t want her to get hurt.

56
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,420
Alright. Alright.

57
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,620
You all call me this late.

58
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,020
Let’s talk in the club tomorrow.

59
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,300
Bai.

60
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,460
Bai.

61
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,340
Bai?

62
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,220
Wu Bai is ridiculous, isn’t he?

63
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,820
He’s in love with the rival’s leader.

64
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,500
Isn’t Wu Bai despicable?

65
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,300
He is being with SP’s team leader.

66
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,300
Gosh. He’s taken their leader.

67
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,260
Bai.

68
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,420
-You’re up.
-You...

69
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,340
Where did you go in the early morning?

70
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,300
Yesterday you said you wanted
fried buns.

71
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,860
I bought some for you.

72
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,300
Sit.

73
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,220
You didn’t sleep well last night, right?

74
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,300
That’s not true. I slept well.

75
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,220
Eat when they are still hot.

76
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,740
Sorry, Bai.

77
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,940
What for?

78
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,100
I saw comments on the Internet.

79
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,660
Netizens are not only abusing me.

80
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,700
Many are also abusing you.

81
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,740
I’m fine.

82
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,580
But,

83
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,020
the AMC later...

84
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,380
Do you wanna part with me?

85
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,700
Is that your thought?

86
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,300
Of course no.

87
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,620
Good.

88
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,900
It’s OK with me then.

89
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,420
You fool.

90
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,620
Ai Qing.

91
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,500
I’ll take care of this matter.

92
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,940
Trust me.

93
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,420
Eat now. They’ll get cold.

94
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,380
You try it first.

95
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,780
Is it tasty?

96
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,620
You got it on your mouth.

97
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,420
Mouth?

98
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,660
Bai.

99
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,980
Are you so good at playing cute now?

100
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,620
Only this way

101
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,900
can I feel you’re my girlfriend.

102
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,860
I’m going back to the club.

103
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,660
Don’t think too much.

104
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,820
I’m fine.

105
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,060
Rest assured.

106
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,500
I’m leaving.

107
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,700
Take care.

108
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,660
Ai Qing.

109
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,580
Sister.

110
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,260
Aren’t you on tour in Beijing?

111
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,540
How could I have time for the tour?

112
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,460
Shen Zhe bought me an airline ticket

113
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,620
and I flew back in the morning.

114
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,140
Let me see.

115
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,500
Are your eyes swollen from crying?

116
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,940
I’m pretty good.

117
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,100
Really?

118
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,740
You’re really better than before.

119
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,260
When the team disbanded,

120
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,300
you cried for a week
and didn’t even eat.

121
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,700
I was too young

122
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,300
and got shocked.

123
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,660
Actually,

124
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,580
when I just knew it yesterday,

125
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,980
I was shocked as well.

126
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,020
I’m not worried about myself.

127
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,500
I’m worried about the whole team.

128
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,180
The AMC later

129
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,220
is too important for Ou Qiang,

130
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,780
Slide and the whole team.

131
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,500
It’s their first
international competition

132
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,060
after they came back.

133
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,060
I’m really worried

134
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,860
that they could be affected

135
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,780
by those doubts and gossips.

136
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,460
Don’t be so pessimistic.

137
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,300
I am not.

138
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,420
There’s always a way out.

139
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,180
Have you got a solution?

140
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,780
We’re rivals,

141
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,500
and also important team members.

142
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,980
Being doubted is not surprising at all.

143
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,180
As long as one party

144
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,140
keeps a distance from sensitive issues,

145
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,660
those gossips

146
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,420
will soon subside.

147
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,500
You’re an expert in this.

148
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,820
I don’t understand it, though.

149
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,100
But remember this.

150
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,580
Don’t make any decision impulsively.

151
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,780
(Chief of China Region)
Hold an official press conference

152
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,380
to clarify this matter...

153
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,540
No need.

154
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,940
SP doesn’t have to hold
a press conference for me.

155
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,420
You

156
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,420
have done enough for me.

157
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,780
I’m here today

158
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,180
to tell you

159
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,420
something.

160
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,300
I

161
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,540
have decided to resign as SP’s leader.

162
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,180
Ai Qing, don’t be impulsive.

163
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,060
It’s not so serious as you think.

164
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,220
I’ve talked with Han Shangyan.

165
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,580
We’ll back you up unconditionally.

166
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,460
Thank you, Solo.

167
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,860
Thank you.

168
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,060
But this time,

169
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,140
I also wanna do something for you,

170
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,780
to help you get rid of the gossips

171
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,860
and the pressure.

172
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,380
No, Ai Qing.

173
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,860
Don’t worry about it.

174
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,940
We have perfect measures
by public relations.

175
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,860
I believe this thing

176
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,180
will soon be over.

177
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,860
The AMC won’t be affected.

178
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,340
Hear me out first.

179
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,540
I just mean to

180
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,020
resign as the SP’s leader.

181
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,340
It doesn’t mean I’ll leave this field.

182
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,300
In fact,

183
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,260
I always want to be a commentator.

184
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,460
It is a good chance

185
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,100
this time.

186
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,020
I’m just worried about...

187
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,500
Don’t worry about me.

188
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,380
I just wanna change my job.

189
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,580
Also,

190
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,340
do you know this?

191
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,860
Being the team leader is very tiring.

192
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,500
I have too many things to care about,

193
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,540
like a nanny.

194
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,100
Besides,

195
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,620
I’m a senior

196
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,100
with ten years of team experience,

197
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,180
and tons of relevant knowledge.

198
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,380
I’m suitable to be a commentator.

199
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,820
If that’s your true thought,

200
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,220
I’ll respect your choice.

201
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,540
However,

202
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,940
you must win the championship

203
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,540
of the AMC.

204
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,700
You have to change your job inside SP.

205
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,060
You can’t leave SP,

206
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,140
unless you go to K&K.

207
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,020
I’ll obey the order.

208
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,220
But,

209
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,220
why should I go to K&K?

210
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,660
Because the five members of Solo Team

211
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,780
are either in K&K or in SP.

212
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,020
We buddies can’t be parted again.

213
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,180
Thank you, boss.

214
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,900
I love watching commentary

215
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,820
by beauties.

216
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,220
Apart from everything else,

217
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,220
given Ai Qing’s good look,

218
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,900
why bother to be a team leader?

219
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,220
She can rely on her good look
rather than her strength.

220
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,820
What a pity.

221
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,340
Ai Qing. Rest assured.

222
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,220
Whatever you’ll do in the future,

223
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,980
we’ll back you up.

224
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,500
We definitely will.

225
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,220
Thank you, Baona.

226
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,100
Wu Bai

227
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,460
is a nice guy.

228
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,020
Go ahead.

229
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,580
Do what you want to do.

230
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,460
Love the man you really love.

231
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,660
Promise me.

232
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,860
You must be happy as well.

233
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,140
Rest assured.

234
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,100
I definitely will.

235
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,220
I’ve heard that.

236
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,980
You can’t just talk.

237
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,420
Do you have any objections?

238
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,500
No.

239
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,780
You must do it for real.

240
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,100
How should I?

241
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,860
Look.

242
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,860
If SP can’t win

243
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,740
the championship of AMC this year,

244
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,740
you’ll go for blind dates ten times.

245
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,380
Fine. Fine.

246
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,100
Tell me.

247
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,580
Why should I take so many times
of blind dates?

248
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,900
It will be good
if you succeed by ten times.

249
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,780
I think you need 20 or 30 times.

250
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,460
Why are you back so late?

251
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,220
Boss is waiting for you upstairs.

252
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,300
I know.

253
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,140
What are you going to do?

254
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,980
Let those gossips disappear.

255
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,020
There are too many mouths.

256
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,540
How can you shut them all up?

257
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,420
I can.

258
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,140
Let’s get to the business.

259
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,220
Since the gossips are incurred,

260
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,780
you must be punished.

261
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,900
I know.

262
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,900
Vacate the captain’s position

263
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,980
to Shen Zhe.

264
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,340
Be good to her.

265
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,580
It’s a blessing for you.

266
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,780
Three days to go.

267
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,700
Win the championship.

268
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,020
Or else, you can’t explain

269
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,580
for this matter.

270
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,860
I know.

271
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,580
Did he get scolded?

272
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,260
I suppose not.

273
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,060
-How is it?
-How is it?

274
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,940
How is it? How is it?

275
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,660
What did the Devil say?

276
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,220
Did he scold you?

277
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,620
Don’t keep us in suspense, buddy.

278
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,140
I won’t be the captain anymore.

279
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,100
The punishment is

280
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,460
to dismiss me as the captain.

281
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,540
If not you, who will be the captain?

282
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,820
Shen Zhe.

283
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,140
Me?

284
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,780
Why? I won’t be the captain.

285
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,660
Being the captain is thankless.

286
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,460
I have to take responsibility
and worry about many things.

287
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,500
I won’t.

288
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,900
It’s not a term in the contract.

289
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,580
I don’t agree.

290
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
What’s wrong with it?

291
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,420
Isn’t Wu Bai a good captain?

292
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,020
He is. That’s his business.

293
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,100
I won’t do the job anyway.

294
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,180
Fine.

295
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,540
Since you disagree,

296
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,820
go talk with Han Shangyan.

297
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,140
Yes, go ahead.

298
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,140
Hey, it sounds like

299
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,140
I don’t dare to talk with him.

300
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
I’m going.

301
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,340
Go ahead. Go.

302
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,540
You’d better go, man.

303
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,060
Go ahead.

304
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,260
I know you don’t dare to.

305
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,020
I’ll go later.

306
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,100
I’ll go after breakfast.

307
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,900
I’m hungry.

308
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,420
I’ll have breakfast first.

309
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,220
I can’t talk with my stomach empty.

310
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,420
You must be freaked out.

311
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,460
You’re freaked out.

312
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,340
I...

313
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,140
(Ai Qing)
I’ve taken my punishment.

314
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,860
What about you?

315
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,620
(I’ve taken my punishment.
What about you?)

316
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,420
(Ai Qing)
I’m good.

317
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,180
But my boss ordered me

318
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,060
to win the championship back.

319
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,060
Unfortunately,

320
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,580
I took the same order.

321
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,180
Badly,

322
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,100
the championship is only one.

323
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,420
(Xiaomi)

324
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,300
Leader.

325
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,020
Are you hiding for such trivial matters?

326
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,580
You are underestimating us.

327
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,820
Just stay and wait there.

328
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,540
You can count on Solo and me
for everything.

329
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,940
It’s not good to enjoy food alone.

330
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,060
Hey, you.

331
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,700
Is it that tasty?

332
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,460
The spicy and sour beef noodles.

333
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,700
It smells too good.

334
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,100
What are the noodles?

335
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,500
How come you are crying?

336
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,900
Yeah.

337
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,460
Buddies. One, two, three. Come on!

338
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,500
Whose tissue will you use?

339
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,580
What are you guys doing?

340
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,140
Why surrounding me like this?

341
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,020
Since you have asked,

342
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,860
I’ll tell you then.

343
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,540
The renowned Appledog,

344
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
the goddess, is weeping.

345
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,100
Isn’t it rare? Who has a phone?

346
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,420
-Take your phone out.
-Let me.

347
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,140
Take a group photo.

348
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,420
Take a photo.

349
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,940
Stop it.

350
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,860
I’m being abused on the Internet.

351
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,540
Are you gloating here?

352
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,060
No.

353
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,340
Baona has told us.

354
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,460
We respect your decision,

355
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,580
but you must be back for the AMC.

356
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,740
We’ll retaliate

357
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,900
with a good result.

358
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Am I right, buddies?

359
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,940
Yes!

360
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,660
Sorry.

361
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,380
I got you guys implicated.

362
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,340
If you see us as your buddies,

363
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,700
take this tissue and withdraw the word.

364
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,500
Yes, boss.

365
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,340
Are you not taking us as your buddies?

366
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:08,980
Yes, boss.

367
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,460
You didn’t implicate us.

368
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,180
I was worried about your mood

369
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,100
for the competition.

370
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,300
Now it looks

371
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,940
you’re all good. I’m half relieved.

372
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,700
Then be relieved for the other half.

373
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,900
Listen to me.

374
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,300
We’re together.

375
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,060
Now we put all minds

376
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
on the AMC

377
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,020
to win the championship

378
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,340
and shut them up.

379
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,420
Rest assured.

380
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,540
We’ll definitely

381
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,260
win this championship. Right?

382
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,020
Yes!

383
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,660
Come on. As usual.

384
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,540
SP.

385
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,500
Go for it!

386
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,860
(K&K China)

387
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
An announcement was made.

388
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,100
Wu Bai, the captain of K&K

389
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,500
was dismissed.

390
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,060
Shen Zhe takes over his position.

391
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,740
It takes effect from now on.

392
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,740
Is it so simple?

393
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,260
No any other words?

394
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,140
97.

395
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,380
Call all the teammates here

396
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,820
for a meeting.

397
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,540
Sure.

398
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,180
(SUPER TEAM)

399
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,380
The email was replied
by the headquarter.

400
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,820
It’s a private matter between employees.

401
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,460
The contract isn’t breached.

402
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,900
That’s all then.

403
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,940
Come on.

404
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,340
Post an announcement

405
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,460
with SP’s official Weibo.

406
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,140
Hurry.

407
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,620
What to post
with the official Weibo?

408
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,180
There’s no punishment to Ai Qing.

409
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,580
She didn’t break any rule.

410
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,940
Why should we post it
on the official Weibo?

411
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,420
You’re right.

412
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,700
Why replying this kind of thing
by official Weibo?

413
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,900
Although Ai Qing resigned by herself,

414
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,940
I still feel bad

415
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,500
for it.

416
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,620
A reply is needed anyway, isn’t it?

417
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,980
I’ll use my private Weibo then.

418
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,260
Due to my personal relationship,

419
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,540
I made troubles to the club

420
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,380
and to my teammates.

421
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,260
As the captain,

422
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,420
I sincerely apologize to you.

423
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,500
Wu Bai, what are you doing?

424
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,980
Captain, what are you doing?

425
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,460
We’re brothers.

426
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,980
I repeat the punishment to me
from the club.

427
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,460
From today on, I resign as the captain

428
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,220
and Shen Zhe will take my place.

429
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,300
Shen Zhe has never been the captain.

430
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,980
The AMC is coming.

431
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,860
Is it OK to do so?

432
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,500
I don’t think it’s appropriate either.

433
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,940
Why don’t we

434
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,580
plead with Boss together?

435
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,580
The competition is about to come.

436
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,820
How can the captain be changed?

437
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,780
Yeah.

438
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,580
I’m incapable to be the captain.

439
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,660
If K&K gets in a mess,

440
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,660
I can’t afford the consequence.

441
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,820
I’ll still be in charge of

442
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,380
tactics and commanding on site.

443
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,860
How about this?

444
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,580
I’ll be the captain in name.

445
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,980
You’ll still command the team.

446
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,100
Is it OK?

447
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,540
OK. I agree.

448
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,340
I agree, too.

449
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,020
-We agree.
-We agree.

450
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,980
I agree.

451
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,820
At last,

452
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,500
I hope you can trust me 100%.

453
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,140
On the field, I’m the captain of K&K.

454
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,900
I represent the team, the club,

455
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,340
and all of you.

456
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,860
My personal life

457
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,860
will never interfere my stance.

458
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,780
It’s a basic principle to me

459
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,900
as a robot fighting player.

460
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Guys.

461
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,540
I’ll take you

462
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,300
to win the World Championship.

463
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,460
Captain, the training...

464
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,500
Are you gonna post a Weibo?

465
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,700
Don’t do that.

466
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,100
Boss has made
the punishment announcement.

467
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,420
For you, the priority is to lay low.

468
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,860
I should say something.

469
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,020
Think twice.

470
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,380
Give me the phone. Go for the training.

471
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,220
Captain.

472
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,020
Give it to me.

473
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,180
Well... Watch your words.

474
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,100
Keep calm.

475
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,820
As the chief of SP China,

476
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,220
for everything that has happened
since last night,

477
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,060
neither I

478
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,660
nor the SP Official

479
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,060
will make any response.

480
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,180
No one broke SP team rules.

481
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,580
No one affected the game result.

482
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,940
Meanwhile,

483
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,060
please allow me to take off
this identity for a minute.

484
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,900
Thanks to my former teammates.

485
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,980
Han Shangyan. Ai Qing.

486
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,740
Xiaomi. Ou Qiang.

487
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,300
To me, we’ve never been parted.

488
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,420
If a person only has love in his eyes,

489
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,780
whether a man or a woman,

490
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,140
they don’t deserve love.

491
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,620
These words have brought me to this far.

492
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,580
And I’ll keep going.

493
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,540
OK. One minute is up.

494
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,780
SP is still the same.

495
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,700
Please keep waiting for our glory.

496
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,060
You are weeping again?

497
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,620
Who is weeping?

498
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,100
Have you seen it?

499
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,260
What?

500
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,100
Wu Bai’s post.

501
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,540
I knew Bai would post it.

502
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,500
But

503
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,740
I haven’t dared to see it.

504
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,740
That’s simple.

505
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
Come on. I’ll see it for you.

506
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,820
No.

507
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,380
Leave. I’ll see it myself.

508
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,420
OK. See it yourself then.

509
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,540
Be careful. It’s very touching.

510
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,220
(Wu Bai)

511
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,660
Since the day I saw her on the field,

512
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,460
I’ve been working hard

513
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,300
so as to stand by her side someday.

514
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,460
Thanks to her,

515
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,220
I’ve become who I am today

516
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,980
from a rookie who knew nothing
about fighting robots.

517
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,460

Captain, are you looking for this?

534
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,820
Thanks.

535
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,700
Are you reacting so quickly today?

536
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,860
Upon he posted the Weibo,

537
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,140
I knew he’d surely go to Ai Qing.

538
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,660
I’ve been waiting here.

539
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,540
You’re sensitive now.

540
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,540
Of course.

541
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,420
They all think I’m not observant.

542
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,940
I’ll take that stigma off

543
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,500
by my own efforts.

544
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,580
Good.

00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,140

to be a love supporter.

547
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,540
You’d better find yourself
a girlfriend first.

548
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,780
What did you say?

549
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,300
Did Shen Zhe have a bad influence
on you?

550
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Ai Qing.

551
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,660
Bai.

552
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,020
Why were you running?

553
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,260
I don’t wanna keep you waiting.

554
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,820
You fool.

555
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,820
Ai Qing.

556
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,060
Those words

557
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,060
on the Weibo

558
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,180
are all from my heart.

559
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,740
I know.

560
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,140
Thank you, Bai.

561
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,380
It’s good to have you.

562
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,740
By the way,

563
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,820
did Han Shangyan scold you?

564
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,740
No.

565
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,580
Good to hear.

566
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,700
I have

567
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,580
good news and bad news.

568
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,700
Which do you want to hear first?

569
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,340
Bad news.

570
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,580
Bad news is that

571
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,580
I resigned as SP’s leader.

572
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,740
It’ll take effect
after the World Championship and AMC.

573
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,980
What about the good news?

574
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,940
Good news...

575
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,580
Good news is that your girlfriend,

576
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,780
the pretty Miss Ai Qing,

577
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,220
is going to be

578
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,420
the best female commentator
of the league.

579
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,420
How is it?

580
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,620
Am I great?

581
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,100
You’ll transfer your post?

582
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,740
Actually, I had this thought long ago.

583
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,220
It’s just that

584
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,860
there wasn’t a good timing.

585
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,060
This happens to be a good chance.

586
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,580
I’ve told you

587
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,940
to trust me.

588
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,620
I can handle it well.

589
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,980
I surely believe you can handle it well.

590
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,220
But Bai, this time,

591
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,980
I want to do something

592
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,020
for you

593
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,900
and for the others.

594
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,620
Bai.

595
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,060
Do you blame me for
not telling you beforehand?

596
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,620
Yes.

597
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,020
Think about it in another way.

598
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,220
Look.

599
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,340
We can date at will

600
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,180
in the future.

601
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,740
Isn’t it wonderful?

602
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,940
Right?

603
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,980
Ai Qing.

604
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,140
Thanks for what you did for me.

605
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,740
We’ve been together.

606
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,460
Do you have to make it that clear?

607
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,060
I’ll do my utmost

608
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,100
to make you happy.

609
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,340
Deal.

610
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,620
Let me send you home.

611
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,460
No.

612
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,500
I’m going back to SP to hand over.

613
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,820
Then I’ll go to visit my dad.

614
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,460
He thought we were on a quarrel.

615
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,260
How about I send you back?

616
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,380
No.

617
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,500
I’ll keep him company tonight,

618
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,820
talking and

619
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,220
reassuring him.

620
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,860
Go.

621
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,740
Ai Qing.

622
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,060
Baona.

623
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,820
Go to Solo’s office with me. Hurry.

624
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,620
What’s the matter?

625
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,220
A big matter. It’s quite serious.

626
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,700
Hurry.

627
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,860
What... What’s wrong?

628
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,060
Hurry.

629
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,340
Mr. Xiang?

630
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,460
What’s up?

631
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,580
What brings you here?

632
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,380
Are you unhappy seeing me?

633
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,860
Come on. Sit.

634
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,380
Well, you tell her

635
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,340
or I tell her?

636
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,060
You, of course.

637
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,860
See if she’ll agree.

638
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,220
Hey. Don’t keep me in suspense.

639
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,860
What’s it exactly?

640
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,780
Live commentary contracts for the AMC

641
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,300
and the World Championship.

642
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,380
For me?

643
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,340
Yeah. They’re for you.

644
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,100
I bring you the invitation
on behalf of the host.

645
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,100
Hope you can sign with our company.

646
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,980
You have

647
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,340
tens of thousands of fans
on the Internet.

648
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,100
You’re professional the most.

649
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,620
You’re SP’s leader.

650
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,860
You also have the world’s

651
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,980
most advanced experience
on robot fighting.

652
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,460
You...

653
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,220
Cut it out, Mr. Xiang.

654
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,220
Stop praising me in face.

655
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,140
I’m not used to it.

656
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,820
I’m convincing you

657
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,220
to sign the contract soon.

658
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,100
And,

659
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,620
better sign it today.

660
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,460
Because the AMC is about to begin.

661
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,940
But...

662
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,380
Who can tell me

663
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,100
what’s going on?

664
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,060
Mr. Xiang meant to poach you

665
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,740
to be the commentator for their events.

666
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,740
But Baona and I refused,

667
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,180
afraid you’d be too tired.

668
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,860
In the morning, you said

669
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,140
you wanted to be a commentator.

670
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,860
So,

671
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,500
I called Xiang.

672
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:01,980
So,

673
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,860
once I hung up,

674
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,100
I came to you with the contracts.

675
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,420
Isn’t it too fast?

676
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,660
Go ahead.

677
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,620
Witness the moment with us

678
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,180
that China wins the championship.

679
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,220
Exactly.

680
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,900
But

681
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,220
it’s too much earlier

682
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,860
than what I planned.

683
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,580
The World Championship and AMC
are coming.

684
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,500
I’m worried about my team.

685
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,980
When you sign the contracts,

686
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,340
Baona and I will take over SP Team I.

687
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,500
I’ll be the coach.
Baona will be the leader.

688
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,620
I used to be the head coach.

689
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,460
It can’t be a problem for me

690
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,660
to lead SP team I.

691
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,220
I’m originally a team leader.

692
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,180
In terms of seniority,

693
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,500
I’m much better than you.

694
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,220
Of course,

695
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,860
10% of your income

696
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,380
will be subject to SP China.

697
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,980
Which is also the income for the club.

698
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,900
Are you guys jointly

699
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,060
giving me a surprise attack?

700
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,900
Not really.

701
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,700
Listen.

702
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,500
If you hadn’t signed with SP,

703
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,100
I’d have invited you much earlier.

704
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,740
But this time,

705
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,500
it has nothing to do with
personal emotions.

706
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,100
I just think,

707
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,140
given your seniority,

708
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,660
you’re best for this job.

709
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,700
Do you

710
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,340
really support that?

711
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,740
It’s equivalent to advertising SP.

712
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,260
Why don’t I support it?

713
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,980
Since you’re convinced,

714
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,380
then sign it.

715
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,140
(Party B: Ai Qing)

716
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,420
OK.

717
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,180
I didn’t come in vain today.

718
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,420
It’s done.

719
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,700
The first rehearsal will
be at noon tomorrow.

720
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,220
Arrange your time for it.

721
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
Go to the gym

722
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,660
before noon.

723
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,860
No problem.

724
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,980
I’m going then.

725
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,740
Let me walk you out, Mr. Xiang.

726
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,500
Sure.

727
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,820
Captain.

728
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,780
Who are you texting?

729
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,820
You brat. You know it.

730
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,540
Wu Bai.

731
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,300
I really admire you.

732
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,060
Back then, Ai Qing was

733
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,060
the only girl among the gurus.

734
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,220
Now you got her.

735
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,620
That’s wrong.

736
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,180
It’s not that our captain got Ai Qing.

737
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,420
It’s that Ai Qing

738
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,980
got our captain.

739
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,140
Did Ai Qing pursue the captain?

740
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,380
Really?

741
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,940
Let me tell you the details.

742
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,900
Go ahead.

743
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,620
Once,

744
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,820
there was a boy

745
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,180
who knew nothing.

746
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,860
But...

747
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,220
Go to bed early.

748
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,780
We’ll double the training tomorrow.

749
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,980
Again.

750
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,060
I didn’t assign this task,

751
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,300
though we should train hard.

752
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,900
So, I’ll take Wu’s advice.

753
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,340
We’ll train hard tomorrow.

754
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,300
OK.

755
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,900
Get down to the business.

756
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,300
Now where was I?

757
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,140
The kid.

758
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,860
Until he saw a match.

759
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,260
What match?

760
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,380
That match was amazing

761
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,180
both on and off the court.

762
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,980
If you want to know more,
listen to it next time.

763
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,940
See you.

764
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,900
Do you keep us in suspense as well?

765
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,540
Tell us first!

766
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,580
Shen Zhe.

767
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,460
Dad.

768
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,620
Sweetheart.

769
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,220
Why are you back?

770
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,420
Yeah.

771
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,140
I miss you, so I come here.

772
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,260
You miss me?

773
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,500
Come on. Give it to me.

774
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,220
Take it.

775
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,460
Sit.

776
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,540
I’m exhausted.

777
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,420
So, how is it going with Bai?

778
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,540
Are you two still on a quarrel?

779
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,660
Dad, I’ve told you.

780
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,500
We didn’t quarrel.

781
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,660
We are on good terms.

782
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,140
Fine. You’re good.

783
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,140
Bai is a good boy.

784
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,580
Have you eaten?

785
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,660
Yes.

786
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,700
Dad.

787
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,820
I’m gonna stay here tonight.

788
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,700
You’re gonna stay here?

789
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,460
I need to repair the water heater then.

790
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,620
OK.

791
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,420
(Sister)

792
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,700
Hello, sister. What’s the matter?

793
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,380
You wild girl.

794
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,860
Don’t you go home now?

795
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,780
You haven’t married yet.

796
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,460
Now are you at Wu Bai’s place?

797
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,580
What are you talking about?

798
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,300
I’m at dad’s place.

799
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,100
The place for the AMC rehearsal

800
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,420
is nearby.

801
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,540
I’ll go straight there tomorrow morning.

802
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,100
Fine.

803
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,940
Accompany the old handsome man then.

804
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,380
Bye-bye.

805
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,940
OK. It’s fixed.

806
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,980
Go to take a shower.

807
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,140
Why didn’t you tell me earlier

808
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,740
that the water heater was broken?

809
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,700
You’re busy. Why bother to tell you?

810
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,660
I could call someone

811
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,980
to get it repaired.

812
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,540
Or I could

813
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,300
buy a new one for you.

814
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:16,900
No.

815
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,420
I used to replace things
when they were broken.

816
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,980
Now when they are broken,

817
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,820
I’ll try to fix them.

818
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,180
You have a point, though.

819
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,500
It is too old, and should be replaced.

820
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,180
The flow is too small.

821
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,660
Your sister said so last week.

822
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,300
My sister.

823
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,260
My sister again.

824
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,140
You take everything she says to heart.

825
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,020
You never care about yourself.

826
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,580
You... You mean I’m partial to her?

827
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,540
I didn’t say that.

828
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,580
You said that.

829
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,620
I’m going for a shower.

830
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,580
Am I?

831
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,540
Dad.

832
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,940
I am your daughter,

833
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,780
not your guest.

834
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,900
Why are you changing the sheet?

835
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,620
No.

836
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,700
I just reflected on myself.

837
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,620
I change it when your sister comes back.

838
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,260
It’ll be unfair

839
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,660
if I don’t change it for you.

840
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,540
It’s not right. I am indeed partial.

841
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,500
I was kidding.

842
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,460
Did you take it seriously?
Are you holding a grudge?

843
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,580
Alright.

844
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,140
These are all washed.

845
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,620
They are clean.

846
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,100
All of them have been changed for you.

847
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,460
OK.

848
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,220
Thank you, dad.

849
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,140
In the future,

850
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,540
I won’t say you are partial again.

851
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,420
Girl.

852
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,780
As I was making your bed,

853
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,540
I was also thinking of the things

854
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,060
when you were little.

855
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,820
And I had many feelings.

856
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,100
You know,

857
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,100
your sister was in poor health
when she was little.

858
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,620
She got sick a lot.

859
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,820
So, I was partial to her

860
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,260
more or less.

861
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,660
Luckily, I didn’t get remarried.

862
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,180
Dad.

863
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,660
You’re just

864
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,700
thinking too much.

865
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,140
Even if you got remarried,

866
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,300
our stepmother could also be good to us.

867
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,300
As long as you feel happy

868
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,860
for it,

869
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,500
that will be fine.

870
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,740
That’s what really matters.

871
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,380
People have different moods.

872
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,180
They all tend to be partial

873
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,580
more or less.

874
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,980
Who can guarantee it’s absolutely fair?

875
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,220
What if I get remarried

876
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,300
and have

877
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,780
another child?

878
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,340
Why am I talking about this with you?

879
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,780
You’ll get married soon.

880
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,740
Who said I’d get married soon?

881
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,340
Wu Bai

882
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,860
called me

883
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,540
regularly.

884
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,340
Bai?

885
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,980
What did he call you for?

886
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,980
He cared for me and asked about me.

887
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,980
We chatted.

888
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,340
He asked

889
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,860
if I had meals,

890
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,900
if I slept well,

891
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,620
or if I got bored

892
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,340
at home alone.

893
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,460
Well, he worried about me

894
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,260
as if I were a lonely old man.

895
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,220
I’m so strong, right?

896
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,260
The belly. Look.

897
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,620
Do I look like an old man?

898
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,700
Do I look like a lonely old man?

899
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,780
No, you don’t.

900
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,060
He always

901
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,100
does silly things,

902
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,220
but he’s kind-hearted.

903
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,540
Yes, he’s kind.

904
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,380
But girl, listen to me.

905
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,660
This time,

906
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,580
you chose to be a commentator.

907
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,260
Is it to fulfill his wish?
