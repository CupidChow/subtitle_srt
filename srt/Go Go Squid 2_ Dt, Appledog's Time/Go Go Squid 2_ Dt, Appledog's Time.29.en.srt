=Episode 29=

19
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,980
How did it go?

20
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,060
Won or lost?

21
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,260
You tell me.

22
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,100
Of course, we won.

23
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,380
Well-done. I’m proud of you guys.

24
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,620
What’re you doing?

25
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,540
The AMC is coming.

26
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,500
I gotta further optimize the plan.

27
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,220
Someone might forget

28
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,060
she has a boyfriend now.

29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,580
Everyone is in the closed training.

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,100
How could I spare time to date?

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,340
You’re right.

32
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,260
Is the car downstairs belonging to Bai?

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,900
You saw Bai downstairs?

34
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,340
Did I speak?

35
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,500
Come on, tell me if he’s here now.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Go.

37
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,940
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

38
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,900
Someone just said
she doesn’t have time to date.

39
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,980
How come you know I arrived

40
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,300
without seeing my message?

41
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,500
Slide told me he saw your car.

42
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,020
Why didn’t you tell me

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,100
you’d come?

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,140
I didn’t wanna disturb your work.

45
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,340
That can’t be disturbing.

46
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,460
How long haven’t we met each other?

47
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,340
At least half a month.

48
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,300
Way more than it.

49
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,780
I feel like I haven’t seen you
for almost a year.

50
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,780
You’re kind of strange to me.

51
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,340
What if I…?

52
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,500
Better, but still a little…

53
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,780
There’re too many people surrounded.

54
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,020
You wish.

55
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,420
Where’re we going?

56
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,580
My big brother called and asked me

57
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,020
to take you home for dinner.

58
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,340
Han Shangyan?

59
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,140
He’s gonna have dinner with us?

60
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,300
Not my cousin.

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,500
It’s my big brother.

62
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,060
Your big brother?

63
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,140
Your father.

64
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,860
You’re not drunk, are you?

65
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,700
Why do you still call my father
“Big Brother”?

66
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,700
My father asked you to take me home
for dinner?

67
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,340
Who on earth is his biological child?

68
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,780
Are you being jealous of your father?

69
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,980
Let’s go.

70
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,500
Bai.

71
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,420
Why do you take me here?

72
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,940
Buy some presents.

73
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,020
Do you have to buy home appliances

74
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,020
for K&K by yourself?

75
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,980
Not for K&K.

76
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,500
Then, who do you buy these for?

77
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,980
This one looks good.

78
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,260
What do you think?

79
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,140
Not bad.

80
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,300
Who do you buy this for?

81
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,060
Did you measure the size?

82
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,500
Or how would you know if it fits?

83
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,540
Not necessary.

84
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,340
This is not that big. It can fit.

85
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,100
Do you buy home appliances
for your matrimonial home?

86
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,380
We have promotional activities now.

87
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,140
Buy more, save more.

88
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,660
Can you deliver to home today?

89
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,380
Not a problem.

90
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,820
OK then. I want it.

91
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,580
OK. I’ll pack it for you.

92
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,660
What do you buy this for?

93
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,660
This is my first time
to officially meet your father.

94
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,100
I should take some presents.

95
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,580
You’re giving this to my father?

96
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,860
Not necessary. You’ve met each other.

97
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,940
No. No. No.

98
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,780
My identity now is different this time.

99
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,500
I must take some presents.

100
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,620
What’s more,

101
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,620
who will take home appliances
to meet his future father-in-law?

102
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,180
That’s it. Let’s go.

103
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,860
Wines would work.

104
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,140
What about we buy some

105
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,140
gold jewelries?

106
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,660
Why do we need gold jewelries?

107
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,780
My grandpa said that

108
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,180
when you visit
your girlfriend’s parents,

109
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,060
you have to offer home appliances
and gold jewelries.

110
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,100
That’s the Chinese engaged tradition.

111
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,420
You don’t have to do that, Bai.

112
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,620
You’ve been abroad for years

113
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,260
and don’t know the domestic customs.

114
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,580
Just trust me.

115
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,780
Wine is enough.

116
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,860
Hi, sir.

117
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,740
We don’t need that air conditioner,
thank you.

118
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,580
Let’s go.

119
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,180
May I buy this?

120
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,820
-Please don’t, seriously.
-That looks good.

121
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,220
I got it.

122
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,420
Look how many things you bought.

123
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,180
Too much to take.

124
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,100
I can handle it.

125
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,220
Let me take it.

126
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,180
Sir.

127
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,780
Dad.

128
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,900
Here you come.

129
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,380
These are what Bai bought for you.

130
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,260
Bai, it’s very kind of you
to buy me so many things.

131
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,460
Yeah. I told him.

132
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,620
But he didn’t listen to me
and all of these are your favorites.

133
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,140
Thanks, buddy.

134
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,100
Unlike Qian and Li,

135
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,380
without any excuses,

136
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,740
Bai will come every time upon my call.

137
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,580
Alright, sir.

138
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,140
Call me when you miss me.

139
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,860
Thanks, bro.

140
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,220
Well, Dad, now that you’re not drunk,

141
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,540
why do you still wanna swear brotherhood
with Bai?

142
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,220
There’s a connection between us,

143
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,180
which you can’t understand,

144
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,020
right, Bai?

145
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,540
Yeah. sir.

146
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,180
Yeah, I can’t. Let’s go.

147
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,060
I’ll take care of it.

148
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,420
You go upstairs with your father.

149
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,260
Bai,

150
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,460
can you do it by yourself?

151
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,340
No problem.

152
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,300
Then, we’ll go first.

153
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,140
Let’s go, Dad.

154
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,020
He bought you a lot of things you like.

155
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,420
Bai,

156
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,620
here you are.

157
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,260
Drink some water.

158
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,580
You haven’t tried my cooking, have you?

159
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,060
Today, it’s time.

160
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,500
Let me help you, sir.

161
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,940
That’s OK. I can handle it.

162
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,980
Help yourself.

163
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,860
Qing.

164
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,940
Come out. Stay with Bai.

165
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,500
Qing,

166
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,740
hurry up.

167
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,180
Don’t keep him waiting alone.

168
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,860
OK. I got it.

169
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,580
Bai.

170
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,500
I’ve downloaded some…

171
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,900
Bai.

172
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,220
Bai.

173
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,300
These pictures were taken
when I was a child.

174
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,460
So ugly. Don’t look at that.

175
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,980
How old were you?

176
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,700
That

177
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,980
might be taken when I was 5 years old.

178
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,660
What about that?

179
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,380
This?

180
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,460
In Grade Six.

181
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,660
I was attending a dancing competition.

182
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,660
Don’t look at those. I was so fat.

183
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,020
Ugly. Don’t look again.

184
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,420
Sit down.

185
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,180
I downloaded some movies yesterday.

186
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,220
Which one do you wanna watch?

187
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,020
Wu Bai. Wu Bai. Wu Bai.

188
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,780
-Isn’t this my video?
-Wu Bai. Wu Bai.

189
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,820
You’re the rival of SP.

190
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,580
I need to watch your performance
in the competition.

191
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,860
Besides that,

192
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,620
I also have to analyze your strategy.

193
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,020
What’s more,

194
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,420
I gotta hear how the narrator

195
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,940
analyzed your performance.

196
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,860
She is one of your loyal fans.

197
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,100
She did that well.

198
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,060
Let me play for you.

199
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,820
(Mecha)
Since Wu Bai became the King of Rookies

200
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,220
(Mecha)
in the AMC,

201
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,100
I’ve been watching his performance.

202
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,900
If the contestants can be divided
into genius and the intelligent,

203
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,860
he, like Han Shangyan,

204
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,500
is a born-to-be pro-robot-operator.

205
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,020
What’s most precious is that

206
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,740
he has always required himself

207
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,940
with the standards of pro athletes

208
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,220
and never bragged

209
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,740
or looked down on his rivals.

210
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,020
He spares no efforts
to every single competition he attended.

211
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,820
That’s the highest respect
to one’s rivals,

212
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,380
and his professionalism.

213
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,700
So, I think the competition of Wu Bai…

214
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,220
What do you think? Say something.

215
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,580
Why’re you looking at me?

216
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,940
I’m happy.

217
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,940
I’m happy to see something about me

218
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,940
in your computer.

219
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,700
Right. This is the

220
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,660
capable and handsome contestant

221
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,860
who has obtained uncountable fans

222
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,380
in the robot combat competitions.

223
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,500
By the way,

224
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,620
where’s your laptop?

225
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,540
Other than my videos,

226
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,500
do you keep any other

227
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,420
excellent female contestants’ videos

228
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,980
in your laptop?

229
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,420
None.

230
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,500
You got excellent grades
in western countries,

231
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,260
haven’t you ever met

232
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,100
any brilliant female contestant?

233
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,820
I have but I never care.

234
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,860
All these years,

235
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,900
except for me,

236
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,380
have you ever fallen in love
with somebody else?

237
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,100
I have when I was a child.

238
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,980
When you were a child?

239
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,460
How old were you?

240
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,140
Middle school?

241
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,740
High school?

242
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,820
What does she look like?

243
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,340
Tell me more.

244
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,660
You wanna see her picture?

245
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,420
You even kept her picture now?

246
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,460
I have it in my phone.

247
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,300
Let me show you.

248
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,660
You even kept her picture till now?

249
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,020
Take a look.

250
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,940
I don’t wanna see it.
You enjoy yourself.

251
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,140
I don’t wanna see her, Bai.

252
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,660
She’s the one.

253
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,660
When I didn’t know

254
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,540
what love means,

255
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,340
I fell in love
with the girl named Ai Qing.

256
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,180
Ai Qing.

257
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,820
Well…

258
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,500
What’s wrong,

259
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,300
Dad?

260
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,140
Well,

261
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,980
I forgot to buy the cold dishes.

262
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,140
Why don’t you go and buy some?

263
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,500
Don’t forget
the Couple’s Sliced Beef in Chili Sauce,

264
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,220
your favorite.

265
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,380
Gotcha.

266
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
Let’s go.

267
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,180
Come with me.

268
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,980
OK.

269
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,180
Let’s go.

270
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,140
We’re leaving, Dad.

271
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,660
Thank you. Thank you.

272
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,260
Paid, Ma’am.

273
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Go.

274
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,780
Here you are. 31 yuan, please.

275
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,260
Thank you, Ma’am.

276
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,420
Paid, Ma’am.

277
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,460
-Goodbye, Ma’am.
-Your boyfriend looks so handsome.

278
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,820
Thank you, Ma’am.

279
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,580
-Bye. Bye.
-Bye.

280
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,020
Fried Pie.

281
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,340
That’s the specialty of Shanghai.
Have you ever tried that?

282
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,340
Mr. Li.

283
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,180
-Qing.
-I want two.

284
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,620
It’s sold out.

285
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,980
Sold out today. Nothing left.

286
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,020
Sold out?

287
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,900
Next time, you could come earlier.

288
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,140
I’ll reserve some for you.

289
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,660
Thank you, Mr. Li.

290
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,860
What a pity.

291
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,300
I wanted to eat that for a while

292
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,940
and I want you to taste it.

293
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,180
We’re leaving then, Mr. Li.

294
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,900
OK. See you.

295
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,660
See you.

296
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,100
Let’s go there and see.

297
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,900
I came here with my father all the time
when I was a child.

298
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,620
He didn’t have an ideal salary.

299
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,300
But he still spared part of it
to buy me Couple’s Sliced Beef.

300
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
That’s the shop right there.

301
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,740
Ma’am.

302
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,540
Ai Qing.

303
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,260
It’s been a long time, Ma’am.

304
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,420
Yeah.

305
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,020
What do you want today?

306
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,140
Half kilo of pig ears,

307
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,620
and the Couple’s Sliced Beef.

308
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,620
Put more chilies today.

309
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,380
OK.

310
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,020
Is he your boyfriend?

311
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,180
Charming.

312
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,060
This is the pig ears we just made,

313
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,660
try some.

314
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,980
Give him some.

315
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,140
-Thank you, Ma’am.
-Have a try.

316
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,980
I liked this stall when I was young.

317
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,500
Have a try of this.

318
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,260
What do you think?

319
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,540
Good?

320
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,620
Absolutely.

321
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,420
You try some.

322
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,980
Old flavor still.

323
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,100
Try this one.

324
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,180
I like vegetables.

325
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,500
Besides, little cabbage is good
for our health

326
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,540
and tastes fresher.

327
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,740
(There’s a sweet couple behind you.)
It’s green and healthy.

328
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,300
(Xiao Manzu followed you.)
And this…

329
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,620
(The boy is so handsome.)
The little cabbage they used

330
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,300
-is very healthy and cheap.
-I loved it when I was a child.

331
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
(Film the couple behind you, come on!)
I love to eat the meat here.

332
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,940
This is my favorite.

333
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,180
So I suggest you buy this.

334
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,540
Is this the way to your school?

335
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,100
Actually, there’s another short cut.

336
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,980
But the landscape here
is more attractive,

337
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,420
let alone it’s way cooler
to take this way in summer.

338
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,500
So it became

339
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,420
my only way to school.

340
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,260
Especially for there,

341
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,740
isn’t that beautiful?

342
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,180
Yeah.

343
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,740
Next time,

344
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,220
I can show you around of my school.

345
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,380
Good idea.

346
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,740
Let’s go home.

347
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,940
My father is waiting for us.

348
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,100
The Fellows are too difficult to pass.

349
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,380
Got stuck?

350
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,380
Yeah. I got stuck for 3 days.

351
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,540
Let me try.

352
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,860
How long

353
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,180
can we take the rest?

354
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,380
Who knows?

355
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,860
What?

356
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,420
Wu Bai and Ai Qing are
on the most searched hashtags.

357
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,300
Look.

358
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,860
What’s going on?

359
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,940
(OMG! The unveiled underground love.)

360
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,260
What’re you talking about?

361
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,940
What?

362
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,620
What the hell is that underground love?

363
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,780
What the hell are they talking about?

364
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,100
What crap are they talking
about Ai Qing?

365
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,300
I’m gonna strike back.

366
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,300
Me too.

367
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,100
Only bachelors like us

368
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,620
got time

369
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,620
to work out after work.

370
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,620
You bet.

371
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,740
I’m a single man

372
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,420
with a daughter.

373
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,180
What’re you complaining about?

374
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,540
Who is not single in our team?

375
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,140
Regarding to this,

376
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,740
we need to have a conversation.

377
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,780
Look at you,

378
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,900
a 6-feet man

379
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,660
who is both tall and good looking.

380
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,620
How come you can’t find a girlfriend?

381
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,540
Then, I gotta ask

382
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
you, my boss,

383
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,620
why did you put so much

384
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,420
pressure on me

385
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,860
so that I don’t have time

386
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,300
to date girls?

387
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,380
You can’t blame it to your employer.

388
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,300
So am I the one to blame?

389
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,460
Guys,

390
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,540
we got trouble.

391
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,540
Calm down. Calm down.

392
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,180
Wu Bai and Ai Qing appeared in the video

393
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,260
of an Internet Celebrity.

394
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,620
His followers took the screenshot
and posted it in Weibo.

395
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,540
It has over ten thousand reviews

396
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,140
within half an hour.

397
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,660
Yiwen and Lin Yin

398
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,020
have had an argument with netizens.

399
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,300
(OMG! The unveiled underground love.)
What’s wrong with the two of them?

400
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,780
Are we being hit?

401
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,180
They had

402
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,860
dated secretly for a while.

403
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,980
What?

404
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,540
Date?

405
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,260
No way.

406
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,900
Wu Bai? Ai Qing?

407
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,620
Enough.

408
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,020
I’ll try to figure out a way
to solve it.

409
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,340
Did you know that?

410
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,460
Ou Qiang,

411
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,260
where’re Fu Yiwen and Lin Yin?

412
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,380
They’re in the canteen.

413
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,900
Tell them to wait in my office.

414
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,780
OK.

415
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,660
Slide,

416
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,620
inform all the team members

417
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,900
to come back before tomorrow morning.

418
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,500
What should we do?

419
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,500
We can’t post or respond to

420
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,660
any message on the internet and forums

421
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,540
until I figured it out.

422
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
I’m upset.

423
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,620
You’re elder sister of Ai Qing.

424
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,420
Why could Wu Bai get invited

425
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,620
by your father to have dinner together,

426
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,980
but I have to eat instant noodles here?

427
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,900
It’s totally unfair.

428
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,020
You envied Wu Bai?

429
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,220
OK, when I finished business trip,

430
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,260
I’ll take you home to visit my father,

431
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,140
OK?

432
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,020
Deal?

433
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,900
You have my word. That’s it.

434
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,700
See you.

435
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Why did Captain have dinner

436
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,140
with your father-in-law?

437
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,420
You don’t have to know that, kiddo.

438
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,140
Did you see what happened
on the internet?

439
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,380
Come on. We got trouble.

440
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,020
What’s the big deal? Don’t make a fuss.

441
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,300
Wu Bai and Ai Qing were filmed together.

442
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,260
What’s the big deal?

443
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,540
Fans were misguided by the consensus

444
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,660
and get mad at them.

445
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,740
Does consensus have anything to do

446
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,020
with Wu Bai and Ai Qing?

447
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,740
Are you an idiot?

448
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,300
(Isn’t she the ex-girlfriend of Solo?)
They were filmed while dating.

449
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,420
Dating, having a romantic relationship,
romantic love,

450
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,380
can you understand what I mean now?

451
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,060
Ai Qing is Captain’s girlfriend?

452
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,060
They’re dating,

453
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,620
and having a romantic relationship?

454
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,380
So, when I brought water to Captain,

455
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,740
he was just gonna express his affection
to Ai Qing?

456
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,820
And the reason

457
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,100
why you dragged me around the mall

458
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,780
was to cover for them.

459
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,140
Obviously, you’re not that silly.

460
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,660
-Dude.
-Come on.

461
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,500
Stop talking nonsense.

462
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,460
Our top priority now is to find Wu Bai.

463
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,820
Contact him, now.

464
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,980
How come I didn’t find that?

465
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,260
Yiwen, let go of it.

466
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,060
I can’t. I can’t give a break on this.

467
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,380
I gotta do something for them.

468
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,220
Well,

469
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,900
you can’t let go even after scolding?

470
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,780
If Ou Qiang didn’t stop me,

471
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,300
I’ll scold them to death.

472
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,340
Enough.

473
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,900
Did you forget the rules of SP?

474
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,740
Do you wanna write the rules
for 20 times again?

475
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,180
Boss,

476
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,060
they’re talking dirty

477
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,940
and they even humiliated you.

478
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,660
What did they talk about him?

479
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,500
Anyway,

480
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,580
it is

481
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,740
humiliating.

482
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,100
You can’t imagine

483
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,540
how devil those trollers are.

484
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,700
And those gossip followers?

485
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,300
You can’t understand
what the hell they’re thinking.

486
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,380
But you two are athletes in service.

487
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,260
You are representing SP.

488
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,900
I hope you’ll remember that.

489
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,100
I…

490
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,740
We know we were wrong.

491
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,780
Lin Yin,

492
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,660
why did you take his blame?

493
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,380
I knew him.

494
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,940
He just doesn’t wanna admit.

495
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,420
But actually,

496
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,500
he feels guilty now.

497
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,060
I don’t feel guilty.
You don’t have to help me on this.

498
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,220
He takes you as his brother.

499
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,740
He definitely will speak for you.

500
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,940
Boss.

501
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,060
Here you come.

502
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,660
As everyone is here,
let me tell you something.

503
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,940
SP has never forbidden our members

504
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,380
to date someone.

505
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,020
You gotta be clear of that.

506
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,380
So don’t get your coach wrong.

507
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,660
Absolutely not.

508
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,300
I’m not that stupid.

509
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,660
But because

510
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,740
her boyfriend is the Captain of K&K.

511
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,900
That’s a special situation.

512
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,660
So we’ll discuss how to deal
with the emergency

513
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,580
with the senior executives of SP China.

514
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,020
Right.

515
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,740
The result will come out tonight.

516
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,580
I’ll hand over this to the club.

517
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,900
Before the AMC,

518
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,100
all members of Team I are inaccessible
to the internet.

519
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,540
All activities are cancelled.

520
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,820
None of you can be interviewed.

521
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,780
Is that clear?

522
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,460
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

523
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,460
Clear?

524
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,540
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

525
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,420
You may leave now.

526
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,780
Go.

527
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,580
Shall we call Ai Qing

528
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,140
and ask how she is holding up?

529
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,220
You make the call.

530
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,820
It’s inappropriate for me

531
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,300
to have the conversation with her.

532
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,820
I know.

533
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,700
Here it comes.

534
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,460
It smells so good.

535
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,540
Come on. Put that in the middle.

536
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,780
Sir, it’s too much for us.

537
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,700
You don’t need to cook that much.

538
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,460
Not much at all.

539
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,620
I still got a couple of dishes later.

540
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,860
It’ll be soon.

541
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,460
Dad, you’re eccentric.

542
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,420
You didn’t cook that much for me

543
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,900
when I came alone.

544
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,980
(Baona)

545
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,500
Baona.

546
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Hi, Baona.

547
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,340
I just came out.
Are you asking me to come back?

548
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,700
No.

549
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,340
It’s uh…

550
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,060
What’s going on?

551
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,100
You and Wu Bai.

552
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,620
Excuse me. I’m taking a call.

553
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,900
What on earth is going on?

554
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,700
Someone is misguiding the reviews
on Weibo.

555
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,900
Weibo?

556
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,820
Yeah.

557
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,420
Someone has posted your pictures

558
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,780
as a couple.

559
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,900
Lin Yin and Fu Yiwen
have had an argument

560
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,460
with the netizens.

561
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,620
Baona,

562
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,780
stop them

563
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,060
and don’t let them argue.

564
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,860
Don’t worry.

565
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,140
They were stopped.

566
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,700
Now the whole team is inaccessible
to the internet

567
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,780
and won’t respond to

568
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,140
this event.

569
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,700
You and Wu Bai,

570
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,340
are the cores
of the two strongest teams.

571
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,660
Your relationship

572
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,420
makes people doubt the justice
of the competition.

573
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,980
Besides,
Bai is the most popular contestant

574
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,260
who owns the most followers.

575
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,860
At this key moment,

576
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,700
the event bursts out.

577
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,700
His followers can’t accept that
definitely.

578
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,460
I know.

579
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,940
I see your point.

580
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,100
And

581
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,300
as the senior executive of SP,

582
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,420
you were

583
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,060
in love with Solo.

584
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,500
So,

585
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,100
remember,

586
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,140
don’t respond.

587
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,180
I know.

588
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,700
I’m coming back to the club

589
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,980
and deal with it immediately.

590
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,060
Not necessary.

591
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,660
You don’t have to come back now.

592
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,620
Solo has

593
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,700
taken care of it immediately.

594
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,620
But the trouble was caused by me.

595
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,820
Besides, I’m the Coach.

596
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,340
I gotta show up.

597
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,740
Ai Qing, listen.

598
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,380
As the AMC is coming,

599
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,260
the bursting out your relationship

600
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,620
at this moment

601
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,500
does have an effect on the club.

602
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,380
Solo and I need time
to figure it out.

603
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,260
When everyone in SP makes an agreement,

604
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,900
we shall respond to the doubts
on the internet.

605
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,540
You’d better not

606
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,500
participate in the process.

607
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,540
Enough, Baona. Don’t say anything more.

608
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,980
I’m the one who caused the trouble.

609
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,940
Only I

610
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,460
can solve it.

611
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,660
OK, then.

612
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,940
See you tomorrow morning.

613
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,100
But don’t force yourself.

614
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,460
If you don’t wanna come,

615
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,140
tell me at any time.

616
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,340
OK.

617
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,100
What’s going on?

618
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,500
Do you need me to stay with you?

619
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,940
Leave me alone.

620
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,380
Relax. I’m OK.

621
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,020
OK.

622
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,900
By the way, Baona.

623
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,340
Write an email to the headquarter.

624
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,980
Narrate the event objectively.

625
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,140
You’re good at PR.

626
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,660
You may help

627
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,100
in wording.

628
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,540
You have my word.

629
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,060
See you.

630
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,620
Hey.

631
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,980
Dude. Finally, you take my call.

632
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,820
The internet is blown up, you know?

633
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,940
I guess so.

634
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,100
Some idiot

635
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,300
has posted the dating video of you guys

636
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,460
to the internet.

637
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,660
Now, everyone is doubting

638
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,820
the result of National Championships
and the Frigg Trophy.

639
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,060
It’s said that’s your black case work.

640
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,380
Yep. Not only did they attack our forum,

641
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:49,660
(Look, that is the evidence.)

642
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,820
(Someone found Wu and Ai dating.)
but the SP’s.

643
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,900
Now, the official Weibo

644
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,100
of both the two clubs are blown up.

645
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,020
Wu Bai, don’t worry.

646
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,660
I’ll bring justice

647
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,180
for you definitely.

648
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,140
Captain, let me deal with them.

649
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,540
What shall we do?

650
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,060
Tell 97 and Zhou Yi,

651
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,940
not to respond.

652
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:06,980
Just…

653
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,660
Don’t do anything before I come back.

654
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,460
Got it.

655
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,580
What would you say in this case?

656
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,100
How ridiculous!

657
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,140
Enough. Give it to me.

658
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
Give it to me.

659
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,860
Bai said he will handle this
when he comes back.

660
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,900
The lockdown of Frigg Trophy.

661
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,580
The secret affair
between Ai Qing and Wu Bai.

662
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,980
The official Weibo of both clubs
are blown up.

663
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,740
Is that the same girl
who dated my God, Solo?

664
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,540
How lucky she is!

665
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,540
Are they going to compete in the AMC?

666
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,140
How did they fall in love
with each other?

667
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,380
OMG! Seriously? I can’t believe that.

668
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,300
Is she the ex-girlfriend of Solo?

669
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,420
What a lucky dog she is!

670
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,940
The two generations of Best Captain,

671
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,940
and both the two Gods dated with her.

672
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,180
Is she related to the dissolution

673
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,500
of Solo Team?

674
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,940
Who knows the details?

675
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,140
Wu Bai is my idol.

676
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,700
I hope he won’t be effected by her.

677
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,500
Bai.

678
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,900
I know.

679
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,380
Bai.

680
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,780
Whatever you see in the internet,

681
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,300
don’t respond to that, OK?

682
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,020
Just focus on your training.

683
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,820
I’ll come back to SP tomorrow.

684
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,660
Don’t worry. Trust me.

685
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,340
I can manage it this time.

686
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,220
Ai Qing,

687
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,540
I’m way much calmer than you think.

688
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,260
Don’t worry about me.

689
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,420
Take it easy.

690
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,540
I’ll handle it well.

691
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,500
You’re not alone.

692
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,820
We’ll face it together.

693
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Alright.

694
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,900
Let’s

695
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,940
enjoy the dinner with your father first.

696
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,540
I’ll send you off when we finish.

697
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,940
OK.

698
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,460
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

699
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,180
I just know about that.

700
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,580
I was called by Coach to attend

701
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,980
the emergency meeting.

702
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,580
We just dismissed.

703
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,220
Why are there so many vagrants
on the internet?

704
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,260
Why did they have to mind
the couple’s business?

705
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,300
Take it easy.

706
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,900
We’re working on it.

707
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,860
I can’t. I gotta go home now.

708
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,980
Now? It’s too late

709
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,060
to buy the ticket.

710
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,020
You don’t understand.

711
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,900
Qing

712
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,100
isn’t good at expressing herself

713
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,940
and she always takes all the blames

714
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,580
to herself.

715
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,300
She used to date Solo.

716
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,620
When the team was dismissed,
everyone blamed that to her.

717
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,300
I worry about her.

718
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,260
I gotta go home immediately.

719
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,260
Alright. Calm down.

720
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,260
It’s not safe for you to come back now.

721
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,060
Well, let me see

722
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,260
if it’s possible to fly tomorrow.

723
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,940
You can try to ask a leave
with the Director now.

724
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,420
OK. I’ll call the Director.

725
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,900
See you.

726
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,820
Awesome.

727
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,780
Alright. Your dinner is being served.

728
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,900
Ai Qing. Ai Qing.

729
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,100
Come out. Dinner is ready.

730
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,100
Coming.

731
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,940
Bai, dinner is ready.

732
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,700
Dad.

733
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,340
You guys eat first.

734
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,460
I need to use the restroom.

735
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,100
What’s going on?

736
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,140
Did you two have a fight?

737
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,420
Girl is like this.

738
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,700
Ai Qing

739
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,340
always likes to take things to heart

740
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,700
and is a little bad-tempered.

741
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,260
But her advantage

742
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,500
is that she won’t hold the grudge.

743
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,540
I know you have a good temper.

744
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,980
Sorry to ask
but would you give her more patience?

745
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,180
What are you guys talking about?

746
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,100
Not a problem.

747
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,500
Nothing. Nothing. Come on.

748
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,020
Let’s start.

749
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,540
Would you please come to the table?

750
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,980
-Come on.
-Enjoy.

751
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,060
Here you are.

752
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,980
Thank you, Dad.

753
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,980
Sir, why did you cook so many dishes?

754
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,380
Not much.

755
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,140
Right, my little daughter?

756
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,060
Thank you for your cooking, Dad.

757
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,300
This is your first time coming home,

758
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,540
have a try of my cooking.

759
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,900
First of all, you should taste this.

760
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,380
Braised Pork in Brown Sauce.
Take a bite.

761
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,100
Here you are.

762
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,740
OK.

763
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,220
Delicious. Thank you, sir.

764
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,340
This is the best Braised Pork
I’ve ever had.

765
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,020
How sweet you are!

766
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,180
And this,

767
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,220
Sounding Oil Atop Braised Eel Shreds.

768
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,540
The rice Afield eels

769
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,980
were the best they got in the market.

770
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,100
Ai Qing, get some for Bai.

771
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,860
Don’t eat alone.

772
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:55,660
So good.

773
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,980
You like this?

774
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,580
Take a bite of this,

775
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,980
Pine Nut Mandarin Fish.

776
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,860
The dish

777
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,060
requests high level cooking arts.

778
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,940
Let me get some for you.

779
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,460
Here you are.

780
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,140
OK.

781
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,940
Bai.

782
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,700
The Couple’s Sliced Beef in Chili Sauce

783
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,780
is Qing’s favorite.

784
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,260
Come on.

785
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,180
Have some more.

786
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,780
You too.

787
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,060
Have some more. This is your favorite.

788
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,300
-She’s never tired of it.
-Dad.

789
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,460
-Leave us alone.
-Don’t.

790
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,860
I’m losing weight lately.

791
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,220
Take a bite.

792
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,100
Alright.

793
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,060
-Sir, you too.
-Come on.

794
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,220
Bon appetite.

795
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,100
Bon appetite.

796
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,580
You’re always welcomed to our home.

797
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,700
I’ll be so glad to cook for you guys.

798
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,260
I’ll take it as you’re staying with me,

799
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,380
alright?

800
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,660
Bai.

801
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,660
By the way,

802
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,340
I still got soup for you.

803
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,820
Come on. Have some soup.

804
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:12,660
Come on.

805
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,700
Sweety,

806
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,060
people get fights

807
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,900
when they’re together for a while.

808
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,020
What’s the most important is
to put up with each other.

809
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,140
Sometimes, you gotta be patient.

810
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,140
I see, Dad.

811
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,780
We didn’t fight.

812
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,980
OK. I see.

813
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,060
We appreciated your hard work

814
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,660
for cooking us so many dishes.

815
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,860
Just a piece of cake.

816
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,380
I can even make

817
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,340
Manchu Han Imperial Feast.

818
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,220
Have a good rest tonight.

819
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,380
OK.

820
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,740
Bai is here.

821
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,620
Sir,

822
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,060
we may leave now.

823
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,500
OK. Bai.

824
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,140
Thank you for visiting me

825
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,540
and bringing so many presents.

826
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,020
Would you please take her home?

827
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,260
Tell me when you arrive.

828
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,940
Good night, Dad.

829
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,340
OK.

830
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,620
Then, I may leave now.

831
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,980
-Bye.
-Bye.

832
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,740
Bai.

833
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,260
See you, sir.

834
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,340
OK. Drive safe.

835
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,380
Do you still worry about your club

836
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,020
and Slide?

837
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,340
I’m afraid that they will be effected.

838
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,140
So will you.

839
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,780
SP is a senior club.

840
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,620
The two bosses have been
in the Combat Robot Industry

841
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,300
for years.

842
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,300
That won’t be a big deal for them.

843
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,180
As for me,

844
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,580
you don’t need to concern about it.

845
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,020
Because I never care about

846
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,180
what others said.

847
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,420
But the high executives of K&K

848
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,820
must have known

849
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,620
about our relationship.

850
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,620
Han Shangyan definitely will punish you.

851
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,700
He must be pissed off

852
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,100
and try to figure a way to punish me

853
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,620
so that the event can be solved

854
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,660
and the club can focus on the AMC.

855
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,740
I’ll see.

856
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,780
You don’t have to do anything now.

857
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
Don’t worry.

858
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,420
You got me.

859
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,860
Do you feel like

860
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,220
both of us

861
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,220
are like the run-away students waiting
to be punished?

862
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,620
Do you feel like a fugitive now?

863
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,300
Now,

864
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,020
you should go get some sleep.

865
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,380
Sorry.

866
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,020
I don’t know how to comfort people.

867
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,300
What I only know is
to stay with you like this.

868
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,620
I’m all right.

869
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,340
I just worry

870
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,340
there will be people booing

871
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,820
at the competition area.

872
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,020
None of the contestants

873
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,900
would like to hear that.

874
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,220
Not only my team,

875
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,220
I also don’t wanna get you involved.

876
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,300
I know.

877
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,220
I’m sorry.

878
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,220
What for?

879
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,940
You did nothing wrong.

880
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,660
Now you are the most popular operator.

881
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,340
Your fans must think
I’m not a good match for you.

882
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,500
But they are right.

883
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,140
I’m older than you.

884
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,900
I understand that.

885
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,060
No.

886
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,660
You are my Goddess.

887
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,340
Alright.

888
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,780
Get some sleep.

889
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,020
The fragrance is beneficial
to your sleeping quality.

890
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,140
Let me turn it on for you.

891
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,660
OK.

892
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,740
Go to bed.

893
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,820
I’ll move to sofa when you fall asleep.

894
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,140
Call me if you need something.

895
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,980
Have a sweet dream.

896
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,540
Good night.

897
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,100
Good night.

898
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,940
Xiang, do me a favor.

899
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,380
Give me Han Shangyan’s number.

900
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,860
Facial Identification is working.

901
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,620
(Han Shangyan’s phone number.)

902
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,260
Hi, who’s speaking?

903
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,300
It’s me, Solo.

904
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,420
Are you calling for Ai Qing?

905
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,940
I wanna discuss with you
about the event

906
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,980
and see how to deal with it.

907
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,380
You do your part. I do my part.

908
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,300
Why do we need to discuss?

909
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,340
Of course, we need.

910
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,660
I don’t wanna see things develop

911
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,060
into the situation like years ago.

912
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,340
We were too young

913
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,220
and naive at that time

914
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,940
and made such extreme decisions,

915
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,820
which became a life-time pity.

916
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,500
Han Shangyan,

917
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,380
don’t take it personal.

918
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,380
Ai Qing is our best friend.

919
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,980
Wu Bai is your younger cousin.

920
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,700
You wish them well, right?

921
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,500
I wanna make an agreement with you.

922
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
Don’t try to object me, Han.

923
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,860
Listen to me.

924
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,100
(Wu Bai)

925
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,780
Wu Bai.

926
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,780
Are you available now?

927
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,780
I know why you called.

928
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,860
Let’s talk face to face.

929
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,820
See you later.
