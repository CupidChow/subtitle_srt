19

This time,

20
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,700
you’ll be the commentary.

21
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,380
Are you doing this for Wu Bai?

22
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,460
No, I’m not.

23
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,420
Silly girl,

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,780
you can fool others but not me.

25
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,340
I’m saying the truth, Dad.

26
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,540
Look,

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,300
your daughter

28
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,300
is not that young

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,300
and I have to change

30
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,460
to a more challenging job.

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,500
As a commentator,

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,340
people will see my face.

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,380
Isn’t it a good thing for me

34
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,700
because I’m beautiful?

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,060
And most importantly,

36
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,620
I’m tired of looking after

37
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,660
those demanding men of the SP.

38
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,220
I’m tired of worrying about them.

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,220
It’s good for me to change my job.

40
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,420
You are an ambitious woman.

41
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,020
Will the job satisfy you

42
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,380
as a common commentator?

43
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,140
Are you biased against the commentator?

44
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,140
It won’t be that easy
to be a commentary.

45
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,060
It also needs professional knowledge

46
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,420
and the ability to meet
the ever-changing game,

47
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,860
as well as eloquence.

48
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,860
I need to work hard for it.

49
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,940
All right, Dad.

50
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,420
Don’t worry about me.

51
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,340
I’m fine.

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,820
My dear,

53
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,340
I know

54
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,260
you will never complain

55
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,340
ever since you’re a child.

56
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,260
If tumbled,

57
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,060
your sister would cry terribly

58
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,260
and made everyone know that

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,740
but you,

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,820
you won’t say anything

61
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,540
even if I tried to ask you.

62
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,420
Some might think

63
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,460
you were dumb.

64
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,340
But I know that

65
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,180
once you’ve made the decision,

66
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,140
nobody can make you change your mind.

67
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,180
So,

68
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,220
I won’t say more.

69
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,660
But remember that

70
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,220
I can’t bear to see you

71
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,740
feel wronged.

72
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,780
You should think more about yourself

73
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,900
when you make a decision.

74
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
I see.

75
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
Hm...

76
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Go to bed.

77
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,140
What do you like to eat tomorrow?

78
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,300
As usual.

79
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,380
Fine.

80
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,820
-Milk.
-Milk.

81
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,860
-Bread.
-Bread.

82
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,060
-Deep-fried buns.
-Deep-fried buns.

83
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,260
Drink some milk

84
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,620
before you go to sleep.

85
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,180
Thank you, Dad.

86
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,500
Goodnight.

87
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,460
Goodnight, Dad.

88
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,540
Have a rest.

89
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,060
You, too.

90
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,100
Nice to see you.

91
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,540
Nice to see you.

92
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,820
Are you Miss Ai Qing?

93
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,900
Yes.

94
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,100
Your takeout.

95
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,660
Mine?

96
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,220
You must have made a mistake.

97
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,340
I didn’t order anything.

98
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,180
Your friend ordered this for you

99
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,820
and he requested me to be on time.

100
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,180
He even paid more money
for a timely delivery.

101
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,100
Please take a look.
It’s likely the food.

102
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,420
Food?

103
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,580
Eat it when you’re hungry at rehearsal.

104
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,100
I know who it is.

105
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,820
Thanks.

106
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,780
All right.

107
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,340
(Ai Qing)
You know me.

108
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,300
All is my favorite food.

109
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,500
(Wu Bai)
Intellectual.

110
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,300
Let me have a look.

111
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,380
I just want to learn.

112
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,020
Send it.

113
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,300
What will you eat first?

114
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,820
Isn’t the sliced meat your favorite?

115
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,780
Old trick.

116
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,020
You’re good.

117
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,940
This is helpful.

118
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,340
Let me also have a try.

119
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,100
Jing,

120
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,860
do you like some dried meat?

121
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,740
Jing,

122
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,300
do you like some dried meat?

123
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,060
What dried meat?

124
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,740
Don’t know I’m on diet?

125
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,780
Do you have some wine?

126
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,980
Yes.

127
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,140
Why not have a drink with me?

128
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,300
Just as if I’m by your side.

129
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,660
Do you get a fever?

130
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,540
Or have you been too nervous
about the AMC?

131
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,460
Why are the sisters

132
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,100
so different?

133
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,220
What are you speaking to yourself?

134
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,500
They’re sisters.

135
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,620
Why have they been
so different in love?

136
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,260
Who shall I ask?

137
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,180
How do you get along?

138
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,780
Surely,

139
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,740
I’m the rich and dictatorial man

140
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,620
and she will be like a cute rabbit.

141
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,580
Isn’t it obvious?

142
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,380
Really?

143
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,460
I thought you’re more ingratiating

144
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,260
than Wu Bai.

145
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,740
That’s not the truth.

146
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,020
I tell you

147
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,180
when we’re at home,

148
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,140
she will always be

149
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,500
at my command.

150
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,140
She’ll follow me anywhere

151
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,100
and only has the meal
when I allow her to eat.

152
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,620
She is obedient to me.

153
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,540
Really?

154
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,140
Hello Ai Jing?

155
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,500
Do you miss me?

156
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,300
No, it can’t be.

157
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,540
Surely, I’ll reply to
every message from you.

158
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,460
97...

159
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,940
He keeps talking.

160
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,140
I didn’t check my WeChat then.

161
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,060
It’s impossible.

162
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,460
I’ll reply to every message from you.

163
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,540
Promptly.

164
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,500
No.

165
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,820
Of course not.

166
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,980
I’ll always love you passionately.

167
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,780
I’m not tired. Please trust me.

168
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,820
Aren’t you a dictatorial man?

169
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,500
Please believe me.

170
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,540
Obedient...

171
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,060
A braggart.

172
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,020
Everyone is well prepared.

173
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,100
Shen Zhe knows
how to adjust his strategy

174
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,420
and works well with the team.

175
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,220
As for 97,

176
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,820
he has improved his field performance.

177
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,060
Generally,

178
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,460
everyone cooperates very well

179
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,460
with each other.

180
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,860
But...

181
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,660
But Zhou Yi’s performance

182
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,380
has been inconstant.

183
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,300
You also notice that, don’t you?

184
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,980
He is eligible,

185
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,060
but he lacks confidence.

186
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,860
The program introductions he wrote

187
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,500
are concise and logical.

188
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,140
But when the workload increases

189
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,620
as the game approaches,

190
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,860
he tends to make
stupid errors due to nervousness.

191
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,980
Yes.

192
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,260
Coach and Captain,

193
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,180
I heard what you said.

194
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,820
I won’t make you difficult.

195
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,980
Don’t worry.

196
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,100
We’ll together

197
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,620
analyze the programs for The Nobody

198
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,660
and Trash Can for the following days.

199
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,420
We’ll wipe out any unfavorable

200
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,260
factors before the AMC,

201
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,660
so the SP won’t find
any weak points in our machines.

202
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,380
I’ll fight for it.

According to the exercise report,

216
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,420
your performances
have all been improved greatly

217
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,980
which are beyond my expectation.

218
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,100
I really look forward to

219
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,500
the AMC

220
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,860
the day after tomorrow.

221
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,100
Coach, you can leave

222
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,180
the game to us.

223
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,060
We’ll have training
tomorrow morning as planned

224
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,500
and in the afternoon,
we’ll check-in at the hotel.

225
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,940
Any questions?

226
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,300
-No.
-No.

227
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,660
That’s it.

228
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,980
You can go now.

229
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,300
You go first. I have a call-in.

230
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,260
Hello.

231
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,860
It was a long time
before you answered my call.

232
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,980
We had a meeting.

233
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,260
By the way,

234
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,540
we’ll check in at the hotel tomorrow.

235
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,740
I have an on-site rehearsal
in the afternoon.

236
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,940
I’ll be with you.

237
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,740
Really?

238
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,980
That’s great.

239
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,820
Okay, see you tomorrow.

240
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,300
Okay.

241
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,180
Then I hang up.

242
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,300
I’ll treat you to some delicious food.

243
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,180
All right.

244
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,540
Think about it

245
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,620
that what you like to have.

246
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,940
I’ve been thinking about you

247
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,260
when I was not in training.

248
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,180
I didn’t have time to
think about anything else.

249
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,660
I can’t hear him clearly.

250
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,660
I can’t hear.

251
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,180
Don’t push me.

252
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,740
Don’t push. I’m going to fall.

253
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,740
No.

254
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Hm...

255
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,260
-Hm...
-I’m tired. I’ll have a rest.

256
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,380
Do you like more training?

257
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,180
Go back to your room.

258
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,860
Hurry.

259
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,860
We’re practicing.

260
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,980
-Zhou Yi, how can you sleep here?
-We should go.

261
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,660
Go back to your bed.

262
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,420
-Let’s have some more practice.
-Go.

263
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,380
The ground is cold.

264
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,860
What happened?

265
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,100
Nothing.

266
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,380
We’d better talk personally.

267
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,860
Have a rest.

268
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,980
Goodnight.

269
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,660
Goodnight.

270
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,220
(2021 Asian Robot
Fighting Championships)

271
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,860
You’ve been focusing on it.

272
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,380
Why did you come so early?

273
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,860
The rehearsal has not yet begun.

274
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,620
It’s my first time to comment
on such an important event.

275
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,180
I need to get myself well prepared.

276
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,500
You’re right.

277
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
By the way,

278
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,980
I haven’t thanked you

279
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,740
for offering me such
a good opportunity.

280
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,660
No need for thanks.

281
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,180
You are speaking too unfamiliar to me.

282
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,180
And I tell you

283
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,860
this is a business

284
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,580
where I’ll earn than lose anything.

285
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,660
Think about it.

286
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,060
I’ve invited the goddess
in the industry,

287
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,260
the Appledog,
former leader of the SP,

288
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,940
the girlfriend of
the Caption of the K&K,

289
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,140
to be the commentator.

290
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,620
With so many titles on you,

291
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,500
you’ll earn more traffic and views

292
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,300
for me.

293
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,740
I shouldn’t have

294
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,820
been nice to you.

295
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,740
Yet I like to more nice words.

296
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,300
Li Xueqian, what’s this?

297
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,500
Flashlight?

298
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,340
I’ve told you

299
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,260
please try to be artistic

300
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,860
and distinguish these things.

301
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,260
-Is it Mr. Lin, the manager?
-What does this channel look like?

302
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,020
Flashlight?

303
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,940
Who are you gonna flash on?

304
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,900
What have you been doing all day?
What’s wrong with the poster?

305
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,820
What’s wrong with it?

306
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,180
I said color should be red and green.
Not like this one.

307
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,100
One can see it through.

308
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,620
I want to see through it.

309
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,380
I see Mr. Xiang.

310
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,700
Mr. Xiang.

311
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,900
Hello, Mr. Xiang.

312
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,460
Nice to see you.
Sorry for interrupting you.

313
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,460
I...

314
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,220
Hello, Mr. Lin.

315
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,220
The Goddess!

316
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,300
You look so beautiful.

317
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,300
Lin

318
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,100
has always been strict

319
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,500
with his work.

320
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,500
But I should tell you.

321
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,220
Please.

322
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,540
The posters

323
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,220
should not be too colorful.

324
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,740
Yes.

325
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,380
And should be posted properly.

326
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:20,740
Okay.

327
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,060
Do you understand?

328
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,740
Sure, you’re right.

329
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,140
Fine.

330
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,780
You can talk.

331
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,580
I have other business to look to.

332
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,220
-Fine.
-Goodbye.

333
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,180
See you, Mr. Xiang.

334
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,020
The goddess!

335
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,180
Long time no see, Mr. Lin.

336
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,060
Long time no see.

337
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,380
What a coincidence to see you here!

338
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,020
You know that

339
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,700
I’ve always been excellent at work.

340
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,260
Mr. Xiang gave me the opportunity

341
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,060
to look after

342
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,740
all stage designs for the competition.

343
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,300
Jiayi will be responsible
for all of these.

344
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,100
And I want to correct you

345
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,700
for a small mistake.

346
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,420
Now I am

347
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,780
the Director.

348
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,140
Congratulations, Mr. Lin.

349
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,460
You’ve been promoted
in such a short time.

350
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,500
You shouldn’t call me Mr. Lin,

351
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,020
just call me Lin.

352
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,780
That’s fine.

353
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,340
You’re shiny like always

354
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,980
though we’ve seen each other
for a long time.

355
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,060
You’re still...

356
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,300
I understand.
I know what you gonna say.

357
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,260
Same to you.

358
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,780
You’ve changed your hairstyle

359
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,060
which makes you more beautiful.

360
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,700
Thank you. Thank you.

361
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,380
You know that

362
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,820
after you left,

363
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,140
I’ve recruited

364
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,420
some other assistants to help me.

365
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,060
They can’t compare even...

366
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,660
-They can’t compare even...
-Director.

367
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,500
Wait.

368
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:23,980
Wait.

369
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,500
You see that I can’t
remove my eyes from them.

370
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,900
They can’t compare with you.

371
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,860
You’d better return to your work.

372
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,340
Mr. Lin.

373
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,220
Okay.

374
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,060
Well, my goddess...

375
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,900
Hm...

376
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,660
I’ll come back to you

377
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,820
when you finish the rehearsal.

378
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,700
We can talk about the old days.

379
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,180
Feel free to tell me when you need water.

380
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,860
I’ll pay for it.

381
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,460
What if we change it to this?

382
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,620
No changes.

383
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,620
Do what Mr. Xiang orders.

384
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,420
He doesn’t change.

385
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,980
My words are the words of Mr. Xiang.

386
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,060
The auditorium.

387
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,700
Okay.

388
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,020
The auditorium.

389
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,900
How do you feel

390
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,340
about my performance today,
Mr. Weiquan?

391
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,260
Perfect.

392
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,140
You’re a genius.

393
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,420
You’re good at machines

394
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,460
and adapt yourself well
to the commentary.

395
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,700
I think someday

396
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,420
you will be the best commentator

397
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,300
in the industry.

398
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,580
You should give some advice
other than praising me.

399
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,220
I don’t have advice for you,

400
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,540
but just some small suggestions.

401
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,300
The professional players

402
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,900
often can see

403
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,060
what a commentator cannot see,

404
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,020
such as the application
of some special mechanism

405
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,940
and how to avoid them,

406
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,020
so if you can reveal these

407
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,340
to the audience,

408
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,780
I’m sure the audience will enjoy it.

409
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,820
Fine.

410
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,420
That requests you to see

411
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,820
what general commentators cannot see.

412
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,340
Okay.

413
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,500
Mr. Weiquan, thanks for your time.

414
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,380
Okay.

415
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,140
See you later.

416
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,940
Okay, thank you.

417
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,340
Goodbye.

418
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,340
Goodbye.

419
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,820
Sorry,

420
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,100
I didn’t know it would take so long,

421
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,060
or I won’t have you wait for me.

422
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,380
It’s fine.

423
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,900
I haven’t spent

424
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,740
enough time with you.

425
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,660
Ai Qing,

426
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,180
thanks.

427
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,700
For what?

428
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,100
Thank you for everything you did for me.

429
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,820
I can’t change your mind.

430
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,860
But I’ll keep in mind

431
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,540
our dream.

432
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,700
I’ll lead my team to win

433
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,460
the championship for our country.

434
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,780
All right. No worries, Mr. Xiang.

435
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,100
I’ve asked them to finish the job

436
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,180
-as you require.
-Run.

437
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,140
Lin Shan likes to talk with me.
We must not...

438
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,380
Stop there.

439
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,940
All right.

440
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,260
Now you can move, my goddess!

441
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,580
Mr. Lin.

442
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,980
You’re here, too, the genius.

443
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,020
What brings you...?

444
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,140
I’ve come to pick up my girlfriend.

445
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,380
How sweet it is to be your girlfriend!

446
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,100
But,

447
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,700
I need to correct you
for a small mistake

448
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,620
that I was no longer the manager.

449
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,460
I’ve been promoted.

450
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,860
I’d appreciate your help.

451
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,860
Well, my goddess,

452
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,100
haven’t we agreed

453
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,620
to talk about the old days?

454
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,660
Yet I run into you here

455
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,740
just before I go to find you.

456
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Do you know what this means?

457
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,260
This means we’re

458
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,780
destined to meet.

459
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,900
By the way,

460
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,020
I went to a teenager training camp.

461
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,940
The children were missing you.

462
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,620
When they knew that we were friends,

463
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,380
they said, “Mr. Lin,

464
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,460
you must tell Miss Ai Qing that...”

465
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,580
He has a sore throat.

466
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,220
And I said...

467
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Mr. Lin,

468
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,340
please relay my words to them

469
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,500
that I’ve been busy recently,

470
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,420
and I’ll visit them

471
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,820
when I have time.

472
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,420
Sure.

473
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,060
That’s what I was gonna say.

474
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,700
And they...

475
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,420
Have some water...

476
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,700
And they said…

477
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,900
Hey, why you just stand here?

478
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,780
Aren’t you to pick your girlfriend up?

479
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,380
You shouldn’t keep her waiting.

480
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,900
Hurry and go.

481
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,740
Can we leave?

482
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,500
Wait.

483
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,260
I know you’re good friends.

484
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,980
But it’s not suitable

485
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,340
in the public.

486
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,580
What are you doing?

487
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,260
Anyway,

488
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,660
I’m a senior of you.

489
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,540
What are you doing?

490
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,700
Let me tell you...

491
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Go ahead.

492
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,100
She

493
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,780
is my girlfriend.

494
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,220
You should have told me early.

495
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,540
I always think that

496
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,580
you are the best match.

497
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,940
I was sad when I heard you say

498
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,540
you already had a girlfriend.

499
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,380
Genius and Goddess!

500
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,300
Love lasts forever!

501
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,340
I wish you harmony.

502
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,540
Do invite me to your wedding.

503
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,020
Hello.

504
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,940
Are you jealous?

505
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Am I?

506
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,140
Wasn’t you?

507
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,660
No.

508
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,980
You’re jealous.

509
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,620
We’d better head back right now.

510
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,180
I still have a pre-battle mobilization.

511
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,620
You shouldn’t take it seriously.

512
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,820
Lin Shan is always like that.

513
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,820
Let’s go.

514
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,580
I think we should implement

515
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,580
Plan A tomorrow.

516
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,660
And we have a plan

517
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,100
to counter the other side’s

518
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,220
particular tactics.

519
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
Wu Bai,

520
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,660
we’ve made a preliminary plan

521
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,020
for tomorrow’s battle.

522
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,340
I’ll give it for your review
after we finish.

523
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,220
Captain, the takeout has arrived.

524
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,740
I’ve asked Yin to send some
to Miss Ai Qing.

525
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,140
I’ll give you yours.

526
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,060
No need.

527
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,260
Sit, please.

528
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,500
I’m not an eloquent speaker.

529
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,380
I know nothing except for the training.

530
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,740
The AMC is soon to kick off.

531
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,380
I have some more words for you.

532
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,940
We are not like the SP.

533
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,900
We’re just a branch
newly established in China.

534
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,220
We can’t match the SP

535
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,660
in terms of the resources
or internal environment.

536
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,060
We won’t care.

537
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,620
Let me say.

538
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,420
So we’ve been through hardships

539
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,940
to have the opportunity to

540
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,980
fight for the championship

541
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,580
against them in the AMC

542
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,540
when we had lost to them

543
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,740
in the national game.

544
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
I need to thank you

545
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,940
for all supports you’ve shown to me

546
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,820
as the Captain of the team.

547
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,220
You shouldn’t thank us.

548
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,140
No, Captain,

549
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,220
it’s our honor to be here

550
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,420
and fight together with you.

551
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,300
Yep.

552
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,860
Robot fighting is teamwork.

553
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,260
Without you,

554
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
I won’t have achieved all of these

555
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,260
by myself alone even though
I’m a good player,

556
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,340
nor can I fight to tomorrow’s game.

557
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,380
It’s because of your contributions

558
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,420
that the K&K could earn its name.

559
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,220
No more sentiments.

560
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,180
Fight for tomorrow.

561
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,620
Fight!

562
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,900
Fight!

563
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,780
-K&K!
-K&K!

564
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,300
Captain, you’d better eat something

565
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,060
so you can have the strength
to cheer for us.

Fighting Championships)

567
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:12,700
Hello,

568
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,460
ladies and gentlemen,

569
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,980
welcome to the live broadcast of

570
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,020
the Asian Robot Fighting Championships.

571
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,860
As you see,

572
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,980
the robot clubs SP and K&K

573
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,500
from China

574
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,820
have made their way to the finals,

575
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,060
(Asian Robot Fighting Championships)
which also demonstrates

576
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,900
China’s steady process
to make robot fighting

577
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,460
(Entrance)
professional, popular, and profitable.

578
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,780
(2021 ARCT)
And under the national

579
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,620
technology development strategy,
we believe that the robot fighting

580
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,460
will develop rapidly in China.

581
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,260
Let’s wish the SP and K&K

582
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,980
bring their best to the game

583
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,580
to catch the world’s attention

584
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,780
on behalf of and earn the honor for

585
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,300
China and Asia.

586
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Let’s get in.

587
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,660
No, we should wait for them.

588
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:54,340
-K&K!
-K&K!

589
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,740
Try your best.

590
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,780
I won’t show any mercy to you.

591
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,140
Don’t worry.

592
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,140
You won’t have the chance to win.

593
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,380
See how you will be

594
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,420
defeated by your brothers.

595
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,260
You can’t think of

596
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,060
any new language

597
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,980
instead of the same nonsense.

598
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,980
You won’t go to the field, will you?

599
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,340
No, I won’t,

600
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,700
but I believe my brothers

601
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,820
can beat you up easily.

602
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,500
Lin Yin, go.

603
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,580
Like last time, we will...

604
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,820
We'll defeat you.

605
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,340
You’re to lose.

606
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,340
All right. No more of it.

607
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,100
You’re a captain now.

608
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,420
Don’t make squabble
at our encounter here.

609
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,100
Wu Bai,

610
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,700
come on!

611
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,540
The championship

612
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,060
belongs to China.

613
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,340
(Exit)

614
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,780
Under the circumstance,

615
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,580
the most important thing is...

616
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,980
Your first commentary.

617
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,100
Are you nervous?

618
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,700
To be honest,

619
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,220
a little.

620
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,980
I’m not nervous.

621
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,820
Because I know

622
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,660
we’ll win.

623
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,180
How can you be so sure?

624
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,620
You know the SP

625
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,820
has made the decisive plan.

626
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,460
A strategy is useless

627
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,660
when faced with a formidable enemy.

628
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,420
Don’t speak too soon.

629
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,020
You won’t know who will win.

630
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,540
It must be the K&K!

631
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,860
Bai, do you know that

632
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,060
if you want to know
how strong a man could be,

633
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,420
the easiest way is to be his opponent?

634
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,900
Miss Ai Qing,

635
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,660
are you satisfied with

636
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,940
the man you face?

637
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,060
I’m honored to have you
as my opponent

638
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,060
on the way to win the championship.

639
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,100
My honor, too.

640
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,220
Why do you wear a cap?

641
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,900
Because I hope

642
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,700
in every competition with you
as the commentator,

643
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,900
I’d have the opportunity
to have you crown me.

that in the first round,

the battle between The Nobody
and the Beastmaster

Yes,

662
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,660
so far,

663
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,580
the K&K is more likely to win.

664
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,460
Well done, Wu Bai!

665
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,060
Wu Bai wins the

666
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,180
first round.

667
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,700
The K&K Team

leads 1:0

669
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,020
and gains the edge

670
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,500
in the finals.

673
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,700
It was my fault.

674
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,420
I lost it.

675
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,540
You’ve successfully penetrated

676
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,940
the steel plate and destroyed

677
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,660
The Nobody’s chip.

678
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
Don’t be upset.

679
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,820
We’ll win the next round.

680
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,700
It’s fine.

681
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,820
The second round will decide.

682
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,900
Come on!

683
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,580
How is it going?

684
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,140
The circuit board has broken up

685
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,940
and I need to
rewrite the stability program.

686
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,580
The inner damage to the mecha

687
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,420
is worse than I thought.

688
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,540
Never mind,

689
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
I can handle this.

690
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,620
Believe me.

691
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,660
(Commentator’s Seat)

692
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,220
-Wu Bai!
-Wu Bai!

693
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,020
This may be a horrible fight.

694
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,300
Look at Lin Yin.

695
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,820
His eyes are like killing someone.

696
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,460
The Beastmaster is entwined
with The Nobody.

697
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,340
The Beastmaster

698
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,420
keeps hitting at The Nobody.

699
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,860
Though The Nobody
secured the first round,

700
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,060
its steel plate was penetrated

701
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,380
and got the chip damaged.

702
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,340
There was very limited time

703
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,140
for them to re-program.

704
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,180
It must be an arduous task.

705
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,900
It may leave some bug

706
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,420
when writing a program
in such a short period.

707
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,700
The Beastmaster’s movements!

708
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,940
It must be a strategy of the SP.

709
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,820
Are they again playing

710
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,100
Tian Ji’s horse racing strategy?

711
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,340
Try it again.

712
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,820
Again.

713
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,820
Again.

714
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
Continue.

715
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,500
Captain,

716
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,140
I’ve tried seven times.

717
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,940
I think I must lack the talent

718
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,180
for doing this.

719
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,300
Success may come even without talent.

720
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,020
You need to learn the experience

721
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,660
from every failure.

722
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,620
If you fail seven times,

723
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,140
try the eighth, the ninth, the tenth...

724
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,220
You will succeed.

725
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,780
Yet The Nobody

726
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,380
seems unaffected

727
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,940
by the attacks.

728
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,620
The Beastmaster again

729
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,420
launches an attack on The Nobody.

730
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,140
Missed.

731
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,660
Landed on the pillar.

732
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,300
The Nobody goes

733
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
up to the Beastmaster,

734
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,340
(The Nobody)

735
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,740
and tries to push it out of the field.

736
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,780
(The Nobody)

737
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,100
A shoot-off!

738
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,820
Game over.

739
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,380
Wu Bai scores one point.

740
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,300
The K&K wins 2:1 to be the champion

741
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,140
of this year’s AMC.

742
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,820
Yes.

743
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,180
We’ve witnessed

744
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,220
a wonderful game.

745
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,900
Again, congratulations

746
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,820
to the K&K!

747
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,140
They win the championship trophy

748
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,140
at their debut of the AMC.

749
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:55,700

769
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,420
Congratulations to the K&K Team.

770
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,620
They’ve won the AMC.

771
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,100
As a domestic team founded

772
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,900
less than a year,

773
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
it’s incredible for them

774
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,420
to have successively won

775
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,620
the second place
of the national championships

776
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,020
and the first place of the AMC.

777
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,900
Wu Bai,

778
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,500
do you like to say something?

779
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,220
From today,

780
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,420
the K&K will be a team of no weakness.

781
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,620
We’ll prove to the world
at the world cup

782
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,340
that we’re the best team on the planet.

783
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,220
We’re the best!

784
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:08,020
-K&K! K&K! K&K!
-K&K! K&K! K&K!

00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,820
We’re the best!

786
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,020
The championship

787
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,620
-belongs to China.
-Belongs to China.

788
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,740
Champion!

789
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,500
Again, congratulations to the K&K

790
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,020
for winning the AMC.

791
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,100
Congratulations.

792

-K&K! K&K! K&K!

793
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,860
After a short period,

794
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,140
we’ll reveal

795
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,860
the winner of the year’s MVP.

796
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,860
He’s on the top

797
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,540
of the leading competitors

798
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,460
and has never been surpassed.

799
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,500
In this season,

800
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,540
he’s also won the Frigg Trophy.

801
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,860
Let’s give a big round of applause for

802
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,340
the year’s MVP, Wu Bai.

803
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,260

the leading player of
the Solo Team ten years ago,

807
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,260
and the most suitable person

808
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,940

to this year’s MVP.

Wu Bai,

856
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,180
anything to say for the moment?

857
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,500
I should thank everyone

858
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,100
and the organizing committee.

859
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,780
Many of you may not know

860
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,460
that why I call myself “DT”.

861
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,260
I’ll use this opportunity

862
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,980
to tell you

863
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,100
and to tell her

864
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,140
that “DT”

865
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,220
means “Appledog’s Times”.

00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,460
I think

892
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,740
the most important is his name.

893
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,140
He never told us

894
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,340
his name was concerned with Ai Qing.

895
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,500
No, he never mentioned it.

896
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:32,940
No.

897
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,500
That is so sweet.

898
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,420
I thought his name

899
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,820
referred to us.

900
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,140
-It must be your daydream.
-That’s impossible.

901
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,340
Xiaomi.

902
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,100
Xiaomi, where is the Captain?

903
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,500
He’s left.

904
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,180
Where did he go?

905
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,060
Don’t ask too much.

906
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,900
Well.

907
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,180
Pack up your things.

908
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,740
We’re gonna celebrate it.

909
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,340
Okay.

910
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,660
Let’s go.

911
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,820
Hurry and get your things packed.

912
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,220
Nice to see you.

913
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,900
Crab and shrimp noodles for you.

914
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,900
-Thank you.
-Here.

915
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,060

916
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:13,980
Thanks.

917
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,660
I’ll show you how to eat.

918
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,820
Mix them first.

919
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,700
Okay. Taste it.

920
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,380
I was to take you here

921
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,980
even before the championships.

922
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,820
Let me try.

923
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,460
How is it?

924
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,380
Good.

925
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,380
Good?

926
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,660
Have more if you like it.

927
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,260
So as you.

928
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,660
Bai,

929
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,020
you should inform me in advance

930
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,060
next time you want to

931
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,380
tell me you love me in public.

932
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,660
I was crying terribly then.

933
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,100
I must look ugly.

934
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,140
My makeup was worn out.

935
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,900
I’ll keep that in mind next time.

936
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,980
Will you do that again?

937
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,980
Joking.

938
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,220

939
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,500
No.

940
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,660
Please don’t.

941
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,500
Don’t propose to me for now.

942
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:41,900
My God.

943
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,180
I just put on a casual dress.

944
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,740
I didn’t have a shower
after I got out of the stadium.

945
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,860
I beg you do not
propose to me for now.

946
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,380
Please don’t.
