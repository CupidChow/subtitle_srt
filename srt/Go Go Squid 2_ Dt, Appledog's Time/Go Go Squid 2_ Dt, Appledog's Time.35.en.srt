Slide.

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,480
What made you so late?

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,730
Come on.

23
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,440
Where are the others?

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,800
Why are only three of you here?

25
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,290
They can’t drink.

26
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,010
Where is Ai Qing?

27
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,290
She can’t come for some business.

28
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,080
But she asked me to take care of you.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,400
Take care of me?

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,800
Why?

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,160
Losing a game?

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,520
It is no big deal.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,050
Let’s say no more about it.

34
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,160
Come on.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,940
Let’s toast.

36
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,690
I can’t drink with you today.

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,720
I have a match tomorrow.

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,280
Drinking will affect the operation.

39
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,330
This will be OK, right?

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,720
Come on.

41
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,640
You reached the final. Let’s celebrate.

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,080
Thank you, Slide.

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,720
Listen guys.

44
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,210
Just don’t be nervous tomorrow
on your match with Naya.

45
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,000
I used to serve at Naya.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,260
They only knew how to be rude

47
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,610
but nothing about skills.

48
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,920
They even can’t reach half of you.

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,160
Trust me.

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,090
Take it easy. Defeat them.

51
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,920
No worry.

52
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,500
Championship’s gonna belong
to our Chinese.

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,560
We will try our best.

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,610
Sure.

55
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,210
Try this.

56
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,330
I ordered some craft beer for you.

57
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,370
At a great cost.

58
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,210
Did you?

59
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,450
Try it.

60
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,080
It’s really nice. Wu Bai.

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,060
You may…

62
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,610
Oh, you can’t take any. I will take it.

63
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,560
Slow down. Don’t…

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,730
It’s really nice to drink.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,450
Hey you, it’s liquor, not water.

66
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,280
Slide.

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,570
It’s nice to drink. Please order more.

68
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,920
I’d go to the toilet.

69
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,720
I’d better help him.

70
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,620
It’s drunk off.

71
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,170
I will order some more.

72
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,440
Wait a moment.

73
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,700
So for all these things,

74
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,570
thank you for look.

75
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,610
OK. Bye-bye.

76
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,900
Bye-bye.

77
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,450
Slide is alright.

78
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,130
Don’t worry about him.

79
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,590
(Ai Qing)

80
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,920
I’ll leave it to you.

81
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,160
(Ai Qing)

82
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,110
(SOLO)

83
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,730
Is this the man, right?

84
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,680
Be polite.

85
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,730
He’s our Theory Master,

86
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,780
Slide.

87
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,380
You lost your game badly, didn't you?

88
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,540
Who is he? Hard to defeat?

89
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,450
You haven’t been in the team for long.

90
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,570
So you don’t know it.

91
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,540
He used to be the mouthy man

92
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,970
of our team,

93
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,380
speaking some impractical tactics.

94
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,730
What a pity! It’s useless in the match.

95
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,290
So he should be named as Theory Master.

96
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,620
Don’t be sharp-tongued.

97
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,570
Slide used to be our Vice Operator.

98
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,130
He liked boasting

99
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,170
and let us fail the playoff.

100
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,730
He likes killing time in bars,
and fighting,

101
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,340
which made our team

102
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,250
be in the news.

103
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,660
But after all, he’s your senior.

104
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,290
You should respect him.

105
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,060
Understand?

106
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,570
Yes, got it.

107
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,970
Slide.

108
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,660
You even couldn’t be able to

109
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
afford the game pad, could you?

110
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,140
How can you take such a heavy thing now?

111
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,170
Mind your hand.

112
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,220
Oh. I see.

113
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,060
You must obtain the compensation

114
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,540
by deception, right?

115
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,660
That’s enough.

116
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,290
Wu Bai? So what?

117
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,500
Slide joins K&K?

118
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,820
If he’s willing to join,

119
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,110
that’d be K&K’s greatest pleasure.

120
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,620
K&K lowered the standard

121
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,820
to such a low level?

122
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,850
Wu Bai, you are great!

123
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,450
He may be a burden on you.

124
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,250
Thank you for reminding.

125
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,130
See you on the game.

126
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,900
Let’s go. Let’s go.

127
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,940
I went to Germany

128
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,380
after AMC.

129
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,220
Naya Team

130
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,010
just won number one in the world.

131
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,410
I was famous at home,

132
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,290
but just a small potato

133
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,690
in their eyes.

134
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,070
At the beginning, I joined the team.

135
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,220
I told them not to rush, but

136
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,140
paying more attention to positioning.

137
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,790
Anyway, nobody listened to me.

138
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,820
None of them.

139
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,570
You know what?

140
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,220
As a result, they even didn’t enter

141
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,830
the playoff in the season I played.

142
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,390
So as a newbie,

143
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,260
I took the blame for all others.

144
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,180
Later,

145
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,250
I was in a bad mood

146
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,540
from time to time.

147
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,820
So I often went to bars.

148
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,910
One day, I met a bunch of

149
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,860
street hustlers

150
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,390
and had a fight against them.

151
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,550
It’s not your fault.

152
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,940
I have to say
I was not the only one to blame.

153
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,350
It’s because I was unlucky.

154
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,460
So they had the chance.

155
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,350
Others are not to blame.

156
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,690
I thought I can defeat Naya

157
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,100
in the World Championships.

158
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,630
But now it’s frustrated.

159
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,050
Here you are.

160
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,060
Morning.

161
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,230
Morning.

162
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,450
You look great.

163
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,980
You, too.

164
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,740
Tomorrow… Oh, no.

165
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,050
We will have the game today.

166
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,580
Aren’t you nervous?

167
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,140
It’s not easy for me to be nervous.

168
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,940
So you stayed loose

169
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,620
when you were chasing Ai Qing?

170
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,310
Here you are.

171
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,700
That...

172
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,100
I got drunk last night

173
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,860
and were talking nonsense.

174
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,110
Don’t care too much.

175
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,310
And don’t let it affect your game.

176
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,700
Slide.

177
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,190
I will

178
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,500
defeat Naya this evening.

179
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,460
I’m leaving.

180
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,230
I’ll leave, too.

181
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,910
But you just came.

182
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,940
I’m here to see you,

183
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,820
not for running.

184
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,500
We will make strategic arrangements

185
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,910
aiming at Naya in the morning.

186
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,700
In this case, we’ll have

187
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,620
site practice in the afternoon.

188
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,310
Guys, I’d say something practical.

189
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,500
After watching yesterday’s video,

190
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,460
we can see

191
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,670
Naya had a complete update

192
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,260
for his system.

193
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,790
The blade of The Cutter

194
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,580
can attack more widely.

195
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,790
Wu Bai.

196
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,670
He’s obviously aiming at you.

197
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,790
Anyway,

198
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,020
Naya is good.

199
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,760
He is in the same period

200
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,190
of Solo, right?

201
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,390
He’s played for years.

202
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,620
But he’s still that great.

203
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,260
He’s really very great.

204
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,060
It’s hard to defeat.

205
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,460
If I didn’t remember it wrong,

206
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,910
Slide used to be his teammate, right?

207
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,870
So Slide released

208
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,620
because of Naya, right?

209
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,380
I admire Slide

210
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,580
for he can return

211
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,060
after the strike.

212
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,110
We will win this game

213
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,350
as well as for Slide

214
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,590
and SP.

215
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,190
Guys.

216
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,440
Tonight, we will let them see

217
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,200
who the real world champion is.

218
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,910
Come on.

219
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,310
Why hasn’t the coach come yet?

220
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Guys.

221
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,380
I take you someone special here.

222
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,200
Ai Qing.

223
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,510
What brings you all here?

224
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,630
Yes.

225
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,670
I’d

226
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,240
say something to you.

227
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,830
RoboCup hosts

228
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,870
not only the dream of us

229
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,380
but also the hope

230
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,620
of our generation

231
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,440
in a sense.

232
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,700
It’s now

233
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,110
the great moment of K&K.

234
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,390
So we decided to

235
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,500
use the best of our abilities

236
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,750
to help you.

237
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,020
I believe

238
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,940
China will win the championship

239
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,200
with the efforts

240
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,750
of everyone.

241
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,360
We will try our best, Ai Qing.

242
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,390
Good luck!

243
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,820
Good luck!

244
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,560
I watched all your game videos.

245
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,550
Through all-night efforts last night,

246
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,150
I have a practicing plan

247
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,310
for K&K.

248
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,200
We will help you practice as the most

249
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,460
expensive practicing partner.

250
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,200
Cherish the chance, guys.

251
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,510
Let’s start, everyone.

252
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,800
Let’s begin.

253
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,550
-Let’s go.
-OK.

254
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,710
Thank you.

255
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,390
Won’t you go?

256
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,150
How time flies!

257
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,710
I still can remember the moment

258
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,350
when you went to Guangzhou

259
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,070
and asked me to join K&K.

260
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,510
It’s hard for people

261
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,630
to be naive for once in the lifetime.

262
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,590
Join K&K.

263
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,240
I will win the championship with you.

264
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,030
If I didn’t agree with you

265
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,880
and didn’t join K&K,

266
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,470
what will happen now?

267
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,920
If you didn’t join K&K,

268
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,030
you must be watching our game

269
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,510
as an audience now.

270
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,710
Are you looking down upon me?

271
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,880
Listen.

272
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,630
Even if I didn’t join K&K, I can still

273
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,710
enter the final with my strength.

274
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,880
Are you nervous?

275
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,210
Yes.

276
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,200
Very.

277
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,600
Why?

278
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,270
It’s the first time
operating the mechanism,

279
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,390
I’m afraid I can’t catch you up.

280
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,470
I'm afraid we will lose.

281
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,880
It’s not like you.

282
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,950
I don’t want to lose face

283
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,880
of armor China combat robot.

284
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,560
Take it easy.

285
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,000
We will win.

286
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,210
(RoboCup)

287
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,630
(Robot Combat World Cup)

288
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,060
(Wu Bai)

289
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,790
(RoboCup)

290
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,400
Hello, Ai Qing.

291
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,320
Hello.

292
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,030
Hello, Ai Qing.

293
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,210
Hi.

294
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,930
Bai.

295
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,600
Why you alone?

296
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,920
Where are the others?

297
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,710
In the washroom.

298
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,890
They’ll be back soon.

299
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,810
You are not nervous.

300
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,930
We still have two minutes.

301
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,330
It’s not late.

302
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,800
This is

303
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,440
the champion ring
of the national game ten years ago.

304
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,120
I’ve always

305
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,070
taken it as a lucky charm.

306
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,770
Now I will give it to you.

307
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,450
Hope it can bring you good luck.

308
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
I will win the world champion

309
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,960
and realize our dreams.

310
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,070
You can get in first.

311
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,450
I will wait for them.

312
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,250
OK.

313
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,840
Good luck.

314
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,130
I’ll get in.

315
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,600
Ai Qing.

316
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,210
Come on!

317
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,970
Dear friends, good evening.

318
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,040
The live show you are watching now

319
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,450
is the final match of

320
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,160
the annual Robot Combat World Cup.

321
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,870
I’m Wang Tao.

322
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,610
My partner for today’s commentary

323
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,360
is the top female operator at home.

324
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,640
See?

325
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
That girl will be
my granddaughter-in-law.

326
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,560
-That one.
-Everyone, good evening. I’m Ai Qing.

327
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,220
Good fortune.

328
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,100
Beautiful girl.

329
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,240
Yes.

330
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,730
She’s like a fairy.

331
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,940
Liu.

332
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,810
Liu, what are you doing?

333
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,640
It’ll start.

334
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,040
OK. I’m coming.

335
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,810
Look.

336
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,690
I don’t know what the robot is.

337
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,400
But

338
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,610
I even asked my friends to come.

339
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,210
You don’t know it but I do.

340
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,490
I will explain it for you.

341
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,520
What’s more,

342
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,280
it’s my grandson Bai’s big thing

343
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,240
of winning honor for the country.

344
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,450
You are the elder.

345
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,730
How can you have no consciousness?

346
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,280
I didn’t know it.

347
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,770
Criticize him.

348
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,100
It begins.

349
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,570
Today’s first team,

350
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,210
Naya has marched into the arena.

351
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,210
We all know Naya hasn’t ever won Wu Bai

352
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,580
in the games before.

353
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,010
Yes.

354
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,970
But it’s said Naya has updated

355
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,650
and improved The Cutter completely

356
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,810
particularly for Wu Bai’s The Nobody.

357
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,500
We can say he wants to
press Wu Bai in all round.

358
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:25,880
Yes.

359
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,460
To fight against The Nobody,

360
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,220
(The Cutter Overhead rotary robot)
The Cutter put a shovel closer to floor

361
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,160
(Nationality: Switzerland Team: NAYA Holder: NAYA)
below its rotating blade,

362
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,360
(Order: 110KG)
which makes it hard for The Nobody’s

363
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
(Unique skill: Three steel blades rotating at high speed)
ejector to insert under its body.

364
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,450
I told you last time

365
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,520
my boyfriend has a game today.

366
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,810
Be sure you will watch it.

367
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,280
It will begin soon.

368
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,520
What’s more,

369
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,690
take a look at the clothes.

370
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,210
I want to wear it to pick up

371
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,000
my boyfriend when he’s back.

372
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,490
It’s nice.

373
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,860
You will look very pretty wearing it.

374
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,360
The price is reasonable.

375
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,000
I saw it in the shopping mall last time

376
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,160
when my sister and I went shopping.

377
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,250
I tried it.

378
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,360
But I bought it on VIPs.

379
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,890
It’s inexpensive.

380
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,240
Let’s stop talking.

381
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,250
It starts now.

382
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,050
Yes.

383
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,090
It seems today’s game

384
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,610
is a hard one

385
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,980
for K&K Team.

386
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,450
According to the rules of the RoboCup,

387
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,330
players can use the mechanism.

388
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,250
(FLOATING)
As per our experience of the matches,

389
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,280
(Commentary Area)
if one can operate

390
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,520
the mechanism properly,

391
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,980
he may turn the tables

392
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,240
instantaneously.

393
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,530
-Who will gain…
-By the way,

394
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,050
who will be K&K’s first one?

395
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,580
Wu Bai of course.

396
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,090
Then he must be stressed out.

397
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,280
Sure.

398
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,610
Han Shangyan’s expectation,

399
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,130
SP’s entrustment,

400
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,500
plus the expectation of
the circle at home.

401
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,640
Everyone hopes China is the winner.

402
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,210
Yes.

403
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,460
We will win the championship.

404
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,520
Sure.

405
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,700
Good luck.

406
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,890
Come on, it’s our turn.

407
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,120
Before getting on the stage,

408
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,620
let’s make it ritualized.

409
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,090
For dreams.

410
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,290
Old-fashioned.

411
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,410
For K&K.

412
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,690
For SP.

413
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,860
For China’s robot combat.

414
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,500
For…

415
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,980
Come on.

416
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,620
One. Two.

417
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,170
K&K.

418
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:57,980
K&K. K&K. K&K.

419
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,100
Friends in the audience,

420
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,460
the game is about to begin.

421
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,410
Two players. Please get ready.

422
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,160
The players are ready.

423
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,380
The game will begin soon.

424
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,010
Three.

425
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,170
Two.

426
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,220
One.

427
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,530
The game begins.

428
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,890
It’s heated.

429
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,010
They just fight straightly.

430
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,890
Both are not afraid.

431
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,530
The Cutter turns its head.

432
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,700
It’s gaining on The Nobody.

433
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,170
Obviously we can see its side armor

434
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,340
was strengthened.

435
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,230
It doesn’t fear The Cutter’s blade.

436
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,010
Naya can foresee it.

437
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,220
It seems it knows everything

438
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,530
of The Nobody.

439
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,370
No matter where The Nobody goes,

440
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,750
The Cutter can foresee its positioning.

441
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,950
The Nobody wants to open the distance

442
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,170
but it can’t find a breakthrough.

443
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,220
It comes to nothing.

444
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,290
Naya avoided it.

445
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,770
A perfect escape.

446
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,590
Naya

447
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,530
has studied it in details.

448
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,410
It’s now

449
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:45,130
hard for Wu Bai to attack and defend.

450
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,010
Naya

451
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,010
now has such a high level?

452
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,860
It’s not about the level.

453
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,350
They made particular practice.

454
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,230
Solo.

455
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,250
Particular practice

456
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,780
can bring this kind of pressing?

457
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,540
Some foreign teams

458
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,180
begin to use AIT

459
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,770
to simulate the opponents’ operation.

460
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,940
Positioning, attacking frequency,

461
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,350
and attacking opportunity,

462
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,750
all can be estimated.

463
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,870
It’s hard for The Nobody
to tip the balance.

464
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,350
Wu Bai is coming.

465
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,980
Left. Left. Avoid.

466
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,820
Both have got strike for times.

467
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,250
The ejecting robot

468
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,460
like The Nobody

469
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,770
gains no advantage

470
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,380
in close fighting.

471
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,900
It will get a beating.

472
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,510
Ready!

473
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,260
Look.

474
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,140
The Nobody is

475
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,290
closely chased by The Cutter.

476
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,580
The columns are rising.

477
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,770
The Cutter is stopped by the mechanism.

478
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,420
The Nobody takes the chance.

479
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,900
Nice ejection.

480
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,470
The Cutter was ejected out.

481
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,370
The Nobody fought back successfully.

482
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,100
We can see The Cutter

483
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,180
is safe and sound

484
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,260
for falling directly to the ground.

485
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,500
It runs normally.

486
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,260
Oh my God!

487
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,110
They are really lucky.

488
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,660
The game will be over if it turned over.

489
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,830
Ready!

490
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,460
Press.

491
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:33,840
(SAW)

492
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,260
Naya Team is using the mechanism.

493
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,870
The electric saw is rising.

494
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,690
(The Nobody)

495
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,780
The Nobody suffers converging attack.

496
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,750
It’s now

497
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,060
surrounded by The Cutter and the gear.

498
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,290
After being attacked for times,

499
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,870
its armor has broken.

500
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,380
My God!

501
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,510
The Nobody suddenly spins rapidly.

502
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,830
Nice! It’s free now.

503
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,260
It got rid of The Cutter.

504
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,590
Nice!

505
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,420
The armor is damaged.

506
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,510
The Cutter responds quickly

507
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,880
and doesn’t let The Nobody go.

508
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,380
He wants to force you to the corner.

509
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,960
Be careful. Watch out.

510
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,380
The Nobody turns around.

511
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,180
Will it wage a fierce battle?

512
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,300
Press.

513
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,310
Naya Team uses the second mechanism.

514
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,420
He wants to burn our chassis.

515
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,230
He wants to burn our chassis.

516
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,870
Get out! Get out!

517
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,780
God! It’s the flame area.

518
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,790
The Nobody only has one way.

519
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,180
This time, it’s attacked

520
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,260
at the bottom, the weakest part.

521
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,470
Seems

522
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,870
Wu Bai should find a way to escape fast.

523
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,590
The Nobody’s bottom

524
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,180
can’t be burnt like this.

525
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,960
Wu Bai is in trouble.

526
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,950
Go to the big circle. To the big circle.

527
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,790
Wu Bai, come out. Hurry.

528
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,240
(Trash Can)

529
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,840
Wu Bai, what are you doing?

530
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Oh my God!

531
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,590
They used the way of Falling Ball.

532
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,240
The Nobody got rid of The Cutter.

533
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,830
That’s the way used in

534
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,030
the game of Shen Zhe and me.

535
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,140
Yes. Wu Bai is amazing!

536
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
The Cutter keeps chasing

537
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,360
and fighting against Wu Bai.

538
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,760
Great! Amazing!

539
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,790
Wu Bai escaped from The Cutter

540
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,590
with his flexible operation.

541
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,640
Why didn’t Wu Bai fight back?

542
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,360
We will win in this way.

543
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,430
Ready!

544
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,430
Press!

545
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,870
The columns are rising.

546
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,150
The Nobody was trapped again.

547
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,390
Re-set the chassis!

548
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,390
You are doomed!

549
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,830
He’s coming. Wu Bai.

550
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,000
Tornado resets its armor

551
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,140
with The Nobody’s attack.

552
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,480
Pianist Ai Qing

553
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,120
made another God-level operation.

554
00:28:59,310 --> 00:28:59,910
God!

555
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,120
The Nobody used great centrifugal force

556
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,550
to get rid of control

557
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,000
and it dashed against The Cutter.

558
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,240
Great!

559
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,150
Great!

560
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,790
Nice, Wu Bai!

561
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,120
That’s Ai Qing’s way, right?

562
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,760
If I remember it correctly,

563
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,790
that should be the unique skill Tornado

564
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,480
our Pianist Ai Qing used that year.

565
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,430
I didn’t

566
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,000
do it so smoothly like him.

567
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,000
Wu Bai, the armor is stuck.

568
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,880
We can see The Nobody’s right armor

569
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,680
has seriously deformed

570
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,000
by The Cutter’s continuous attack.

571
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,240
Now,

572
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,960
its armor is stuck in the tyre.

573
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,760
Yes.

574
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,310
And The Nobody’s elusion for times

575
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,070
will cause overwork of the motor.

576
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,390
Ten.

577
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,070
The judge is counting down.

578
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,960
-Can The Nobody still move?
-Nine.

579
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,070
The Nobody,

580
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,880
-the most promising winner.
-Eight.

581
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,000
Nobody can expect

582
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,840
it will fall into such a hard situation.

583
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,960
Seven.

584
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,640
It can move. It can move.

585
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Six.

586
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Five.

587
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,520
Four.

588
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,070
Three.

589
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,600
Two.

590
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,010
One.

591
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,400
It’s great!

592
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,120
The Nobody is moving.

593
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,920
The Nobody is moving.

594
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,250
Wu Bai didn’t give up.

595
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,010
Wu Bai. Wu Bai. Wu Bai.

596
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,910
Blade Point rotates again

597
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,770
by using the mechanism.

598
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,240
Yes.

599
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,970
That’s Solo’s strength.

600
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,080
Why is The Nobody close to the side?

601
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,120
It’s wrong.

602
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,480
It runs to the mace.

603
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
What will it do?

604
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,370
Watch out! Be careful!

605
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,650
Wu Bai, be careful.

606
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,370
It knocks it.

607
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,800
The Nobody knocked off

608
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,150
its armor with the mace.

609
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,400
But its ability is recovered.

610
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,960
Cutting one’s own wrist!

611
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,560
Nice. Wu Bai.

612
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,360
We can see that

613
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,800
Beastmaster is running to the catapult.

614
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,920
It will kill itself.

615
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,560
That’s the way.

616
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,660
(The Nobody)
Pressurizing.

617
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,530
It’s too incredible!

618
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Ready!

619
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,560
We can see The Nobody

620
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,890
is running to the ejection plate.

621
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,040
The plate is suddenly ejecting
at that moment.

622
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,730
Wu Bai pushed the steering yoke.

623
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,530
Nice operation.

624
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,040
Nice.

625
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,160
Wu Bai used the ejection plate

626
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,250
to finish the fatal blow to The Cutter.

627
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,490
Nice.

628
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,130
Great!

629
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,730
Good job! Wu Bai.

630
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,490
Pressurizing. SP’s unique skill.

631
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,320
That’s it.

632
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,490
Double the tuition fees.

633
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,400
Cool. That’s my idol.

634
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,160
Don’t say that.

635
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,010
It’s a way

636
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,370
we worked out together.

637
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,320
Wu Bai’s combination is amazing.

638
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,890
Let the foreigners see

639
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,610
we Chinese teams’ strength.

640
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,560
Yes.

641
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,730
Let them see

642
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,250
how powerful we Chinese teams are.

643
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,160
Sure.

644
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,530
Wu Bai. Come on.

645
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:30,490
Cheer up. Wu Bai. Cheer up.

646
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,440
The robots of both

647
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,090
are stopping in the field.

648
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,740
The Nobody and The Cutter.

649
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,380
Can they move?

650
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,650
The Nobody

651
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,920
has a large smoke in the cabinet.

652
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,010
There is little time for the game.

653
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Ten.

654
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,280
Nine.

655
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,660
Eight.

656
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,280
Move.

657
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,130
Come on!

658
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,210
Seven.

659
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,930
-Move.
-Move.

660
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,200
Six.

661
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,920
Five.

662
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,770
Four.

663
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,530
I want to build my own team,

664
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,160
starting from the very beginning,

665
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,100
till

666
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,600
we win the world champion.

667
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,570
It’s hard for people

668
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,970
to be naive for once in the lifetime.

669
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,160
Join K&K.

670
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,980
I will win the championship with you.

671
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,740
I hope we can be together

672
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,300
and work wonders in the next year.

673
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,820
A brand-new team.

674
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,890
Starting from the very beginning,

675
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,100
till the end.

676
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,740
Till we win the champion for China.

K&K. K&K. K&K.

686
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,500
Wait.

687
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,690
The Nobody shows us a sentence.

688
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,340
(The champion belongs to China.)
K&K. K&K. K&K.

689
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,050
The champion belongs to China.

690
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,920
Yes.

691
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,930
The champion belongs to China.

692
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,130
China, the champion.

693
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:53,840
Champion.
