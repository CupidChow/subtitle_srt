19
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:36,930
This...

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,250
Excuse me,

21
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,520
I didn’t mean to disrupt you.

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,160
It’s just Mr. Xiang said that

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,200
everyone back home is celebrating.

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,520
If we fail to interview you,

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,930
then there’s no need for us to go back.

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,010
We were about to interview you.

27
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,650
Can you say something briefly, Wu Bai?

28
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,610
I know you don’t like to
talk to the media.

29
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,580
It’s gonna be very fast.

30
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,720
Come! Come!

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,410
Here! Here!

32
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,130
OK.

33
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,160
Here, cameraman.

34
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,850
Dear audience,

35
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,690
now I’m at the backstage area

36
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,250
of Chicago Stadium

37
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,520
with the captain of our

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,970
champion team Wu Bai.

39
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,050
So, Wu Bai,

40
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,620
what do you want to say to your fans

41
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,410
and the audience?

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,080
Thank you.

43
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,850
Wonderful!

44
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,000
Anything else?

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,210
Thanks again, everyone!

46
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,210
What a wonderful speech!

47
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,080
Wonderful!

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,970
OK.

49
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,450
OK.

50
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,340
And now,

51
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,330
let’s listen to the K&K TEAM.

52
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:45,890
Come.

53
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,000
Come here.

54
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,690
Five energetic boys.

55
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,440
The last round

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,610
was very intense.

57
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,640
When we were watching...

58
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,210
You still remember

59
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,800
-Were you nervous?
-the AMC competition?

60
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,160
Very nervous.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,560
Of course I remember.

62
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,730
We won the championship together.

63
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,810
But now,

64
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,280
I’ve retired.

65
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,280
You made a comeback.

66
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,210
And he

67
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,260
succeeded.

68
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,140
Thank you.

69
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,490
Thank you. Thank you.

70
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,490
Let’s go.

71
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,650
Coach,

72
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,520
we performed so well today.

73
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,770
Should you reward us with something?

74
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,610
Right!

75
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,440
You have to treat us to a meal!

76
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,520
Am I right, guys?

77
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,570
Of course!

78
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,520
Right!

79
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,650
I’ve already prepared a
celebration banquet for you.

80
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,730
Come back with me
to the K&K headquarters,

81
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,810
you can eat and drink your fill!

82
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,490
Till you’re drunk!

83
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,450
I want to eat pickled fish.

84
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,490
How about we

85
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,690
slip away?

86
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,250
Order whatever you like.

87
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,330
You can order anything.

88
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,060
Great!

89
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,970
We must eat and drink our fill!

90
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,810
Am I right, guys?

91
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,490
Yes!

92
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,410
That’s for sure!

93
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,850
The celebration banquet is ready!

94
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,340
What do you want to eat?

95
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,690
I owe you nothing.

96
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,890
Stop chatting, guys.

97
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Let’s go!

98
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,700
-Go! Go!
-Let’s go!

99
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,490
Where’s Wu Bai?

100
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,730
Where’s Ai Qing?

101
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,080
I’ll give the coach a call.

102
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,000
No need.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,210
There’s no need.

104
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,810
Let’s go. Let’s go.

105
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,770
Should I

106
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,730
hold back this time?

107
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,130
You sure?

108
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,930
I won last time.

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,930
Probably not this time.

110
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,380
Let’s see.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,410
Lady first.

112
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,170
You held back

113
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,240
back in Singapore, right?

114
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,170
I didn’t.

115
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,450
Really?

116
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,900
I don’t believe you anymore.

117
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,780
After I learned what Assisting Genius
revealed about you,

118
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,170
I felt that I shouldn’t believe

119
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,620
everything you say.

120
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,960
I did pull some tricks

121
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,050
when I chased you.

122
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,900
But I really

123
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,100
did my best that time.

124
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,780
Because of your eyes?

125
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,570
After that match,

126
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,730
I received surgery.

127
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,660
And then,

128
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,130
you disappeared for three years.

129
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,170
When I was in the ward,

130
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,350
I always wanted to call you

131
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,450
and hear your voice.

132
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,500
But I knew

133
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,130
I wouldn’t be able to
promise you a happy life

134
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,290
even if I found you.

135
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,900
So I thought

136
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,940
when my eyes heal,

137
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,060
I must go look for you.

138
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,380
But what if

139
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,290
we didn’t meet...

140
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,980
What if

141
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,510
you failed to find me...

142
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,940
What if...

143
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,220
There’re no what ifs.

144
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,730
You so sure?

145
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,670
Then my eyes healed.

146
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,740
I thought

147
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,540
I should go to you

148
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,850
after I make some achievements.

149
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,620
No wonder you said

150
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,900
you wanted to win 300 competitions

151
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,950
to earn a chance to start over with me.

152
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,140
I haven’t yet told you

153
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,250
why it had to be 300 wins.

154
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,340
Why then?

155
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,690
Because Solo

156
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,700
had reaped 299 wins.

157
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,010
So I thought I must

158
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,290
win more times than him

159
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,170
to become qualified to profess my love.

160
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,220
But there were not many

161
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,830
robot fighting competitions
in our country,

162
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,130
so I forced myself to take part

163
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,620
in over 200 competitions abroad

164
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,130
before I came back.

165
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,860
People said you’re a little genius.

166
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,950
But how come I suddenly feel

167
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,410
you’re very stupid?

168
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,810
In fact, I also regret it.

169
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,310
Regret what?

170
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,540
I regret not coming back earlier

171
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,490
on that day you rejected me.

172
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,460
Now come to think of it,

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,870
if I come back earlier,

174
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,980
probably we’d have already got married.

175
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,810
Yes.

176
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,220
Rest early after you go back.

177
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,610
Good night.

178
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,430
Good night.

179
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,010
Bye.

180
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,700
See you tomorrow.

181
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,670
What’s wrong?

182
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,190
I want to stay with you.

183
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,140
What are you thinking?

184
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,230
Nothing,

185
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,250
but you.

186
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,020
Why is your heart

187
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,060
beating so fast?

188
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,220
Now you know why.

189
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,110
Did you sleep well?

190
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,310
Why are you looking at me like this?

191
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,870
I thought I couldn’t

192
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,680
take my eyes off you.

193
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,110
I haven’t washed my face yet.

194
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,110
I don’t look good now.

195
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,940
You’re always beautiful.

196
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,230
I’ve already prepared the breakfast.

197
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,190
Get up and eat.

198
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,820
You got up so early

199
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,910
to prepare this?

200
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,380
Hurry and eat.

201
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,700
You must be very hungry.

202
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Eat up.

203
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,230
Let’s eat together.

204
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,230
Eat this.

205
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,430
Yum.

206
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,120
Did you catch a cold, Bai?

207
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,380
I’m fine.

208
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,700
It’s not serious.

209
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,700
I happen

210
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,870
to have brought some cold granules.

211
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,120
I’ll mix some with water.

212
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,560
Hello, Mom.

213
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,800
Bai,

214
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,120
I watched the live broadcast yesterday.

215
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,230
I knew you were celebrating last night

216
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,070
so I didn’t dare to disrupt you.

217
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,870
How was it?

218
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,350
You won the championship.

219
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,500
Was your girlfriend happy?

220
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,020
Did you celebrate it together?

221
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,870
Yes, we did.

222
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,390
Mom,

223
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,060
I want to get married.

224
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,820
Really? You’ve decided?

225
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,760
Did she agree?

226
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,750
Great!

227
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,430
We’ll book flight tickets right away.

228
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,830
See you the day after tomorrow.

229
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,680
OK.

230
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,820
My parents will come back
the day after tomorrow.

231
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,350
The day after tomorrow?

232
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,350
I said I wanted to get married.

233
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,310
Then they decided to
come back right away.

234
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,000
Have some water.

235
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,950
It’s hot.

236
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,940
This is too fast!

237
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,110
The day after tomorrow?

238
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,380
So sudden!

239
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,020
Don’t make a fuss.

240
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,380
No.

241
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,200
I’ll ask my mom
to come to Shanghai, too.

242
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,020
You should pick another time.

243
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,110
Why would I?

244
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,270
Ai Jing is the elder sister.

245
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,470
I should meet her family first.

246
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,320
And then it’s Wu Bai's turn.

247
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,320
As his future brother-in-law,

248
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,580
I can’t fall behind.

249
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Hello, Mom.

250
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,190
Yes, we won.

251
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,880
That’s not the point.

252
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,200
The point is,

253
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,630
I’ll book you a flight ticket now.

254
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,360
You should come to Shanghai
tomorrow morning

255
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,830
and meet Ai Jing’s father.

256
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,500
It’s indeed very sudden.

257
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,760
I didn’t expect it, too.

258
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,990
Things don’t always go as we expected.

259
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,870
You two are really interesting.

260
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,060
I’m still single.

261
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,380
But you’re going to meet
your father-in-law.

262
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,460
You should

263
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,950
work hard.

264
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,030
I’d better

265
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,950
play video games.

266
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,680
Oh man!

267
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,260
Come on.

268
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,140
Why are you still playing games?

269
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,320
Pack your things.

270
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,510
Easy. We still have time.

271
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,440
Hurry. We’ll leave
after you pack your things.

272
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,030
Move!

273
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,800
Oh man!

274
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,990
Tomorrow?

275
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,150
Yes, tomorrow.

276
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,440
Shen Zhe’s mother will arrive
in the morning.

277
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,680
Wu Bai’s parents will arrive
in the afternoon.

278
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,630
Why the rush?

279
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,820
I’m not eager,

280
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,460
but Wu Bai is very eager.

281
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,630
He wants to marry my sister right away.

282
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,560
Make dinner yourselves.

283
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,950
Dad, where are you going?

284
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,700
I’ll go buy some clothes.

285
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,360
I must look very decent.

286
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,320
Dad is even more

287
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,140
nervous than us.

288
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,440
Mom, listen to me,

289
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,070
you can’t bully Ai Jing again

290
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,270
when you see her today.

291
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,880
If I can’t be with Ai Jing,

292
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,060
I’ll jump down, you see,

293
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,710
from here!

294
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,070
I know.

295
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,230
Did I treat her badly

296
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,760
in the hospital last time?

297
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,360
Let’s not talk about the last time.

298
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,030
What I want to say is

299
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,560
Ai Jing really is

300
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,360
a very, very nice girl.

301
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,440
In terms of appearance, character
educational background,

302
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,960
and socializing skills,

303
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,440
she’s indeed

304
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,350
much better than you.

305
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,870
It’s just

306
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,720
she’s a bit too old.

307
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,440
Mom, I...

308
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,990
Could you please not always say things

309
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,870
I don’t want to hear?

310
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,510
I just like it this way.

311
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,320
Ai Jing’s three years older than me.

312
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,840
It’s perfect for me.

313
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,910
It’s a blessing to have an older wife.

314
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,480
My wife is older than me.

315
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,030
She knows how to

316
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,920
handle things better than me.

317
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,210
Sir,

318
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,270
we’re like-minded.

319
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,630
You heard that?

320
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,560
Ai Jing really is very nice.

321
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,630
You see?

322
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,030
Every time she scolded me,

323
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,680
I felt very convinced

324
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,720
and very comfortable.

325
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,110
Besides,

326
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,750
she’s mature and charming, right?

327
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,720
She’s an opera actress.

328
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,390
I know.

329
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,280
Then promise me, don’t bully her today.

330
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,390
So fussy.

331
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,630
Promise me you won’t bully her.

332
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,480
Swear it.

333
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,630
Swear what?

334
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,320
I’ll feel relieved then.

335
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,720
Is this the same outfit

336
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,480
you tried on last time

337
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,270
when we went shopping?

338
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,110
Yes.

339
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,280
I bought it on Vipshop.

340
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,630
It’s cheaper than in the mall.

341
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,630
It looks

342
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,600
very good on you.

343
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,570
This is a very formal occasion.

344
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,720
Dad, you ready?

345
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,840
One second. I’m ready.

346
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,870
Coming.

347
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,920
You can’t even walk now, Dad?

348
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,880
How do I look?

349
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,150
How do you think?

350
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,030
Very handsome!

351
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,440
How about this?

352
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:56,990
Turn around.

353
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,560
Except that

354
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,200
your belly is bigger, Dad.

355
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,270
This... This...

356
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,450
Dad,

357
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,450
they’re paying a visit.

358
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,090
Why are you so nervous?

359
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,320
How can I not feel nervous?

360
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,200
I have to meet two families in one day.

361
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,320
You do know how to torture me.

362
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,450
It’s not my fault, Dad.

363
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,880
Wu Bai arranged it.

364
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
It’s not my fault either.

365
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,090
Shen Zhe didn’t want to fall behind.

366
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,750
How can you...

367
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,600
Um...

368
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,090
When will Wu Bai’s parents arrive?

369
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,390
This afternoon.

370
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,400
We’ll go to Grandpa’s place first
to meet them.

371
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,320
OK. Ai Qing,

372
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,360
I’ll leave you alone then.

373
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,870
Your sister...

374
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,510
Let’s leave right away!

375
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,960
OK, let’s go!

376
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,350
-Let’s go!
-Let’s go! Go! Go!

377
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,610
Go for it! Go for it!

378
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,150
You shouldn’t have left in such a hurry.

379
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,490
Coming!

380
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,150
What did you forget?

381
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,600
Bai?

382
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,230
Didn’t you say
you’d come this afternoon?

383
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,490
I was afraid I may be late,

384
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,810
so I came early.

385
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,450
Come on in.

386
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,800
No one’s at home.

387
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,440
My dad and sister just went out.

388
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,970
You came at the right time.

389
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,750
Hurry. Hurry.

390
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,330
Help me pick an outfit.

391
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,030
Bai, Bai,

392
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,920
help me take a look.

393
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,480
Which one looks better?

394
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,210
What type do your parents like?

395
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,730
Long sleeves, short sleeves,

396
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,990
or sleeveless?

397
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,810
Dark color, or light color?

398
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,450
You can wear whichever you like.

399
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,680
No.

400
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,680
This is my first meeting with them.

401
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,320
I have to make them feel

402
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,120
I take this meeting very seriously.

403
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,520
You remember when you
went to see my grandpa last time?

404
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,400
You also asked me
to pick clothes for you.

405
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,810
But it’s different this time.

406
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,810
This is the first time
I’m going to meet your mother.

407
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,160
I can’t let her think

408
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,640
I have a bad taste in clothes.

409
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,450
Actually,

410
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,000
they saw you long ago.

411
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,970
They saw me long ago?

412
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,280
When?

413
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,600
The walls of my room

414
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,210
are full of posters and photos of you.

415
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,850
So they knew you long ago.

416
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,240
It’s still different.

417
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,330
They haven’t seen me in the flesh.

418
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,160
Don’t worry.

419
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,490
My parents

420
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,000
grew up together.

421
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,240
They’re each other’s first love.

422
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,880
So they’re very happy

423
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,970
that I’m marrying my first love.

424
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,240
Then,

425
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
this one.

426
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,280
Be happy.

427
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,390
Dad, Mom, Grandpa.

428
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,610
They’re here.

429
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,350
Ai Qing!

430
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,160
Hurry! Come here!

431
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,640
Grandpa!

432
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,810
I finally got to see you, Ai Qing!

433
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:01,970
Hello, Auntie.

434
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,730
Good.

435
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,810
This is our future daughter-in-law.

436
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,450
Don’t be so grim.

437
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,240
Hello, Uncle.

438
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,360
Hello, Ai Qing.

439
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,400
Ai Qing,

440
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,970
come chat with me.

441
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,280
-No, no, no!
-Come!

442
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,320
Ai Qing, chat with me!

443
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,360
Hurry! Hurry!

444
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,880
I haven’t seen you for a long time.

445
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,240
Come.

446
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,520
Now,

447
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,610
you and Bai,

448
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,120
and Han Shangyan and Nian

449
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,450
can get married on the same day.

450
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,330
You have to get prepared.

451
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,640
Did Bai propose to you?

452
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,530
Bai,

453
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,520
making a proposal is very important.

454
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,290
A girl will only be

455
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,280
proposed to once in a lifetime.

456
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,690
You should do it
in the most romantic way.

457
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,770
I already did that.

458
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,000
You already...

459
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,810
Grandpa, Bai already proposed to me.

460
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,040
Then...

461
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,280
Are you satisfied?

462
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,880
Yes.

463
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,860
That’s great. That’s great.

464
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,810
This is a very important matter.

465
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,400
It’s great you’ve done it.

466
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,520
Bai,

467
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,640
I heard Shen Zhe’s parents are coming?

468
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,730
Yes.

469
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,000
They’ll have lunch
with Ai Qing’s sister.

470
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,880
Wouldn’t it seem we fall behind

471
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,370
and are not proactive this way?

472
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,890
It’s not good.

473
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,220
I don’t think so.

474
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,000
There has to be an order.

475
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,640
It’s natural that they met

476
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,000
Ai Qing’s elder sister first.

477
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,280
Then we must

478
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,520
meet each other
more often in the future.

479
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:35,970
Sure. Sure.

480
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,400
Come visit us when you have time.

481
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,850
Sure. Sure.

482
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,850
You’ll be in good health

483
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,490
if you’re in a good mood.

484
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,330
Right. Right.

485
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,520
Come to Guangzhou when you have time.

486
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,120
We can have morning tea together.

487
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,760
Will do.

488
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,280
Jing,

489
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,730
I got you wrong before.

490
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,890
Don’t take it to heart.

491
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,770
Not at all, Auntie.

492
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,880
Don’t think like that.

493
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,400
Alright.

494
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,940
Uncle, we’re leaving then.

495
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,850
See you next time.

496
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,760
OK. OK.

497
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,520
Take care.

498
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,890
OK. I’m off then. Bye.

499
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,610
Let me see you off, Auntie.

500
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,450
Sure.

501
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:01,860
Let’s go.

502
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,930
Take care.

503
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,770
Mom, I want to say something to Ai Jing.

504
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Bye.

505
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,980
Come with me.

506
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,400
What?

507
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,820
What are you doing?

508
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,370
Now that you’ve met my mother.

509
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,770
Shouldn’t you reward me with something?

510
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,120
My dad and your mom are here.

511
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,250
I’ll come see you tonight.

512
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,970
Don’t say you don’t have time.

513
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,220
I have time.

514
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,890
My dad will meet
Wu Bai’s parents tonight.

515
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,100
I don’t want to go.

516
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,570
OK then.

517
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,290
See you tonight.

518
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,090
Uncle, I’m leaving.

519
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,700
I’ll visit you next time.

520
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,160
See you.

521
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,610
Take care of your mom.

522
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,610
OK.

523
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,930
Shen Zhe’s mother is a bit traditional.

524
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,240
And you’re hot tempered.

525
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,500
I’m afraid you’ll quarrel

526
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,880
with each other again.

527
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,340
You must get ready for that.

528
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,130
You should give in to her, you know?

529
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,810
OK, Dad. I won’t be like her.

530
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,980
Mind your words.

531
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,130
Bai’s parents should have arrived.

532
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:14,850
There’s enough time.

533
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,850
You can walk there.

534
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,610
No, it’s very urgent.

535
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,010
I need to change my clothes.

536
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:19,980
Change your clothes?

537
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,360
Aren’t you wearing a suit?

538
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,980
I bought two suits

539
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,250
for each of the meeting.

540
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,520
Hurry.

541
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
Hail a cab for me.

542
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,610
I’ll go change my clothes.

543
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,650
OK.

544
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,690
Dad, slow down.

545
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,000
OK. I know.

546
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,760
It’s so close. It’s hard to hail a cab.

547
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,890
How do I look?

548
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,240
Didn’t you change your clothes?

549
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,170
I did.

550
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,240
You did?

551
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,940
You bought two suits, right?

552
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,760
Right.

553
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,210
Two same suits.

554
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,580
Completely the same.

555
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,490
How do you think?

556
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,490
I’m not partial

557
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,620
to either of you.

558
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,530
Did you get a cab?

559
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,940
Yes. It’s downstairs.

560
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,520
I’ve got to go then.

561
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,370
Cheer up!

562
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,100
Cheer up!

563
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,580
What’s that cheering?

564
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,120
Please enjoy.

565
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,290
OK. Thank you.

566
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,520
Grandpa, nice to meet you.

567
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,490
Nice to meet you.

568
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,890
Let me introduce you.

569
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,120
This is my son-in-law.

570
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,100
-Hello.
-Hello.

571
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,820
Nice to meet you.

572
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,820
This is my daughter.

573
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,620
Nice to meet you.

574
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,460
Hello.

575
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,970
Let’s sit down and chat.

576
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:22,700
OK?

577
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,460
Please.

578
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,490
Grandpa, this way.

579
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,220
OK. OK.

580
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,340
Grandpa, sit here.

581
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,500
OK. OK. Here.

582
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,700
Sit here. Sit.

583
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,410
Here. Sit.

584
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,340
Sit down, please.

585
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,500
Bai.

586
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:39,650
Grandpa.

587
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,880
OK. OK.

588
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,250
This kid’s very polite.

589
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,760
This...

590
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,460
Thank you, thank you.

591
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,810
Well,

592
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,500
we’ve never

593
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,740
gone to a similar occasion.

594
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,000
We’re not experienced.

595
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,130
Please forgive us if we’re being

596
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,370
inconsiderate.

597
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,530
You’re too polite.

598
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,740
Don’t think like that.

599
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,410
They like each other

600
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,250
and want to get married.

601
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,820
Then they can go ahead and do it.

602
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,740
We can sit together,

603
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,890
chat and eat together,

604
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,490
and then we’ll become family.

605
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,770
Right. Right.

606
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,620
We want to buy a house for them.

607
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,460
Mom, I’ll buy it myself.

608
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,860
We can buy one ourselves.

609
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,250
How big a house do you want?

610
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,290
You should take your kids
into consideration.

611
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,820
Right. Right.

612
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
It’s very important.

613
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,580
They’ve decided.

614
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,650
They’ll have a boy and a girl.

615
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,940
Let’s talk about the marriage first.

616
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,860
Let’s do it step by step.

617
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,980
Right! Right!

618
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,170
It takes time.

619
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,170
Actually,

620
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:39,970
Wu Bai’s mom

621
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,650
wanted to give Wu Bai a gift.

622
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,290
But he wouldn’t accept it.

623
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,500
We’ve taught

624
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,940
Wu Bai to be independent
since he was a kid.

625
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,940
He’d get paid for doing housework,

626
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,100
which would become his pocket money.

627
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,220
So Wu Bai

628
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,530
has been very independent.

629
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,860
Wu Bai’s obviously

630
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,820
very well educated.

631
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,050
Your childhood was so miserable?

632
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,290
Not too bad.

633
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,650
I’m used to it.

634
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,500
You should keep up this

635
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,100
good habit of yours

636
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,710
after we get married.

637
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,250
What good habit?

638
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,460
Doing housework.

639
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,580
If you like,

640
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,250
I can do it every day.

641
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,510
Pinky swear.

642
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,780
I can finally stay with you
alone for a while.

643
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,650
Didn’t we just meet in the morning?

644
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,370
It’s different.

645
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,100
We were not alone in the morning.

646
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,620
It didn’t count.

647
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,170
How do you like my performance?

648
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,020
So-so.

649
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,980
How can you call it so-so?

650
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,510
My performance was obviously

651
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,410
perfect.

652
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,870
Since you already knew, why ask me?

653
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,180
It’s because

654
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,340
I wanted to hear you say it.

655
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,500
Should we speed up a bit as well?

656
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,010
Speed up what?

657
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,860
Getting married.

658
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,980
Wu Bai and Ai Qing are getting married.

659
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,500
What are we waiting for?

660
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,660
Wu Bai has chased my sister
for ten years.

661
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,100
So what if it’s 10 years?

662
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,460
I can chase you for ten years,

663
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,950
twenty and thirty years.

664
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,050
I can chase you after we get married.

665
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,460
How many candies did you eat today?

666
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,340
You’re so sweet.

667
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,700
You want me to agree
by saying some sweet words?

668
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,290
You got me wrong.

669
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,580
Honey,

670
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,780
my love for you is witnessed

671
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,420
by the sun and moon.

672
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,130
How can you say I’m hoaxing you?

673
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,650
You’re shameless.

674
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,020
I am, so what?

675
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,010
Not enough.

676
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,620
Still not enough.

677
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,870
Not enough.

678
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,510
Shouldn’t you go home now?

679
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,980
My dad will be back soon.

680
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,530
It doesn’t matter.

681
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,350
So he can be our witness.

682
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,020
Grandpa, slow.

683
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,170
Do you like the food?

684
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,820
Yes. Very good.

685
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,180
We need to talk about the house again.

686
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Grandpa, you’re the eldest.

687
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,060
I’ll pay you a visit

688
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,900
personally another day.

689
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,740
I’ll be waiting for you.

690
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,740
OK.

691
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,870
Ai Qing.

692
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,420
Grandpa.

693
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,010
Come visit me when you have time.

694
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,060
Don’t worry, I will.

695
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,990
OK. OK.

696
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,870
Dad, get in the car.

697
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,710
Get in. Get in.

698
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,470
Let me help Grandpa.

699
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,740
Here. Let me help Grandpa.

700
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,230
See you.

701
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,660
OK.

702
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,110
See you.

703
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,590
OK.

704
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,140
See you, Ai Qing.

705
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,110
-Bye, Uncle.
-Bye.

706
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,860
Call me when you get back home.

707
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,540
Go now.

708
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,470
See you, Grandpa.

709
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,140
See you, Uncle.

710
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,710
Bye, uncle.

711
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,470
Goodbye.

712
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,180
See you.

713
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,180
See you.

714
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,110
Goodbye, Uncle, Auntie.

715
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,380
I’ve finally completed
this important mission.

716
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,350
Two tasks in one day.

717
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,510
Thank you, Dad.

718
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,820
Wu Bai is a nice kid.

719
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,130
You should cherish him.
Don’t bully him.

720
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,830
When did I bully him?

721
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,350
OK, let’s go home.

722
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,470
Let’s go.

723
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,950
Nice.

724
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,110
What are you playing?

725
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,350
What should I do now?

726
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,950
It’s so easy, Dad.

727
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,950
Just move it down.

728
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,140
Brilliant! Brilliant!

729
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,990
I won! I won!

730
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,110
I...

731
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,350
I thought about it all night.

732
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,590
How about

733
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,710
you get married together?

734
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,350
I’m not in a hurry.

735
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,180
You’re not in a hurry?

736
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,710
You’re one year older than Ai Jing.

737
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,770
But you’re not in a hurry?

738
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,020
I want to observe him for two years.

739
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,510
Right.

740
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,380
Shen Zhe

741
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,180
doesn’t seem as reliable as Wu Bai.

742
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,380
Let’s wait.

743
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,260
Dad,

744
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
Shen Zhe taught you
how to play this game.

745
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,590
Didn’t you say
you wanted to observe him?

746
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,300
Can’t I talk ill of him?

747
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,380
What about you?

748
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,190
How about you get married first?

749
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,750
I...

750
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,630
I think...

751
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,670
You see, we just met Bai’s parents.

752
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,110
Let’s take it slow.

753
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,380
Take it slow?

754
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,260
Bai’s parents,

755
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,390
especially his grandpa,

756
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,510
attach great importance to this.

757
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,360
How can you take it slow?

758
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,420
You must be quick!

759
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,230
Listen, Bai!

760
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,230
You’ll hold your
wedding ceremonies together!

761
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,030
In next month!

762
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,710
Next month?

763
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,060
What? You not happy?

764
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,350
No. Of course not.

765
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,750
Grandpa said

766
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,830
we should get married next month.

767
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,300
I’ll tell you face to face.

768
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,420
I wanted to wait
till your next birthday.

769
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,870
But Grandpa said so,

770
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,180
and he happens to be in China.

771
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,270
Let’s do it then.

772
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,150
So I’ll feel secure.

773
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,630
We have obtained the marriage license.

774
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,300
What are you feeling insecure about?

775
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,030
I feel insecure because
we’re not living together.

776
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,240
Bai, come on in.

777
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,340
Uncle.

778
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,750
Bai, come and sit.

779
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,280
Eat hawthorn balls.

780
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,860
Dad, give him a few minutes.

781
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,800
I need to talk with him.

782
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,350
You can eat first.

783
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,820
You just said

784
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,910
we’re getting married next month.

785
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,580
But,

786
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,470
are we moving too fast?

787
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,720
I’m not ready for it yet.

788
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,900
Grandpa said

789
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,270
we can get married on the National Day.

790
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,630
But,

791
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,710
we haven’t obtained
the marriage license yet.

792
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,580
I’ve brought the documents.

793
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,720
Let’s do it in a bit.

794
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,620
In a bit?

795
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,070
I checked.

796
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,110
They’re working today.

797
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,390
Let me take a look.

798
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,660
Dad, what are you doing?

799
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,240
Your sister is suspicious.

800
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,480
What is she plotting?

801
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,190
Dad!

802
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,420
How come this door is moving!

803
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,550
This door...

804
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,390
Um...

805
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,240
Bai and I will

806
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,630
get our marriage license later.

807
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,180
The marriage license?

808
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,910
Dad, what are you looking for?

809
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,110
You’ll need the household register.

810
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,430
Take it.

811
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,540
(Household Register)

812
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,960
(Household Register)

813
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,110
Dad,

814
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,240
you carry the household register
with you all the time?

815
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,580
I prepared it after I met Bai’s parents

816
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,520
last time.

817
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,150
Thank you, Uncle.

818
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,800
Others don’t want to
marry their daughters off.

819
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,070
But look at you.

820
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,190
You can’t wait to marry us off.

821
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,580
That’s because Bai is excellent.

822
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,960
I wouldn’t do it
if it were another person.

823
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,240
Bai,

824
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,630
after getting married,

825
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,630
you’ll have

826
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,080
a whole new life to live.

827
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,390
Are you ready?

828
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,960
Uncle,

829
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,150
I’ve been preparing it for ten years.

830
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,760
Don’t worry.

831
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
OK.

832
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,590
I’ll entrust you with her then.

833
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,040
You really are ready?

834
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,870
I’ve been thinking about it
for a long time.

835
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,390
Let’s go.

836
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,040
Let’s go.

837
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,760
(Civil Affairs Bureau)

838
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,010
(Freely Register Your Marriage
According to the Law)

839
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,350
OK.

840
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,520
On my count.

841
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,760
Smile.

842
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,670
OK.

843
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,870
Three, two...

844
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,320
Sir!

845
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,630
Again!

846
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,350
OK. Let’s do it one more time.

847
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,560
Three, two...

848
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,830
Sir! Sir!

849
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,440
Bai,

850
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,150
what are you doing?

851
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,730
Aren’t I supposed to make a gesture?

852
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,600
Who told you that?

853
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,830
97.

854
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,040
Wu Bai! Wu Bai! Wu Bai!

855
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,110
Do you know?

856
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,430
Now the wedding photos

857
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,590
are shot differently from before.

858
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,960
You should make some gestures.

859
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,350
Don’t just stand there.

860
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,430
Really?

861
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,560
Listen to me.

862
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,870
You’d been abroad for many years.

863
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,040
And then you were busy with competitions
after you came back.

864
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,830
I’m sure you don’t know
the latest trends.

865
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,150
Listen, if you don’t know what to do,

866
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,000
you can make some gestures like these.

867
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,520
Right, show your love

868
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,000
for her.

869
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,010
Go for it!

870
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,040
Sorry.

871
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,670
One more time.

872
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,960
Let’s do it again.

873
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,350
Just put your hands here.

874
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,250
Three...

875
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:42,830
Smile.

876
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,080
Two...

877
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,240
One.

878
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,830
(Marriage Registration)

879
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,410
(Marriage License)

880
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,010
Oh no.

881
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,570
I forgot to tell Wu Bai

882
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,670
he needs to go to a photo studio
to take new style photos.

883
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,840
He can’t take these photos
in the Civil Affairs Bureau.

884
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,000
He should know, right?

885
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,720
I think he knows.

886
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,040
So we have

887
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,880
the marriage license now.

888
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,290
Right.

889
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,110
(License holder: Wu Bai)

890
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,830
Is it too late

891
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,280
if I say

892
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,680
I regret it?

893
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,640
Don’t even think about it.

894
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,600
Let’s go.

895
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,380
(Civil Affairs Bureau)

896
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,330
Who’s calling?

897
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,840
My Dad.

898
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Hello, Dad.

899
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,490
Hey, Ai Qing.

900
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,250
How did it go?

901
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,810
We have the license now.

902
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,590
Great!

903
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,200
I’ll go home with Dad.

904
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,970
You just got the license.

905
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,600
You should spend some time together.

906
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
There’s no need.

907
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,840
I’ll go back to the club

908
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,870
after I send her back.

909
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,630
Why are you going back?

910
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,630
Aren’t you having a holiday?

911
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,200
Wu Bai, stay in our house.

912
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,970
Don’t stand on ceremony.

913
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:06,800
Right. Right.

914
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,910
I’ve cooked

915
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,870
a lot of food for you.

916
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,190
You should eat them up.

917
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,920
We’ll leave you alone then.

918
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,120
Then...

919
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,800
Leave them alone.

920
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,010
Right. Right.

921
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,970
Let’s go.

922
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,050
Let’s go.

923
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,810
We’re home.

924
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,000
My dad cooked so many dishes.

925
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,810
He even prepared wine for us.
