=Episode 5=

19
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,060
Who is the one behind him?

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,540
Looks familiar.

21
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,580
Appledog.

22
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,020
Appledog!

23
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,740
Come on, Director!

24
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,380
Zoom in, please!

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,340
Let’s see

26
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,540
who is helping him!

27
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,140
It’s Doggie.

28
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,300
The master behind the kid

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,140
is the famous Appledog!

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,460
Since she retired three years ago,

31
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,940
it’s the first time she is seen in public!

32
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,780
We have so many gurus here today!

33
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,460
Yes, let’s continue our ceremony.

34
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,620
Welcome the staff to present the award.

35
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Congrats, kid.

36
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,700
You’ve got Solo’s autograph,

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,620
your favorite prize!

38
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,700
Congrats!

39
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,940
-Thank you.
-Let’s go.

40
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,580
So, I hope this kid...

41
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,500
Why is she leaving?

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,820
Hope he will still love our game,

43
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,100
and love robot fighting.

44
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,780
She doesn’t like these occasions, maybe.

45
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,460
Sit down.

46
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,340
Mr. Xiang,

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,940
if nothing else,

48
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,100
I’ll take my leave.

49
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,780
Okay. Good day.

50
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,660
But,

51
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,100
you must attend the closing ceremony
tomorrow.

52
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,740
See you.

53
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,260
Well,

54
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,900
excuse me, buddy,

55
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,180
all the audience knew the woman

56
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,300
on the screen.

57
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,740
Who…? Who is she?

58
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,820
Seriously, buddy?

59
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,300
You are here, yet you don’t know her?

60
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,140
She was the No.1 female operator
in Solo Team,

61
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,780
Appledog,
as famous as Solo and Han Shangyan!

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,780
She was the best female robot operator

63
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,460
in China.

64
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,260
In the Robot Combat Tournament
three years ago,

65
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,380
she was the Captain of the second place
in China.

66
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,780
In the same year,

67
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,580
she won the ARCT.

68
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,500
Really? Is she so awesome?

69
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,300
She represented China

70
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,660
and won the Team Competition.

71
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,140
Don’t you know it?

72
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,020
Well… Now I know it.

73
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,860
She’s our goddess.

74
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,900
And mine.

75
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,020
I thought you were generous,

76
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,740
yet you still got away.

77
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,500
It was a long time ago.

78
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,100
I don’t want to be in it again.

79
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,620
Honestly,

80
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,820
do you miss it

81
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,500
when you were back to the familiar game?

82
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,980
Do you regret retiring?

83
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,500
I can tell from your look.

84
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,260
You…

85
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,740
Why are you here?

86
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
Where should I be?

87
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,300
Shouldn’t you be inside?

88
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,780
Don’t you need to go on the stage?

89
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,900
It’s Solo and Wu Bai's stage.

90
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,620
How can I be there?

91
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,820
I had a nap here.

92
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,620
What about you?

93
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,980
Did you sleep well?

94
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,380
Yes, I did.

95
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,420
Wu Bai.

96
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,260
Long time no see.

97
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,940
Long time no see.

98
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,660
Are you leaving?

99
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,740
I think it’s time to go.

100
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,820
Well,

101
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,380
later…

102
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:45,820
You…

103
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,500
Appledog!

104
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,380
It’s been a while!

105
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,300
Didn’t you see me in there?

106
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,140
Do you have any schedule

107
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,300
with your friends?

108
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,380
No.

109
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,740
Come with me.

110
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,660
Let’s have a party.

111
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,700
Who will be there?

112
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,740
Will Solo go?

113
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,380
Just old friends.

114
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,500
Doggie,

115
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,180
we haven’t met for seven or eight years.

116
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,420
You won’t say no to me, will you?

117
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,100
Of course not.

118
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,100
I’m taking her away.

119
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,020
Okay.

120
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,420
Bring her back safe and early.

121
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,220
Rest assured.

122
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,220
I promise she’ll be back safe.

123
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,500
Stop that. Go ahead.

124
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,140
We’re leaving.

125
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,940
Bye.

126
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,340
They were my sister’s teammates.

127
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,540
I know.

128
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,580
Her ex will be there as well, I guess.

129
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,380
She’ll feel embarrassed.

130
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,580
My sister

131
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,100
is very nostalgic.

132
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,420
You are getting masculine.

133
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,420
Guys,

134
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,620
look who is here.

135
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,900
Doggie.

136
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,020
You have no change at all.

137
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,780
Yeah. It’s been many years.

138
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,460
You look more beautiful.

139
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,460
You guys, too.

140
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,620
You look more handsome.

141
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,980
You can’t treat us differently, Doggie.

142
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,260
Old friend,

143
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,620
come and say hi.

144
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,100
May I say

145
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,340
you look more handsome?

146
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,020
Yes.

147
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,620
You have longer hair.

148
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,780
You look more beautiful.

149
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,020
Cut it out.

150
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,740
Stop complimenting each other.

151
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,860
Let’s sit and have a chat.

152
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,740
Sit down.

153
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,500
Excuse me.

154
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,820
Two glasses of water, please.

155
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,820
Ai Qing.

156
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,820
Yes?

157
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,420
Please join SP.

158
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,580
No way.

159
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,100
I’ve retired.

160
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,220
-Actually...
-Moreover,

161
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,180
I’m pretty good now.

162
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,220
Things go well both at home and work.

163
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,300
You said all I meant to ask.

164
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,300
I’m setting up a team.

165
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,540
And I need a leader.

166
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,420
The leader doesn’t have to be
a good fighter,

167
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,340
but must be able to comfort,

168
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,340
look after and lead the members.

169
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,980
It will be better if the leader can fit in

170
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,180
and be their spiritual leader.

171
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,980
Ai Qing, you meet all the conditions.

172
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,300
You suit the best.

173
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,900
Given your experience, seniority,

174
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,460
and your charisma,

175
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,300
you will be well respected by teammates.

176
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,260
And what you’ve achieved

177
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,780
can convince them.

178
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,980
Is this your spontaneous idea

179
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,420
when you meet me today?

180
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,540
No.

181
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,140
I’m desperate for talents,

182
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,820
yet I can’t find one.

183
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,020
God brings you to me.

184
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,660
You are really the manager
of SP in China.

185
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,740
You are really a good talker.

186
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,620
Good or not,

187
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,020
it depends on if I can convince you.

188
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,700
I can prove it.

189
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,620
Doggie.

190
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,260
He is really looking for a good leader.

191
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,420
I’ve been away for too long.

192
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,540
I don’t want to be back.

193
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,660
-You…
-It’s okay.

194
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,620
The team will be assembled
at the end of the year.

195
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,700
I have time to convince you.

196
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,900
Next stage.

197
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,740
Come on.

198
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,340
Where is Wu Bai?

199
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,460
If you want to master the skills,

200
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,460
you need to remove the bottom layer.

201
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,740
Where is Wu Bai?

202
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,820
What about these two? These two.

203
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,900
About these two…

204
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,220
Where is Wu Bai?

205
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,300
He’s out there.

206
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,980
You are so annoying, aren’t you?

207
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,580
Look.

208
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,940
Actually, if you can…

209
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,300
After you remove this part…

210
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,300
Is Wu Bai troubled?

211
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,420
He falls for a girl.

212
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,980
A girl?

213
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,020
Is she beautiful?

214
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,260
Yes, she’s pretty.

215
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,700
But she’s older than him.

216
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,740
You are so old-fashioned.

217
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,220
What’s wrong with an older girl?

218
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,860
It’s popular.

219
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,660
What about you?

220
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,380
Do you like younger boys?

221
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,060
I...

222
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,660
It depends on how much younger.

223
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,140
Three years younger.

224
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,500
Three years younger?

225
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,260
Let me think.

226
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,500
It seems too young.

227
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,700
I don’t think so.

228
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,100
I can accept that anyway.

229
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,620
Me, too.

230
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,700
Captain.

231
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,620
You’ve been gazing at it the whole day.

232
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,660
She hasn’t been back?

233
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,060
Where are you going?

234
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,420
Jogging.

235
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,500
I’ve got things to do.

236
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,300
I’m leaving.

237
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
OK.

238
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,980
By the way.

239
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,100
Send her home for me.

240
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,620
That’s for sure.

241
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,420
I won’t let a girl go home alone, will I?

242
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,540
Alright.

243
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,380
You must attend

244
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,740
the closing ceremony tomorrow.

245
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,660
Promise me.

246
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,740
It’s a deal.

247
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,740
Deal. I will.

248
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,100
Okay. I gotta go.

249
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,940
-Bye.
-Bye.

250
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,300
Let me give you a ride.

251
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:56,980
Okay.

252
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
Let’s go.

253
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,420
Wu Bai.

254
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,340
It’s a busy day. Aren’t you having a rest?

255
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,060
I just had dinner

256
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,540
and got back.

257
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,980
Don’t run right after dinner.

258
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,300
It’s bad for your stomach.

259
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,340
Yeah. Take care of yourself.

260
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,260
Well,

261
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,100
do you know each other well?

262
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,620
We’re old friends.

263
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,820
When I first met him,

264
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,180
he was about 16, right?

265
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,620
Time flies.

266
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,060
You must be hungry.

267
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,940
We kept talking,

268
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,260
and didn’t eat anything.

269
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,500
How about we go around…?

270
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,940
Are they going for dinner together?

271
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,900
I don’t…

272
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,860
Well,

273
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,860
I’m hungry.

274
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,380
Did you say you had dinner?

275
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,420
I’ve been running

276
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,300
and get hungry again.

277
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,780
Ok. Join us.

278
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,540
Let’s go.

279
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,820
What did you eat?

280
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,980
Are you hungry so soon?

281
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,820
I...

282
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,980
I forgot it.

283
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,860
Forgot it?

284
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,380
Please sit here.

285
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,580
Sorry, Miss. This chair is broken.

286
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,180
Could you sit there?

287
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,100
OK.

288
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,620
Excuse me.

289
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,300
I remember you love spicy food,

290
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,420
a chili lover.

291
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,180
Yeah.

292
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,300
Spicy food is addictive.

293
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,620
I’m gonna order as before.

294
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,980
Spicy stir-fried beef,
spicy deep-fried eggs.

295
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,180
Hot and sour chicken gizzards.
Spicy fried squids.

296
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,460
Hot crayfish.

297
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,380
Super spicy, please.

298
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,460
Sure.

299
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,620
Well, Wu Bai,

300
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,620
can you eat spicy food?

301
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,740
Yes, that’s no problem to me.

302
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,740
Is your stomach okay with it?

303
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,900
No problem.

304
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,620
It’s okay.

305
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,660
I’ll order two dishes without chili.

306
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,180
Vinegar-flavored cabbage. OK?

307
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,180
No need.

308
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,020
I don’t like vinegar.

309
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,420
You don’t like sour food.

310
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,180
Well, how about this?

311
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,220
No vinegar

312
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,740
in vinegar-flavored cabbage, please.

313
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,820
OK.

314
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,380
See the menu again.

315
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,580
No more.

316
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
Thank you.

317
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,620
Hold on.

318
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,180
I forget the most important dish.

319
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,660
You ordered it every time.

320
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,500
The steamed fish head with chili.

321
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,500
Okay. Any dietary restrictions?

322
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
No.

323
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,340
Alright.

324
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,900
No vinegar for this gentleman.

325
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,500
Okay.

326
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,260
No vinegar for this gentleman.

327
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,380
No vinegar for the gentleman in Table 3.

328
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,340
Excuse me, I have a call.

329
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,660
You may chat.

330
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,540
Hello?

331
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,180
Has your gastroenteritis fully recovered?

332
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,060
You like steamed fish head with chili?

333
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,060
Yeah. I like spicy food.

334
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,820
It’s been my favorite food.

335
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,740
You don’t have sour food?

336
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,780
I

337
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,300
barely have it.

338
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,820
So you don’t eat dumplings with vinegar?

339
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,100
With soy souse.

340
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,620
Soy souse?

341
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,100
That tastes awful.

342
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,180
I like vinegar.

343
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,940
I must eat dumplings with vinegar.

344
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
Something is on your coat.

345
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,020
It’s white.

346
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,620
It’s gone.

347
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,260
Thanks.

348
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,420
All right. Send me the files.

349
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,860
Okay. Thanks.

350
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,300
Sorry.

351
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
What’s wrong?

352
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,540
Nothing.

353
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,140
The steamed fish head with chili.

354
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,860
OK. Thank you.

355
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,220
Thank you.

356
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,380
I forgot to tell him

357
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,660
not to add coriander.

358
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,140
It’s fine. Let me pick it out.

359
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,260
Never mind. Let it be.

360
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,500
I can have some now.

361
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,140
Back then in the team,

362
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,300
if there was any coriander in your food,

363
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,540
you wouldn’t even touch it.

364
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,940
People all change.

365
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,740
You still like chili as before.

366
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,380
Yeah, that doesn’t change.

367
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,180
I like it since I was a child.

368
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,980
So,

369
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,580
I just know her well in the interview.

370
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,940
What she really likes and dislikes,

371
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,380
I know little about it.

372
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,260
The vinegar-flavored cabbage, please.

373
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,220
Thank you.

374
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,500
There’s vinegar in the cabbage.

375
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,300
Let me replace it.

376
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,300
No.

377
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Sorry.

378
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,700
Now I want to have it.

379
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,700
Can you have vinegar now?

380
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,380
Try the fish.

381
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,220
The fish is really spicy.

382
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,260
You like hot food more than before.

383
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,140
Is this the one?

384
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,540
It is. I’m sure.

385
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,460
Captain.

386
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,420
You came back so late.

387
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,020
Are you hungry?

388
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,460
No.

389
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,740
Captain, we ordered takeout just now.

390
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,460
Would you like some?

391
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,300
Yeah, a Hunan Cuisine restaurant nearby

392
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,900
is famous
for their steamed fish head with chili.

393
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
It’s really tasty.

394
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
I won’t eat it.

395
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,740
It’s really tasty. Try it.

396
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,060
It is.

397
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,300
I have gastroenteritis.

398
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,980
No. I have no appetite for it.

399
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,060
And,

400
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,340
I hate fish head the most.

401
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,900
Why does he hate fish head so much?

402
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,220
Well, should we eat it?

403
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,380
Of course.

404
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,940
We have no hatred with it.

405
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,740
Ignore him. Let’s enjoy it in your room.

406
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,980
You have everything in your room,
like a grocery store.

407
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,540
I love sour food. Do you have vinegar?

408
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,020
Yes.

409
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,740
Great. Add some on the fish head.

410
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,620
It’s sour and spicy. Amazing.

411
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,340
(Chinese Robot Fighting League
Promotion Event)

412
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,740
Ai Qing. Ai Qing. Ai Qing.

413
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,020
Lin.

414
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,220
Mr. Lin. What can I do for you?

415
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,540
No, thanks. You are so kind.

416
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,340
I’m here to say sorry

417
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,620
for what happened yesterday.

418
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,580
I had no choice.

419
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,900
There was only one guest of honor,

420
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,860
yet you had two persons.
It was hard for me.

421
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,180
But things are different today.

422
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,340
I personally applied

423
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,100
two VIP seats for you.

424
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,700
You’ll sit next to me.

425
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,420
No, thanks.

426
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,100
We’ll take the back seats.

427
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,580
You’re joking.

428
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,260
You must take the VIP seats.

429
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,780
These two seats are
for you and your fri…

430
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,740
My sister. I just….

431
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,660
Nice to meet you, Miss.

432
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,500
Well... Well...

433
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
You look so young.

434
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,460
I can’t believe my eyes.

435
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,380
You’re like twins.
I’m going for some water.

436
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,780
Thank you, sir.

437
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,700
You’re welcome.

438
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,580
Was he frightened by you yesterday?

439
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,580
How did I frighten him?

440
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,900
Don’t you think it’s fun?

441
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,100
It’s like you showed up as Monkey King
riding Somersault Cloud

442
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,020
with the Golden Cudgel in hand.

443
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,260
This way, please.

444
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,380
I’ve got water for you

445
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,140
on your chairs.

446
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,020
This way, please.

447
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,860
Watch out.

448
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,020
Fine... I’m... I’m fine.

449
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,940
-Miss!
-Please.

450
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,700
What are you doing?

451
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,100
I’m Fu Yiwen, from SP.

452
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,140
I like you so much.

453
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,940
Hello.

454
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,140
I am her manager.

455
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,980
Hello, Goddess.

456
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,420
I grew up watching your games.

457
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,380
I know. I’m her manager.

458
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,100
I like you very much.

459
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,860
You’re my idol.

460
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,140
I really like you.

461
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,580
Where are your manners?
Hello, Mr. Xiang.

462
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,660
Ai Qing.

463
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,020
Mr. Xiang, long time no see.

464
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,460
Long time no see.

465
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,540
Where will you sit?

466
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:38,940
I will…

467
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,980
I’ve got her a VIP seat,

468
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,540
right next to me.

469
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,340
No.

470
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,580
You may sit with me.

471
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,260
She should sit with us.

472
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,180
I’m inviting her to be our leader,

473
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,740
so she should sit with us.

474
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,420
Is it true?

475
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,580
I haven’t agreed.

476
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,580
Well, Doggie.

477
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,500
You should sit with us.

478
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,300
You belong to our team.

479
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,700
Alright. Stop talking.

480
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,460
It’s not your style.

481
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,500
Ai Qing, we…

482
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,220
You. Come over.

483
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,540
Yes, Mr. Xiang?

484
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,860
These two years,

485
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,860
how is Ai Qing doing in your company?

486
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,340
She’s doing well, very well,

487
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,060
both at work and in the life.

488
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,540
Be honest to me, man.

489
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,940
She is my best friend.

490
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,420
If she is bullied,

491
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,780
I’ll get them punished.

492
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,900
Never. I will stand out

493
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,860
and stop it before it happens.

494
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,740
Trust me, Mr. Xiang.

495
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,780
Don’t hide anything from me.

496
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,700
Mr. Xiang, the seat next to you…

497
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,860
Take care, Mr. Xiang.

498
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,820
Yeah. It’s almost the time.

499
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,740
Hello, my friends.

500
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,580
The fans of fighting robots.

501
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,620
Welcome to

502
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,060
the closing ceremony

503
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,700
of this robot fighting competition!

504
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,180
Welcome!

505
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,740
Today, we’re honored

506
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,380
to have the three core players

507
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,620
from the top Solo Team,

508
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,300
who used to

509
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,500
dominate the robot fighting game.

510
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,620
Director,
turn the camera to them, please.

511
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,700
Surprisingly, after so many years,

512
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,900
we can still have

513
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,900
the previous members of Solo Team here.

514
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,820
Most unexpectedly,

515
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,420
the only female teammate,

516
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,860
Ai Qing,

517
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,020
is sitting next
to her previous teammates.

518
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,700
Is it a coincidence?

519
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,900
Or it is planned?

520
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,260
Thank you.

521
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,700
The fate.

522
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,140
It is the fate.

523
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,900
You all know I have a crush on her,

524
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,140
don’t you?

525
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,740
Don’t talk nonsense.

526
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,180
Yeah, I’m also a fan of Ai Qing.

527
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,700
I even made manga for her.

528
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,100
I’d like to ask the players here.

529
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,580
How many of you used her photo

530
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,140
as a desktop wallpaper?

531
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,780
Could you raise your hands?

532
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,900
Captain.

533
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,620
Would you mind if I

534
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,860
raise my hand?

535
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,100
No. Forget it.

536
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,660
What about the audience?

537
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,620
Anyone of you?

538
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,860
-Yes.
-Yes.

539
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,340
Do you miss those years?

540
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,220
-Yes!
-Yes!

541
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,060
Next,

542
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,580
there is a small gift for you guys

543
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,220
from the new players of new generation.

Gifted with design instinct)

We may pay respects to those pioneers.

What’s this?

548
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,860
Don’t know.

They lead the way

551
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,900
for China’s robot fighting competition.

552
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,020
(Ou Qiang, Electric/SW Engineer)
They first applied non-classified

military tech and aerospace technology
to robot design,

554
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,860
making China’s fighting robot industry

555

556

558
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,980
performing scientific research and

559
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,260
making contribution to Chinese technology.

560
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,980
They were ever defamed,
doubted and sneered,

561
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,140
but they still persisted,
loved and dreamed.

562
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,380
In the past ten years,
they never wavered.

591

You stand up and solute first. Why?

592
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,020
Do you start your career

593
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,980
because of Solo Team?

594
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,540
Yes.

595
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,180
Keep it up.

596
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,420
Thank you.

597
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,620
Thanks, Wu Bai. Thanks, Solo Team.

598
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,620
Sit, please.

599
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,340
I had witnessed Solo Team

600
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,820
rank top in many games.

601
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,580
I’ve been too excited about it.

602
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,660
Please allow me to

603
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,580
forget about my identity
as a host for a minute,

604
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,820
and express my gratitude
to all the seniors

605
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,300
who contributed to the robot fighting,

606
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,660
as well as so many successors

Yes, we are eager to listen to

610

-Yes!
-Yes!

616
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,620
Really?

617
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
Go ahead.

618
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,300
Ou Qiang, the Bold, feels afraid now?

619
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,380
The three core operators in the team,

620
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,540
Solo, Doggie, and Han Shangyan,

621
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,540
left the team on the same day.

622
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,100
Many fans abused that it was Doggie

623
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,580
who made the team disbanded.

624
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,180
In fact,

625
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,300
I’ve never

626
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,060
quit the robot fighting circle,

627
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,060
because of what Doggie told me.

628
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,580
When I had hesitations,

629
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,580
Doggie said to me,

630
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,940
“Do you know why

631
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,180
I like robot fighting?

632
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,660
Because in this circle,

633
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,100
we believe in sharing,

634
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,580
whatever your positions are,

635
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,900
whether friends or foes.”

636
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,460
If the battery is dead,

637
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,180
other teams will offer one to you.

638
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,100
If gas runs out,

639
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,940
your opponent

640
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,100
will help you fill it
with an extinguisher.

641
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,420
Even if your robot is overweight,

642
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,300
your opponent will sneer at you,

643
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,420
“idiot,”

644
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,540
and then give you advice

645
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,460
to reduce the weight.

646
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,060
So,

647
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,780
I can’t leave.

648
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,900
They may scold each other,
but after that

649
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,060
they still help each other

650
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,060
and see it as their top principle.

651
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,180
Thank you, Ou Qiang.

652
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,820
All the players may work together

653
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,340
and bring more honors to

654
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,700
China’s fighting robots!

655
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,700
I mean it, Doggie.

656
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,940
You shouldn’t waste your talents.

657
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,580
I

658
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,780
have a new life.

659
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,420
Please reconsider it.

660
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,540
I’ve told you I’m pretty well.

661
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,580
Things go well both at work and home.

662
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,020
Say no more.

663
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,100
What are you waiting for?

664
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:17,940
Let’s go.

665
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,420
Hello.

666
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,100
That was a good speech.

667
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,540
Thanks.

668
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,780
Are you in SP Team?

669
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
I know you.

670
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,340
You get famous these two years.

671
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,940
Shen Zhe, right?

672
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,100
Nice to meet you.

673
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,020
Would you like to join SP Team?

674
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,340
Who knows?

675
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,940
Maybe we’ll be opponents later.

676
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,780
It’s arrogant of you. Good.

677
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,060
Your future is promising.

678
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,180
Hello, sir.

679
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,780
I’m 97 from K&K Team.

680
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,060
Hello. I’m Zhou Yi.

681
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,460
I know you guys.

682
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,580
Good luck to you.

683
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,820
Thank you.

684
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,180
Captain of K&K Team, Wu Bai, right?

685
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,580
Hello, sir.

686
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,780
You are amazing, huh?

687
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,060
Solo meant to take him in,

688
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,420
yet he was taken away by Han.

689
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,580
I’m confused.

690
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,420
Han got nothing on Solo

691
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,820
whether his financial backing
or eloquence.

692
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,940
How can he take you in?

693
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,700
Stop chatting here.

694
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,820
Let’s get a place to sit.

695
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,300
Yes.

696
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,340
It’s my first time in Guangzhou.

697
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,220
Who can be the guide

698
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,540
and hang out with us?

699
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,700
Wu Bai.

700
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,740
He grew up in this city.

701
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,300
There is Ferris wheel nearby.

702
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,420
It’s pretty good, right? Captain.

703
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,300
Shall we?

704
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,660
No. I’ve got things to do.

705
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,540
Have fun.

706
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,100
Bye.

707
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,660
-See you, sir.
-Bye.

708
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,940
Let’s go.

709
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,980
-Okay. Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

710
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,020
Netizens say that

711
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,660
the Ferris wheel is famous
for proposing.

712
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,100
It’s no use for singles to know it.

713
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,700
We’re all singles.

714
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,780
Stop hurting each other.

715
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,300
Is Wu Bai also single?

716
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,940
Yes, exactly.

717
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,340
He is, and will always be. And,

718
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,380
he has never loved or kissed a girl.

719
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,020
Seriously?

720
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,580
So handsome and still single?

721
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,780
I don’t buy it.

722
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,220
You heard that?

723
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,780
She said you’re handsome.

724
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,940
For a man, it’s not about their look,

725
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,540
but about their skills.

726
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,220
-Skills.
-Skills.

727
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,220
What skills?

728
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,300
I mean the skills…

729
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,580
I know.

730
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,220
Skills about how to control.

731
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,740
Let’s go have a look there.

732
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,940
Ai Qing, let’s take a photo.

733
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,580
-Let me take it for you.
-Come on.

734
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,860
Come on.

735
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,220
Stand still.
Come on.

736
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,900
Make a pose.

737
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,060
Three. Two. One.

738
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,820
Change your pose.

739
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,780
Zhou Yi. 97. Pose a heart.

740
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,100
You got it. Stay still.

741
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,180
You should lose weight.

742
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,700
Let’s… Let’s take another one.

743
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,820
What’s the next?

744
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,580
Another pose...

745
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,780
Hold on. Let’s me think.

746
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,580
We can do…

747
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,380
You stand in front.

748
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,220
Wu Bai.

749
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,540
Make a pose.

750
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,860
Relax yourself.

751
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,460
Turn around a little bit.

752
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,860
Turn. Yes.

753
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,020
Raise your head a little.

754
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,980
Go to show him.

755
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,500
Hey, can you grow up?

756
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,660
You don’t even know how to pose?

757
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,700
Go help him. Go ahead.

758
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,940
Go. Go. Go.

759
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,940
Like this.

760
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,580
This hand.

761
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,700
Right here.

762
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,300
Relax.

763
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,780
Don’t move.

764
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,780
Three. Two. One.

765
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,860
Have a look.

766
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,300
Now that you’re here,

767
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,620
you may take a group photo.

768
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,300
Hurry. My hand hurts.

769
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,660
I’m holding it.

770
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,180
Wu Bai.

771
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,900
Get closer to her. Get closer.

772
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,140
Here we go.

773
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,300
Three.

774
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,740
Wu Bai, smile.

775
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,180
Take it easy.

776
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,620
Here we go.

777
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,100
Three. Two. One.

778
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,780
Three. Two. One.

779
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,300
Wu Bai is so handsome.

780
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,620
Are you provoking me?

781
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,340
What? You want a fight?

782
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,380
Come with me.

783
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,540
Wu Bai or me,

784
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,420
who is more handsome?

785
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,820
Are you a kid? Why are you so childish?

786
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,420
None of your business.

787
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,260
Answer my question.

788
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,220
OK.

789
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,300
Let me think.

790
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,540
Wu Bai.

791
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,180
You…

792
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,900
I want some ice cream.

793
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,980
Go ahead.

794
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,300
Go with me.

795
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,780
I won’t have ice cream with you.

796
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,260
Do you mean it?

797
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,460
No. No. I won’t.

798
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,260
Suit yourself.

799
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,540
I won’t have ice cream!

800
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,380
(Vanilla Ice Cream)

801
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,380
Yours tastes good.

802
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,260
I prefer yours.

803
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,700
Send me the photos you took.

804
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,380
What photos?

805
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,540
Those I took with Ai Qing.

806
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,300
Listen,

807
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,980
though you are handsome,

808
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,580
I still won’t give you the photos.

809
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,060
What do you want?

810
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,620
You can have them.

811
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,740
100 yuan for each.

812
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,860
A discount for each three,

813
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,300
250 yuan.

814
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,860
It’s up to you.

815
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,700
Are you cheating me for money?

816
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,700
97, Zhou Yi, Ai Qing, Ai Jing.

817
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,700
I’ve made a chat group.

818
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,420
Go get your own photos.

819
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,740
-Okay.
-Got it.

820
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,900
Give me money

821
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,540
and you’ll have the photos.

822
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,340
Fine.

823
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,380
500 yuan.

824
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,300
You’re generous. Alright.

825
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,460
Check your phone.

826
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,580
Thank you.

827
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,780
You’re welcome.

828
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,260
You’re handsome anyway.

829
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,140
Where’s my ice cream?

830
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,380
You want it?

831
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,220
Ai Qing.

832
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,740
Are you hot?

833
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,100
What are you looking at?

834
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,540
You startled me.

835
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,220
What can I see?

836
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,940
Nothing.

837
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,380
Are you moved?

838
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,820
Moved… Moved by whom?

839
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,860
Whom?

840
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,380
I mean Solo invited you to join SP.

841
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,820
You mean that?

842
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,500
Yeah. What do you think it is?

843
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,380
Wu Bai.

844
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,820
It’s Wu Bai, right?

845
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,500
What? Why do you mention him?

846
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,220
Let’s talk about him then.

847
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,940
I saw you two take photos. So sweet!

848
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,740
It’s like a romantic drama.

849
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,620
Tell me.

850
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,100
Do you like him?

851
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,060
Stop it. Don’t talk nonsense.

852
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,900
Let’s get down to the business.

853
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,940
Okay.

854
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,540
I met many old teammates lately.

855
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,380
I have many feelings.

856
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,100
You mean Slide?

857
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,300
How do you know?

858
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,740
I’ve been your sister for two decades.

859
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
I think something’s wrong with him.

860
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,900
He seems to have some secret.

861
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,940
Right?

862
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,100
But he wouldn’t tell me anything.

863
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,020
He pretends to be decent
in front of others,

864
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,700
but barely supports himself behind us.

865
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,500
Maybe

866
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,540
Wu Bai can have a chat with him.

867
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,820
After all, they were both in the ARCT

868
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,900
in Singapore.

869
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,460
Then you can bring Wu Bai to Slide.

870
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,540
All right. Forget about that.

871
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,780
As the old saying goes,

872
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,980
it will be all right on the night.

873
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,180
Smile.

874
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,780
So pretty.

875
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,420
I’m gonna return the power bank.

876
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,700
Captain, look.

877
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,100
What nice photos!

878
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,900
Why aren’t you in our chat group?

879
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,020
That brat. Shen Zhe forgot about you.

880
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,700
Let me invite you in.

881
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,700
No, it’s okay.

882
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,580
Where are you going?

883
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,180
I almost forget

884
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,780
to do a very important thing.

885
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,500
Who’s it?

886
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,820
Just 500 yuan.

887
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,100
Is it necessary to blame me?

888
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,260
Hey.

889
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,380
What are you doing?

890
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,780
Wu Bai.

891
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,540
Wu Bai.

892
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,460
What are you doing at this hour?

893
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,180
Why don’t you

894
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,420
get dressed first?

895
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:21,860
A naked man

896
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,100
walking in front of me so late,

897
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,740
it’s embarrassing.

898
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,060
I know what you want to say.

899
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,060
You want me join K&K,

900
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,300
right?

901
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,140
Yes.

902
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,180
The thing is,

903
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,260
I don’t want to join K&K.

904
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,780
Any reason?

905
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,820
If you want me to join

906
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,980
a new team,

907
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,180
you need to offer a good price.

908
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,580
First,

909
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
a good salary.

910
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,220
Second,

911
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,660
I shall be the Captain.

912
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,580
It’s the only way to convince me.

913
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,900
About the salary,

914
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,300
K&K in China is just established.

915
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,860
The budget is limited.

916
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,980
As for the Captain,

917
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,820
it’s me.

918
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,300
OK.

919
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,580
That’s it.

920
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,500
Can’t you drop your realism?

921
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,740
It’s not realism!

922
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,940
It’s what I truly need!

923
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,820
We are different.

924
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,860
You were born
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

925
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,100
You don’t need to think
about the reality.

926
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,500
But to me,

927
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,100
I’ve been struggling to live alone
since little.

928
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,460
I live on the prize.

929
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,940
I spend money a lot,

930
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,020
but I make it myself.

931
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,980
Is it wrong?

932
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,820
I also have a dream.

933
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,780
I want the championship.

934
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,180
And I want both.

935
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,740
You’re right.

936
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,700
A dream should be more unrealistic.

937
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,740
And, you shouldn’t only focus on dreams

938
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,460
and ignore the reality.

939
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,700
You can have the salary
and be the Captain.

940
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,580
I give it up.

941
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,580
As for the salary,

942
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,940
I’ll give you half of mine to you.

943
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,620
Save it. You must be kidding.

944
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,300
Leave now. I’m going to sleep.

945
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,460
Why did you choose this career?

946
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,420
You want to beat Solo, right?

947
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,460
It’s your dream to defeat him.

948
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,780
Yes.

949
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,500
But he retired.

950
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,700
But if you join SP,

951
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,700
you can never defeat him.

952
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
He will always be your boss.

It’s said, when cameras were invented,

962
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,220
those who took photos believed

963
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,300
their souls would be taken away

964
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,060
and printed on a flat paper.

965
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,940
Of course, nowadays,

966
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,260
no one has such fears.
