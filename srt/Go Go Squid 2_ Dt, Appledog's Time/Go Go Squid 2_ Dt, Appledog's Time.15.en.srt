Don’t regret it.

88
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,970
Okay. How would you like me
to break up officially?

89
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,130
To say it officially...

90
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,970
We are not gonna break up.

91
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,250
Shameless.

92
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,340
Shameless it is.

93
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,290
I won’t break up with you.

94
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:45,810

95
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,060
No.

96
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,370
Let go of me.

97
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,690
I’ll punch you if you push me.

98
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,900
Do it.

99
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,410
You’ve punched me before.

100
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,130
You said it.

101
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,570
Don’t dodge later.

102
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,620
Come on. I won’t...

103
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,940
Your Ladyship.

104
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,570

105
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,660
Scared?

106
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,820
No.

107
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,060
I’m... Let’s use another one.

108
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,630
This. Will this do?

109
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,700
I handled it wrongly.

110
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,530
I admit it.

111
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,290
But I’ve never screwed up

112
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,740
any matters of principle, right?

113
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,540
Break up.

114
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,940
Got it?

115
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,250
Ai Jing.

116
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,090
Don’t break up with me
every time we argue.

117
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,410
It greatly damages

118
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,250
our relationship.

119
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,900
I can forgive all kinds of mistakes.

120
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,900
But a third person

121
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,690
is inexcusable.

122
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,060
What...? There’s no one else.

123
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,540
Ai Jing.

124
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,250
I can show it to you.

125
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,630
I can show you our chat history.

126
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,510
No.

127
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,020
Read it and you’ll know.

128
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,090
No!

129
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,970
Wait, how would you know what happened

130
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,090
if you don’t look at it?

131
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,030
You have to look. It’s the only way...

132
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,540
No!

133
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Listen to me.
Let me go.

134
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,980
Listen to me.

135
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,020
I’ll read it to you.

136
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,380
No.

137
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,140
I’ll read it.

138
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,170
I said. Zhouzhou.

139
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,050
Love can’t be a forced thing.

140
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,610
You’re forcing me
to not ever going home

141
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,130
and cutting off with my family.

142
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,660
You lied to my parents

143
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,860
that I cheated on you and dumped you.

144
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,220
I never defend myself, right?

145
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,940
I was saving your face
for the last time.

146
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,730
After all, there were some happy times

147
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,670
when we were together.

148
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,790
But now we’ve...

149
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,420
You were happy together?

150
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,980
It’s not the point.

151
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,350
The point is that we have...

152
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,570
Happy or not?

153
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,180
Ai Jing. I...

154
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,780
Happy or not?

155
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,420
We’ve been together for two years.

156
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,870
We were happy at first.

157
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,490
But this is not the point.

158
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,250
The point is that I told her
we’ve broken up.

159
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,420
The point is you were together
and you were happy.

160
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,790
No, I...

161
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,580
Ai Jing.

162
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,810
Ai Jing.

163
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,060
Ai Jing.

164
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,580
Everyone has an ex.

165
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,910
What would you think

166
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,550
if I have ten exes?

167
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,050
Really?

168
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,820
Ten, ten would be fine.

169
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,620
I’m, I’m not conventional about it.

170
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,180
What about twenty?

171
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,430
As long as I’m the last one,

172
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,930
it’d be alright.

173
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,860
Ai Jing, let’s stop talking
about the past but now.

174
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,940
I’ll be frank with you.

175
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,050
I’m a one-track mind.

176
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,030
As long as I’m with someone,

177
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,250
there’s no way back.

178
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,470
Unless,

179
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,620
you don’t want me anymore.

180
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,500
How to deal with what I’ve suffered?

181
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,430
Your Ladyship, I’m sorry.

182
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,140
Go away.

183
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Your Ladyship, I’m really sorry.

184
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,940
Don’t break up with me.

185
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,790
I love you with my full heart.

186
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,470
I can’t stand it.

187
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,940
Go away.

188
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,670
Are we cool?

189
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,030
That’s great.

190
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,140
But, there’s something else

191
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,870
that I need to talk to you.

192
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,780
What’s going on with you and Slide?

193
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,790
Slide?

194
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,860
What about him?

195
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,620
You...

196
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,550
What happened to my sister?

197
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,470
Seems like she just cried.

198
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,580
Is everything okay?

199
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,620
Alright. You should go back now.

200
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,620
Why should I go back?

201
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,060
Go back first.

202
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,380
We... We haven’t finished.

203
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,050
Just go.

204
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,180
So, so you’re not mad anymore?

205
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,260
Just go, please.

206
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,620
Give me a smile.

207
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,700
Smile.

208
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,260
Don’t be mad.

209
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,790
Just go.

210
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,820
I’m going. Don’t be mad.

211
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,560
I actually made it to the concert

212
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,820
three years ago.

213
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,630
But suddenly something went wrong
with my eyes.

214
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,670
So I left.

215
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,940
I could be temporarily blind.

216
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,320
Not only on the day of the concert,

217
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,750
it started even earlier

218
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,310
on the night at the beach.

219
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,680
I left without saying goodbye
for surgery.

220
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,400
(The 62nd All-star Championship)

221
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,550
It was a risky surgery.

222
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,470
It failed on the first time.

223
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,670
Han Shangyan took me to transfer
to different hospitals.

224
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,740
There were three surgeries in total.

225
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,580
I remained blind off and on

226
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,870
(The 62nd All-star Championship)
for a year.

227
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,830
(Goal: Win 300 games)
300 games...

228
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,280
(Goal: Win 300 games)

229
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,180
Are you okay? You left

230
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,580
without notice today.

231
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,990
I went back to our old home.

232
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,800
To visit Dad?

233
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,030
No.

234
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,380
Jing.

235
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,430
Do you remember here?

236
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,590
What’s this?

237
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,500
This is where we used to live.

238
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,190
The street light went on and off

239
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,310
from time to time three years ago.

240
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,710
I almost

241
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,820
fell right there many times.

242
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,440
And then?

243
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,390
It suddenly got fixed

244
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,060
one day by someone.

245
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,360
There are these flowers

246
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,580
drawn on the wall.

247
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,990
I knew later

248
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,710
that its name is forget-me-not.

249
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,380
Wu Bai left all these.

250
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,920
This is so romantic.

251
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,260
Three years ago,

252
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,870
Wu Bai disappeared all of a sudden.

253
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,510
I thought he just left without notice.

254
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,590
But he actually went to treat his eyes.

255
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,270
I’ve only known that he left me

256
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,060
the forget-me-not until today.

257
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,440
On the road which I pass by

258
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,830
every day I go home.

259
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,240
Aren’t you touched by it?

260
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,190
Wu Bai’s feelings for me

261
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,550
is indeed much deeper

262
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,480
than I imagine.

263
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,140
So,

264
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,320
would you let go of your concerns

265
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,120
and reconsider it?

266
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,620
Captain.

267
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,240
Morning.

268
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,710
Well, I’ve always forgotten to ask you

269
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,240
until I saw her that day.

270
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,070
Did Ai Qing join SP for real?

271
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,800
Are you okay?

272
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,950
She’s back to the circle.

273
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,500
I feel happy for her.

274
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,480
She was born for this after all,

275
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,000
she shouldn’t have left.

276
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,040
That’s true.

277
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,830
According to Ai Qing’s talent,

278
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,190
it’s surely a good thing for her.

279
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,920
However,

280
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,320
she becomes the biggest enemy of K&K.

281
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,930
Your love life may be tough.

282
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,630
I’ve thought about it.

283
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,920
As long as she discovers her own value,

284
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,190
I’m happy wherever she goes.

285
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,040
You didn’t think so before.

286
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,040
You insisted that I should join K&K.

287
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,130
I’m leaving for SP now.

288
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:14,800
See you.

289
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Bye.

290
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,120
I’m leaving.

291
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,950
-I’m leaving for real.
-Go.

292
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,750
-I’m serious.
-Go away.

293
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,560
I... Never mind.

294
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,150
Wait.
Go.

295
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,120
It’s, it’s a bit pricy to go by taxi.

296
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,560
Your condition shifts
from a few days earlier.

297
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,590
Tell me.

298
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,710
Did anything happen during the time

299
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,630
when you were alone with Ai Qing?

300
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,360
Alone?

301
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,510
I didn’t know this.

302
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:35,710
It’s all because

303
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,590
of your fight with Ai Jing.

304
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,630
It made me and Captain have coffee

305
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,950
and talk with Ai Qing.

306
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,590
Ai Qing even gave us a tip.

307
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,400
What tip?

308
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,240
She said...

309
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,820
So, there’s nothing
between Slide and Ai Jing?

310
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,700
I don’t know anything.

311
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,040
I’ll get back to you later.

312
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,150
Now I’m more interested in what happened

313
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,440
when they were alone.

314
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,910
There was actually nothing.

315
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,740
We just

316
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,790
talked out a few

317
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,070
important matters.

318
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,680
Great.

319
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,560
Not a waste

320
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,380
of the opportunity I created for you.

321
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,310
What comes next would be

322
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,980
consolidating the achievement.

323
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,220
How?

324
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,740
Sending gifts.

325
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,070
Listen to my analysis.

326
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,310
Girls are into

327
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,220
things like perfume,

328
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,550
lipsticks,

329
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,070
roses and stuff.

330
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,390
Money isn’t a problem to you.

331
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,980
Just buy all these

332
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,500
and give them to Ai Qing.

333
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,680
I guarantee it’ll work.

334
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,670
I feel like

335
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,790
it’s not necessary.

336
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,670
Though 97 isn’t very reliable.

337
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,980
I think this idea

338
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,350
is applicable.

339
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,670
I’ve got an idea.

340
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,550
This fast?

341
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,150
What idea?

342
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,580
Captain, coffee.

343
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,790

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,820
your girlfriend?

513
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,090
Is it so obvious?

514
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,760
Yeah, obviously.

515
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,000
You two have that look

516
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,850
of a couple.

517
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,730
She’s not my girlfriend yet.

518
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,410
But I hope she is.

519
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,970
There’s a girl who you can’t get?

520
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,490
Signed.

521
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,600
Don’t gossip.

522
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,050
I won’t.

523
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,970
Who’s that girl?

524
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,180
Probably the girl Captain likes.

525
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,640
I can tell he looks at her differently.

526
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,760
Yeah.

527
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,090
I’ve prepared it for you. Go.

528
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,520
I’ll go and do Captain a favor.

529
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,570
Go.

530
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,730
Hello.

531
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,280
Hi.

532
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,600
Did Wu Bai ask you to come to me?

533
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,640
No.

534
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,000
Then...?

535
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,400
Nothing. I just want

536
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,770
to give you Wu Bai’s honor collection.

537
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,930
Honor collection?

538
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,410
Yeah.

539
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,450
He’s won the most honors in K&K.

540
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,970
So I’m giving it to you.

541
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,130
Okay, thank you.

542
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,280
What are you talking about?

543
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,240
Nothing.

544
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,060
Excuse me.

545
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,240
See you.

546
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,530
She said that you won
the most honors in K&K.

547
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,100
There’s a special honor collection
of you.

548
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,180
So you’ve played many games

549
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,100
during the years in Chicago.

550
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,000
How many exactly?

551
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,410
Have you counted?

552
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,250
More than two hundred.

553
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,890
I have twelve individual competitions
this time.

554
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,740
If I win them all,

555
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,100
my victories add up to three hundred.

556
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,600
That’s what “three hundred” means.

557
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,890
What?

558
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,210
Nothing.

559
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,280
Winning them all?

560
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,340
You really aren’t nervous about SP.

561
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:12,690
By the way,

562
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,330
is the competition terrain
far from here?

563
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,060
I’d like to check on it.

564
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,130
No, it’s not.

565
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,650
But it’s too late now.

566
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,770
I’ll take you there tomorrow.

567
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,690
Okay.

568
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,490
Go back.

569
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,460
See you tomorrow.

570
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,480
Hello, Wu Bai.

571
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,240
Here’s the main stadium of Chicago.

572
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,370
This is the fighting area.

573
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,210
That’s the main stage.

574
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,980
Hey, how are you doing?

575
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,890
Welcome back. Long time no see.

576
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,340
I’m good. Long time no see.

577
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,770
Sorry, but I’m going now.

578
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,130
See you, guys.

579
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,520
You know each other?

580
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,980
We’ve played games a few times here.

581
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,220
This is my first time

582
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,740
standing on an international
playing field.

583
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,700
It’s kind of magical.

584
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,740
We’re not players
in the same generation,

585
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,100
but both are standing here
at the same time.

586
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,130
Let’s win, together.

587
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,980
Don’t worry.

588
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,460
The champion belongs to China.

589
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,480
(Han Shangyan)

590
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,060
It’s Han.

591
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,820
Hey, Han.

592
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,580
Hey. How come you answer this slowly?

593
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,490
You didn’t want to answer, right?

594
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,070
I... No.

595
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,740
I didn’t mean that.

596
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,180
Let me tell you.

597
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,860
Don’t embarrass Ai Qing.

598
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,370
You’re with her.

599
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,460
You should greet me knowing
it’s my call.

600
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,980
Give it back to her.

601
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,860
Let me talk to her first.

602
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,020
It’s fine. Let me talk to him.

603
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,180
Don’t worry.

604
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,940
I won’t eat her alive.

605
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,860
-I doubt you can digest well.
-Go away.

606
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,740
Hello, Han.

607
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,650
Hi, Ai Qing. Where are you?

608
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,110
We’re at the playing field.

609
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,340
This is my first time

610
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,070
standing on an international
playing field.

611
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,180
If our team

612
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,490
didn’t dissolve at that time.

613
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,580
Me, you,

614
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,980
Xiaomi, Solo and Ou Qiang

615
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,410
would have

616
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,610
probably been here before.

617
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,460
Han.

618
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,340
I...

619
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,110
I’ve always owed you

620
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,180
an official apology.

621
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,060
Don’t make it so miserable.

622
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,370
I’m afraid Bai may kill me later.

623
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,130
Women are always like this,

624
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,340
getting all sentimental without reasons.

625
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,500
I know.

626
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,740
I’m...

627
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,020
Emotional.

628
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,900
You’re not only emotional,

629
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,420
but also have a good memory.

630
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,490
Don’t meet me

631
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,190
and act like a mouse before a cat.

632
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,260
It’s all in the past.

633
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,060
I, I don’t.

634
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,770
I have a rather poor memory.

635
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,650
I’ve forgotten everything from the past.

636
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,180
You should, too.

637
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,740
Let’s all do.

638
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,750
Ai Qing.

639
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,300
Actually, Bai is pretty good.

640
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,770
Why?

641
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,890
Are you

642
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,830
trying to be a wingman?

643
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,700
I’m not.

644
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,190
So,

645
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,660
SP comes with K&K.

646
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,420
We should win the champion, right?

647
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,020
No problem.

648
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,250
I’ll ask my kids in K&K

649
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,590
to try their best.

650
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,950
SP doesn’t have a chance.

651
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,950
That’s very arrogant.

652
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,020
It’s called confidence.

653
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,990
Join us to dinner tonight.

654
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,310
We haven’t got together in a while.

655
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,990
I can’t, I have things to do.

656
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,030
Gotta go, see you.

657
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,030
Han.

658
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,950
He hasn’t changed

659
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,820
at all after all these years.

660
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,190
Who’d know?

661
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,470
After all these years,

662
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,100
I’m back to this field again.

663
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,950
Can you imagine?
Two months ago,

664
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,060
I was staying in my store
and selling goods.

665
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,510
Who can imagine that?

666
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,030
You don’t say.

667
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,310
I’ve never retired.

668
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,470
During the ten years,

669
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,040
I’ve switched to different teams.

670
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,620
Now thinking about it,

671
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,110
I feel the happiest to be

672
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,580
with you guys.

673
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,100
What about me?

674
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,750
I was running a business

675
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,230
in my little aeromodel store.

676
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,990
Who’d know

677
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,820
I’m now the Captain of

678
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,510
SP Team I?

679
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,470
If anyone has told me that,

680
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,190
I’d think he’s crazy.

681
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,620
Here. Cheers.

682
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,800
Cheers.

683
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,550
I was probably in my
primary school ten years ago

684
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,750
and middle school five years ago.

685
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,030
I was playing the tournament
abroad two months ago.

686
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,760
Yeah.

687
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,790
What?

688
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,630
Are you bragging about

689
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,390
your age in front of your seniors?

690
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,550
You’re old enough to be my uncles.

691
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,510
What a show-off.

692
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,560
Wait... You’re not an uncle.

693
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,710
You’re a brother.

694
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,550
That’s alright.

695
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,950
Seriously.

696
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,150
Boss invited these many

697
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,800
former players of Solo Team

698
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,030
to form Team I

699
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,320
and a kid to be the main operator.

700
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,790
We weren’t convinced.

701
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,070
We didn’t understand, either.

702
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,590
In wine there’s truth.

703
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,550
You didn’t even drink much.

704
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,750
Yeah.

705
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,710
Xiaomi.

706
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,790
Entering Team I

707
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,390
is the dream of all of our players
in Team II.

708
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,230
Who wouldn’t want
to represent SP to play?

709
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,350
Isn’t that right?

710
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,380
The second I saw Slide

711
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,510
taking out his mecha design drawing

712
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,430
and Lin Yin operating in the game.

713
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,990
I was completely convinced.

714
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,990
Words lie

715
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,870
but ability doesn’t.

716
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,900
To be honest,

717
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,960
joining SP Team

718
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,830
is the happiest thing in my life.

719
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,820
A toast

720
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,140
to all of you.

721
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,560
-Come on.
-Cheers.

722
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,830
-To all of us.
-To all of us.

723
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,230
I can tell

724
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,190
that all of you

725
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,860
had a tough time during these years.

726
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,470
Doggie.

727
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,030
You’ve experienced

728
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,960
the most all these years.

729
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,280
You like

730
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,190
taking everyone’s responsibilities

731
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,060
on yourself.

732
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,200
Girl. Listen to me,

733
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,030
everyone should be responsible
for their own life

734
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,520
but not other people’s.

735
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,950
We

736
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,040
chose our own paths.

737
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,350
Besides,

738
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,320
no one thinks we’re living a bad life.

739
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,520
Yeah.

740
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,100
I agree.

741
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,520
In my opinion,

742
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,950
all of the setbacks we’ve experienced

743
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,710
are positive.

744
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,710
We won’t be who we are now
without them.

745
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,470
For example,

746
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,960
now my only wish is

747
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,620
to be a good captain of SP Team I.

748
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,240
We should all look forward.

749
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,870
Yeah.

750
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,470
SP is the best.

751
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,560
We’ll try our best

752
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,720
in tomorrow’s competition

753
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,790
to get good record.

754
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,960
We won’t shame our coach.

755
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,310
Though you’re not

756
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,190
representing the club to play,

757
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,830
you’re

758
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,200
the main operator of the team.

759
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,230
The first game of an international.

760
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,200
We’ll try hard!

761
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,800
I have a few words.

762
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,320
I think

763
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,110
you shouldn’t have too much stress.

764
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,590
Because in my eyes,

765
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,390
you are always the best.

766
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,190
So,

767
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,060
just try your best.

768
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,350
It’s the same for you.

769
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,520
As long as you’re happy,

770
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,340
it’s the only thing we hope for.

771
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,910
Come on.

772
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,430
It’s an honor to fight

773
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,800
with you.

774
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,320
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

775
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,430
Maybe Wu Bai is right.

776
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,520
Everyone

777
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,070
is moving on.

778
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,150
Perhaps now

779
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,200
I should let go of some of the past.

780
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,580
Let’s go.

781
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,550
-Give me your hand.
-Hurry.

782
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,670
What’s wrong?
You didn’t even drink much.

783
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,390
Yeah.

784
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,350
See you.

785
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,240
-I’m fine.
-Bye.

786
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,560
-Don’t help her, she’s stubborn.
-Bye.

787
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,990
If I don’t help,
who do you want to help you?

788
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,520
I want

789
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,040
Xiaomi to help me.

790
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,240
Come on, see straight.

791
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,350
I’m right here.

792
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,110
-Ou Qiang, shut up.
-Ou Qiang, shut up.

793
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,670
Ou Qiang, shut up.

794
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,530
Come on.

795
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,870
Be careful.

796
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,110
-Ou Qiang and I will go first.
-Wait.

797
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,760
Come back. Slide.

798
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,390
Good luck, Xiaomi.

799
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,760
Xiaomi.
You...

800
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,240
Are you okay?

801
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,960
I’m fine.

802
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,480
Come on. Don’t throw up.

803
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,630
Don’t throw up.

804
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,110
We’re almost there.

805
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,280
Hello?

806
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,720
What did you say

807
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,320
to Ai Qing today?

808
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,160
No comment.

809
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,520
She already feels guilty.

810
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,390
Don’t upset her.

811
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,590
What could I say?

812
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,320
I just said that you two don’t fit.

813
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,640
She should ignore you.

814
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,590
Is that okay?

815
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,360
Gotta go. Bye.

816
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Come on.

817
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,520
I can walk straight, Xiaomi.

818
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
Quiet down. We’re almost home.

819
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,040
Okay.

820
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,320
How come you look shorter, Xiaomi?

821
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,390
I’m always this high.

822
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,210
You’re fatter, too.

823
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,210
Yeah?

824
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,080
My room is...

825
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,970
My room is here.

826
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:02,670
That way.

827
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,280
That way, that way.

828
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,600
I know.

829
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,250
That’s my room.

830
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,040
Yeah, it is.

831
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,000
-Where’s the room card?
-I can walk straight.

832
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,760
Oh my god.

833
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,490
-Here it is.
-Great.

834
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,150
Rest early. Come on.

835
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,520
Okay.

836
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,290
I’m home.

837
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,920
You shouldn’t come in, Xiaomi.

838
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,280
It’s a girl’s room.

839
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,520
Good night.

840
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Have a good rest.

841
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,390
-Bye.
-Bye.

842
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,280
Have a good rest.

843
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,240
Bye.

844
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,040
I’m finally home.

845
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,570
Where’s my phone?

846
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,000
Whose message?

847
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,870
It’s Jing.

848
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,830
What to reply?

849
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,150
Jing, when you’re here.

850
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,150
Buy me some,

851
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,430
some apple vinegar.

852
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,160
I’ll wait for you.

853
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,810
Thanks.

854
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,330
Please hurry.

855
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,070
Jing, when you’re here.

856
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,960
