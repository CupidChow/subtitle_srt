But,

20
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,940
I haven’t prepared any gift.

21
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,470
When you’re with me,

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,500
it’s the best gift for me.

23
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,300
Wu Bai.

24
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,510
Hurry and show us your Wu...

25
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,260
Actually, I also know
something about Wu Liao.

26
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,000
Well...

27
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,820
Go ahead.

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
I’ll be right back.

29
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,590
Ai Qing.

30
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,460
You really scared me.

31
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,020
This is just for you.

32
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,540
Thank you.

33
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,990
I’m so sorry today.

34
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,820
I was too busy

35
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,910
to talk to you.

36
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,510
You can call me

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,990
if you have any emergency.

38
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,150
No way.

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,350
There is something
that you can talk on the phone.

40
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,740
But as for this,

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,620
I think it’s better to

42
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,460
tell you in person.

43
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,110
What’s the emergency

44
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,630
that you have to tell me in person?

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,360
Look.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,230
You are the Goddess

47
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,020
in the armor circle.

48
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,910
You are the idol for thousands of boys.

49
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,870
Right?

50
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,070
But,

51
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,350
you have broken up
with Solo for years.

52
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,720
Haven’t you ever thought about
rekindling your romance?

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Get to the point.

54
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,520
The point is what do you

55
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,150
think of me?

56
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,910
You?

57
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,380
Is this some kind of joke, Mr. Xiang?

58
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,360
What?

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,150
Is today April Fool’s Day?

60
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,030
What April Fool’s Day?

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,540
Ai Qing.

62
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,470
Listen.

63
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,440
Mr.

64
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,030
Xiang!

65
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,550
You just found

66
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,600
a match for your cousin.

67
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,100
Now you are doing it for yourself.

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,110
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,670
How can you eavesdrop on
a conversation of adults?

70
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,470
Sorry.

71
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,600
It’s your first time. I’ll forgive you.

72
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,320
Since you heard it,

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,660
there is nothing I’m afraid of.

74
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,660
From today,

75
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,950
I will formally pursue Ai Qing.

76
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,790
But why did I hear

77
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,470
that you also pursued Tong Nian?

78
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,760
Keep it down.

79
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,640
What are you talking about?

80
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,190
Don’t be ridiculous, okay?

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,390
How can I poach Han Shangyan’s person?

82
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,100
Hello, guys.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,750
Sorry I’m late.

84
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,630
There was a traffic jam.

85
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,270
Solo.

86
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:44,880
You are here.

87
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,070
You go ahead first.

88
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,780
Solo, there you are.

89
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,660
Hello.

90
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,200
You are too generous

91
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,920
with the gift.

92
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,390
It’s just a little gift.

93
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,110
Open it.

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,720
Here.

95
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,230
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

96
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,000
Where’s Wu Bai?

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,830
He is inside.

98
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,800
I’ll go in.

99
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,200
Ai Qing, I want to tell you

100
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,790
that I really...!

101
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,400
It’s useless.

102
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,400
Admire...

103
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,790
She has a crush on someone.

104
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,360
Who?

105
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,640
Who? Why do I not know it?

106
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,280
Not to mention you,

107
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,350
I don’t know it, either.

108
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,110
He

109
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,120
doesn’t eat vinegar.

110
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,550
I told you.

111
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,960
I’ve always been allergic to vinegar.

112
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,840
How about vinegar cabbage?

113
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,720
No need.

114
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,890
I don’t eat vinegar.

115
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,550
Come on, drink.

116
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,390
Thank you.

117
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,770
Well,

118
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,490
it’s time for me to get back.

119
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,360
I have a report to write.

120
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,490
What report?

121
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,450
The training plan.

122
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,920
I have a lot of research to do.

123
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,000
Wu Bai is basically a data bank.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,440
Just ask him if you have any questions.

125
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,280
Right?

126
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,840
I’ll help you do it.

127
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,600
Okay.

128
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,770
Let’s go.

129
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,170
We need two persons here. Who is coming?

130
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,390
-Me! I’m coming!
-And me!

131
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,770
I’m full anyway.

132
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,610
I’ll draw cards.

133
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,080
You are done.

134
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,840
One more time. One more time.

135
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,890
Impossible.

136
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,350
It’s impossible.

137
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,010
How can you not tell me about it?

138
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,210
I found out I was pregnant
after breaking up with you.

139
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,040
Then why are you keeping it from me?

140
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,080
Why didn’t you tell me?

141
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,210
She’s ill.

142
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
She needs treatment.

143
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,390
But I can’t even

144
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,680
support myself now.

145
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,000
Solo.

146
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,640
Can you keep her?

147
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,830
Your team is doing great now.

148
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,400
You can make a lot of money.

149
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,350
It won’t be a problem for you
to raise a little girl.

150
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,640
She is really your daughter!

151
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,280
I have a birth certificate.

152
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,080
Or if you

153
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,450
want to do any test,

154
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,360
I’ll do it with you.

155
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,610
I am sorry.

156
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,840
There is nothing
you should be sorry for.

157
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,510
It’s just...

158
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,650
How should I tell Ai Qing about...?

159
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,080
What are you doing here, Ai Qing?

160
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,080
Is what she said true?

161
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,970
Ai Qing.

162
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,850
Go back first.

163
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,800
I’ll explain everything
to you later, all right?

164
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,290
Solo, is she really your daughter?

165
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,560
She is Solo’s daughter.

166
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,890
Do you have time?

167
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,480
I want to talk to you.

168
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,090
Okay.

169
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,560
Go ahead. What’s wrong?

170
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,360
I have something to discuss with you.

171
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,850
But

172
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,410
I don’t know how to say it.

173
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,040
What’s the matter?

174
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,730
During all these years,

175
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,970
I didn’t formally apologize to you.

176
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,040
If I didn’t leave Xiao’ai to you

177
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,100
in a moment of desperation,

178
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,450
you and

179
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,810
Ai Qing wouldn’t break up.

180
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,250
No.

181
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,540
It has nothing to do
with you and Xiao’ai

182
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,610
that I didn’t remarry.

183
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,610
I am sorry.

184
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,370
It’s over.

185
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,540
Let’s not mention it again.

186
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,600
We are

187
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,300
in our thirties now.

188
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,970
We’ve spent almost half of our lives.

189
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,810
All right, go back.

190
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,860
I want to take Xiao’ai abroad.

191
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,920
What do you mean?

192
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,410
I want to take Xiao’ai abroad.

193
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,460
I want to raise her.

194
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,890
That’s why you ask me out?

195
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,930
Yes.

196
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,250
Do you think our daughter is an object?

197
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,130
You gave birth to her as you want,

198
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,220
but you failed to
take the responsibility.

199
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,540
You thought you can’t
afford to raise her,

200
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,780
so you left her to me.

201
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,220
You married a rich man
and live a better life,

202
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,560
and you want her back now.

203
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,120
Have you ever thought about
her feelings?

204
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,970
I want to make up for her, Solo.

205
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,540
Solo, I have always
wanted to make up for her.

206
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,340
Do you think I’m having a good time?

207
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,780
Solo.

208
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,730
Calm down.

209
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,810
I’m discussing with you now.

210
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,730
I would never agree to it.

211
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,220
I believe

212
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,120
Xiao’ai won’t want to go with you.

213
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,490
I can give her better treatment.

214
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,220
And I will always be with Xiao’ai.

215
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,860
What’s more,

216
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,010
she is growing up,

217
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,930
there are a lot of things

218
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,130
that are more convenient for her
to talk to her mother.

219
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,430
Su Cheng.

220
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,460
You are too selfish.

221
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,050
Xiao’ai is looking for me.

222
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,130
I should go back.

223
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,540
My room is a little messy.

224
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,780
Let me tidy it up.

225
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,370
He has a secret.

226
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,860
You can come in!

227
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,430
I’m coming in!

228
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,690
The room is a little messy.

229
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,540
Why are you leaning against it?

230
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,690
I...

231
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,820
It’s comfortable.

232
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,500
Were you hiding it

233
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,580
when you kept me at the door?

234
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,380
Is there any secret?

235
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,810
It’s just some material.

236
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,170
There is nothing special.

237
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,810
I understand.

238
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,250
Boys

239
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,820
have their own little secrets.

240
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,140
It’s not that kind of secret.

241
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,550
All right, I won’t tease you.

242
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,130
Your box is special.

243
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,900
Why are there so many hearts on it?

244
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,980
What are you doing?

245
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,170
I know you too well, Captain.

246
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:04,910
You will put up the poster

247
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,470
of your Goddess wherever you go.

248
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,310
So I got this collection box

249
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,100
specially for you.

250
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,460
You can put your favorite

251
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,910
posters and magazines in it.

252
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,860
How is it?

253
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,940
Well...

254
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,370
Why did you draw so many hearts on it?

255
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,550
You are a fan.

256
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,180
Administrator permission.

257
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,740
The box is unlocked.

258
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,690
Administrator permission?

259
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,380
Is there anything wrong with the box?

260
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,470
It’s fine.

261
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,870
I set it.

262
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,990
I set you as the administrator

263
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,910
for all my locks.

264
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,340
Apart from the secrets of the club,

265
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,700
you are never off-limits.

266
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,940
You can see it if you want.

267
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,500
No need.

268
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,620
I said I won’t see your little secret.

269
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,470
I have something for you.

270
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,590
This is the model information
I searched for you.

271
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,580
It should be helpful.

272
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,620
That’s great.

273
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,500
Thank you.

274
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,240
Wu Bai.

275
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,700
Go to a place

276
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,990
with me tomorrow.

277
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,790
Don’t you ask where the place is?

278
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,430
I’ll go wherever you tell me.

279
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,350
I’m home.

280
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,820
I’ll get in.

281
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,440
See you tomorrow.

282
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,030
See you tomorrow.

283
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,480
Ai Qing!

284
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,750
I want to see you early tomorrow.

285
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,630
Good night.

286
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,670
Good night.

287
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,590
Hello.

288
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
What’s wrong?

289
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,150
Ai Qing.

290
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,040
If you need help with Xiaomi,

291
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,740
feel free to tell me.

292
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,710
How can you guess everything right?

293
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,460
It’s raining outside.

294
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,430
Are you back to K&K?

295
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,350
Not yet.

296
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,200
Ai Qing.

297
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,230
You are my first girlfriend.

298
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,350
I don’t have much experience.

299
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,990
If I make any mistake,

300
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,710
you must tell me about it.

301
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,070
You have always been great.

302
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,630
Don’t work too late.

303
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,680
Go to bed soon.

304
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,470

Why are you smiling?

328
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,110
I remembered three years ago

329
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,050
at the Shanghai Stadium.

330
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,640
I highly doubt that you asked 97

331
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,050
to take that towel.

332
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,280
I really didn’t.

333
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,110
All right.

334
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,240
I believe you.

335
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,280
I’ll get some clothes.

336
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,730
I borrowed it from you last time.

337
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,200
I forgot to give it to you.

338
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,110
Change it.

339
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,600
I have washed it.

340
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,880
Put it on.

341
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,400
Change it all?

342
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,850
Got it.

343
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,160
Go ahead, I won’t watch.

344
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,760
It’s raining hard outside.

345
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,210
Why are you here suddenly?

346
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
What’s wrong?

347
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,730
Do I need your approval to be here?

348
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,080
Why is my dad here?

349
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,780
-Your dad is here?
-Hush.

350
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,170
Hush.

351
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,570
Don’t speak. Don’t speak.

352
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,970
Where have you been?

353
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,480
I went out for a meal.

354
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,840
(Ai Qing)
Wu Bai and I are in the room.

355
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,850
Dad.

356
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,560
You came without telling us in advance.

357
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,050
I asked someone to play cards together

358
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,400
and send some food for you by the way.

359
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,510
Where’s your sister?

360
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,330
She... She went out.

361
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,330
Look.

362
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,800
I’m just a little bit late.

363
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,760
And she has gone out to have fun.

364
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,930
Is the balcony door closed?

365
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,480
The door must be closed on rainy days.

366
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,210
How many times have I told you?

367
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,920
The two of you

368
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,930
have no safety awareness at all.

369
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,880
Dad, where are you going?

370
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,280
The door of the bedroom
must be open for ventilation.

371
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,810
It’s locked.

372
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,400
Why is it locked?

373
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,560
The wind shut the door.

374
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,480
The wind shut the door?

375
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,570
What to do then?

376
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,570
Get a workman to unlock the door.

377
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,760
No need. Ai Qing has the key.

378
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
She can open it when she comes back.

379
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,570
-Just leave and go to play cards.
-Wait.

380
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,880
All right, I’ll leave.

381
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,090
Well...

382
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,240
Hold on.

383
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
Wait a minute,

384
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,690
I’ll say something to you.

385
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,520
While your sister is away,

386
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,490
I need to talk to you
about your little boyfriend.

387
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,700
Sit down.

388
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,520
I mean,

389
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,930
where are you two now?

390
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,810
Nowhere.

391
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,210
I am your father.

392
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,520
Is there anything you can’t tell me?

393
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,290
I can’t sleep these days

394
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,730
when I think about

395
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,160
you and Shen Zhe.

396
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,280
I know

397
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,240
you two are just getting started.

398
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,530
It’s fresh and sweet for you.

399
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,050
But I’m worried

400
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,690
that when

401
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,090
the passion is gone

402
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,520
after some time,

403
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,130
plus the aesthetic fatigue,

404
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,280
he is still young,

405
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,860
what if he

406
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,930
starts to change his mind?

407
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,360
What should you do then?

408
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,050
He won’t, Dad.

409
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,730
I swear I won’t.

410
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,810
Of course.

411
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,120
If you ask him now,

412
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,930
he will definitely say no.

413
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,860
But three or four years later,

414
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,290
he will be exactly thirty.

415
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,880
You will be thirty-three.

416
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,760
Girls have no advantage in age.

417
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,280
Dating a younger man

418
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,770
seems to be good at first,

419
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,860
but the disadvantage will
become more obvious later.

420
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,570
What’s more,

421
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,940
I’m thinking

422
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,130
that you haven’t met his parents, right?

423
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,220
Since you are together now,

424
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,290
why don’t you

425
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,940
let his parents know earlier?

426
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,730
Then you can also know them earlier.

427
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,400
If it can’t work,

428
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,770
you should break up with him early,

429
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,340
and it won’t be too hard for you.

430
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,740
Our family is open-minded.

431
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,010
Of course, boys are stubborn.

432
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,160
He will tell you

433
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,810
that his family is open-minded.

434
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,530
It’s because you haven’t
met his parents.

435
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,620
It’s hard for parents to be open-minded.

436
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,730
I mean, say something.

437
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,290
You kept talking. What can I say?

438
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,570
Break up with him?

439
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,240
I won’t.

440
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,970
I’m telling you the worst situation.

441
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,460
You will understand

442
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,480
when you have troubles in the future.

443
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,860
Okay, I got it.

444
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,000
Dad, just leave.

445
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,170
It’s raining hard outside.

446
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,860
Your friends are

447
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,090
waiting for you to play cards, hurry up.

448
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,280
All right, I’ll leave.

449
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,610
He is finally gone.

450
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:46,930
Well...

451
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,290
What’s wrong again?

452
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,410
It occurred to me

453
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,280
that I have a spare key.

454
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,460
What?

455
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,210
He has a spare key?

456
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,460
Dad has a spare key!

457
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,580
I told you many times

458
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,700
to close the window when you leave.

459
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,130
It’s still raining outside.

460
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,820
The rain comes in.

461
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,760
Look at it.

462
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,890
Do you see it?

463
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,460
Bad girl.

464
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,650
All right, let’s go.

465
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,340
Okay.

466
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,340
Dad, where are you going?

467
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,130
Look. You should also

468
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,240
open the cloakroom

469
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,340
for ventilation.

470
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,220
Otherwise

471
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,890
the clothes would get damp.

472
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,970
Open the curtain.

473
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,580
Dad! Your friends will be mad
if you don’t leave now.

474
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,370
All right, I’ll leave.

475
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,620
I’ll leave now, okay?

476
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,020
My dad is gone.

477
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,290
Let’s go out.

478
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,650
Let’s kiss first before we go out.

Mom.

488
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,020
Don’t worry.

489
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,990
Xiao’ai is fine.

490
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,170
She couldn’t find some stuff for school.

491
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,770
I was looking for it.

492
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,100
It’s late. Go to bed.

493
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,860
I am at the company now.

494
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,110
I have something to deal with.

495
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,340
I’ll hang up.

496
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,980
She has a crush on someone.

497
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,410
Who?

498
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,860
Why do I not know it?

499
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,020
He

500
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,180
doesn’t eat vinegar.

501
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,070
Jing, I’m leaving.

502
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,980
Why don’t you tell me

503
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,660
your mother came to Shanghai?

504
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,070
She is in the hospital?

505
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,870
Where are you going in such a hurry?

506
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,660
Shen Zhe’s mother is in the hospital.

507
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,070
I’ll go to take a look.

508
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,940
Hello?

509
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,900
I’ve arrived.

510
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,230
I’m waiting for you downstairs.

511
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,460
I’ll be right there.

512
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,710
Let’s go.

513
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,630
Thank you.

514
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,830
Hello, I want to check in.

515
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,780
Hello, please show me your ID.

516
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,260
Here.

517
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,300
Okay.

518
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,870
Okay, Miss Ai.

519
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,710
This is the double room you booked.

520
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,710
It’s not right.

521
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,230
I booked two rooms.

522
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,870
Please check it for me again.

523
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,590
Okay.

524
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,870
Well,

525
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,590
it shows that you booked

526
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,420
two rooms on the platform.

527
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,110
But due to the shortage of rooms,

528
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,310
the platform sent you a message

529
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,660
that there is only one room left.

530
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,420
Sorry.

531
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,540
I guess I didn’t notice the message.

532
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,710
Well...

533
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,590
Miss.

534
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,660
Are you going to live here?

535
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,960
Yes.

536
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,230
Okay.

537
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,600
This is your room card.

538
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,630
Our people are cleaning the room.

539
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,420
You can get in the room

540
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,030
and rest one hour later.

541
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,070
Thank you.

542
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,950
You’re welcome.

543
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,540
One hour...

544
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,150
There is a lake over there.
The scenery is really good.

545
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,470
Let’s go for a walk.

546
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,600
Shen Zhe.

547
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,500
You are really here.

548
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,020
Of course.

549
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,640
Your mother is hospitalized.

550
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,900
I have to visit her.

551
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,640
Where is she?

552
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,870
Actually, it’s not that serious.

553
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,870
She will be discharged soon.

554
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,830
Why don’t we...?

555
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,380
Are you hungry?

556
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,710
Let’s go to grab a bite.

557
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,120
I need to visit her even she is fine.

558
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,140
I even bought bird’s nest for her.

559
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,960
What’s wrong?

560
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,950
Nothing.

561
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,670
Are you hiding something from me?

562
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,760
It’s just...

563
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,110
Xing Zhouzhou...

564
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,420
Is she here?

565
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,550
She is here.

566
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,260
But that’s not the point.

567
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,880
The point is...

568
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,990
What’s the point?

569
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,510
She also said

570
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,300
something bad to my mom.

571
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,120
What did she say?

572
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,960
Just some

573
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,390
pointless nonsense.

574
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,350
Anyway, my mom

575
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,600
must be angry now.

576
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,790
Let’s not see her.

577
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,030
You can come next time.

578
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,420
Alright?

579
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,880
Let’s go and eat something delicious.

580
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,260
Come on, let’s take a look.

581
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,470
I mean it.

582
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,390
You will be angry if you go.

583
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,660
I have to face it
sooner or later, right?

584
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,070
Let’s make a deal first.

585
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,510
You can’t be angry.

586
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,430
Let me take it for you.

587
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,990
Let’s go.

588
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,790
Zhouzhou.

589
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,790
It’s been hard for you these days.

590
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,310
I’m not tired, Ma’am.

591
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,830
Look.

592
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,760
-Mom.
-Your face gets thinner.

593
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,110
This is my girlfriend.

594
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,990
Ai Jing.

595
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,080
-Hello, Ma’am.
-She brought the bird’s nest for you.

596
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,790
Watch your hands.

597
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,150
It’s okay, Ma’am. Don’t worry.

598
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,310
Be careful.

599
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,140
Give it to me.

600
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,670
Give it to me.

601
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,880
I...

602
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,270
It’s full of stuff

603
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,510
brought by Zhouzhou.

604
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,720
Make some space for it.

605
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,510
Okay.

606
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,640
Zhouzhou.

607
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,670
-These days...
-Have some pears.

608
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,310
Thank you for coming

609
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,190
and making me happy.

610
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,310
I’m getting better faster.

611
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,430
Mom.

612
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,430
Xing Zhouzhou also has her own life.

613
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,270
Let’s not bother her
with our own affairs anymore.

614
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,480
I want to come by myself.

615
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,550
Ma’am watched me grow up.

616
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,880
When she is sick,

617
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,030
even my parents asked me to
take care of her for a few days.

618
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,080
Zhouzhou is sensible and filial indeed.

619
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,960
I have always liked you
since you were a kid.

620
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,090
Mom.

621
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,960
This is my girlfriend.

622
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Ai Jing.

623
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,880
Ma’am.

624
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,560
Miss Ai, sorry.

625
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,120
I’m sick.

626
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,320
I don’t want to talk too much.

627
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,150
It’s okay.

628
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,640
Are you feeling better?

629
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,120
I’m much better.

630
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:17,510
Zhouzhou comes here every day
and makes me happy.

631
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,430
Otherwise...

632
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,960
-Mom!
-I don’t know what to do.

633
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,790
Mom.

634
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,360
Ai Jing came here to visit you.

635
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,840
Miss Ai.

636
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,120
How did you meet Shen Zhe?

637
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,670
Were you two classmates?

638
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,880
You look quite mature.

639
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,880
We were not classmates.

640
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
I am three years older than him.

641
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,120
Three years older?

642
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,970
When Shen Zhe and I were in high school,

643
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,190
you were already a freshman?

644
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,490
Xing Zhouzhou.

645
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,720
Zhouzhou.

646
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,270
I mean...

647
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,200
Well...

648
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,850
By the way,

649
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,120
girls tend to

650
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,430
mature earlier than boys.

651
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,670
You are together now,

652
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,680
do you have much in common?

653
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,390
We do.

654
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,790
I’m childish, he’s mature.

655
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,440
We have no problem

656
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,730
with communication.

657
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,720
What do your parents think?

658
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,640
Do they think that he is
too young, childish

659
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,930
and not reliable?

660
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,800
My dad likes him a lot.

661
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,230
But,

662
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,880
when a girl gets old,

663
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,640
she will...

664
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,280
Mom, stop it.

665
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,480
What kind of question is that?

666
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,760
What’s wrong with my questions?

667
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,410
I’m your mother.
I’m asking for your good.

668
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,760
-The more questions I ask...
-All right.

669
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,750
Have some rest.

670
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,200
We should leave.

671
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,800
Ma’am, have some rest.

672
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,510
I’ll come to see you later.

673
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,760
Don’t be angry, have some pears.

674
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,470
Ai Jing.

675
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,470
You are the best.

676
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,880
You know how to make me happy.

677
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,160
Ai Jing!

678
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,160
Ai Jing!

679
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,030
Ai Jing!

680
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,840
Let me explain!

681
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,920
Don’t follow me!

682
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,560
I mean,

683
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,960
you promised that you won’t be angry.

684
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,520
Why are you...?

685
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,200
Stop.

686
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,370
Can you leave me alone for a while?

687
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,090
Ai Jing.

688
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,450
Xing Zhouzhou.

689
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,370
Come out with me.

690
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,690
Go ahead.

691
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,210
What’s wrong?

She asked me. How can I not answer her?
