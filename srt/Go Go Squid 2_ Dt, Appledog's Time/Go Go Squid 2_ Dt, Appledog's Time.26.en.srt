What are you doing here?

00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,420

00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,900
I don’t want to be involved

Let me show you somewhere.

37

Wait for me

38
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,580
here.

39
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,940
Ten years ago,

40
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,740
when Solo Team won

41
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,420
the national champion,

42
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,780
I was there.

43
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,140
I was sitting right here

44
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,660
to watch a brilliant game

45
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,940
and the post-game interview.

46
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,380
As the sole female player in the team,

47
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,700
what do you want to say

48
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,660
to everybody after winning this game?

49
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,620
Please don’t call us players.

50
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,420
Actually,

51
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,660
we are the same as

52
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,820
all the other athletes.

53
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,140
We are athletes, too.

54
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,460
(2010 China Robot National Finals)
Every game started from zero.

55
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,300
Failure or success,

56
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,820
only the athlete’s personal skill

57
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,540
can determine all this.

58
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,500
As long as you’re powerful

59
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,620
and good enough,

60
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,740
you’ll win other people’s respect.

61
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,340
Even more,

62
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,220
the world will see your tactics

63
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,700
as the model.

64
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,540
This is what robot fighting is about.

65
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,700
Right at this stadium,

66
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,140
I watched your game for the first time.

67
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,260
You and my brother
won the national champion.

68
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,980
But I was just someone

69
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,020
who watched on the spectator seats.

70
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,020
You cried after winning.

71
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,460
Everybody cheered for you.

72
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,140
They call you
the Robot Fighting Goddess.

00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,540
I’m going up.

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,940
Aren’t you gonna go?

177
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,260
I’ll go after you get home.

178
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,820
Dad.

179
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,100
Uncle.

180
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,380
Bai is here.

181
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,220
What are you doing here, Dad?

182
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,500
I brought you some food.

183
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,180
Your sister has told me.

184
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,860
Bai is a good kid.

185
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,420
Don’t bully him.

186
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,620
When have I ever bullied him, Dad?

187
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,940
Alright, take your time.

188
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,620
Take your time.

189
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,420
Standing here makes me look taller.

190
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,060
Compromise first when having
an argument.

191
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,980
It’s a survival skill for men.

192
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,180
Alright.

193
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,420
I’m going back.

194
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,860
Be careful, Dad.

195
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,860
Take care, Uncle.

196
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,740
What did my father say?

197
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,860
He said that I should

198
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,420
talk to you nicely more.

199
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,540
Well,

200
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,100
how are you gonna do it?

201
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,060
How was it?

202
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,980
Not bad.

203
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,500
We’re in a public place.

204
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,420
I’ll go up with you.

205
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,940
Let’s go.

206
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,620
It’s late already.

207
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,740
I should go.

208
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,620
Can you...

209
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,500
Go after I fall asleep?

210
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,980
The competition is coming.

211
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,060
Have a good rest.

212
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,460
Adjust yourself a bit.

213
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,180
I’ve been waiting for it for long.

214
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,060
Why?

215
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,740
I want to beat you.

216
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,420
Go to sleep.

00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,860
I’ve told you there’s a

224
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,900
bigger surprise for you,

225
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,420
remember?

226
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,540
Of course.

227
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,140
It’s so mysterious.

228
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,660
What is it exactly?

229
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,180
Let our coach tell you.

230
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,700
You have a new coach?

231
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,900
We just signed him.

232
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,580
Do I know him?

233
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,700
Doggie.

234
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,980
Long time no see.

235
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,220
Xiaomi?

236
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,220
You went to K&K

237
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,500
to be their coach?

238
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Yeah.

239
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,900
I couldn’t leave this industry
after all.

240
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,580
Let me buy some water for you.

241
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,300
Why didn’t you notice me

242
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,540
before becoming their new coach?

243
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,060
Traitor.

244
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,580
How come your eyes swell?

245
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,140
I’ve got sand in my eyes, okay?

246
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,220
What’s with you

247
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,900
and K&K’s captain, Wu Bai?

248
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,820
The boundary between us is pretty clear.

249
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,580
We rarely talk about work.

250
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,180
Alright.

251
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,420
I’ll stop.

252
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,620
By the way,

253
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,980
he’s a great guy.

254
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
Besides,

255
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,980
though I’m K&K’s new coach.

256
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,460
Please tell Slide

257
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,100
and Ou Qiang for me

258
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,500
not to lose faces.

259
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,620
I’ll watch every game of them.

260
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,420
Show their juniors what’s it like

261
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,420
when the best return.

262
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,220
Okay.

263
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,940
I’ll tell them.

264
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,420
You came early.

265
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,140
It’s for you.

266
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,300
This is...?

267
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,020
Your upgraded design for Sea Breeze.

268
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,180
You published the design philosophy
of Sea Breeze.

269
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,940
I don’t want to take advantage of you.

270
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,620
Thanks.

271
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,780
I hate to part with K&K

272
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,460
and you guys, too.

273
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,980
Alright.

274
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,940
Cut it off.

275
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,620
Go and update it.

276
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,580
Or I’ll still beat you

277
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,060
next time we see each other.

278
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,700
I won’t let you win.

279
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,260
Take care.

280
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,060
Let’s go.

281
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,140
I’ll see you off.

282
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,020
Guys.

283
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,300
The new member has come.

284
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,900
Hello.

285
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,500
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

286
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,900
These are some daily necessities.

287
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,780
Bed sheets and blankets

288
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,060
will be delivered to you
in the afternoon.

289
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,580
What’s this?

290
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,420
This is

291
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,300
an old tradition of Solo Team.

292
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,140
To quote Solo,

293
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,660
I’m responsible for all

294
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,420
of your health.

295
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,780
That’s the captain of Solo Team.

296
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,260
Okay, now you’ve come to SP.

297
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,020
Let me introduce you.

298
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,420
Lin Yin.

299
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,660
Our group’s favorite.

300
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,340
He is innocent, kind
and loves to cry.

301
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,940
Of course.

302
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,820
He never backs off at crucial moments.

303
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,260
He kills the enemies after
wiping away his tears.

304
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,460
I don’t know why.

305
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,460
I do cry a lot.

306
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,700
Next, pay attention to the one
next to you.

307
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,940
He’s a playboy.

308
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,300
He’s rhetoric.

309
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,460
When meeting pretty girls,

310
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,580
he can’t move.

311
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Don’t listen to him.

312
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,660
I’m just lightening up the atmosphere.

313
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:12,780
Of course.

314
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,100
He’s pretty reliable
when it’s important.

315
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,980
Lastly,

316
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,980
Fu Yiwen, the head of rear services.

317
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,020
Come to me whenever

318
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,540
you need anything.

319
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,660
It’s time to introduce yourself.

320
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,580
Why do you want to play professionally?

321
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,180
Maybe because I’m too talented.

322
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,180
You won’t be more talented than Lin Yin.

323
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:30,940
Right?

324
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,060
You’re pretty arrogant.

325
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,100
Save up the

326
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,180
energy.

327
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,180
Alright, let’s be serious.

328
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,860
We officially welcome you to SP.

329
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,580
Here.

330
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,820
Okay.

331
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,340
We’ll be brothers for life.

332
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,260
SP, SP.

333
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
Guys.

334
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,660
Let me introduce our new coach,

335
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,580
Xiaomi.

336
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,220
I believe you all know him.

337
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,420
Mi Shaofei?

338
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,740
Hello, I’m Mi Shaofei.

339
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,020
I’ll be the coach of K&K
starting from today.

340
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,980
Hopefully I can help everyone.

341
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,140
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

342
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,300
So, Captain.

343
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,580
That’s what you meant that day?

344
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,020
The national finals are coming.

345
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,220
I’ve got an idea.

346
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,300
Let’s talk about it.

347
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,260
Okay.

348
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,100
Since both teams have finished
stuff augment,

349
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,580
the competition over the champion

350
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,340
between SP and K&K
has officially started.

351
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,220
I think they’ll send Wu Bai

352
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,980
to play in the first round.

353
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,860
It’d be the safest tactic.

354
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,580
But I think it’d be Shen Zhe.

355
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,300
After all, Trash Can is more suitable

356
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,220
for tag match than The Nobody.

357
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,980
I think I should play
for the first round

358
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,060
of tag match.

359
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,180
Tag match is the strong point
of Trash Can.

360
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,780
I think we should use this advantage.

361
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,460
Ai Qing, what do you think?

362
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,740
I think it doesn’t matter who they send.

363
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,540
It’s how we play

364
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,580
this game that matters.

365
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,220
Whoever plays first doesn’t matter,

366
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,020
we should speculate their coping style

367
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,940
precisely instead.

368
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,340
If you play first,

369
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,980
Lin Yin won’t be a problem.

370
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,460
I can make a tie with Tao Qitao.

371
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,580
I will play conservatively

372
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,020
to stifle him.

373
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,300
I think our chance of winning is bigger.

374
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,940
As for personal ability,

375
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,180
Lin Yin is more immature than Wu Bai.

376
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,620
Qitao has just got on the team.

377
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,060
He hasn’t fitted in well.

378
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,660
Wouldn’t it be hard for him
to compete with Shen Zhe?

379
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,380
If we’re talking about one to one,

380
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,820
my chance of winning Shen Zhe

381
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,140
is thirty percent.

382
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,420
There’s still

383
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,060
a huge gap between me and my idol.

384
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,580
In this case,

385
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,020
our overall chance of winning isn’t big.

386
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,020
What’s wrong with you guys?

387
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,020
We haven’t started playing

388
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,340
but are already losing the faith.

389
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,820
Coach.

390
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,300
Tell us what to do then.

391
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,460
Have you read Records of the Historian?

392
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,220
Let me tell you a story.

393
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,420
Okay.

394
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,780
Let’s call it a day.

395
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,060
Have targeted training

396
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,740
based on our discussion.

397
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,620
Zhou Yi,

398
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,740
take Xiaomi to get acquainted
with the club.

399
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,420
Okay.

400
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,140
Let’s go.

401
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,940
Coach.

402
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,620
Good luck.

403
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,220
The competition with SP is coming.

404
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
What do you think?

405
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,580
Does Ai Qing know
that you want to propose

406
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,260
if you win the game?

407
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,020
What?

408
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,380
You want to propose?

409
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,260
How do you know?

410
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,100
Someone

411
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,420
left this at the tea room

412
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,340
and I got it.

413
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,780
But Wu Bai, this is all so fast.

414
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,780
How come you beat your
future brother-in-law?

415
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,700
Why didn’t you give me a notice?

416
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,740
You...

417
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,980
Isn’t this the package I fetched
for Boss?

418
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,140
How come it’s here?

419
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,220
Don’t lose it.

420
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
Boss?

421
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,860
Yeah, why?

422
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,140
So it’s

423
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,180
for Han Shangyan and his girlfriend.

424
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,020
I couldn’t be happier.

425
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,900
I’m totally supportive.

426
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,860
And me.

427
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,460
Wait, you just...

428
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,380
Wu Bai.

429
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,100
Wu Bai. Are you gonna propose, too?
Wu Bai.

(2021 China Robot Combat League

431
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,580
Welcome to China Robot

(Mecha)
Combat League National Finals

433

(Commentary Table)
Hi, I’m the game narrator, Wei Quan.

435
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,540
I’m the narrator, Lu Yang.

436
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,180
Let’s welcome K&K Team.

437
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,580
K&K! K&K! K&K!

438
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,820
The two teams today

439
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,260
have conquered numerous difficulties

440
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,180
to come to today’s final.

441
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,180
They’ve had different reasons
for winning.

442
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,860
Indeed, K&K Club is

443
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,300
one of the best clubs nationwide.

444
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,380
If they can win

445
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,060
today’s game,

446
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,460
they’ll reach a grand slam
within the country.

447
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,780
Let’s now welcome

448
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,300
SP Team to enter.

449
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,620
SP Team as a regular strong team

450
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,020
was facing all kinds of queries.

451
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,780
Winning this game

452
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,540
would be their best choice

453
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,300
of defending dignity.

454
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,620
Yes. Now we can see

455
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,180
K&K Team has entered

456
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,700
the Debug Area to debug

457
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,020
for the last time before the game.

458
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,260
Before the game starts,

459
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,420
SP Team

460
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,940
has made a big change
on the attending list.

461
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,700
The league has penalized them

462
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,300
to lose their time for debugging.

463
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,700
Yes. So SP Team now

464
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,660
can only stand in the corner

465
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,220
to watch K&K Team

466
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,660
debugging.

467
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,300
Do as how we prepared.

468
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,460
Relax, Lin Yin.

469
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,700
You got this.

470
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,820
Don’t be nervous.

471
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,780
Do as how we discussed

472
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,180
last night.

473
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,820
Take a deep breath.

474
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,820
Wei Quan.

475
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,700
Which team has a bigger chance to you?

476
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,060
SP Team

477
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,180
changed their list
before the game started

478
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,060
because

479
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,180
they’ve recruited

480
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,940
the operator of Taotao Team, Tao Qitao,

481
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,180
who’ll be the operator of SP Team

482
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,900
in today’s game.

483
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,020
He was in a trial training at K&K, too.

484
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,540
So he’s familiar with K&K’s tactics.

485
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,460
He is personally an all-around player

486
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,060
who can both attack and defend.

487
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,580
So Tao Qitao joining SP

488
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,900
will provide SP a qualitative leap.

489
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,660
Besides, this time’s competition rules

490
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,060
allow each team to change mecha.

491
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,940
It has brought variations to the game.

492
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,580
That’s true.

493
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,940
So, today’s game

494
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,900
doesn’t only

495
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,700
test the player’s operating ability.

496
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,820
What’s more,

497
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,100
it’s a tactical battle
between the coaching groups.

498
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,300
Yes, that’s right.

499
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:18,220
(China Robot Combat League
National Finals)

500
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,300
Surprisingly, the first player of K&K

501
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,660
is Wu Bai.

502
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,340
Are they using the strongest weapon

503
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,300
at the beginning?

504
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,460
They probably want

505
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,060
to straightly win the first two games

506
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,540
relying on Wu Bai’s strong ability

507
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,060
which can end the game.

508
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,780
In this case,

509
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,580
K&K doesn’t want

510
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,580
to give their opponent any chance.

511
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,180
SP is sending Lin Yin to play.

512
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,340
Based on his former data,

513
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Lin Yin has only one narrow victory

514
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,420
when he’s against Wu Bai.

515
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,900
Seems like SP

516
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,220
is giving up the first round.

517
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,300
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

518
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,020
The first round of the final

519
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,660
is about to start.

520
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,300
Beastmaster, please get ready.

521
00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:01,700
Lin Yin, come on!
Lin Yin, come on!

522
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,700
Beastmaster is prepared.

523
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,820
The Nobody, please get ready.

524
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:15,060
Wu Bai! Wu Bai! Wu Bai!

525
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,100
The Nobody is prepared.

526
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,540
The first round

527
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,300
starts now.

528
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660
Three.

529
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
Two.

530
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,180
One.

531
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,220
It’s obvious that SP’s tactic

532
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,780
is pretty steady.

533
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,660
Lin Yin has probably thought about

534
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,420
his previous experiences,

535
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,100
so he’s not letting Wu Bai
get close to him

536
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,060
nor to attack him.

537
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,180
I’ll attack aggressively
in the first round.

538
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,220
I’ll seek any chance
to hit The Nobody hard.

539
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,100
No.

540
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,820
Don’t attack in the first round.

541
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,020
No?

542
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,060
Then I...

543
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,220
You run.

544
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,820
Is Lin Yin scared of Wu Bai?

545
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,820
Yeah, what’s he doing?

546
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,820
Is he playing or what?

547
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,020
Wait, what’s wrong with SP?

548
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,060
It doesn’t matter if he loses.

549
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,300
Why is he playing like a coward?

550
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,220
Yeah.

551
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,580
Beastmaster has been

552
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,180
avoiding The Nobody’s attack.

553
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,820
It’s like car racing.

554
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,900
To be accurate,

555
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,180
Lin Yin’s task in the first round

556
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,380
is to delay.

557
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,460
Drag Wu Bai down.

558
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,420
Beastmaster suddenly stops moving.

559
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,860
The Nobody wants to eject.

560
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,820
It’s the saw web.

561
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,100
The saw web cut both mechas
down on the ground!

562
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,740
Except for avoiding his attack,

563
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,220
there’s another thing to do.

564
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,620
You try to

565
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,940
lead The Nobody

566
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,060
to the mechanism area.

567
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,180
But Wu Bai operates so fast.

568
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,780
I’m afraid I won’t hurt it.

569
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,060
A fast operation means

570
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,380
the robot gets high-frequency orders.

571
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,060
It’s a big challenge

572
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,780
for every mecha’s electric system.

573
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,100
What Wu Bai’s The Nobody scares the most

574
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,660
is this kind of

575
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,900
high-frequency consumption.

576
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,500
Beastmaster is now

577
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,460
chasing The Nobody.

578
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,940
Their two mechas have come

579
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,380
to the fire area.

580
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,780
Eject!

581
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,180
The Nobody has made an effective attack

582
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,580
at this crucial point.

583
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,140
Out.

584
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,500
The game is over.

585
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,300
Wu Bai has won a point smoothly.

586
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,100
It was such a great game.

587
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,180
Wu Bai played so courageously

588
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,980
in this round.

589
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,740
On the contrary,

590
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,220
Lin Yin was a bit panicky.

591
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,140
Yes. I wonder why

592
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,620
the first round

593
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,980
of the final

594
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,420
was nearly a car-racing game.

595
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,900
There was a lot of chasing.

596
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,140
(The Nobody)
But at the end of the game,

597
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,460
Wu Bai still used his

598
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,780
regular unique skill,

599
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,140
eject attack to defeat Beastmaster.

600
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,900
In this case,

601
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,100
the score is one to zero.

602
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,460
K&K Team is taking

603
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,740
a preemptive opportunity.

604
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,700
It’s weird.

605
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,660
There wasn’t

606
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,420
any frontal collision,

607
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,100
why its chassis is so severely abraded.

608
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,380
It runs too much.

609
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,860
The last round
was like Chicken vs. Eagle.

610
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,540
Wu Bai.

611
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,740
What’s wrong?

612
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,140
You won, why do you look worried?

613
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,900
SP’s tactic is weird.

614
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,420
How’s that?

615
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,020
Though Lin Yin is a tender person,

616
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,940
he’ll definitely strike back

617
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,340
once got attacked.

618
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,900
Probably he was saving up
for the second round.

619
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,380
I don’t know.

620
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,220
Let’s see how it goes.

621
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,180
97.

622
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,860
Is it serious?

623
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,380
I need to weld it again.

624
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,140
It’ll be fast.

625
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,780
Hurry up.

626
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,420
We don’t have much time left.

627
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,740
Nice game, Lin Yin.

628
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,260
I got it, don’t worry.

629
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,980
It went well.

630
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,180
Don’t be nervous.

631
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,140
You did great.

632
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,580
Next, all we need to do

633
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,900
is to follow our plan.

634
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,580
Don’t worry.

635
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,300
The game has got only one minute left.

636
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,500
Now we’ve reached a

637
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,820
white-hot situation.

638
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,180
They are chasing and running,

639
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,260
it’s too close to call.

640
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:02,740
Yes.

641
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,980
Two robots are in a stalemate again

642
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,540
in the center of the field.

643
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,540
Beastmaster is constantly chiseling

644
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,340
The Nobody.

645
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,100
The Nobody has slowed down.

646
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,940
It has got chiseled for more times.

647
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,900
Can its armor take more hits?

648
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,300
Seems like Lin Yin has adjusted

649
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,900
his status.

650
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,620
Oh my god.

651
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,060
What did SP say to Lin Yin?

652
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,660
It’s like Beastmaster
has broken his seal.

653
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,140
The Nobody’s side armor got hit off.

654
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,060
It’s escaping.

655
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,940
Beastmaster is chasing to attack.

656
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,700
At this time,

657
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,420
The Nobody’s chassis would
be severely impaired.

658
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,660
What you need to do

659
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,660
is to use the mechanism

660
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,620
to give him a critical strike.

661
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,700
Even if you have to perish together,

662
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,060
you still take it with you

663
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,620
to win this point.

664
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,620
The mechanism.

665
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,780
The mechanism is playing its role.

666
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,220
The Nobody got knocked over.

667
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,660
Beastmaster seized the chance

668
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,260
to chisel its bottom again.

669
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,180
It turned over.

670
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,260
The Nobody did a great job.

671
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,260
It’s ejecting Beastmaster again.

672
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,460
The Nobody’s chassis got broken.

673
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,420
Seems like Beastmaster has lost

674
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,260
its ability to move, too.

675
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,060
In this case,

676
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,740
both of them are greatly injured.

677
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,100
Yes.

678
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,420
We can see the judge

679
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,340
is counting down now.

680
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,140
Ten.

681
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
Nine.

682
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,620
Eight.

683
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,500
Seven.

684
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,300
Six.

685
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,300
Five.

686
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,260
Four.

687
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,100
Three.

688
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,980
Two.

689
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,940
One.

690
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,820
K.O.

691
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,940
K.O.

692
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,700
Lin Yin won!

693
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,300
It’s a very dramatic round.

694
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,660
Oh my god, the first two rounds

695
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,420
ended up with a tie.

696
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,100
But,

697
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,620
both mechas are

698
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,020
severely damaged.

699
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,420
I think, both teams

700
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,460
will change mecha in the third round.

701
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,260
Not bad.

702
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,620
You did well.

703
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,980
Nice game, Lin Yin.

704
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,340
I feel sorry for Beastmaster.

705
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,100
It’s badly injured.

706
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,700
Don’t worry, I got it.

707
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,460
It’s fine.

708
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,020
The Nobody wasn’t any better.

709
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,460
It almost got cut in half.

710
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,580
Yeah.

711
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,340
Come on, let’s clean up.

712
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,020
Lin Yin fought for this chance
at the full spirit.

713
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,140
You gotta seize it.

714
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,140
Don’t worry.

715
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,420
I’ve learned from

716
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,820
all these many simulations.

717
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,740
I can know where

718
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,900
Shen Zhe subconsciously would escape to.

719
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,620
I will try my best today

720
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,860
to help SP

721
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,500
win the trophy.

722
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,460
Captain.

723
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,220
Sorry, it was all my fault.

724
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,300
It’s probably
because I repeatedly welded it

725
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,140
which made the welding point weak.

726
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,900
That’s why...

727
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,900
It’s not your fault.

728
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,300
Even if The Nobody
was in good condition,

729
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,420
it wouldn’t be able
to take such strong hits.

730
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,620
SP played so weirdly.

731
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,980
They ran and ran in the first round.

732
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,380
It was like yielding the point to us.

733
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,940
They fought so hard in the second round.

734
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,020
In this case, both robots

735
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,420
will be scrap.

736
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,620
It’s the art of war.

737
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,100
What?

738
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,420
The art of war.

739
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,300
Ai Qing is using the art of war.

740
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,340
She wanted Lin Yin to trap me

741
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,660
which will lead to a tie.

742
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,020
Then let Shen Zhe
and Tao Qitao to compete.

743
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,540
It’s risky.

744
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,700
How can they be so sure

745
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,900
that Tao Qitao can defeat Shen Zhe?

746
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,220
An art of war, is it?

747
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,300
Alright.

748
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,380
I’d like to know how good

749
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,780
Tao Qitao is.

750
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,660
Be careful with your moves.

751
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,180
Don’t give him any chances.

752
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,140
Though Sea Breeze is

753
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,780
a born opponent for Trash Can.

754
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,500
Its design has got a weakness.

755
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,660
When you are behind it,

756
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,260
it loses balance immediately.

757
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,740
Don’t worry.

758
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,420
I’ll go to its back at the start

759
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,220
and cut its tail.

760
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,020
I won’t lose again.

761
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,780
This round,

762
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,380
I have to win.

763
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,660
The third round is about to start.

764
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,180
Yes.

765
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,220
The deciding round has come.

766
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,100
Trash Can, please be ready.

767
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:50,380
Shen Zhe! Shen Zhe! Shen Zhe!

768
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,460
Trash Can is ready.

769
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,820
Sea Breeze, please be ready.

770
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:04,180
Qitao! Qitao! Qitao!

771
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,980
Sea Breeze is ready.

772
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,980
The game starts now.

773
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,740
Three.

774
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,820
Two.

775
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,780
One.

776
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,940
The final has started.

777
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,500
We can see Trash Can’s style

778
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,060
is reckless as always.

779
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,260
It emphasizes attack.

780
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,420
Trash Can has repeatedly attacked

781
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,980
Sea Breeze after the game started.

782
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,700
But these attacks seemed to

783
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,180
fail to hit

784
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,060
Sea Breeze’s tail.

785
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,380
Sea Breeze’s fatal flaw

786
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,460
is its tail.

787
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,500
Shen Zhe is a very

788
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,380
aggressive player.

789
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,620
This could be his advantage

790
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,060
as well as his flaw.

791
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,100
He’s good at movement,
and his operation is flexible.

792
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,140
He’d move it to the back

793
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,180
of Sea Breeze to attack its tail.

794
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,380
That’s why the technology department

795
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,100
has upgraded the design
of Sea Breeze’s weapon arm.

796
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,700
Even if it tripped over,

797
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,380
it can turn over immediately

798
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,580
through its technology arm.

799
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,500
Sea Breeze is showing its tail

800
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,940
to Trash Can.

801
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,900
Trash Can approached to strike,

802
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,860
but Sea Breeze

803
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,620
didn’t damage too much.

804
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,980
I wonder if they have upgraded

805
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,820
(Trash Can)
Sea Breeze’s tail before the game.

806
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,340
This time, Trash Can

807
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,780
got smashed by the hammer on the field.

808
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,620
Trash Can seems to lose

809
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,980
ability to move.

810
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,980
Sea Breeze is controlling its opponent

811
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,580
to the wolf’s fangs mace.

812
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,420
Ai Qing.
