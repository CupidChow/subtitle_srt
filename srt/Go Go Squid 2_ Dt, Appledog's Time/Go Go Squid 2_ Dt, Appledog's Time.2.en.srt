=Episode 2=

19
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,300
It’s said on NetEase Music that

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,940
Fox Xia is having
a fans’ meeting tomorrow.

21
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,100
How about we go together?

22
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,820
OK, I like him very much too.

23
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,940
Great!

24
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,140
Let’s go.

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,660
Hello.

26
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,540
Hello, Mr. Wu.

27
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,380
The tickets you booked
for the fans’ meeting of Fox Xia

28
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,260
have been delivered to your hotel.

29
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,540
You look beaming.

30
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,940
Where did you go last night?

31
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,340
I didn’t see you when I got up.

32
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,500
You stayed out all night.

33
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,940
Good for you, Captain.

34
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,140
Exactly speaking,

35
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,700
I came back last night.

36
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,740
You didn’t see me because

37
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,380
you were asleep when I came back

38
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,060
and still asleep when I got up.

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,300
That’s why you made the conclusion.

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,260
Uh. Hold on please.

41
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,860
I’m a bit confused.
Let me figure it out.

42
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,620
He said I was asleep and he…

43
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,740
I thought you didn’t like dessert.

44
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,740
Well…

45
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,180
It depends on my mood.

46
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,380
Oh, it depends.

47
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,860
There’s something I have to tell you.

48
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,100
Solo is here.

49
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,900
He’s picking members for his SP team.

50
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,860
After all,
it is now the nation’s top team.

51
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,140
If Wu Bai can win the champion,

52
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,220
he will become very popular.

53
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,340
Why don’t you go to SP?

54
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,700
I...

55
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,660
I’m going to Germany.

56
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,820
Have you signed the contract?

57
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,980
Of course.

58
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,300
What do you think? Will you go with me?

59
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,300
No.

60
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,060
It’s not my taste.

61
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,300
What’s more,

62
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,780
even if I wanted to join a club,

63
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,660
I would choose a Chinese club.

64
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,340
A Chinese club?

65
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,620
For that,

66
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,020
the top one in China is Solo’s SP.

67
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,540
Will you join them?

68
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,100
What do you think of Wu Bai?

69
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,140
He is great.

70
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,620
A genius.

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,140
You see,

72
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,420
in awareness, positioning, and teamwork,

73
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,620
he has no weakness.

74
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,780
The key is they are highly coordinated.

75
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,340
Oh, that is the man, Solo!

76
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,100
Yeah, Solo.

77
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,140
The legendary man.

78
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,740
Solo?

79
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,820
What brings him here?

80
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,340
As the captain, Wu Bai

81
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,940
is such a good leader,

82
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,180
which means he is good at managing

83
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,380
and has high IQ and EQ.

84
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,700
Really?

85
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,380
Solo.

86
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,100
It’s been a while.

87
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,020
You are here too.

88
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,260
I’m picking members for SP.

89
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,540
Do you have a second?

90
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,060
Let’s talk outside.

91
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Okay.

92
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,620
Let’s go back to practice.

93
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,780
You are not eating?

94
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,180
It doesn’t taste good.

95
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,300
You just said it was delicious.

96
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,500
Which race did you take part in?

97
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,740
Single-player racing.

98
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,860
It’s great

99
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,340
you still can compete.

100
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,060
Do you want to join SP?

101
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,700
Let bygones be bygones.

102
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,660
We can cooperate again.

103
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,580
OK?

104
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,740
It’s all over.

105
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,580
I mean everything.

106
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,940
It’s all over.

107
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:20,940
Okay.

108
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,620
Forget about that.

109
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,580
After this,

110
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,220
will you go back to Shanghai?

111
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Call me when you have time.

112
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,020
I recently found a Hunan restaurant…

113
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,260
Solo,

114
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,580
I have deleted your phone number.

115
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,020
I have to leave now.

116
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,660
Wish you all the best in Singapore.

117
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,300
Bye.

118
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,420

doesn’t need Solo anymore.

135
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,460
Give it up to Team AEO

136
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,620
from Singapore.

137
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,500
Let’s give them a big hand.

138
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,300
Fighting, fighting, fighting!

139
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,660
Next is Team DT from China.

140
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,340
Welcome.

141
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,980
Fighting, fighting, fighting!

142
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,620
Wu Bai! Wu Bai!

143
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,140
DT! DT! DT!

144
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,620
That’s the real final.

145
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,020
The combat is fierce from the beginning.

146
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,900
Wu Bai! DT!

147
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,460
Nobody took advantage of a small mistake

148
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,620
and threw the opponent out.

149
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,260
For duel of masters,

150
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,260
any mistake could be fatal.

151
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,780
Nobody threw his opponent out again.

152
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,500
DT! Wu Bai!

153
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,860
It seems the robot of Singapore players

154
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,020
is stuck in the venue mechanism.

155
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,180
Fans of the Chinese team

156
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,980
are already celebrating
the victory for Wu Bai.

157
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,900
Wu Bai! DT!

158
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,020
No words required.

159
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,500
I believe

160
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,340
you can win.

161
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,220
When I win the championship,

162
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,900
you can put it on for me again,

163
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,740
and crown me.

164
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,620
Deal.

165
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,820
One minute to the end of the game.

166
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,660
Wu Bai’s robot is trapped
by the ground drill.

167
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,940
Trapped by the drill?

168
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,300
-Yeah, that’s a rookie mistake.
-That’s impossible.

169
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,180
Captain, your eyes…

170
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,540
I’m fine. Don’t worry.

171
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,060
According to the rules,

172
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,260
the robot can be trapped

173
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,260
for three seconds at most.

174
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,580
But now…

175
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,260
Foul! It’s a foul!

176
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,500
It’s been a long time.

177
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,820
-It’s a foul!
-It’s a foul!

178
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,940
The Singapore robot is out of trouble,

179
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,860
but Wu Bai is still trapped there.

180
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
The referee is not calling a time-out.

181
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,820
The Chinese robot has been trapped

182
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
way longer than 3 seconds.

183
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,060
It’s a foul.

184
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,980
Referee! That’s a foul!

185
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,980
The opponent didn’t stop attacking.

186
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,980
This is against the rules.

187
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,060
I protest!

188
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,660
He fouled!

189
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,940
It’s against the rules!

190
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,060
Referee!

191
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,180
This is completely against the rules.

192
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,860
That’s so unprofessional!

193
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,420
What should we do now?

194
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,300
-How could that happen?
-That’s too much.

195
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,540
The game is over.

196
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,740
-Wu Bai won!
-Fantastic!

197
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,660
Bravo! Well done!

198
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,420
-China! China is the champion!
-Good for you, captain!

199
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,980
We are the champions.

200
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,860
Champion of champions.

201
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,260
Good job, Wu Bai.

202
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,380
That was your move.

203
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,180
When did you teach him?

204
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,420
He learned it secretly by himself.

205
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,580
I’m going to charge him for that.

It’s so hard, but you still won. Wu Bai.

209
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,180
You won fair and square.
Congrats to you.

Congrats to us.

211

Yes, right. Go get the prize.

344
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,500
with it.

345
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,700
♪A fleeting dream♪

346
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,860
♪freezes in your eyes♪

347
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,540

00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,780

00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,940

♪Tears are for the distant reunion♪

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,500
♪Love will go go♪

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,540
♪The starry sky blurs my eyes♪

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,500
♪Love will go go♪

354
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,980
Are you awake?

355
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,820
Mom, he’s awake.

356
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,420
Luo Hui.

357
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,540
I’m sorry

358
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,060
for disturbing you.

359
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,060
It’s OK.

360
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,940
Come on, go back to your bed.

361
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,020
No, I want to play with him.

362
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,580
But he needs more rest.

363
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,820
Come on.

364
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,300
I’m really sorry.

365
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,060
No, no.

366
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
Is it too bright?

367
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,820
I’ll close the curtain.

368
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,180
Thank you.

369
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,500
Feel better now?

370
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,420
Mom, I want

371
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,260
to have some chocolate.

372
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,420
Can I?

373
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,380
OK.

374
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,260
Go back to your bed and lie down.

375
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,700
Then I’ll buy it for you.

376
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,780
Okay.

377
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,060
Come on.

378
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,780
Be careful.

379
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,780
Be good, OK?

380
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,100
Mom?

381
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Brother?

382
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,340
You hardly called me brother.

383
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,780
Now you are blind but nicer.

384
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,180
It must be hard for you,

385
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,300
so I bought some fruits easy to take.

386
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,500
I will be here for a couple of days.

387
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,900
Tell me if you need anything.

388
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,180
This might be your only chance

389
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,580
to order me around in your lifetime.

390
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,060
Make good use of it.

391
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,460
No need.

392
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,460
Fine.

393
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,100
Then I’ll get a nurse
to take care of you.

394
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,460
You’ll pay for it yourself.

395
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,220
Peel an apple for me please.

396
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,220
Are you a little girl or what?

397
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,300
The apples are clean.

398
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,580
Can’t you eat it without peeling?

399
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,100
Did the operation fail?

400
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,180
Little girl.

401
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,700
Do you want a banana?

402
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,820
Here.

403
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,340
Thank you, uncle.

404
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,580
Uncle?

405
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,780
Fine.

406
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
You have one, too.

407
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,340
Tell me the truth.

408
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,580
I can stand it.

409
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,900
Temporarily.

410
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,540
It’s just not succeeded yet.

411
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,220
I’ve talked to the attending doctor.

412
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,660
You will take a break for one week.

413
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,340
And we’ll discuss the plan

414
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,820
for the next operation next week.

415
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,180
What if it fails again?

416
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,540
Just wait for the operation.

417
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,940
Don’t think too much.

418
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,020
If you become blind,

419
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,540
I’ll support you all my life.

420
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,580
You even refused to
peel an apple for me.

421
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,420
How should I trust you?

422
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,940
Don’t worry,

423
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,820
the next time,

424
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,220
it will succeed.

425
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,780
After you recover,

426
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,820
let’s open a club together.

427
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,420
Do you have money?

428
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,060
Well…

429
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,060
We will have that.

430
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,940
You still have some money, right?

431
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,060
Lend me some then.

432
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,540
You’re borrowing money from a blind guy.

433
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,580
Shame on you.

434
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,580
No way. Dream on.

435
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,420
I mean it.

436
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,820
I’ve retired.

437
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,460
So you

438
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,100
will be the main force of the club.

439
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,780
Then shouldn’t you

440
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,420
talk to me about the salary first?

441
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,020
I told you we are starting from scratch.

442
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,100
I don’t have the money.

443
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,060
I will think about it.

444
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,100
As one of the shareholder,

445
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,020
I can consider allowing you to name it.

446
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,420
I will be king of the world

447
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,900
of robot combat.

448
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,220
You are a girl,

449
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,100
so it should be the queen of the world.

450
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,700
But a queen is destined
to have a king husband.

451
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,940
I don’t like it.

452
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,460
I want to be a king on my own.

453
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,220
What?

454
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,780
You want to be a king, too?

455
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,020
There can only be one king.

456
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,820
You can be the king,

457
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,820
but there will be another king

458
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,020
who’s right for you.

459
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,300
Then there would be two kings.

460
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,660
Two kings can coexist.

461
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,900
Let’s call it K&K.

462
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,180
K&K.

463
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,420
Good.

464
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,020
K&K then.

465
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,580
But you need to practice more

466
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,100
to be double kings together with me.

467
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,100
You can do it.

468
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,820
I’ll buy you some clothes.

469
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,820
Go to sleep early.

470
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,300
Look after each other, you kids.

471
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,580
Goodbye, uncle.

472
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,580
Call me brother

473
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,060
next time.

474
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,580
Your brother is harsh.

475
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,060
Yeah.

476
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,220
Is he cute?

477
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,620
To be honest,

478
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,060
he is not bad.

479
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,460
What are you two doing?

480
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,940
Are you brothers, sisters or a couple?

481
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,500
Don’t pat on the belly of a cat.

482
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,700
Pat them here.

483
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,220
They will feel safe and comfortable.

484
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,380
You know a lot about cats.

485
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,100
You can say that.

486
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,980
I think it’s a couple,

487
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,660
but both have affairs.

488
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,380
Do you have to be so mean?

489
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,420
You are not welcomed by cats.

490
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,860
When you come, they all run away.

491
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,300
I don’t mind.

492
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,820
I’m welcomed by men. That’s enough.

493
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,660
Let’s go home.

494
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,060
I have something to talk to you.

495
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,900
What is it?

496
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,220
I was looking at you
from a distance just now.

497
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,780
You were smiling at the two cats.

498
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,180
You seemed so happy.

499
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,540
Were you thinking of a man?

500
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,700
What are you talking about?

501
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,660
Thank God.

502
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,940
My sister is finally over it

503
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,740
and ready to love another guy.

504
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,780
The stairs are so old.

505
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,100
And the light,

506
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,980
it’s flashing.

507
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,900
We might trip ourselves someday

508
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,900
when it goes off.

509
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,220
Okay, quickly.

510
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,900
Dad’s waiting for us.

511
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,420
Let’s go home for dinner.

512
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,660
Are you hungry?

513
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,060
Yes.

514
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,140
Ai Qing.

515
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,300
Are you tired?

516
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,900
I’m fine.

517
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,260
Sister.

518
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,380
Let’s guess what dishes

519
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,820
dad prepared for us.

520
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,620
Your favorite stir-fried eggs
with tomato.

521
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,660
Again?

522
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,380
I want braised pork today.

523
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,580
I can’t stand the stairs.

524
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,660
Dad isn’t home?

525
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,980
Hush, he fell asleep.

526
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,620
Dad, you’re awake.

527
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,540
You’re back.

528
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,500
Yep.

529
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,580
Yes.

530
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,620
Dad, why did you fall asleep so early?

531
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,180
After finished cooking,

532
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,340
I wanted to take some rest.

533
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,980
Then I fell asleep.

534
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,300
Well.

535
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,580
Wash your hands and wait.

536
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,260
I’ll heat up the dish.

537
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,660
Then we will have dinner.

538
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,860
Let me help you.

539
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,700
It’s OK.

540
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,020
I’ll do it myself.

541
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,820
Let’s buy an apartment.

542
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,820
Do you have money?

543
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,860
No.

544
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,980
I’ve been working for years.

545
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,020
But I’m used to being a big spender.

546
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,540
It’s hard when I really need money.

547
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,340
Actually,

548
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,780
I wanted to discuss with you about

549
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,020
buying an apartment for a long time.

550
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,100
A one-bedroom apartment is nice,

551
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,300
but dad has to sleep on the couch.

552
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,500
Here’s the money

553
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,660
I’ve earned from competitions
during all these years.

554
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,660
I have not spent a cent.

555
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,180
It’s all in here.

556
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,300
Maybe

557
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,500
it’s not a lot.

558
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,380
But I believe it’s enough
for a down payment

559
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,780
for an apartment in the suburbs.

560
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,180
For the housing mortgage,

561
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,380
I can take my time to pay for it.

562
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,780
Maybe we should forget it.

563
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,860
Let’s wait for a few years.

564
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,660
I will work harder

565
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,620
to get to the peak of my career.

566
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,860
We can buy one then.

567
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,060
When your career reaches its peak?

568
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,500
God knows when that will be.

569
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,340
Just take the money.

570
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,860
The password is my birthday.

571
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,620
You are in charge of
buying the apartment.

572
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,940
Just choose a two-bedroom

573
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,820
apartment we can afford.

574
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,820
When I have salary,

575
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,740
I’ll be able to pay monthly.

576
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,020
Have you really decided to retire?

577
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,060
Are you sure?

578
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,980
Will you regret it?

579
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,820
I won’t know

580
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,340
without experiencing it.

581
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,580
It’s still too early to talk about that.

582
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,020
Ask me again several years later.

583
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,940
Are you going to the bathroom?

584
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,660
Shall I ring the bell for you?

585
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,820
No, I just can’t fall asleep.

586
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,740
Both days and nights are equally dark.

587
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,340
We can do nothing

588
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,700
but sleep.

589
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,140
Count the sheep.

590
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,300
No, it’s outdated.

591
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,700
Brother, let’s have a chat.

592
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,500
Tell me a story, will you?

593
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,300
We can talk

594
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,820
but forget about the story-telling.

595
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,020
It’s outdated.

596
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,860
Brother,

597
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,420
what’s your name?

598
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,060
Wu Bai.

599
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,620
W-U, Wu.

600
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,380
How old are you? Can you spell words?

601
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,340
I’m eight already.

602
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,940
I can spell a lot of words.

603
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,020
My name is Luo Hui.

604
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,540
Luo, the same as the Ro
in Robert Downey Jr.

605
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,140
Hui, which means wisdom.

606
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,820
You know Robert Downey Jr.?

607
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,740
Of course, I love Iron Man.

608
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,260
You like robots?

609
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,020
Yeah. Do you have one?

610
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,460
Yes.

611
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,740
Really?

612
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,340
You are lying. My mom said

613
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,820
only characters in movies have robots,

614
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,500
ordinary people can’t have one.

615
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,980
Maybe I’m not an ordinary person.

616
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,340
I’m a professional
fighting robot player.

617
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,340
Really?

618
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,780
Then tell me more about your robot.

619
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,900
Why are you in my bed?

620
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,140
We can talk better this way.

621
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,660
Tell me about your robot.

622
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,660
What does it look like?

623
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,820
What’s his name?

624
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,500
Why do you have so many questions?

625
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,300
That’s what kids are like.

626
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,340
You’ll get used to it.

627
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,140
Come on, come on, tell me about it.

628
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,820
My robot,

629
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,500
it’s called

630
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,180
Nobody.

631
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,540
I don’t want to,

632
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,540
but I think it’s time to retire.

633
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,420
What then?

634
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,540
What happened to your team?

635
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,300
After you recover,

636
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,980
will you play with them again?

637
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,500
Will you make a new robot?

638
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,220
What are you going to call it?

639
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,180
What functions will it have?

640
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,540
Will it float in the water like a boat?

641
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,980
And then on land, it will transform,

642
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,300
running in the shape of a car.

643
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,460
If it could fly
in the shape of an airplane,

644
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,740
it would be even better.

645
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900
And that girl called Frigg,

646
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,180
what happened to her then?

647
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,700
Does she have her own robot?

648
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,980
What is the robot’s name?

649
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,060
Does she know you are in hospital?

650
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,580
Does she know

651
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,860
you join the club because of her?

652
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,060
You need to tell her that.

653
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,940
Or she might date

654
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,020
other boys.

655
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,220
You have so many questions.

656
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,540
Which one should I answer first?

657
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,020
I am sleepy.

658
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,100
I’m going to bed.

659
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,580
Tell me tomorrow when I wake up.

660
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,260
(Outpatient)

661
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,660
(Emergency)
(Inpatient Building)

662
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,700
You are lying all day and still sleepy?

663
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,260
You don’t know.

664
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,180
Taking care of a child

665
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,500
is much more tiring than playing games.

666
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,460
I have something to tell you.

667
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,580
One good news and one bad news.

668
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,620
Which one do you want to know first?

669
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,380
I don’t mind, early or later, the same.

670
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,620
I have talked to your doctor.

671
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,740
We decided to transfer you to Norway

672
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,900
to do the second operation.

673
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,940
We’ll leave the day after tomorrow.

674
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,700
Then,

675
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,860
you can get rid of this kid.

676
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,300
That’s kind of a good news.

677
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,980
What about the bad news?

678
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,140
The bad news is,

679
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,420
grandfather has known about it.

680
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,420
He’s going to look after you

681
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,300
during your treatment in Norway.

682
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,420
I have told you

683
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,180
not to tell him.

684
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,900
Anyway,

685
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,700
grandfather or the kid.

686
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,980
You pick one.

687
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,180
How are you feeling now?

688
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,660
Slowly.

689
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,740
Try to open your eyes.

690
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,380
Not very stable.

691
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,740
It’s OK.

692
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,500
You just need more rest.

693
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,100
Don’t worry.

694
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,660
Relax yourself and get ready

695
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,660
for the second operation.

696
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,260
If he has a second operation,

697
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,420
it will be pretty risky.

698
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,980
He could lose his sight forever.

699
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,660
I had a successful interview today,

700
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,180
and will be in post tomorrow.

702
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,700
I’ve been wearing high heels all day.

703
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700
I’m so exhausted.

704
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,420

706

I’m fine.

711
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,900
I’m going upstairs.

712
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,620
