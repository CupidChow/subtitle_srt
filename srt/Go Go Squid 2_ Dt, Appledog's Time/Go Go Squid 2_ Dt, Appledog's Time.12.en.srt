Wu Bai, I hope you are clear

20
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,210
that Ai Qing is Solo’s girlfriend.

21
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,210
No matter what happened among us,

22
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,980
Solo will always be my friend.

23
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,210
What about me?

24
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,770
I have a stomachache.

25
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,250
Gotta go.

26
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,390
Wu Bai.

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,130
Captain.

28
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:21,660
Wu Bai.

29
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,330
Captain.

30
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,300
Where are you going?

31
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,940
Wu Bai.

32
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,820
Wu Liao, catch up with him.

33
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,820
I’ll take care of it.

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,420
Daddy, take me with you.

35
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,490
Ai Qing.

36
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,610
Ai Qing.

37
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,700
You’re asleep?

38
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,380
I’m sorry.

39
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,690
Wu Bai.

40
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,030
I really

41
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,140
like you very much.

42
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,060
Sleep tight.

43
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,740
Don’t think about anything.

44
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,430
Grandpa.

45
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:41,940
I’m back.

46
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,180
How come you’re back now?

47
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,340
Didn’t you say

48
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,270
you’d come back on the day
before lunar New Year?

49
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,590
Did you eat?

50
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,500
Tell me.

51
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,390
I’ll make you some good food.

52
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,260
Your cousin, Han Shangyan,

53
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,340
came back last night.

54
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,460
He just showed up for a while.

55
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,550
On the morning when I got up,

56
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,890
he had gone again.

57
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,550
What’s wrong? Don’t you feel well?

58
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,990
I have a stomachache.

59
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,900
Stomachache?

60
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,740
That’s terrible.

61
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,060
I, I’m going to find you
some painkillers.

62
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,950
No, no, no, shall we

63
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,270
call Han Shangyan and

64
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,620
ask him to drive you to the hospital?

65
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,550
Grandpa.

66
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,740
Don’t bother.

67
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,460
I just need to take a rest.

68
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,710
Is that OK?

69
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,740
Yes.

70
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,500
-Wu Liao wants a hug.
-Well…

71
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,310
-Wu Liao wants a hug.
-Well, what’s this?

72
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,720
I’m Wu Liao. I want a hug.

73
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,830
A hug.

74
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,110
Wu Liao is heart-broken.

75
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,870
What a surprise!

76
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,180
There’s no painkiller at all.

77
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,430
It’s too late.

78
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,150
I don’t know where
Han Shangyan has been.

79
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,060
No.

80
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,280
I have to call Han Shangyan.

81
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,110
Where’s my phone?

82
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,670
Calling Han Shangyan.

83
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,990
Who is calling so late?

84
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,740
It’s me. Your grandpa.

85
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,230
Grandpa.

86
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,180
Why are you calling
from a strange number?

87
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,390
Is there any problem?

88
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,550
I, I, I just asked

89
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,190
Bai’s

90
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,500
tin man

91
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,300
to call you.

92
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,270
Don’t talk nonsense.

93
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,500
Bai has a stomachache now.

94
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,070
Come back quickly
and drive him to the hospital.

95
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,430
Hang up the phone.

96
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,720
Hang up the phone.

97
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,030
Good.

98
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,910
Well,

99
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,880
where did I

100
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,220
put my phone?

101
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,280
Searching.

102
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,950
Position fixed.

103
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,680
It’s under the pillow.

104
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,190
Under the pillow.

105
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,460
It, it, it’s really here.

106
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,300
You tin man.

107
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,470
You’re amazing.

108
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,560
Hey, Han Shangyan.

109
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,710
Where’re you?

110
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,060
I’m on my way, Grandpa.

111
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,070
I’ll be home in a minute.

112
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,280
I found the herbal prescription
for stomach trouble.

113
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,510
Come back quickly.

114
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,780
Help me to decoct the medicinal herb.

115
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,180
Where did you find the prescription?

116
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,500
Does it work? It’s troublesome.

117
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,000
It’s just a stomachache.
Take some medicine.

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,510
Why do you take the trouble?

119
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,880
You know nothing about it.

120
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,460
The prescription was from
one of my old friends.

121
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,870
He has been a doctor of traditional
Chinese medicine for 50 years.

122
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,070
He gave it to me.

123
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,470
Wait for a minute.

124
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,120
Don’t hang up.

125
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,960
Honestly.

126
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,990
Listen carefully.

127
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,550
Usually, the internal heat rises,

128
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,500
external evils cause wind-damp…
No, no, no.

129
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,470
This is for toothache.

130
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,710
Here, here, here it is.

131
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,720
Anoxia, hemorrhage, swollen…
No, no, no.

132
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,910
This, this is for headache.

133
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,790
Yeah, yeah. I found it.

134
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,310
Usually, worry and anger

135
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,360
and emotional frustration

136
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,990
cause disharmony of stomach energy.

137
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,840
The medicine helps to reduce
internal heat

138
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,190
and relieve depression.

139
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,510
It’s for stomachache.

140
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,110
OK. OK

141
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,060
Whatever you say is right.

142
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,510
Yes. Come back quickly.

143
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,030
Help me to decoct it.

144
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,230
What? In the middle of the night?

145
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,750
Give me a break.

146
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,510
Watch your tongue.

147
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,950
That’s your cousin.

148
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,240
Do you have any human feelings?

149
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,550
I’ve raised you for nothing.

150
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,480
No. You just,

151
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,360
you just give

152
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,840
me a headache.

153
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,830
Enough. Don’t complain again.

154
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,040
I got it. I’m on my way.

155
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,800
I’ve got a headache, I…

156
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,550
I’ve never apologized to anybody.

157
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,040
I certainly won’t apologize to you, too.

158
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,990
As you’re my dear cousin,

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,880
I’ve brought you medicine.

160
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,070
I’ve given you an out.

161
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,040
Take the chance.

162
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,310
He doesn't dare to ignore me.

163
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,040
He must be asleep.

164
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,510
What else do you want?

165
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,000
Grandpa made me decoct
Chinese medicine for you.

166
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,480
I’ve spent the whole night
on doing it.

167
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,290
Drink it.

168
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,640
No.

169
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,990
Drink it or not.
I’ll leave it here anyway.

170
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,970
I don’t know how our captain is doing.

171
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,370
Judging from yesterday,

172
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,870
I don’t think he’s very well.

173
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,320
Why don’t you visit him on our behalf?

174
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,430
Why me?

175
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,750
It seems too deliberate

176
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,560
if we go together.

177
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,810
-Improper.
-Yeah.

178
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,560
You are the vice-captain.

179
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,670
You’d better take the lead

180
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,990
to take care of

181
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,490
the administrative affairs.

182
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,730
Sounds reasonable.

183
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,930
Still, I don’t want to go.

184
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,760
But I won’t stop you guys.

185
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,280
He was furious the other day.

186
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,800
I’m afraid of being a vent to his anger.

187
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,520
Why don’t we

188
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,640
draw lots?

189
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,850
Draw lots?

190
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,630
Yes.

191
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,560
Three paper tapes.

192
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,120
Whoever draws the shortest one

193
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,850
should go. OK?

194
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,120
Absolutely fair.

195
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,430
Sure. It depends on pure luck.

196
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,290
Let’s do it.

197
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,120
I have three paper tapes here.

198
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,170
Whoever draws the shortest one
will go. OK?

199
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,520
Don’t cheat.

200
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,810
You, don’t play tricks.

201
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,640
How could I?

202
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,930
Who will come first?

203
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,960
I’ll go first.

204
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
Two long tapes and a short tape.

205
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,050
See who draws the shortest.

206
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,120
Here we go. Bros.

207
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,630
Here we go. Here we go.

208
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,720
Excuse me, bros.

209
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,970
I’m off the hook.

210
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,680
Please.

211
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,050
If I draw the shortest,

212
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,170
you must protect me.

213
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,440
Of course. Come on.

214
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,200
Yours must be a long one, too.

215
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,250
Bro.

216
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,860
It’s longer than yours.

217
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,000
Then, maybe,

218
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,130
maybe,

219
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,250
maybe you’re the fall guy.

220
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,730
Pardon me.

221
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,320
Come on.

222
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,620
Let’s have breakfast.

223
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,850
Who is it?

224
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,530
Grandpa.

225
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,880
I’m Shen Zhe,

226
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,410
from Wu Bai’s team.

227
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,940
Well, come on in.

228
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,320
Come in. Sit.

229
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,760
You said

230
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,730
your name is…

231
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,820
Shen Zhe, Grandpa.

232
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,570
My name is Shen Zhe.

233
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,490
Zhe.

234
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,570
It’s nice.

235
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,560
You’re so pretty,

236
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,440
just like a girl.

237
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,370
I’m flattered.

238
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,410
Do you play with

239
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,880
robots just like

240
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,760
they do?

241
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,200
Yes. I’m in the same team with Wu Bai.

242
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,810
I saw he didn’t feel well yesterday.

243
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,980
So I come to see him.

244
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,940
It wasn’t a big deal.

245
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,260
Just a stomachache.

246
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,500
He took medicine.
Now he is resting.

247
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,050
Is he resting now?

248
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,970
I’d better take my leave.

249
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,610
I don’t want to disturb him, Grandpa.

250
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,490
Wait. Wait.

251
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,500
Have a chat with me.

252
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,820
I, I, I want to

253
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,890
ask you some questions.

254
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,450
Sure.

255
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,210
Please go ahead, Grandpa.

256
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,250
I know my Grandson, Bai,

257
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,440
very well.

258
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,560
He’s not that kind of person

259
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,080
who would come home as long as
he feels a little uncomfortable.

260
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,640
Was it possible that the team

261
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,290
had wronged him?

262
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,330
No, Grandpa.

263
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,490
He’s our Captain,

264
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,320
the main force of the team.

265
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,640
Nobody will bully him.

266
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,210
If it’s not about work,

267
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,930
is it about

268
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,860
love?

269
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,090
Has he met

270
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,970
some girl

271
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,570
who treats him as a punching bag?

272
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,730
I’m not sure about the details.

273
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,770
But there’s a girl

274
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,090
he’s loved for a long time.

275
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,320
Well, Bai has a girlfriend.

276
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,450
Maybe their relationship
doesn’t go well.

277
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,640
I knew it. I knew it.

278
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,980
He must be wronged

279
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,170
in the emotional life.

280
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,620
The girl takes him as a punching bag,
doesn’t she?

281
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,180
Poor, poor Bai.

282
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,060
His Grandpa can’t help him.

283
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,490
Well, Zhe,

284
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,420
is there any possible that

285
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,380
you have the photo of the girl?

286
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,380
The question is tailor-made for me.

287
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,890
I do have her photo.

288
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,170
Hold on.

289
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,090
Look.

290
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,890
This is the girl.

291
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,060
She’s pretty.

292
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,520
What’s her name?

293
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,820
Ai Qing.

294
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,620
Love?

295
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,180
What a nice name!

296
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,440
Wait.

297
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,860
Who’s the man next to her?

298
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,450
Why were they so close?

299
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,090
He’s Solo,

300
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,300
Ai Qing’s ex-boyfriend.

301
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,560
Ex-boyfriend?

302
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,440
Yeah.

303
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,420
Is there any chance
they would get back together?

304
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,650
It’s hard to say.

305
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,980
If they get back together,

306
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,330
what shall my Grandson do?

307
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,940
Bai would be disappointed in love.

308
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,330
Let me see it again.

309
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,540
This, this man isn’t

310
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,260
as good-looking as Bai.

311
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,810
That being said,

312
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,020
he has much more experience

313
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,740
than Bai in the industry.

314
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,270
What experiences does he have?

315
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,290
He’s called

316
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,980
Solo the Creator.

317
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,290
He’s the pioneer of the whole industry.

318
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,330
He is as awesome

319
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,930
as our boss, Han Shangyan.

320
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,900
-Don’t you have to train today?
-His…

321
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,660
Bai, don’t you have a stomachache?

322
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,290
Why don’t you take a longer rest?

323
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,570
It looks like your training
is far from sufficient.

324
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,570
Grandpa, I should take my leave now.

325
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,090
Well, I have something to attend to.

326
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,390
Don’t go. Spend more time with me.

327
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,570
Pardon me. I’ll talk to you next time.

328
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,210
Next time.

329
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,810
Grandpa, I’ll visit you next time.

330
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,380
I, I’ve got to go, Grandpa.

331
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,500
Goodbye. Goodbye.

332
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,300
Have a good rest.

333
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,740
Grandpa, I’ll go upstairs and rest.

334
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,930
Bai. Bai.

335
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,550
You have lots of merits.

336
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,500
The girl

337
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,930
definitely likes you.

338
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,570
Believe your Grandpa.

339
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,460
Are you awake?

340
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,550
Do you feel better?

341
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,260
My head aches.

342
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,810
You gave me a headache, too.

343
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,780
Last night while you were asleep,

344
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,900
you held the globe all the time.

345
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,700
I couldn’t even take it from you.

346
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,670
I’ve been your sister for 20 years.

347
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,410
I just found out

348
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,500
you talk in your sleep.

349
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,260
What did I say?

350
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,870
You straightened things out with Wu Bai

351
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,900
and turned him down?

352
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,940
How did you know?

353
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,630
You spoke loudly.

354
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,210
It was hard for me to miss it.

355
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,580
In my experience,

356
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,870
it’s useless

357
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,510
to do this.

358
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,910
Love is like

359
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,570
sneezing and coughing.

360
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,990
You can’t just hold it back.

361
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,090
Even if you can fool everyone,

362
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,700
can you fool yourself?

363
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,100
I must hold it back.

364
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,030
Well,

365
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,390
I’m going to work.

366
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,270
Bye.

367
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,990
How’s it going?

368
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,090
How about our boss and Wu Bai?

369
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,740
I didn’t see Boss.

370
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,820
Wu Bai has a stomachache.

371
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,620
He’s taken medicine.

372
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,460
Stomachache?

373
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,790
Shall I cook him some soup?

374
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,630
Hold on.

375
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,790
In my opinion,

376
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,820
it must be more than a stomachache.

377
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,570
I really don’t want to talk about it.

378
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,030
He seems to be dumped.

379
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,460
How do you know?

380
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,340
I showed Grandpa a picture of Ai Qing.

381
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,300
He gave me

382
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,790
an ice-cold stare.

383
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,820
Shall we do something?

384
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,390
Love is like drinking water.
Only he can feel the temperature.

385
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,820
We shouldn’t interfere.

386
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,060
Sounds fair.

387
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,990
I still need to teach him

388
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,390
a couple of tricks some time.

389
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,910
Look at me and Jing.

390
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,790
How sweet!

391
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,910
Don’t brag about it.

392
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,220
You’re jealous.

393
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,990
How’s the Chicago game coming along?

394
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,510
I’ve thoroughly studied the tactics.

395
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,870
Not bad. You deserve your reputation.

396
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,630
Come on.

397
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,740
Everybody, get ready for the meeting.

398
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,060
First, let’s welcome

399
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,580
our new coach, Ai Qing,

400
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
to introduce

401
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,220
your rival team

402
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,630
and assign you tasks.

403
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,910
OK.

404
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,150
Next,

405
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,940
I’ll give you a

406
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,990
brief introduction

407
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,750
about all the members of RAP,

408
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,750
including their personal abilities,

409
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,820
psychological quality, career achievement,
overall situation consciousness

410
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,750
and their weakness.

411
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,180
Next, the object of our training

412
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,270
is to show all the members of RAP

413
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,820
on the battlefield

414
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,150
that the glory of China’s SP Team

415
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,820
is by no means made up.

416
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,220
This is the information of RAP

417
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,430
I’ve prepared.

418
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,700
You should take a look.

419
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,830
Come on.

420
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,100
Come on. Have a look.

421
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,510
Read the information.

422
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,350
(Operation)
It includes operations,

423
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,700
blocking, pre-judgment of the team,
equipment

424
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,750
and personal stress tolerance.

425
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,820
All of these

426
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,630
must be paid attention to
in the competition.

427
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,670
Is there anything you don’t understand?

428
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,180
-Nothing.
-No.

429
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,760
Ai Qing.

430
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,060
Why don’t you give us

431
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,910
a mobilization before the battle?

432
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,100
Mobilization?

433
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,300
Yes.

434
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,400
We’re a new team.

435
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,390
We need a warm-up before the game.

436
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,230
Yes.

437
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,750
It’s the first battle

438
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,340
of SP Team I.

439
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,000
Coach.

440
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,270
Come on.

441
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,830
Inspire us a little.

442
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,160
We’re looking forward to it.

443
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,940
Coach. Coach. Coach.

444
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,940
OK. OK.

445
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,000
I will

446
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,520
give it a try.

447
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,910
I’ve never given a

448
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,710
mobilization before a battle.

449
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,590
I don’t know your routines.

450
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,790
Today I’ll give you

451
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,700
a mobilization

452
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,870
before the battle in Appledog’s way.

453
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,000
Actually, what I want to say is simple.

454
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,150
Just one point.

455
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,110
I don’t know if you know

456
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,640
SP Team II

457
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,460
is just two champions away

458
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,350
from the Grand Slam.

459
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,800
Their average age

460
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,060
is only 20 years old,

461
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,940
but the gold medals they won
in the past two years

462
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,910
are all over SP’s halls of glory.

463
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,160
This morning,

464
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,220
our boss called

465
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,680
their coach, being told

466
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,230
they won another champion.

467
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,230
Till today,

468
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,230
they’ve made a record of

469
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,920
17 consecutive wins.

470
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,040
Team I

471
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,390
has an average age

472
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
that’s eight years older than them.

473
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,920
But SP gives us the best resources

474
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,560
and highest expectations.

475
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,950
So, in this competition,

476
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,190
I wish every one of you

477
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,710
to do whatever you can

478
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,880
and hit your best form,

479
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,470
making all the people who support you

480
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,640
be proud of you.

481
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,640
Let all the commentator
be crazy for you.

482
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,560
Let the Chinese national flag

483
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,180
rise in every arena.

484
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,280
In the place

485
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
are buried all the dreams

486
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,830
that we’ve cherished
since we were teenagers.

487
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,470
Therefore,

488
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,350
please end our careers

489
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,640
with a Grand Slam.

490
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,090
Please.

00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,810
Hold on.

517
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,470
Let’s ask our new coach, Ai Qing,

518
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,040
to hand out the red packets.

519
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,890
Could I?

520
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,560
OK.

521
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,800
Thanks, Baona.

522
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,470
Happy new year.

523
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,520
Happy new year, coach.

524
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,280
Happy new year.

525
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,070
Happy new year, coach.

526
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,070
Happy new year.

527
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,800
Thanks, coach.

528
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,070
Every year,

529
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,110
at this time,

530
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,710
you’re greatly pleased.

531
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:09,680
All right.

532
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,590
Go back and have a good rest.

533
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,000
Get ready for the next game.

534
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,280
OK. Let’s go back and have a rest.

535
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,800
Don’t worry .

536
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,770
Have a good rest.

537
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,160
-Yeah.
-Don’t play games.

538
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,960
Rest assured.

539
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,560
Go back and have a rest.

540
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,600
It’s been a long day.

541
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,920
I still have some information
to prepare.

542
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,350
I’ll go back when I finish it.

543
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,410
OK. Don’t work too late.

544
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,080
Yes.

545
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,530
Bye, Boss.

546
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,170
How are you today?

547
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,300
Just finished a meeting.

548
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,850
It made my brain dizzy.

549
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,410
Are you still working?

550
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,250
Did you have dinner?

551
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,010
I’ll have it later.

552
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,600
I still have two meetings in a while.

553
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,540
That’s fine.

554
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,060
Distract your attention with work
when you’re disappointed in love.

555
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,000
That’s good.

556
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,530
Otherwise you may get depression.

557
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,530
But remember to have meals.
Do you hear me?

558
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,480
Who’s disappointed in love?

559
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,570
Besides, I’m not that vulnerable.

560
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,090
Enough.

561
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,770
You’re strong.

562
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,700
By the way,

563
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,170
how’s it going with you and Shen Zhe?

564
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,330
It goes well.

565
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,690
I have a feeling that

566
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,820
the one Shen Zhe loves isn’t me.

567
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,000
It’s Solo.

568
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,650
Since he entered the industry,

569
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,780
he’s been following Solo’s steps.

570
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,050
Finally, when he could challenge him,

571
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:24,970
he got more losses than winnings.

572
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,180
At last, when he’s become a
world-ranked player,

573
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,540
your Solo retired.

574
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,770
Stop. Stop.

575
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,820
I must correct you.

576
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,170
He’s not my Solo.

577
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:33,960
Give me a break.

578
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,130
Fine.

579
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,660
Solo isn’t yours.

580
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,300
Wu Bai isn’t yours, OK?

581
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,730
Fortunately, Shen Zhe

582
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,540
is still mine.

583
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,580
Here comes my take-out. Gotta go.

584
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,660
She’s always like that.

585
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,300
Hang up before she finishes.

586
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,420
Are you…

587
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,250
Hello.

588
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,420
I’m Shen Zhe’s ex.

589
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,610
Come on.

590
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,970
Here come the dumplings.

591
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,660
Come on.

592
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,370
Come on, bros.

593
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,370
Let’s get together today

594
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,080
to celebrate the new year ahead of time.

595
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,170
Sure. Sure.

596
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,010
Shen Zhe, dinner’s ready.

597
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,060
OK.

598
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,490
Shen Zhe.

599
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,370
You won’t go home to spend
Spring Festival this year, will you?

600
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,200
It’s too noisy.

601
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,330
I prefer quietness.

602
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,090
Just leave me alone at K&K,

603
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,460
so I can enjoy

604
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,820
the taste of loneliness.

605
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,020
All right. Do as you like.

606
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,660
Your ex is at my place.

607
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,610
Again?

608
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,660
What does that mean?

609
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,700
Xing Zhouzhou.

610
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,730
It’s her again.

611
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,860
You guys continue. I’ll pick up a call.

612
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,740
Sure. Sure.

613
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,540
Who is it?

614
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,210
Shen Zhe seems scared.

615
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,490
Is it his mom?

616
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,490
More terrifying than his mom.

617
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,780
His ex.

618
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,010
Ex?

619
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,010
Tell us.

620
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,180
Hurry up.

621
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,260
Well,

622
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,370
it’s a long story.

623
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,010
You all want to hear it.

624
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,300
Isn’t it improper?

625
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,370
Shen Zhe has an ex.

626
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,470
They had been together long ago.

627
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,490
Wu Bai and I both know it.

628
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,250
He used to be nice to her.

629
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,460
He was all obedient.

630
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,860
But then,

631
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,540
his ex has cheated on him.

632
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,010
Three times.

633
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,820
And then?

634
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,210
Then Shen Zhe learned from
the experience

635
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,250
and broke up with her completely.

636
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,940
But the girl wouldn’t let him go.

637
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,130
She has to make it up with him.

638
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:47,980
She kept cheating on him

639
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,070
while not giving him up.

640
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,620
Shen Zhe is a handsome guy
as well as a skillful player.

641
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,900
How could she?

642
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,910
Shen Zhe didn’t want to
make up with her,

643
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,940
but the girl

644
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,060
kneeled down in public,

645
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,130
proposed in public,
tried to commit suicide in public.

646
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,970
She had played every trick

647
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,540
that almost killed Shen Zhe.

648
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,730
She is horrible, isn’t she?

649
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,430
Of course.

650
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,460
Shen Zhe, why don’t you talk?

651
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,090
I have nothing to talk to her.

652
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,460
Xing Zhouzhou, stop crying, will you?

653
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,620
Did I owe you that much in my last life?

654
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,970
Leave her place now.

655
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,540
Shen Zhe,

656
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,700
we’d been happy growing up together.

657
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,940
What’s your point?

658
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,130
I deserve to be tormented by you,
do I?

659
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,850
Ai Jing.

660
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,220
Don’t believe whatever she says.

661
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,130
Believe me, OK?

662
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,460
OK. Bye.

663
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,900
Ai Jing.

664
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,950
Ai Jing.

665
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,380
I…

666
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,370
Wipe your tears.

667
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,740
No, thanks.

668
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,900
Would you like something to drink?

669
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,660
Juice or coffee?

670
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,780
No, thanks.

671
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,020
I don’t drink juice or coffee.

672
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,980
Then, have some pieces of apple.

673
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,550
No, thanks.

674
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,910
Are you sure?

675
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
I’ll help myself, then.

676
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,470
She is not so pretty,

677
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,180
but she’s good at
pretending to be polite.

678
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,340
Actually,

679
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,190
you don’t have to make a fuss

680
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,420
about emotional stuff,

681
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,340
do you?

682
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,670
As you don’t eat apples,

683
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,340
what would you like?

684
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,250
I can make it for you.

685
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,950
Don’t mind me.

686
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,190
Gotta go.

687
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,460
I…

688
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,070
Hey.

689
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,430
Shen Zhe, you scumbag.

690
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,220
Enough.

691
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,430
You’ve scolded me over 100 times today.

692
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,100
I just want to ask you one question.

693
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,190
Do you believe me or not?

694
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,140
No.

695
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,830
Then why do you answer my phone?

696
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,020
I’m older than you.

697
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,190
I don’t want to bully a guy
who’s younger than me.

698
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,140
Fine.

699
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,700
You’re the boss.

700
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,980
You’re the biggest boss, OK?

701
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,020
Ai Jing.

702
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,910
She was really messing with you.

703
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,550
If you don’t believe me,

704
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,550
I’ll ask Bai and 97 to help.

705
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,500
They can prove my innocence.

706
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Men’s friends are used for

707
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,710
covering each other, aren’t they?

708
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,740
No, what can I…

709
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,100
Drop it. Gotta go.

710
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,740
Don’t hang up.

711
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,620
It was my bad.

712
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,710
Let me apologize to you face to face.

713
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,830
How about that?

714
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,790
Forget it. I won’t see you.

715
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,590
So be it.

716
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,070
Let’s not disturb each other.

717
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,190
I’m begging you.

718
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,470
Let me explain it to you face to face.

719
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,470
If you’re still not satisfied,

720
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,620
just slap me.

721
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,950
I give you my words today.

722
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,080
If I told you one lie today,

723
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,670
you can slap me to death.

724
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,100
Enough.

725
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,590
That’s it.

726
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,020
I…

727
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,420
(Competition preparation materials)

728
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,130
Shush.

729
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,280
Why are you back?

730
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,340
Isn’t it the holiday?

731
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,310
I come back to get a document.

732
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,920
You stayed up all night, didn’t you?

733
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,550
We spent all night
on tactical discussion.

734
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,230
She’s such a workaholic.

735
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,100
You and her…

736
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,520
It’s a pity.

737
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,280
I’m serious.

738
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,310
Don’t talk nonsense.

739
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,200
It may interfere with her work.

740
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,240
In SP,

741
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,920
she and I just talk about business.

742
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,790
Don’t give up.

743
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,790
You still have chances.

744
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,720
I’ve wronged her before.

745
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,830
I dare not have extravagant hopes.

746
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,960
It has been years.

747
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,490
You should think about yourself.

748
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,590
All right. Get back to work.

749
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,000
Boss.

750
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,200
I’ve been sleeping till now, haven’t I?

751
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,150
Boss.

752
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,960
We’re on holiday today.

753
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,150
Why haven’t you left yet?

754
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,550
I’m leaving now.

755
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,070
The cleaning lady

756
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,830
asked you to turn off

757
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,010
all the lights before you leave.

758
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,210
I’ll remember it.

759
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,070
Anything else?

760
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,150
It seems that you didn’t take my cue.

761
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,970
I mean

762
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,310
you should go home now.

763
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,160
This is the last working day
before the new year.

764
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,520
You don’t have to work so hard.

765
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,310
Yes. I must listen to you.

766
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,310
Eat your breakfast.

767
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,970
I’ll take you home later.

768
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,870
Thanks. Boss.

769
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,010
Who’s it?

770
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,050
Who’s it?

771
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Ai Jing.

772
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,200
Ai Jing.

773
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,050
Your Ladyship,

774
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,120
could you give me a chance to explain?

775
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,630
What’s wrong with you?
Do you know what time it is?

776
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,790
Won’t you let me sleep?

777
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,920
I, I…

778
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,870
Upon my honor, Ai Jing, well…

779
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,630
Don’t you think I must

780
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,280
come to explain it to you?

781
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,960
Explain? Explain what?

782
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,450
Your ex?

783
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,080
There’s no need.

784
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,080
You take so much trouble
to apologize to me face to face.

785
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,240
There’s no need.

786
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,320
Here we are.

787
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,880
Hold on.

788
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,530
Lucky money.

789
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,350
Why? You’re not one of my elders.

790
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,520
Why do you give me luck money?

791
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,280
I’m your boss.
All the staff got lucky money.

792
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,250
Here.

793
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,360
OK. Thanks, Boss.

794
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,840
I’ve got something, too.

795
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,550
This is

796
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,930
for your daughter.

797
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,450
Don’t turn me down.

798
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,970
I thank you on behalf of Xiao’ai.

799
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,690
Goodbye.

800
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,070
Happy new year.

801
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,010
Happy new year.

802
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,120
See you.

803
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,350
Bye-bye.

804
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,400
What do you mean?

805
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,630
What do I mean?

806
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,520
I mean to tell you

807
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,830
I have nothing to do with you.

808
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,720
Please tell your ex,

809
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,400
your ex-ex, your ex-ex-ex.

810
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,210
Every debt has its debtor.
Find their true debtors.

811
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,360
Don’t come to bother me.

812
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,800
Because I have nothing to do

813
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,520
with you at all.

814
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,720
What’s the meaning of
having nothing to do with me?

815
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,010
Don’t you like me?

816
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,400
Which eye of yours can see
I like you?

817
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,970
I can tell from both of your eyes

818
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,880
that you like me.

819
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,520
You’re ridiculous. I like you?

820
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,930
How can you tell I like you?

821
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,010
Have I ever hugged or kissed you?

822
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,480
You need to calm down now.

823
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,250
Don’t flatter yourself.

824
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,360
Say it again.

825
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,530
I said I don’t like you at all.

826
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,600
Firstly, I’ve never kissed you.

827
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,120
Secondly, I’ve never hugged you.

828
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,800
I didn’t ask you to say that again.

829
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,010
I asked you to say

830
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,400
you have nothing to do with me

831
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,560
-again.
-I have…

832
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
I’m not a repeater.

833
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,080
Why should I say it again?

834
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,320
Because I want you to say it again.

835
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,220
Then I’ll tell you again…

836
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,530
I didn’t mean it.

837
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,210
You don’t like me.

838
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,970
You have nothing to do with me, huh?

839
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,490
Then why are you doing this to me?

840
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,890
You’re two-faced.

841
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,400
Damn you.

842
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,560
Stop grinning. Get up.

843
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,770
I won’t.

844
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,370
I’ll beat you if you don’t.

845
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,600
Come on.

846
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,800
I can bear it.

847
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,020
You just said

848
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,090
what you would do
if you like someone?

849
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,940
Will you do this?

850
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,640
Will you do this?

851
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,730
Here you go again.

852
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,640
It won’t work this time.
