(Shen Zhe)

20
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,900
What are you looking at?

21
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,700
She hasn’t replied to you?

22
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,020
Am I right?

23
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,380
It’s none of your business.

24
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,580
Sure.

25
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,060
I’ve had it.

26
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,660
Nonsense.

27
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,420
The lid hasn’t been opened.

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,060
You drank it with your force?

29
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,460
I want to use my force

30
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,980
to stop you from drinking it.

31
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,500
This is so refreshing.

32
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,740
Tell me.

33
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,500
What happened?

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,900
She’s just left.

35
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,300
And you start to miss her already?

36
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,940
It’s not me.

37
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,900
Well... I have a friend.

38
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,500
What should he do

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,020
in a situation like this?

40
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,780
It’s rather simple.

41
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,020
Your friend can go straight to her.

42
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,540
They’re all staying in Shanghai.

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,420
Although

44
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,300
the location of K&K Team

45
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,540
is indeed

46
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,820
not ideal.

47
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,300
But, to pursue true love,

48
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,540
you can endure these hardships,

49
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,580
right?

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,140
I googled for you just now.

51
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,660
It’s my friend, not me.

52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,020
Stop pretending.

53
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,220
I googled for you just now.

54
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,620
Take the subway for 18 stops,

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,420
and then take 3 different buses.

56
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,300
Get off the bus,

57
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,580
and walk another
3 or 4 kilometers.

58
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,140
Then you’ll arrive at her place.

59
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,940
I looked it up on the map.

60
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,900
If the traffic isn’t busy,

61
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,740
you’ll arrive in 3 hours and 45 minutes.

62
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,540
It’s not far.

63
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,260
It’s a bit far,

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,020
right?

65
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,820
In that case, we need to

66
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,820
buy a car.

67
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,660
Ask Han Shangyan to spare some budget

68
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,020
and buy K&K Team a car.

69
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,540
We can share it,

70
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,380
right?

71
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,220
Our K&K

72
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,180
is a pretty big club.

73
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,020
But we only have one car.

74
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,900
And our boss occupies it.

75
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,900
It’s very inconvenient.

76
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,780
He won’t approve of it.

77
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,580
Why?

78
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,540
He doesn’t have the money.

79
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,020
He doesn’t?

80
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,740
It seems to be a sad story.

81
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,220
The night is long.

82
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,300
Goodnight.

83
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,660
What?

84
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,700
You’re suggesting that

85
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,140
I should go to see her first?

86
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,020
Of course.

87
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,220
That’s what you should do.

88
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,060
But, what if she

89
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,260
is really busy?

90
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,460
Right.

91
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,340
She is busy hanging out with guys

92
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,540
who are more important.

93
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,540
This is just a kind reminder.

94
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,780
Goodnight.

95
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,340
Are you free tomorrow?

96
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,660
Why?

97
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,420
Go to a 4S store with me.

98
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,860
You just said that
Han Shangyan doesn’t have the money.

99
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,580
I have.

100
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,940
Good for you.

101
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,140
See you tomorrow.

102
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,740
This model of RX5PLUS

103
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,420
is spacious and has a modern design.

104
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,500
It’s equipped with

105
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,060
automobile intelligent system.

106
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,940
It’s very good for youngsters like you.

107
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,220
Try it.

108
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,660
It’s the first time I see a customer

109
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,020
who tries passenger’s seat first.

110
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,620
He wants to see the comfort level of
the passenger’s seat.

111
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,420
That’s a first.

112
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,980
But don’t worry.

113
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,140
Our seats are as comfortable as

114
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,700
luxury couches.

115
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,620
The person who’ll sit on
his passenger’s seat

116
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,620
is very precious.

117
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,420
He’s been pursuing her
for more than a decade.

118
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,020
He’s been through a lot.

119
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
You’re here to select a car.

120
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,340
Why are you so gossipy?

121
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,180
Why are you checking out the back seats?

122
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,740
People select cars
based on the function.

123
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,620
You only care about its comfort level?

124
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,500
The back seats are spacious too.

125
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,180
It must be comfortable for the elders.

126
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,340
The elders have weaker immune systems.

127
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,740
They must be extra careful on trips.

128
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,020
The AC of this car

129
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,700
has PM2.5 infiltration

130
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,340
-Hello, Ai Jing.
-and UV sterilization.

131
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,420
You don’t have
to worry about the elders.

132
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,980
I’ll take this one.

133
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
Is it available now?

134
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,020
Yes.

135
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,540
We can sign the papers right now.

136
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,260
Okay.

137
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,340
Wu Bai.

138
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,460
Ai Jing is looking for me.

139
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,620
I’ll go now.

140
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,780
Don’t leave me, Jane.

141
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,020
Let me go, Mr. Rochester.

142
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,660
What do you want me to do, Jane?

143
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,300
Sacrifice the rest of my life to her?

144
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,060
She’s your wife, sir.

145
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,020
You’re punishing me.

146
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,140
You’re torturing me.

147
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,460
Do you think it’s easy for me?

148
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,740
Do you think I’m happy to see

149
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,980
you suffer?

150
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,380
Every cell in my body is screaming

151
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,260
for me to comfort you.

152
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,780
If there’s any slightest possibility,
I’ll comfort you.

153
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,460
But I can’t.

154
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,380
I can’t let go of my self-esteem

155
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,940
for these temptations.

156
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,300
You have a wife.

157
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,780
And you belong only to her.

158
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,140
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

159
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,900
Well done. Well done.

160
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,700
Thank you for your performance.

161
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,740
Go get changed.

162
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,620
Thank you, Director.

163
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,300
Thank you.

164
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,060
Thank you so much.

165
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,420
How do you like it, Director?

166
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:52,980
Ai Jing.

167
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,300
You did an amazing job.

168
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
We’re all impressed.

169
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Well done.

170
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,460
I’m relieved that I didn’t let you down.

171
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:57,900
You surely didn’t.

172
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,620
I’ll do my best.

173
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,740
Keep it going.

174
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,420
Keep it up.

175
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,580
Okay.

176
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,540
Why are you still standing there?

177
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,180
Your performance is incredible today.

178
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,140
Thank you.

179
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,620
I’m touched.

180
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,900
Do you want to

181
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,140
go to dinner with me later?

182
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,180
I’m sorry.

183
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,340
Someone is waiting for me.

184
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,900
Is that your boyfriend?

185
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,620
Of course not.

186
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,060
Fine. See you tomorrow.

187
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,700
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

188
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,380
You came!

189
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,500
Who is that guy?

190
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,980
My Mr. Rochester.

191
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,420
Your Mr. Rochester?

192
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,980
Is he yours?

193
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,620
Sure.

194
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,740
What?

195
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,300
Ai Jing, I am being serious.

196
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,980
Do you remember

197
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,620
the last sentence I said to you

198
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,860
at the KTV in Guangzhou?

199
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,060
What did you say? I can’t remember.

200
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,620
Thank you, Director.

201
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,300
Come here. Hurry.

202
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,180
I know an amazing restaurant

203
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,620
on Huaihai Road.

204
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,820
I’ve heard about it, too.

205
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,620
I know.

206
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,420
Its dishes are great.

207
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,500
The curtain.

208
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,660
Lift the curtain.

209
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,300
Great.

210
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,180
Let’s go then.

211
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,820
Sure.

212
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,500
Let’s ask Zhao to go with us.

213
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,540
Okay.

214
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,860
It’s quiet now.

215
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,060
They must have left.

216
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,180
Take a look.

217
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,260
Wait for me.

218
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,180
I remember I put my script here.

219
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,860
Think carefully. Where did you put it?

220
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,300
Have they left?

221
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,180
Let me take a look.

222
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,300
They’re coming toward us.

223
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,860
They’re here.

224
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,060
Where are they?

225
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,180
They’re coming toward the stage.

226
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,620
Hurry. Don’t look.

227
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,620
Watch out.

228
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,300
Are they still here?

229
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,820
Yes, they’re.

230
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
They’re walking toward us.

231
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,380
Where are they?

232
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,060
They... They were just here.

233
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,580
They’re still here.

234
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,780
You tricked me.

235
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,660
Come back.

236
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,060
Seriously,

237
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,140
do you remember it?

238
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,300
Let me refresh your memory.

239
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,620
If you don’t remember,

240
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,820
why are you covering your mouth?

241
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,980
Bugs.

242
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,060
There are many flying bugs.

243
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,500
Look. They flew that way.

244
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,500
To be honest,

245
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,500
the show is

246
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,420
really amazing.

247
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,420
Actually, there’re many sides of me.

248
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,260
You just don’t know me well enough.

249
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,500
Can you give me a chance

250
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,660
to know you?

251
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,620
I’ve given you the chance, haven’t I?

252
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,780
When did you give me the chance?

253
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,500
You never answer my calls.

254
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,780
You don’t reply to my texts.

255
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,540
Where’s my chance?

256
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,820
Isn’t it better to meet you

257
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,860
face to face?

258
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,540
What song do you

259
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,860
often play?

260
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,900
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.

261
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,940
Not bad.

262
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,340
You can play nursery rhymes.

263
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,580
There’re also many sides of me.

264
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,500
Are you interested in
getting to know me?

265
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,660
Since we all have many sides,

266
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,940
let’s get to know each other.

267
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,660
♪Haven’t seen you in a while♪

268
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,340

00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,140

(Has won a competition)

275
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,900
Ai Qing,

276
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,780
today is my play’s
first official rehearsal.

277
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,020
I’ll go now.

278
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,260
Breakfast is left on the table.

279
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,620
Don’t forget to eat it when you wake up.

280
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,500
You are so loud.

281
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,940
How could I not wake up?

282
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,260
Ai Qing.

283
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,020
Ai Qing.

284
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,340
Haven’t you left already?

285
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,260
-Hurry.
-Why are you back?

286
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,420
Hurry. Come with me.

287
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,060
Come.

288
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,380
What?

289
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,460
Why do you take me here?

290
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,300
Look down.

291
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,740
What?

292
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,740
Why is Wu Bai here?

293
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,020
When did he come here?

294
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,260
I was also shocked when I saw him.

295
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,180
Take care of it yourself.

296
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,660
I’ll be late if I don’t go now.

297
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,340
A handsome guy came to you.

298
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,460
Grab the chance.

299
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,540
Good morning.

300
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,220
Morning.

301
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,140
Let’s have breakfast together.

302
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,180
Okay.

303
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,020
Wait for me.

304
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,500
I’ll get changed first.

305
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,540
What are you looking at?

306
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,020
This outfit

307
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,100
is cute.

308
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Thanks.

309
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,020
What do you want?

310
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,380
Everything works for me.

311
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,260
You live here.

312
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,340
You choose.

313
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,900
Let’s go to a nearby restaurant.

314
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,180
It serves great food.

315
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,780
Let’s go.

316
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,260
Sir.

317
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,860
One pan-fried bun.
One savory rice puddings.

318
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,860
Do you want soy milk sweet or salty?

319
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,660
Sweat.

320
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,620
Then two sweet soy milk.

321
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,540
Thanks.

322
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,580
Wait a second.

323
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,980
What is savory rice puddings?

324
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,740
You’ll know when you try it.

325
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,420
Thanks.

326
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,060
Thanks.

327
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,940
Thanks.

328
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,780
Hello. Your savory rice puddings.

329
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,580
Have a try.

330
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,260
Do you like it?

331
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,100
Not bad.

332
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,860
Really?

333
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,500
I was worried that
you might not like it.

334
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,180
Strictly speaking,

335
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,820
this is the first breakfast
we have together.

336
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,940
This place is not fancy at all.

337
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:22,980
It’s fine.

338
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,540
The environment here is nice.

339
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,980
I quite like this place.

340
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,140
-Here.
-It’s great then.

341
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,260
Have some.

342
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,020
Okay.

343
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
-You...
-You...

344
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,700
After you.

345
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,180
After you.

346
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,060
K&K Team is so far away from here.

347
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,900
When did you set out?

348
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,660
At 3 or 4 AM.

349
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,980
You left your place so early?

350
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,180
You barely had any sleep.

351
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,220
You came here so early.

352
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,820
Do you need me for something?

353
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,580
I want to have breakfast with you.

354
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,980
What did you want to tell me?

355
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,460
Will you go to

356
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,020
next month’s competition in Suzhou?

357
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,180
I substituted for my colleague
last time.

358
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,020
This time, she can substitute for me.

359
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,780
What?

360
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,580
Can you come?

361
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,540
I wish you can come.

362
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,700
You can take

363
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,380
our K&K Team’s bus.

364
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,380
Okay.

365
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,900
Then,

366
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,780
a deal is a deal.

367
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,300
A deal is a deal.

368
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,620
Have you had breakfast?

369
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,140
Their house cat doesn’t flee

370
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,140
when it sees you.

371
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,700
It seems to like you.

372
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,020
I like it, too.

373
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,900
You’ve liked

374
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,660
too many things today.

375
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,780
(Welcome)

376
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,980
Good morning, Captain.

377
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Good morning.

378
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,020
You bought us breakfast?

379
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,380
Great! Thank you, Captain.

380
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:38,780
Have a try.

381
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,420
Thank you.

382
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,500
It’s rice puddings!

383
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,580
It’s my favorite.

384
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,580
Captain knows me the best.

385
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,820
Of course.

386
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,940
Why is this salty?

387
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,420
Doesn’t it taste good?

388
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,700
How can rice puddings be salty?

389
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Isn’t this delicious?

390
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,780
It... tastes so weird.

391
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,900
You have lousy taste.

392
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,660
Where’s Shen Zhe?

393
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,940
He’s inside.

394
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,780
Finish it. Don’t waste it.

395
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,100
The speed of the weapons must be
in coordination with the accelerator.

396
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,300
If you can’t operate it on your own,

397
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
I can ask Zhou Yi to do it with you.

398
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,540
Bro,

399
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,340
goading doesn’t work for me.

400
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,940
Give me more time.

401
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,860
I can operate them well.

402
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,780
I’m not joking with you.

403
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,180
This robot that spins at every angle

404
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,220
is often operated
by two people worldwide.

405
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,300
There’s nothing to be ashamed of.

406
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,300
We’re teammates,

407
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,540
not competitors.

408
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,580
Of course.

409
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,940
It’s fine if you insist on

410
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,820

411
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,780
From today on,

412
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,100
you will have two more hours
of training every day

413
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,060
to work on the coordination
of your hands.

414
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,300
If you can’t do it

415
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,060
in a month,

416
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,060
I will ask Zhou Yi
to operate it with you.

417
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,540
No.

418
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,820

517
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,020
Qing, you just returned
from your trip.

518
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,260
You need time to rest.

519
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,460
Na, you’ll go to Suzhou.

520
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,220
Qing.

521
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,340
Is this plan okay with you?

522
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,820
Lin,

523
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,980
we’ve just discussed.

524
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,820
I’ll go to Suzhou this time.

525
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,100
It...

526
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,180
It... it’s great that you’ll go.

527
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,540
Think about it.

528
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,980
You’re the master.

529
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,980
If a master is absent,

530
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,860
the event is insignificant.

531
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,020
Am I right?

532
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,500
Lin,

533
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,780
haven’t you just said that

534
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,660
I should go?

535
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,500
I just said you...

536
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,620
You... you should go sit down.

537
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,740
Go sit down.

538
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,020
Qing, don’t worry.

539
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,740
I’ll take care of

540
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,860
everything for your trip.

541
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,740
I’ll make sure it’s all 5-star service.

542
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,060
Qing, I’ll leave you
with your work now.

543
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,980
Oh. I forget to mention it.

544
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,220
Qing, this time

545
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,620
you’ll sit on the VIP seat.

546
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,300
Go ahead.

547
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,900
Isn’t this a wrong example of

548
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,460
flattering?

549
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,060
Kind of.

550
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,860
My face is twisted.

551
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,580
Did you see how his face was cramped?

552
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,300
Captain, let me put away your suitcase.

553
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,620
Good morning.

554
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,420
Good morning.

555
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,020
Good morning, Qing.

556
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,700
Hello.

557
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,020
-Hello.
-Good morning.

558
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,020
Thank you for

559
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,700
letting me

560
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,820
take your K&K Team’s bus.

561
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,380
No problem. Welcome.

562
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,980
There comes your rival in love.

563
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,140
Oh, Captain.

564
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,580
Coach called this morning,

565
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,980
saying that SP Team’s bus is broken.

566
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,740
They’ll go to Suzhou with us.

567
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,220
I see.

568
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
Good morning.

569
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,620
Thank you for allowing us
to take your bus.

570
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,780
Good morning, Ai Qing.

571
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,540
Good morning.

572
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,060
Good morning.

573
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,780
You’re going to
Suzhou’s competition too?

574
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,500
Yes, our company is
also responsible for the event.

575
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,540
Little Appledog.

576
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,300
You’re here too. Great.

577
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,500
Give it to me.

578
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,660
Thank you.

579
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,580
Let’s share the umbrella.

580
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,140
Your car is broken?

581
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,940
Yes.

582
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,700
That’s why we have to ride with others.

583
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,460
Are you feeling restless?

584
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,780
Do you need me to investigate for you?

585
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,860
Investigate what?

586
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,420
To ask her whether
she still likes Solo or not.

587
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
Wu Bai.

588
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,740
Bro, you’re good at rubbing it in.

589
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,780
No.

590
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,980
I mean well, bro.

591
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,620
Let’s go.

592
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,060
Come. Sit here.

593
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,620
Come.

594
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,220
Okay.

595
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,860
How’s yesterday’s plan?

596
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,100
Almost done.

597
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,620
Have you made the decision?

598
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,340
It’s settled then.

599
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,060
I’ll sit in the back.

600
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,660
Are you okay?

601
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,220
I’m fine.

602
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,260
See you later.

603
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,540
You should be thankful
for having invited her.

604
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,340
I’m so proud of you.

605
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,860
You wake up?

606
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,060
Why are you sitting in the back?

607
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,180
It’s easy to watch over my teammates.

608
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,860
You’re such

609
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,780
a sweet captain.

610
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,020
May I ask you a question?

611
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,380
New Year is coming.

612
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,460
I want to give my teammates red packets.

613
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,780
How much do you think is appropriate?

614
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,060
I think

615
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,300
500 yuan per person.

616
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,460
That seems enough.

617
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,500
Yes.

618
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,300
What happened?

619
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,100
Have we arrived?

620
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,860
It’s fine.

621
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,780
It’s all right.

622
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,460
The cars before us collided.

623
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,220
Collided? Okay.

624
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,540
Where’s Wu Bai?

625
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,060
Where’s Captain?

626
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,100
Was he thrown out of the window?

627
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,260
How’s that possible?
He’s around 1.9 meters tall.

628
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,260
Sit down.

629
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,220
Wu Bai.

630
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,620
Wu Bai.

631
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,340
I'm here.

632
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,540
We’re talking about
New Year’s red packets.

633
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,300
Red packet? I want a big one.

634
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,180
I want a big one too.

635
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,980
Me too.

636
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,140
-Thank you, Captain.
-Thank you, Captain.

637
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,740
(Chinese Robot Fighting League
Suzhou Competition)

638
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,300
(2020 Chinese Robot Fighting League
Suzhou Competition)

639
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,260
(Mecha)

640
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,580
(Chinese Robot Fighting League
Suzhou Competition)

641
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,780
Dear audiences, welcome to

642
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,300
(Suzhou Competition)
the Suzhou competition of

643
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,220
2020 Chinese Robot Fighting League,

644
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,020
funded by SAIC Roewe.

645
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,220
The player who’ll represent K&K Team

646
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,460
on the first competition is Shen Zhe,

647
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,380
and his robot that’s called

648
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,140
(Trash Can)
Trash Can.

649
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,780
Both sides are ready.

650
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,780
The competition will start soon.

651
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,700
Once the competition starts,

652
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,340
we see Shen Zhe

653
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,460
put the robot at full speed.

654
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,380
This is a risky move.

655
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,940
If the pace of the weapons

656
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,780
can’t catch up with
the speed of the robot,

657
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,380
without the attack of the rivals,

658
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,780
his robot will trip itself.

659
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,820
We’ve noticed that

660
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,100
Shen Zhe has obviously practiced

661
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,780
the coordination ability of his hands.

662
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,260
He’s indeed one of the best operators

663
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,500
in this new generation.

664
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,980
In the whole world,

665
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,340
we don’t see many operators

666
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,980
who can single-handedly control a robot

667
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,740
that rotates at every angle.

668
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,860
It seems that
the grueling training worked.

669
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,580
I know.

670
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,020
He’s really good.

671
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,820
Look at it.

672
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,620
It stopped.

673
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,380
It’s not moving.

674
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,340
Now’s the time. Go!

675
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,260
We just saw the other robot

676
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,580
was thrown into the air by a field trap.

677
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,460
Shen Zhe seized the chance and struck.

678
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,820
A complete victory!

679
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,580
Congratulations.

680
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,500
Let’s congratulate Shen Zhe
for winning the game!

681
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,540
This is a great game.

682
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,860
Congratulations, Shen Zhe.

683
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,940
Well done.

684
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,300
Congratulations, Shen Zhe.

685
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,380
He’s indeed a top operator
in this new generation.

686
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,580
His first battle since he joined

687
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,980
K&K Team is a complete victory.

688
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,460
Not bad.

689
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,820
How’s it?

690
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,020
Am I good?

691
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,460
Grunt!

692
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,540
Such a clean fight.

693
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,860
Of course.

694
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,820
I’m born to be the winner.

695
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,140
Your Trash Can lives up to its name.

696
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,220
It retrieves all the trash.

697
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,140
I’m a man of my words.

698
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,340
You scared the hell out of me just now.

699
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,340
I thought there was
something wrong with the robot.

700
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,940
All is fair in a war.

701
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,140
Learn from me.

702
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,060
You’re so cunning, bro.

703
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,540
You should treat us to dinner, bro.

704
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,380
No problem.

705
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,340
Really?

706
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,220
I’ve told you that

707
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,100
I’m born to be the winner.

708
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,260
Well done.

709
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,460
Listen.

710
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,980
No one knows about mecha

711
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,820
better than I do.

712
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,100
Look at him.

713
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,300
-Well done.
-You’re boasting now.

714
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,100
I’m not.

715
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,860
Let’s have dinner together.
