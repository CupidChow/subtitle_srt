=Episode 23=

19
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,660
My sister told me that

20
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,540
a new operator suddenly
joined your team.

21
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,420
Are you feeling alright?

22
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,380
I beat him before.

23
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,780
I don’t need to be overly concerned.

24
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,060
You sound like you’re a bit concerned.

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,380
The signal is bad.

26
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,500
You must have misheard.

27
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,180
All right.

28
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,140
A handsome man like you is always right.

29
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,660
Go to bed early.

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,380
I’ll have some extra training.

31
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,500
Go to sleep.

32
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,540
All right. Good night.

33
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,380
Good night.

34
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,740
Have some fruit.

35
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,300
You came right in time.

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,820
I just finished calling Shen Zhe.

37
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,100
Is...

38
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,580
Is he alright?

39
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,660
He denied his bad mood.

40
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,060
But what are you and Wu Bai doing?

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,660
You tried to poach the same guy.

42
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,220
Are you competing

43
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,300
like the Mr. Smith & Mrs. Smith?

44
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,780
What?

45
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,500
It’s so imaginative of you.

46
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,180
We make a clear distinction

47
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,100
between business and private affairs.

(Tao Qitao)

49
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,860
(Tao Qitao)
What’re you up?

50
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,580
You won’t understand, anyway.

51
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,580
I received it.

52
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,500
Don’t worry.

53
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,100
I’m used to the life in K&K.

54
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,660
People here are nice.

55
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,420
Simply several teammates

56
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,580
look a bit odd.

57
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,500
Wu Bai won the champion
with such a team.

58
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,620
It means he’s indeed brilliant.

59
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,100
Don’t worry.

60
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,500
Bye-bye.

61
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,780
Dude,

62
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,940
it’s okay that you’re sleepless.

63
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,380
But why do you make us sleepless, too?

64
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,900
How unreasonable you are!

65
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,740
Are you practicing blocking?

66
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,380
Blocking is indeed important.

67
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,220
Well, I think

68
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,620
you’re simply tough-talking.

69
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,900
You contradicted Captain,

70
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,860
but behind him,

71
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,420
(Trash Can)
you still practice without sleeping.

72
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,220
(Trash Can)

73
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,020
Could you please hold your tongue?

74
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,700
The robot is in good condition.

75
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,220
Good enough for your practice overnight.

76
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,060
The food is getting cold.

77
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,300
Have some.

78
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,620
Thanks.

79
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,100
I’ll have it after a lap.

80
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,020
Tao Qitao isn’t a simple man.

81
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,860
Even Captain is on his side.

82
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,740
I don’t know

83
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,660
why Wu Bai supports him,

84
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,660
but I’m sure about something.

85
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,060
-What?
-What?

86
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,380
In term of the team thing,

87
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,900
he has never made an unwise decision.

88
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,060
I suddenly remember that

89
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,620
there’re several bugs with Trash Can.

90
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,140
I’ll put the food here.

91
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,380
Let’s say no more.

92
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,100
Some foreign masters

93
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,660
make public their design manuscripts.

94
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,020
I’ll get them here and let’s study them.

95
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,900
Okay.

96
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,860
Zhou Yi.

97
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,060
What, 97?

98
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,340
Do you think

99
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,500
we should adjust this part?

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,540
Let me check.

101
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,780
Team members’ potentials
have been maximized.

102
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,260
Everyone is getting stronger.

103
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,580
Hello, Xiao’ai?

104
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,220
Go to bed early

105
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,740
with your grandma.

106
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,020
Don’t wait up for me.

107
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,340
I’ll be back home soon.

108
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,220
Dad,

109
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,820
didn’t you promise
to have less extra work?

110
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,780
All right.

111
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,740
I’ll have less extra work tomorrow,
okay?

112
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,860
Then I’ll go back home early for you.

113
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
Dad,

114
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,580
I can’t stop worrying about you.

115
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,220
After I go abroad,

116
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,060
no one will supervise you.

117
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,940
Let’s make a deal, then.

118
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,980
I promise you that

119
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,380
I’ll take good care of myself,

120
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,340
all right?

121
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,860
And after you go abroad,

122
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,460
you should also listen to your mother,

123
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,660
okay?

124
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,100
Fine.

125
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,420
You bent my ears.

126
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,420
Dad,

127
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,500
come back quickly.

128
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,020
I’m already sleepy.

129
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,180
Fine.

130
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,180
Go to bed.

131
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,260
I’m going back home soon.

132
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,980
Bye-bye, Dad.

133
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,420
After I leave,

134
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,180
listen to Captain and Boss,

135
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,300
and practice carefully.

136
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,020
Do you hear me?

137
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,380
Rest assured, Coach.

138
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,900
Captain and I

139
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,060
are close friends.

140
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,020
Aren’t we, Captain?

141
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,580
Congratulations,

142
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,900
on realizing your dream

143
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,300
to live with Xiao’ai.

144
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,340
My regret for years

145
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,060
can finally be made up for.

146
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,340
But I feel sorry

147
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,060
for Solo and Ai Qing.

148
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,260
I hope they’ll get back together

149
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,060
after I leave.

150
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,740
I’m sorry.

151
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,300
Am I bringing up

152
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,300
something inessential again?

153
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,860
It doesn’t matter, Coach.

154
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,740
After you arrive,

155
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,100
call us often.

156
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,940
I will.

157
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,340
Captain,

158
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,700
get back the champion of the World Cup.

159
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,980
I will.

160
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,060
Come on!

161
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,460
-I’m leaving.
-Bye-bye, Coach.

162
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,180
Take care.

163
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,020
What’s the time?

164
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,060
Half past nine.

165
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,820
It’s too late.

166
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
What... what are you going to do?

167
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,100
Food delivery.

168
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,660
Food delivery?

169
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,220
Even Wu Bai is doing the food delivery?

170
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,500
Hello, Zebra.

171
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,420
What do you want?

172
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,020
Order a cup of coffee for me.

173
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,460
Toffee Nut.

174
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,260
Hot.

175
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,300
Pay now.

176
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,820
Paid for Ai Qing.

177
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Do you need navigation

178
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,660
to Ai Qing’s home?

179
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,700
Yes.

180
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,780
Is there any restaurant along the way
that girls like?

181
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,980
I’ll buy some food.

182
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,260
I’ve witnessed too much
public display of affection.

183
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,940
A highly-recommended restaurant
has been found.

184
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,380
Ready to go.

185
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
Here’s your food delivery.

186
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,140
Mr. Deliveryman,

187
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,340
where’s my food?

188
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,300
Here it is,

189
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,740
Miss Ai Qing.

190
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,340
I’m satisfied.

191
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,020
May I invite you
to enjoy the food with me?

192
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,460
I’m afraid not.

193
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,420
It’s against our work regulation.

194
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,140
What a company!

195
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,260
Quit your job, then.

196
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,220
All right.

197
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,460
I’m starving.

198
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,820
Sorry I can’t have breakfast with you today.

199
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,620
Why?

200
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,900
I have an appointment
with the new coach.

201
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,180
New coach?

202
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,180
Who?

203
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,660
I’ll keep it secret for the moment.

204
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,180
Fine.

205
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,300
Get back to your work, then.

206
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,620
Don’t forget to have breakfast.

207
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,740
See you.

208
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,740
See you.

209
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,700
What?

210
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,780
Nothing.

211
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,900
I just want to hug you.

212
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,740
Ai Qing,

213
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,860
let me serve
as your exclusive deliveryman forever.

214
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,100
My regret for years

215
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,860
can finally be made up for.

216
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,700
But I feel sorry

217
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,580
for Solo and Ai Qing.

218
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,860
I hope they’ll get back together

219
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,340
after I leave.

220
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,820
You wanted to see me?

221
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,540
May I have a word with you?

222
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,940
Sure.

223
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,740
Go ahead.

224
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,340
Thank you.

225
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,740
What are you going to do

226
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,140
after you retire?

227
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,100
Why did everybody ask the same question?

228
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,300
I’m going back to run my small shop

229
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,220
and hire two students for part-time job.

230
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,020
Then,

231
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,860
I’ll sit there and count my money.

232
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,060
What do you think?

233
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,140
Sounds good, doesn’t it?

234
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,060
Would you like a membership?

235
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,740
You’ll have 50% off.

236
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,140
Xiaomi,

237
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,380
I want you to stay in this industry.

238
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,220
You want?

239
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,460
Han Shangyan sent you, didn’t he?

240
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:01,940
No.

241
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,780
I come for Ai Qing,

242
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,940
and K&K.

243
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,140
You and Ai Qing...?

244
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,860
You’re a star player!

245
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,340
I’ll protect her.

246
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,340
Thank you.

247
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,540
I’m so happy

248
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,820
when someone still cares for her.

249
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,020
People like us

250
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,500
have quite an obsession.

251
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,740
The other day, Solo said that

252
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,300
he had bought the old house

253
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,500
where Solo Team lived ten years ago.

254
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,500
I was thinking

255
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,060
we couldn’t just let go

256
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,100
of the past ten years.

257
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,380
However,

258
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,060
people should move forward,

259
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
shouldn’t they?

260
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,540
Yes.

261
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,820
People move forward.

262
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,700
That’s why you should stay.

263
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,580
Why?

264
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,540
For the champion dream in your heart.

265
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,940
Join K&K

266
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,700
and be the coach.

267
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,460
Let’s be the world champion.

268
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,340
No, no.

269
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,940
It took me great trouble

270
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,140
to decide to start a business.

271
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,580
Let me realize my beautiful dream

272
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,140
to become rich through hard work.

273
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,940
If doing small business

274
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,420
could make you happier,

275
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,020
you wouldn’t have made a comeback.

276
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,900
Don’t push me to tell the truth.

277
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,980
Wu Bai,

278
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,060
I played games for years.

279
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,980
But I never worked as a coach.

280
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,420
You should find

281
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,060
a better coach

282
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,940
to help you.

283
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,780
You’re my best choice.

284
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,260
As a professional player,

285
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,820
you’re no longer young.

286
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,700
You react a bit slowly

287
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,260
and you don’t feel strong enough.

288
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,780
But for a coach,

289
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,940
you’re the most experienced
in this industry.

290
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,900
You have operational experience

291
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,860
that can’t be paralleled by new players.

292
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,620
That’s why you can give

293
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,140
systematic learning and training
to the team.

294
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,140
-Xiaomi.
-I...

295
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,500
I always remember

296
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,380
the motto of Solo Team.

297
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
Some people

298
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,180
always have dreams

299
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,700
and complete enthusiasm.

300
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:23,900
So,

301
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,140
please don’t give up your dream.

302
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,140
Join K&K

303
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,700
and work with us

304
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,380
to get the first team world champion

305
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,940
for China.

306
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,140
Game over.

307
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,180
2 to 1. Qitao wins.

308
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,940
Congratulations!

309
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,700
Qitao is awesome!

310
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,620
What do you mean?

311
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,020
I’m not weak, all right?

312
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,380
He’s an operator, after all.

313
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,020
No,

314
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,980
I said he was awesome,

315
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,700
but I didn’t mean you weren’t.

316
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,580
Do it if you can.

317
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,820
I’ve got messages to reply.

318
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,020
Let me do it.

319
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,140
He?

320
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,900
Give it to me.

321
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,900
Come on.

322
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,500
Brilliant.

323
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,140
I know you’re eager to win.

324
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,940
Let’s try another round.

325
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,100
I’m not convinced.

326
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,220
The voting result of All-star Game
has come out.

327
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,340
Han Shangyan is the first.

328
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,220
Wu Bai is the second.

329
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
What about me?

330
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,700
You...

331
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,500
You’re the fourth.

332
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,340
Solo is the third.

333
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,220
Lin Yin is the fifth.

334
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,860
The sixth is...

335
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,020
Nothing’s special.

336
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,580
It will simply be

337
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,700
a messy battle

338
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,020
between Wu Bai, Shen Zhe and Lin Yin.

339
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,220
Let’s have another round.

340
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,500
(Robot Fighting All-star Game)
Let me tell you the rules.

341
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,220
Only three players will be in the game.

342
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,940
Among top three players voted,

343
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,620
those in service
must accept the challenge.

344
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,380
Retired players can choose

345
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,460
if they take up the challenge.

346
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,860
If there’re fewer than three players,

347
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,100
the following players rise in rank

348
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,980
according to their votes.

349
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,980
To no one’s surprise,

350
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,580
Han Shangyan posted
to reject the challenge.

351
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,500
When Han Shangyan don’t go,

352
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,220
neither will our boss.

353
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,140
Then Lin Yin will be among top three.

354
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,500
You can take part, then.

355
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,900
Seriously?

356
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,620
I’ll work hard!

357
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,620
Do a good job in All-star Game!

358
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,140
(Solo: #ALL STAR2021# I’m in.)

359
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,380
You know what?

360
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,380
Wait.

361
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,660
Boss accepted the challenge.

362
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,860
Are you sure?

363
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,340
He accepted the challenge?

364
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,060
Gosh,

365
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,740
he did accept it!

366
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,620
Really?

367
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,100
We can see him play a game?

368
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,340
I bet he’ll be the champion!

369
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,860
That’s great!

370
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,380
Oh, my God!

371
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
What? What happened?

372
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,380
Solo will be in!

373
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,820
Seriously?

374
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,340
(Wow, unbelievable!)
Gosh!

375
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,540
Solo, the Creator,

376
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,180
will PK DT, the defending champion.

377
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,980
There’s fun to see.

378
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,100
Captain?

379
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,260
(Solo: #ALL STAR2021# I’m in.)

380
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,820
Wu Bai, Solo, Shen Zhe.

381
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,940
The game will be exciting.

382
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Friends,

383
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,620
team, daughter,

384
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,700
sense of responsibility and honor.

385
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
Solo,

386
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,420
you should live for yourself once.

387
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,700
After all,

388
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,740
we’re no longer young.

389
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,500
Ai Qing,

390
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,580
I don’t know if I still have a chance

391
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,340
to live for myself.

392
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,980
Come in.

393
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,580
Boss,

394
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,260
don’t tell me

395
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,580
you’re going to make a comeback?

396
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,860
No.

397
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,460
I promised Han Shangyan

398
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,100
I wouldn’t have my team members

399
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,580
as a captain anymore.

400
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
So,

401
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,740
I don’t represent any team

402
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,580
to be in the game.

403
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,340
Then you accept the challenge

404
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,220
so that you can change
the negative public opinion

405
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,860
on Xiaomi’s retirement?

406
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,740
It’s a good idea.

407
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,900
Fine.

408
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,500
I understand now.

409
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,460
Ai Qing,

410
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,620
shall we go have Hunan cuisines

411
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,940
after the game?

412
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,580
Why not?

413
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,860
I’m leaving, then.

414
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,500
You laugh so widely.

415
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,340
You haven’t won yet.

416
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,420
Be careful.

417
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,140
That’s Solo, the Creator.

418
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,980
Don’t be walloped

419
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,020
and come back crying.

420
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,100
I’m warning you.

421
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,380
Don’t jinx it.

422
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,300
It’s been my dream for years

423
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,180
to play against Solo.

424
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,380
At last, the day is to come.

425
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,700
Yes!

426
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,100
I don’t think you can defeat him.

427
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,500
Anyway, Solo played with Boss

428
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,580
in old years.

429
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,660
A man like you who counts on his face

430
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,100
will not make it.

431
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,460
Are you nuts?

432
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,140
Are you nuts?

433
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,820
Why do you wear two shorts?

434
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,140
None of your business.

435
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,700
Why do you even wear swimming trunks?

436
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,660
Can’t I wear swimming trunks in a bath?

437
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,700
You’re so weird.

438
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,260
Wear swimming trunks?

439
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,900
You don’t count on your face, huh?

440
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,100
What else do you count on?

441
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,180
I hit my ankle.

442
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,380
Don’t blackmail me,

443
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,060
OK?

444
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,180
I did hit my ankle, Shen Zhe.

445
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,260
Stand up.

446
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,300
You’re a man.

447
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,620
When you lie in the bathhouse
with shorts off,

448
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,660
you look odd.

449
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,580
I did hit my ankle.

450
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,060
Be quick.

451
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,580
Stop making fun.

452
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,740
Get me up. Get me up.

453
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,140
Can I defeat Solo?

454
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,220
You can. You can.

455
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,420
You!

456
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,580
Shen Zhe!

457
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,620
I did hit my ankle, Shen Zhe!

458
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,660
Shen Zhe!

459
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,380
Zhou Yi!

460
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,580
Zhou Yi!

461
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,540
Anybody help?

462
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,540
Why didn’t you go out for a date?

463
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,540
My boyfriend is working hard

464
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,540
on how to defeat your boyfriend
and Solo.

465
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,020
But why did Solo

466
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,300
suddenly go to All-star Game?

467
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,300
After Xiaomi retired,

468
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,420
the public opinion was unfriendly.

469
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,620
I guess he wants
to cheer the members up.

470
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,660
Who do you think will win?

471
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,620
Shen Zhe won’t win, anyway.

472
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,020
Why can’t he win?

473
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,300
He’s been working so hard.

474
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,420
There’s a very slight chance that

475
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,420
he might win.

476
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,460
Who do you think will win,

477
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,660
Wu Bai or Solo?

478
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,620
It’s hard to tell

479
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,580
in a three-player game.

480
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,820
There’re too many factors.

481
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,780
I mean I want to know

482
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,380
who do you want to win?

483
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,500
Personally, I want Wu Bai to win.

484
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,220
But in business,

485
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,740
SP needs a victory for the moment.

486
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
All right.

487
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,980
I won’t get a satisfactory answer.

488
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,100
I’ll leave you alone.

489
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,140
I’ll go support my boyfriend.

490
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,140
Congratulations

491
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,220
on competing with Solo.

492
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,100
Don’t stress yourself out.

493
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,340
Come on! Come on! Come on!

494
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,940
I’ll always be with you.

495
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,780
Love you.

496
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,540
Good night.

497
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,380
Good night. Good night.

498
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,100
My old friend,

499
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,100
come out and help me.

Solo is a prudent man.

514
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,460
Now that he accepted the challenge,

515
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,940
he’ll be well prepared.

516
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,980
Let’s just take action accordingly.

517
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,020
No one knows more about his battle mode

518
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,420
than I do.

519
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,220
I’ve prepared three ways

520
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,900
to fight against him.

521
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,860
We underestimate him in attitude.

522
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,340
But we must be serious with our tactics.

523
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,180
We should pay attention

524
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,420
to possible promotion of Blade Point.

525
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,380
Too much attention
to Solo’s personal style

526
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,100
may get us led by the nose.

527
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,460
Why are you so cautious this time?

528
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,820
Too much pressure
from your rival in love?

529
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,140
At last we caught up.

530
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:05,900
Captain.

531
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:06,860
Captain,

532
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,740
you run fast.

533
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,900
But I’m faster, huh?

534
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,500
Zhou Yi,

535
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,180
why do you ride a bike?

536
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,340
You’re cheating.

537
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,180
I’m not.

538
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,060
You two, don’t ride a bike next time!

539
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,380
I’m using skates, Captain.

540
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,980
You can’t use them, either!

541
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,580
No.

542
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,860
I haven’t said anything yet.

543
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,620
Whatever you want to say,

544
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,220
no.

545
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,020
Come on.

546
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,060
Here’s a national battle today.

547
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,540
I can’t play without you.

548
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,780
Didn’t you say
you would ask Tao Qitao for help?

549
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,500
Where’s he?

550
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,940
He’s gone out for business.

551
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,700
He’s quite busy.

552
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,420
He leaves quickly after every training.

553
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,420
He does.

554
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,020
I asked him for help a few times,
but didn’t find him.

555
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,100
Wait, you mean...

556
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,380
You want me simply because I’m free?

557
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,260
No, no, no.

558
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,780
I mean you look more reliable.

559
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,420
Come on.

560
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,660
I don’t want to play it.

561
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,100
I have to download the app.

562
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,740
I don’t want it.

563
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,580
I’ve considered it.

564
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,620
You don’t need to bother.

565
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,380
Right?

566
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,380
I told Qitao about it.

567
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,500
You can just use his account.

568
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,580
Everything is ready.

569
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,860
I don’t want it.

570
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,220
Come on. I beg you.

571
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,100
I won’t.

572
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,820
Well,

573
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,660
if we can clear the game,

574
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,300
I’ll clean your room

575
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,620
for one week.

576
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,260
You promise?

577
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:24,740
I promise.

578
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,380
Come on.

579
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,340
Hurry. There’s half an hour to go.

580
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,260
Be quick.

581
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,060
Here I am.

582
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,900
A master is coming.

583
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,060
Log in. Log in.

584
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,860
(Recruitment of Mecha Fighting Team)

585
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,020
What’s this?

586
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,740
Don’t look. It’s his privacy.

587
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,220
What’s wrong?

588
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,860
Not used to his laptop?
Let me adjust it.

589
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,500
No. No.

590
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,220
Let’s start.

591
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,620
All right. Come on.

592
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,540
You know what?

593
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,980
This game is super fun.

594
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,660
Wu Bai,

595
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,500
I’ve got something to tell you.

596
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,940
I told you that

597
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,980
Tao Qitao wasn’t a good guy.

598
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,660
Shen Zhe,

599
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,500
don’t casually suspect our teammate.

600
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,500
I don’t mean to!

601
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,660
In his computer,

602
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,860
I saw him browse the recruitment
of other teams.

603
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,820
He works for K&K

604
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,220
and looks for another...

605
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,100
I’ve reminded you.

606
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,660
Sorry.

607
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,500
I’m late.

608
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,740
It doesn’t matter.

609
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,860
Not everyone is here yet.

610
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,100
-Captain.
-Captain.

611
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,420
All right.

612
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,060
Everyone is here.

613
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,420
Let’s start the meeting.

614
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,540
Today, let’s discuss

615
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,020
about what we should do

616
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,260
if we compete with players

617
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,300
with mono-cone spiral weapon

618
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,860
in a game.

619
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,860
It’s been ten years.

620
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,980
At last I see Blade Point again.

621
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,900
Young men nowadays can’t witness the age

622
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,580
when Blade Point won countless games.

623
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,340
What a pity!

624
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,780
It’s been so many years.

625
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,460
Interior fittings and the deign

626
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,380
of Blade Point

627
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,860
need to be completely upgraded.

628
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,140
All right.

629
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,860
I’ll handle that with Slide.

630
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,700
Have a look at this.

631
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,140
Great!

632
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,380
You’re still skillful.

633
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,940
It’s nearly impossible

634
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,260
to upgrade internal fittings
and finish the running-in

635
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,420
within simply two weeks.

636
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,140
So, I need your help.

637
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,180
This time, I don’t compete
in the name of your boss,

638
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,180
but in my own name.

639
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,900
Because I want to win.

640
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,060
Dude,

641
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,060
you’re serious this time?

642
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,540
All right.

643
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,660
As your friend,

644
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,780
I’ll help you for certain!

645
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,820
I’ll upgrade Blade Point’s chip asap.

646
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,100
Slide will take care of the hardware.

647
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,940
You’ll focus on the training.

648
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
Thanks, bro.

649
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,700
Never say it again.

650
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,380
Boss.

651
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,700
Fu Yiwen,

652
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,780
what brings you here?

653
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,860
Boss,

654
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,060
I also want to help

655
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,260
with the All-star Game.

656
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,740
When I joined this industry,

657
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,180
you had retired.

658
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,460
It’s been ten years

659
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,100
and Blade Point will be used again.

660
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,740
I don’t want to miss the chance

661
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,660
to work hard with you.

662
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,300
Good point!

663
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,820
We were just discussing

664
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,020
how to upgrade Blade Point.

665
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,020
I major in it.

666
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,940
I can help.

667
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,780
Thank you.

668
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,300
Thank you.

669
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,940
Let’s work together

670
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,460
and win the game!

671
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,780
So much for today’s meeting.

672
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,180
Go back and digest it.

673
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,060
-Okay.
-Thank you, Captain.

674
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,380
Tao Qitao,

675
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,540
let’s have a word.

676
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,460
You’ve come to us for a while.

677
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,420
How’s your stay?

678
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,100
K&K has very professional

679
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,300
training equipment and operation plans.

680
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,100
I’ve learnt a lot.

681
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,020
That’s good.

682
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,140
As for Shen Zhe,

683
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,180
his bark is worse than bite.

684
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,140
So, don’t haggle with him

685
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,020
over something.

686
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,460
You mean what he just told you?

687
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,740
In fact, he’s right.

688
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,420
I was browsing

689
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,900
recruitments of other teams.

690
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,060
Tell me the reason.

691
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,460
I browsed them
for members of my former team.

692
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,140
My team was dissolved.

693
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,580
No one has a new job,

694
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,100
but me.

695
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,660
They stay at home without work.

696
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,940
I saw the recruitment of others teams

697
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,020
and I tried to help them.

698
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,740
I prepared some files for them,

699
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,820
but I was still worried.

700
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,860
After all,

701
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,620
I used to lead them for everything.

702
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,420
-So...
-So,

703
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,220
you want to go with them?

704
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,660
We didn’t have too many members.

705
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,940
Our mechanical engineers

706
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,380
and software engineers

707
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,220
help each other.

708
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,220
If I go with them,

709
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,740
I think I can help.

710
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,380
It makes sense.

711
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,460
You can leave a couple of days earlier

712
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,780
so that you can be more prepared.

713
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,460
But,

714
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,580
the game against Solo...

715
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,740
Don’t worry.

716
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,620
Shen Zhe and I will do a good job.

717
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,900
All right.

718
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,540
I’ll leave you alone.

719
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,380
Hello?

720
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,740
Wu Bai,

721
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,180
this is Nan Wei.

722
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,820
I regret to tell you

723
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,500
the common decision of directors.

724
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,580
As estimated,

725
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,020
K&K isn’t strong enough

726
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,660
to run two teams at the same time.

727
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,740
Even if Tao Qitao can help us

728
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,060
to make the game safe in advance,

729
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,420
we still can’t run two teams?

730
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,340
After careful discussion,

731
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,380
we all believe that

732
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,300
it’s more meaningful

733
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,820
to focus all manpower
and material resources

734
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,620
on the existing team.

735
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,860
I understand

736
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,420
and support your decision.

737
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,100
As for Taotao Team,

738
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,060
I’ll think of another way

739
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,300
after the game.

740
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,060
All right.

741
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,380
-97.
-Zhou Yi.

742
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,540
-After you.
-After you.

743
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,340
-Good job.
-Good job.

744
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,740
Shen Zhe!

745
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,860
Blade Point’s procedure.

746
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,700
We specifically studied it.

747
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,780
We’ve put down

748
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,340
all upgrading possibilities

749
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,340
on its design, armor and program.

750
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,060
Have a look

751
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,580
and get prepared in advance.

752
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,060
Have you shown them to Wu Bai?

753
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,180
Not yet.

754
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,580
We showed you first.

755
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,740
I don’t think Captain needs them.

756
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,540
These data are very reliable.

757
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,780
I showed Qitao, too.

758
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,420
He said they would certainly help you.

759
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,820
I don’t need them.

760
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,780
Solo is my idol.

761
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,900
I can even recite
the design of Blade Point.

762
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,420
I need no one to help me

763
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,340
with the game.

764
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,900
Don’t worry.

765
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,540
We won’t steal your thunder.

766
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,100
We’ll only be your secret supporter.

767
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,620
Yes.

768
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,660
We’ll be the men behind you.

769
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,980
As usual.

770
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,060
Get out!

771
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,180
You don’t want them.

772
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,180
All right, then.

773
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,180
Wait.

774
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,100
Well,

775
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,860
my laptop is broken.

776
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,860
I’ll keep yours to look up information.

777
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,340
Leave me this one as well.

778
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,020
Don’t deny it.

779
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,340
Here.

780
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,980
Shen Zhe loves denying his heart.

781
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,900
It took us great trouble

782
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,900
to sort out the data for him.

783
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,980
He didn’t want them at first,

784
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,500
but at last he kept them.

785
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,580
I think

786
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,100
he just wants

787
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,380
to defeat his idol

788
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,980
with his own strength.

789
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,500
Genius players like him

790
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,300
can be more or less proud.

791
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,820
I can understand him.

792
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,380
What?

793
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,340
You’re a genius, too?

794
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,340
I’m a fan.

795
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,780
Who’s your new idol?

796
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,260
The entire Solo Team is my idol.

797
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,300
Shall we bet?

798
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,700
On the winner of tomorrow’s game.

799
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,900
K&K will win, I’m sure.

800
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,100
We have two players to go.

801
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,100
Which one do you support?

802
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,500
Captain, I guess.

803
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,100
I think he’ll win.

804
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,580
Don’t underestimate Solo, all right?

805
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,340
He’s Solo, the creator!

806
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,500
In old years,

807
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,780
he opened up the industry with Boss.

808
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,180
He’s the most experienced master.

809
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,180
I think

810
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,620
I’ll bet on Solo.

811
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,180
I think Captain will win, anyway.

812
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,820
97, Zhou Yi!

813
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,100
-Grandpa?
-Grandpa,

814
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,500
what brings you here?

815
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,980
I’ve brought you some snacks.

816
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:51,900
-Thank you, Grandpa.
-Thank you, Grandpa.

817
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,100
Wait, wait.

818
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,900
This is for Bai.

819
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,140
Oh,

820
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,500
where’s he?

821
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,780
Shen Zhe isn’t here, either.

822
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,340
They’ll have a game tomorrow.

823
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,620
They’re working on it in their rooms.

824
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,340
This one tastes great. This one.

825
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,060
Bai.

826
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,660
Bai!

827
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,340
Grandpa,

828
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,620
what brings you here?

829
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,540
You didn’t go home lately.

830
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,900
You... you...

831
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,660
Look at you.

832
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,220
You look thinner. You must be starving.

833
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,860
Come on and have some snacks.

834
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,620
Grandpa,

835
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,780
I’ll have some later.

836
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,300
I’ve been preparing for the game

837
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,740
and I didn’t go home.

838
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,300
Well...

839
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,580
Look.

840
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,340
Isn’t that Han Shangyan?

841
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,780
That’s Ai Qing, right?

842
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,380
Is that her ex-boyfriend,

843
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,300
Solo?

844
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,420
How did you know?

845
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,340
I... I certainly got to know.

846
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,340
Oh,

847
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,020
in tomorrow’s game,

848
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,340
will you play against Solo?

849
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,260
No way.

850
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,620
Bai, you... Wait, wait.

851
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,140
Don’t eat it. Don’t.

852
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,300
The game matters most!

853
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,340
You know what?

854
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,780
You must

855
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,060
win this game!

856
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,580
It doesn’t matter

857
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,100
when someone eats less

858
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,660
or sleeps less.

859
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,060
The practice matters most.

860
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,500
Stop drinking water, too.

861
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,420
Hurry with your practice. Be quick.

862
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,540
The snacks taste good.

863
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,580
97!

864
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,140
Grandpa.

865
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,540
Stop eating. Stop.

866
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,740
I’ve got something

867
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,900
to ask you.

868
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,300
How awesome do you think

869
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,580
Solo is?

870
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,540
Does Bai have a chance to win?

871
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,700
You know what?

872
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,700
Solo was...

873
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,820
Wait, wait.

874
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,140
Put it down.

875
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,900
Don’t eat it now.

876
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,420
You two,

877
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,860
do you have anything to do tonight?

878
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,700
-No.
-No.

879
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,780
Shall I take you
to enjoy something delicious?

880
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,140
-Really?
-Really?

881
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,980
-Hooray, Grandpa!
-Hooray, Grandpa!
