19
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,440
Wu Bai, you’ve ironed it twice.

20
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,290
Are you still going to iron it?

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,330
Well, how many times will he iron it?

22
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,840
I’ve had it enough.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,890
The guy is getting married tomorrow.

24
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,160
You don’t understand.

25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
Shen Zhe.

26
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,330
Would you get my tie for me?

27
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,370
I have to iron it.

28
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,520
You’ll do it again?

29
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,120
It’s the fifth time, dude.

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,890
Just get it for me.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,410
And get my suit pants, too.

32
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,650
Fine.

33
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,260
Are you nervous?

34
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,490
Actually, I’m nervous.

35
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,890
It seems that

36
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,570
we were still kids yesterday,

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,410
then you’re getting married in a flash.

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,170
I think time flies, too.

39
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,160
Although

40
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,800
we’ve got our marriage license,

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,050
I feel that

42
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,060
these days are like a dream.

43
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,140
I feel like a dream.

44
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,160
You’re getting married tomorrow.

45
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,160
Don’t be nervous.

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,000
If Wu Bai dares to bully you,

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,860
I’ll kill him in the first chance.

48
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,640
Don’t worry, sister.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,530
Bai won’t bully me.

50
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,260
Time can go slowly

51
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,450
and fast.

52
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,000
Ten years passed.

53
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,500
Tomorrow,

54
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,530
we’re getting married.

55

(Wedding LOVE)

56
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,500
Morning, Grandpa.

57
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,290
Morning.

58
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,000
Why are you in sports suits?

59
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,660
I’m going for a morning run.

60
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,250
You have to pick up the bride.

61
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,660
Do you have time for a run?

62
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,170
I’ll be back soon.

63
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,960
Why do you take wedding candies?

64
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,660
In case I run into people,

65
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,290
I’ll share with them.

66
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,940
What a boy, running with candies.

67
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,660
Have a baby soon.

68
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,220
Is there anyone getting married
in your family?

69
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,010
Yes. It’s me.

70
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,660
Congrats! Congratulations!

71
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,780
Thanks.

72
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,620
Have a candy.

73
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,820
OK, thank you.

74
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,720
Who’s the lucky bride?

75
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,660
A girl I’ve loved for ten years.

76
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,900
You’re really lucky.

77
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,220
Congrats! Congrats! Congrats!

78
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,000
You’re honey-lipped.

79
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,340
Come on. Do have more candies.

80
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,650
It’s very kind of you.

81
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,530
I’m going for the morning run.

82
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,780
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

83
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,570
You get to work so early!

84
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,570
Today is my wedding day.

85
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,730
Have some lucky candies.

86
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,340
-Thanks. Congrats.
-Congrats!

87
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,130
Thanks.

88
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:51,960
-Best wishes.
-Congrats!

89
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,170
I’m getting married. Have some candies.

90
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,850
Congrats!

91
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,850
Thanks.

92
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,540
Morning jog, huh?

93
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,100
Yeah.

94
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,970
Today is my wedding day.

95
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,940
-Have some candies, everyone.
-It’s a surprise.

96
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,730
Congrats!

97
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,570
Thanks! Congrats!

98
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,250
Come to visit us often.

99
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,340
Sure, sure. Thanks, thanks.

100
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,380
Bye.

101
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,170
Ai Qing,
you look beautiful in the dress.

102
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,410
Thanks.

103
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,220
How’re you doing?

104
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,010
Here, drink some water.

105
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,740
Hold on.

106
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,170
You’ve applied lipstick. Use the straw.

107
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,010
What should I do, Ai Jing?

108
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,900
I’m so nervous.

109
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,690
I’m nervous, too.

110
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,250
You don’t have to be nervous.

111
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,450
You can count on me.

112
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,100
Don’t you think so?

113
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,940
Yeah. We got your back.
Don’t be nervous.

114
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,570
I’m still nervous.

115
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,940
This is the first time I saw

116
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,130
a male bestie group.

117
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,300
It’s funny.

118
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,620
They’re all my besties.

119
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,580
I’m back, Grandpa.

120
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,130
Finally, you’re back.

121
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,570
Your cousin has already gone to
his bride’s home to greet her.

122
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,170
Hurry up.

123
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,570
We have over an hour.

124
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,450
I’m anxious still.

125
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,130
Back in the day,

126
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,060
when I married your grandma,

127
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,020
I didn’t sleep before the wedding day.

128
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,500
I got up early and went to her family
to greet her.

129
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,630
All right. Go to change your clothes.

130
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,100
I need to take a shower first.

131
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,950
Why take a shower?

132
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,220
I just had a jog.

133
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,140
I reek of smell of sweat.

134
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,620
You’re right. Go.

135
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,070
Bai, Bai.

136
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,970
Set your alarm clock,

137
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,450
in case you forget time.

138
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,820
Bai, Bai.

139
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,060
After the shower, come down quickly
to have breakfast.

140
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,220
Bai.

141
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,540
Wake the boys

142
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,070
and ask them to come down.

143
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,060
Is there anything else, Grandpa?

144
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,340
No, nothing.

145
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,500
Then,

146
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,420
I’m going up.

147
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,490
(Wedding)

148
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,060
It’s time for breakfast.

149
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,570
Got it. You have it first.

150
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,460
Grandpa.

151
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,380
You’re ready.

152
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,250
Let me see.

153
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,110
Today, you’re the most handsome man.

154
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,230
Where are they?

155
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,230
They want to sleep for more time.

156
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,790
They asked us to eat first.

157
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,430
Sit down.

158
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,900
Today is your wedding day.

159
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,980
You should have some more.

160
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,860
They haven’t got up yet.

161
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,110
Will they be late?

162
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,870
Don’t worry, Grandpa.

163
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,230
It’s early. We still have time.

164
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,570
Today’s young people

165
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,260
are really patient.

166
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,500
No, no. Bai.

167
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,230
Wake them up right away.

168
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,190
I, I’m worried.

169
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,990
OK.

170
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,190
-Morning, Grandpa.
-Grandpa, morning.

171
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,350
Morning.

172
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,430
Morning.

173
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,460
What a hearty breakfast.

174
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,110
Thank you, Grandpa.

175
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,110
No, no, no.

176
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,940
It’s too late. It’s too late.

177
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,980
Go, go, go. Go to pick up the bride.

178
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,940
Let us grab a bite first.

179
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,020
-No, no, no. Go, go. No.
-Just a bite.

180
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,110
The big things matter.

181
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,870
Just, grab a bite.

182
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,550
Let us have breakfast before we set out.

183
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,310
You’re late. Blame yourselves.

184
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,050
(Wedding)

185
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,550
Are you ready, bro?

186
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,910
Please, groom.

187
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,460
Did you put on blusher?

188
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,990
Yes.

189
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,990
It’s almost time.

190
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,020
I’m going to see if they arrive.

191
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,990
Yin, come with me.

192
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,230
Watch the live broadcast later.

193
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,990
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

194
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,550
We’re going to do our things.
Don’t be nervous.

195
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,020
Excuse me, too.

196
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,430
Ai Jing.

197
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,990
I’m still nervous.

198
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,910
Relax. Relax.

199
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,580
They arrived.

200
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,190
The wedding convoy arrived.

201
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,310
They arrived.

202
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,680
They’re downstairs.

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,060
Really?

204
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,880
Let me see.

205
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,820
Why are you so anxious?

206
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,140
Didn’t you see him before?

207
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,920
I’ve never seen him in a suit.

208
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,320
He’s handsome.

209
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,760
Of course.

210
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,270
Shen Zhe looks decent, too.

211
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,820
I just saw the members of SP.

212
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,700
Today, we definitely
have a war to fight, bros.

213
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,670
Come on.

214
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,320
97.

215
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,790
Have you got the red envelopes ready?

216
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,510
Sure.

217
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,510
Good.

218
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,830
But we have to discuss it.

219
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,500
Discuss what?

220
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,940
I bet you’ve never picked up
a bride from her family, have you?

221
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,320
Have you?

222
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,460
I…

223
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,460
Zhou Yi?

224
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,060
What about Xiaomi?

225
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,120
I’ve never done that, too.

226
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,260
I

227
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,880
did some research.

228
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,030
How long should we wait?

229
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,470
Ten minutes.

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,870
Captain.

231
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,000
You mustn’t be nervous.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,580
We’ll take care of everything.

233
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,380
You can safely

234
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,110
escort your bride to the wedding.

235
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,990
After all, we’re the best

236
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,920
best men.

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
All right.

238
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,620
Let’s go.

239
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,460
-Go. Go.
-Go.

240
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,670
-Go.
-Go.

241
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,990
They’re coming.

242
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,350
Hurry up. Go, go, go.

243
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,120
Didn’t you say we had to
wait for ten minutes?

244
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,630
Yeah.

245
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,790
Yeah.

246
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,350
Yeah.

247
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,150
Eight minutes left.

248
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,920
Wait for a while.

249
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,240
Wait for a while.

250
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,750
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

251
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,000
Hold on.

252
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,800
Don’t move.

253
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,500
Listen up. Today,

254
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,700
I’m on behalf of the bride’s family.
I’ll be just and stern.

255
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,630
Rules.

256
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,270
Red envelopes.

257
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:55,950
Red envelopes.

258
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,590
Hurry. Hurry.

259
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,590
Red envelopes?

260
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,060
Ready.

261
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,830
Here.

262
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,700
Does it work?

263
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,270
-Close the door.
-Close the door.

264
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,060
Only one. Only one.

265
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,000
Fine. Fine.

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,270
Two.

267
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,460
Here’s one more, OK?

268
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,360
Are those enough?

269
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,750
-Close the door.
-Just close it.

270
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,500
Fine.

271
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,880
Give them more.

272
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,940
The groom spoke.

273
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,910
Fine.

274
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,320
Five of you. Each gets one.

275
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,430
Here are three more.

276
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,030
I can’t give you more.

277
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,880
What do you say?

278
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,950
Well, let me see

279
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,390
how many have you actually got?

280
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,070
These’re all I have.
I have to hand them out later.

281
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,240
Give me.

282
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,120
Well, you can’t do that.

283
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,880
We’ll leave her to you.

284
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,070
Sure.

285
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,950
Ai Jing.

286
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,270
You must take my side today.

287
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,200
I’m her family.

288
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
Why should I take your side?

289
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,880
Today, she is one of us.

290
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,270
Get off your hands, bro.

291
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,510
Don’t take advantage of my girlfriend.

292
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,390
I’m warning you.

293
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,120
Enough. Don’t cotton up to me.

294

If you want to come in,

295

you must pass three tests.

296
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,680
Three tests?

297
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,200
No problem.

298
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,560
First test,

Mission accomplished in 15 seconds.

347
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,760
You passed.

348
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,830
Good.

349
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,030
Now it’s the last test.

350
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,590
Three questions.

351
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,800
After you answer the questions,

352
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,320
you can greet the bride.

353
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,930
I’m going inside to ask my sister.

354
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,630
If you give wrong answers,

355
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,690
you can’t pick up the bride.

356
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,250
Yes.

357
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,130
-Come on.
-Come on.

358
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,640
First question,

359
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,240
who made the first declaration of love

360
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,440
and when did it happen?

361
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,690
I confessed to her first

362
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,570
in Chicago.

363
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,710
Am I right?

364
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,770
Yes.

365
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,320
Good.

366
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,960
OK.

367
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,600
Second question,

368
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,160
where did you have your

369
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,510
first fight and why?

370
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,240
It was

371
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,160
under Solo’s old house.

372
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,490
Because I was afraid

373
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,690
she didn’t love me enough.

374
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,850
Right?

375
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,090
Right.

376
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,760
Good.

377
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,160
The last question.

378
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,810
It won’t be easy.

379
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,730
From now on,

380
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,690
will you always stand behind her

381
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,210
and solidly back her up

382
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,640
as you did when you first met her?

383
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,970
I’ll always stand behind her

384
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,930
and solidly back her up.

385
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Then I’ll give my best friend

386
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,610
to you.

(Han Shangyan & Tong Nian
Wu Bai & Ai Qing)

413
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,820
Hello.

414
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,880
Hello.

415
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,610
-Here.
-Thanks.

416
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,280
OK.

417
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,860
Not bad.

418
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,940
It looks pretty nice.

419
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,210
Do we have to sigh this?

420
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:28,820
I don’t think so.

421
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,730
The whole place is beaming.

422
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,220
Shanghai.

423
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,330
Singapore.

424
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,760
Guangzhou.

425
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,970
Chicago.

426
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,280
What does that mean?

427
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,640
Don’t you know?

428
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,010
The cities are where he played.

429
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,890
It’s the love track of our captain.

430
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,240
What’s a love track?

431
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,740
Wu Bai marked all the cities

432
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,090
where he played.

433
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,160
The cities are also

434
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,930
where he and Ai Qing left memories.

435
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,890
It’s the track of him pursuing a wife.

436
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,610
He’s good.

437
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,120
He played games and pursued a wife
at the same time.

438
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,700
Sure.

439
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,290
After all, he has captured

440
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,010
the greatest goddess of SP.

441
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,860
Do you bully us because
you outnumber us?

442
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,040
Anyway, there’s nothing you can do.

443
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,820
Gentlemen, are you the groom’s friends

444
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,970
or the bride’s friends?

445
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,400
The bride’s. The bride’s.

446
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,940
Why do you have to take sides?

447
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,530
One for each.

448
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,500
You’re so generous.

449
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,130
Take the lesson.

450
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,650
Well, I…

451
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,500
Grandpa.

452
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,120
Grandpa.

453
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,130
-Grandpa.
-Grandpa.

454
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,010
Here.

455
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,640
Today is your wedding day.

456
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,490
Here.

457
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,770
Red envelopes.

458
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,770
This is yours.

459
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,120
Thanks, Grandpa.

460
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,290
This is yours.

461
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,650
Thanks, Grandpa.

462
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,580
This is yours.

463
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,090
Thanks, Grandpa.

464
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,090
This is yours.

465
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,460
Thanks, Grandpa.

466
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,100
Grandpa.

467
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,120
Why is her red envelop

468
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,980
much thicker than mine?

469
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,880
It’s one of our family traditions.

470
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,940
Prefer daughters to sons.

471
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,700
Don’t you know that?

472
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,460
What’s wrong?

473
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,940
Your two grandsons get married
on the same day.

474
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,170
Aren’t you happy?

475
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,250
You’re married.

476
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,770
Be serious.

477
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,010
Han Shangyan.

478
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,650
Grandpa has something to say.

479
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,100
I’ve always

480
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,940
been strict with you.

481
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,580
I feel regretted.

482
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,050
Actually, in my mind,

483
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,740
you’re one of my proudest grandsons.

484
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,580
Come here.

485
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,620
Hold on.

486
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,370
I haven’t said yet.

487
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,460
Bai.

488
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,940
You’re also one of

489
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,220
my proudest grandsons.

490
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,860
I’m proud of you.

491
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,740
Grandpa, what about us?

492
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,580
Yeah, Grandpa, what about us?

493
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,170
We want to hug you, too.

494
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,830
OK. OK.

495
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,620
OK. OK.

496
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,500
Boss, Captain.

497
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,230
The wedding is about to begin.

498
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,420
Get ready.

499
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,530
Grandpa, let me help you.

500
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,100

I wanted to ask you long ago.

Today, on this special occasion,

572
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,950
I want to ask you,

573
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:48,590
who do you think will be
next year’s champion?

Ai Qing, you answer first.

575
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,120
SP, of course.

576
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,140
-Fascinating.
-Excellent.

577
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,720
Well said. Well said.

578
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,750

579
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,790
Yeah.

580
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,430
What do you think, Wu Bai?

581
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,900
Don’t be a chicken.

582
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,960
Captain, don’t be a chicken.

583
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,510
Don’t be a chicken. Captain. K&K.

584
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,240
I listen to my wife today.

585
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,840
Captain, how can you say that?

586
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,950
Great!

587
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,950
(Wedding)

588
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,240
He hasn’t come anyway.

589
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
I’ll use the time to rewrite my paper.

590
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,710
(You Xiaoyu)
Last time I treated you to milk and bread.

591
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,190
This time I’ll treat you
to wedding candies.

592
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,660
Is Tong Nian in the mood

593
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,910
to write a post at her wedding night?

598
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,520

-Come on, Captain.
-Come on.

602
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,840
Every minute of the wedding night
is precious, Captain.

603
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,520
Go. Hurry.

604
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,910
Hurry. Hurry.

605
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,880

Bai.

609
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,560
Why are you here?

610
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,360
Where’s your cousin?

611
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,360
I don’t know.

612
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880

613
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,000
Well…

614
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,520
Captain, where are you going?

615
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,360
-Tong Nian.
-Tong Nian.

616
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,520
Why are you here?

617
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,120
We’re screwed.
I mixed up the room cards.

618
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,120
I, I… We come to wish you
a happy wedding.

619
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,910
Best wishes for you.

620
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,480
Have a lovely baby soon.

621
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,120
Let’s go. Go.

622
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,840
Hold on.

623
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,430
Where’s my husband?

624
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,480
-We’ll find him.
-We’ll find him for you.

625
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,130
-Find him.
-Find him.

626
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,070

00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,680
Bai.

629
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,520
Captain Wu Bai.

630
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,720
You’ve taken the most famous goddess

631
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,080
in the circle from

632
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,430
our old friends.

633
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,840
Now you’re in the tiger’s den.

634
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,200
Why’re you still here?

635
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,190
Han Shangyan has left.

636
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,840
Why don’t you leave?

637
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,480
It’s an opportunity.

638
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,010
Shall we tease the newlyweds, Xiaomi?

639
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,120
Sure. Sure.

640
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,270
Come on.

641
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,530
Are you serious?

642
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,430
No, we’re joking.

643
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,000
We’re giving you to him.

644
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,430
Wu Bai.

645
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,960
We’re giving our best friend to you.

646
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,480
Don’t bully our goddess.

647
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,150
What do you say?

648
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,280
We’re her family.

649
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,040
If he dares to bully you,

650
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,190
we’ll back you up.

651
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,490
We shall go.

652
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,370
-Let’s go.
-Go.

653
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,320

00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,030
Bye-bye.

656
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,550
Bye-bye.

657
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,450
(Wedding)

658
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,010
Why do you lock the door?

659
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,670
Tonight,

660
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,370
I don’t want anyone to disturb us.

661
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,090
It’s been ten years.

662
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,570
Do you know how happy I am?

663
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,090
Dear.

664
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,290
Darling.

665
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,360
Dear.

666
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,050
Darling.

667
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:37,810
Dear.

668
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,010
Darling.

669
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,680
You drank so much just now.

670
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,600
I bet you didn’t eat anything.

671
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,570
Why don’t you grab a bite first?

672
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,080
Come on.

673
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,570
What do you want?

674
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,200
Are you still
in the mood for food tonight?

675
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,600
Well,

676
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,290
what do you want to do?

677
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,910
What about

678
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,200
going in there to watch a movie?

679
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,920
What movie?

680
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,190
Guess.

681
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:15,400
(Wedding)

682
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,200
Why are you so anxious to see me?

683
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,050
You should fulfill our bet.

684
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,250
What bet?

685
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,290
Don’t play dumb.

686
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,010
Ten blind dates.

687
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,770
Sure.

688
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,600
Well, wait

689
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,490

We’re waiting for you.

694
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,770
Not today. I have something to do.

I gotta go.

696
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,730
What do you have to do?

697
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,920
Come back.

698
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,090
Look over there.

699
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,880
My sister. What do you think?

700
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,570
Well, are you serious?

701
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,770
I took a lot of trouble
to make the arrangement.

702
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,440
No, no.

703

I’m not ready yet.

704
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,400
You don’t have to be ready.

705
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,290

She’s already here.

707
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,360
Yeah.

708
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,400
-No, no.
-Take it as a warm-up.

709
00:35:59,400 --> 00:35:59,920
Come on.

710
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:00,930
I feel embarrassed.

711
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,970
-It’s OK. Just have a talk.
-Nothing embarrassing.

712
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,880
Come on. It doesn’t matter.

713
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,920
Come.

714
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,600
Knock it off.

715
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,360

716
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,820

00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,440
Solo.

718
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,920
You know him.

719
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,050
Take your time.

720
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,260
Hello.

721
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,970
Hello.

722
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,840
It’s hopeful.

723
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,360
I’ll leave it to you.

724
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,500
I have an errand to run.

725

Rest assured.

Bros,

729
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,690
next year’s champion
will still be K&K.

730
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,360
Of course.

731
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,100
Sure. Come on.

Wow, what’re you doing?

734

We let you win once.

735
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,570
You won’t get a second chance.

736
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,250
Yeah, next year’s champion

737
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,570
will surely be SP.

738
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,490
Don’t even think about it.

739
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,360
Stop it, Slide, you’ll make him choked.

740

It doesn’t matter.

741
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,160
I must teach him a lesson.

742
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,130
It’s a harmless pleasure
for young people.

743
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,600
Yeah. They don’t have girlfriends.

744
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,730
It’s a good way to let off steam.
