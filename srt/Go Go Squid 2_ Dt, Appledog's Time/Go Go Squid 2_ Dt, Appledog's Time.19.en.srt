19
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,340
I have one last surprise for you.

20
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,980
This is the first time

21
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,260
I’m lying in bed watching the stars.

22
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,500
Bai.

23
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,420
Do you know

24
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,460
my first impression of you?

25
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,620
When we first met,

26
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,420
my remote control didn’t work.

27
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,380
You said to me at the time,

28
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,140
“believe me”.

29
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,860
But…

30
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,380
Believe me.

31
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,100
That was the first time
someone said to me,

32
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,100
“believe me”.

33
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,580
I didn’t know until later

34
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,100
that you had done
more than that for me.

35
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,140
Three years ago,

36
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,740
due to the lack of form

37
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,820
and taking care of my family,

38
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,860
I chose to retire.

39
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,180
At that time, I had been down

40
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,020
and lost

41
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,500
until one day,

42
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,020
I saw the painting downstairs.

43
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,700
Follow your dream.
You’ll never be alone.

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,540
I was not sure

45
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,060
if my eyes would be cured.

46
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,700
So I was afraid to see you.

47
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,060
I could only paint the word
I wanted to tell you.

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,060
In the past three years,

49
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,580
the words have been warming me

50
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,500
and leading me back to my dreams.

51
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,300
Thank you, Wu Bai.

52
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,540
To protect you

53
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,340
is the happiest thing for me.

54
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,580
Morning.

55
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,740
Why did you get up first?

56
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,940
Breakfast time.

57
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,700
I,

58
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,740
I have to go wash first.

59
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,300
So much food.

60
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,380
You are skinny.

61
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,620
Have some more.

62
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,900
There’re boiled meat dumplings.

63
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,660
Thank you.

64
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,460
Are you still thinking about Xiaomi?

65
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,020
I may help.

66
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,980
Do you have any good suggestions?

67
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,980
The hardware could be upgraded
at the same time.

68
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,300
Do you mean to upgrade Cobra?

69
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,540
There are several famous mechas abroad,

70
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,140
of which the designs
are similar to Xiaomi’s Cobra.

71
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,740
Besides,

72
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,500
you could also find Xiaomi
an assistant operator to cover him.

73
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,820
Captain Wu, you’re really great.

74
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,700
When I get back to the club,

75
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,580
I’ll discuss it with everyone.

76
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,340
Let’s not talk about work again.

77
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,460
I want to take you to a restaurant.

78
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,060
Which one?

79
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,580
A hotpot restaurant.

80
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,980
You really like Cantonese cuisine.

81
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,620
Is there anything special

82
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,140
in the restaurant?

83
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,980
The beef balls they serve

84
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,260
taste like those I ate in an
old restaurant in Guangdong

85
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,580
when I was a child.

86
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,420
It happens to be near our hotel.

87
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,580
I’ll take you there tonight.

88
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,300
Nice.

89
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,620
Speaking of that,

90
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,820
did you often return to Guangzhou?

91
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,340
Every other year,

92
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,260
I returned and stayed for three months.

93
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,620
Then,

94
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,820
did you have to
change schools all the time?

95
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,820
Almost.

96
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,380
If you kept changing schools,

97
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,900
you must be excluded all the time,
weren’t you?

98
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,140
Maybe.

99
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,580
I couldn’t recall it.

100
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,460
I remember when I was in high school,

101
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,580
Han Shangyan was in trouble
with the family.

102
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,980
They didn’t contact at all.

103
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,700
My grandpa is very like Han Shangyan.

104
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,300
Though he missed him very much,

105
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,140
he wouldn’t stop scolding him.

106
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,580
He asked me to come back
during the summer vacation

107
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,740
to see how Han Shangyan
was doing at home.

108
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,020
How old were you then?

109
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,740
I was a high school freshman.

110
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,580
Yet your grandpa

111
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,340
asked you to check on him.

112
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,980
It sounds like you’re the older one.

113
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,860
In some ways,

114
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,380
I was really more mature
than Han Shangyan.

115
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,140
You should learn to be modest.

116
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,820
I helped him to choose a major

117
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,260
and go through all the
admission procedures of college.

118
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,500
At that time,

119
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,940
he seemed dispirited.

120
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,140
I didn’t want him to go on like that.

121
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,580
But you were just in Grade One.

122
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,340
What was it like to be a genius?

123
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,460
Well,

124
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,180
it felt not bad, actually.

125
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,380
Nothing special.

126
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,500
What I feared most were good students
when I was a child.

127
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,260
Surely you don’t understand

128
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,340
the feelings of being compared
to other children.

129
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,900
But you’re Ai Qing.

130
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,580
In my eyes, you are the unique Appledog.

131
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,020
No one can compare with you.

132
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,820
Yeah. I got it.

133
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,220
OK.

134
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,340
I’ll take care of it
as soon as I get back.

137
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,780
if Xiaomi needs a ladder player,

138

I’m at your disposal.

But

140
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,340
you’re busy with you own work.

141
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,260
Don’t worry.

142
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,100
I can take good care of everything.

151
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,380
the sesame filling is very delicious.

152
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,260
Nonsense.

Obviously, rice rolls filled with
crackers and dried meat floss

last time you just sent me
some vague information.

I need the patient’s detailed

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,060
to have an overall examination
before we could make a conclusion.

173
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,340
Yeah, I got it.

174
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,780
But

175
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,220
I may need some more time.

176
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,220
OK.

177
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,460
I suggest you bring the patient
to see me as soon as possible.

178
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,940
Yeah, Dr. Chen. I got it.

179
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,060
Thank you.

180
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,500
Come in.

181
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Why did you close the door?

182
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,740
I’m going out later.

183
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,180
You’re good.

184
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,500
You and your sister have captured

185
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,940
the two new rising stars

186
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,780
in the robot fighting circle

187
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,620
in no time.

188
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,940
How do you know?

189
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,260
I happened to be downstairs
just now.

190
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,580
Did you see us?

191
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,300
I’m serious.

192
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,860
You are different from your sister.

193
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,140
You’re the coach of SP.

194
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,940
Your every move

195
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,500
is watched by many people.

196
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,900
Besides, Wu Bai’s status and

197
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,220
position in the robot fighting circle
are significant.

198
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,980
You should know about it.

199
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,820
I know.

200
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,900
So, please,

201
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,460
keep a low profile in the future.

202
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,900
Just a little.

203
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,940
You come here specially

204
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,820
to tell me this?

205
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,020
Not exactly.

206
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,580
The weather has changed recently.

207
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,220
Many of our members
are not in good condition,

208
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,220
especially Solo.

209
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,740
His voice is hoarse.

210
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,700
Well, I’m going to
the conference room now.

211
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,060
Give him this for me, will you?

212
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
I just found out some medicine myself.

213
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,460
I’m going to give out the medicine
to the team.

214
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,460
Give it to me.

215
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,020
Thank you. Gotta go.

216
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,140
Keep a low profile.

217
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,260
I know.

218
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,820
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

219
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,260
I admit I’m a selfish woman,

220
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,700
but I really want to
make it up to Xiao’ai.

221
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,820
Besides, you’re busy with work now.

222
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,740
You don’t have time

223
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,620
to be around Xiao’ai
and take care of her.

224
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,940
You’re the coach of K&K.

225
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,060
Do you have time to
take care of her?

226
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,780
I’ll resign as the coach

227
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,580
to accompany her.

228
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,220
I’ve already contacted
a doctor abroad.

229
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,820
We can make arrangements next month.

230
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,780
Solo, I hope you’ll understand.

231
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,060
I did all of these for Xiao’ai’s good.

232
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,700
Solo.

233
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,580
Excuse me.

234
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,460
Slide said you didn’t feel well.

235
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,020
I’ve brought you some medicine.

236
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,460
Thank you.

237
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,580
I’ll leave you alone.

238
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,020
About the thing we talked,

239
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,820
I hope you can think it over seriously.

240
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,860
Thank you.

241
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,700
999 Coldrine.

242
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
I didn’t expect that

243
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
you still remember the habits of Solo.

244
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,900
You should have a good rest.

245
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,460
I’ll give out the medicine
to other members.

246
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,580
Let me go with you.

247
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Don’t bother.

248
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,060
I can take care of it.

249
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,260
Have a good rest.

250
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,380
Bye-bye.

251
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,900
Do you want me to suffer
when I’m alive

252
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,780
and to be cursed when I’m dead?

253
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,820
You…

254
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,820
Excuse me, could you…

255
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,260
Every cell of my body is telling me…

256
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,260
Stop, stop, stop.

257
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,660
All right. All right.

258
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,620
Ai Jing.

259
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,220
You’re in poor condition.

260
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,820
All right.

261
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,940
Let’s call it a day.

262
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,460
Adjust your state, will you?

263
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,500
Everyone,

264
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,700
that’s all for today.

265
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,020
You’ve worked hard. Thank you.

266
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,420
-Thank you, director.
-Thank you, director.

267
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,060
What’s up?

268
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,820
I feel

269
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,940
you’re in a bad state today.

270
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,260
I didn’t sleep well last night.

271
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,060
OK.

272
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,460
Go back and have a good rest.

273
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,700
Come on.

274
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,140
(Chinese Robot Fighting League Workshop)

275
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,980
Ai Qing.

276
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,780
Are you all alone?

277
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,060
Would you like to have a drink…

278
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,940
Excuse me, Mr. Xiang.

279
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,620
I’m in a hurry.

280
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,820
Bye-bye.

281
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,500
Ai Qing.

282
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,060
Hold on.

283
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,140
They must be having dinner nearby.

284
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,500
Shall we

285
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,460
walk apart?

286
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,060
Well,

287
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,500
walk in front of me.

288
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,780
I’ll follow you.

289
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,020
Follow the navigation.

290
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,820
OK.

291
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,260
Let me take it for a while.

292
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,260
Short Loin. Rib Fingers. Top Round.

293
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,980
OK.

294
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,900
Pakchoi. Brisket.

295
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,860
And beef balls.

296
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,300
Yes, sir.

297
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,180
That’s it.

298
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,700
Are you still making plans?

299
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,420
I just got a new idea.

300
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,740
I must make a note of it.

301
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,820
The information I sent you before
is too sweeping.

302
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,020
I sorted out another piece
targeted at Xiaomi’s situation.

303
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,220
I’m sending it to you.

304
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,740
Got it.

305
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,060
When did you do it?

306
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,700
I did it in spare time.

307
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,100
It’s carefully organized.

308
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,980
How could you possibly
do it in spare time?

309
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
Thanks, Bai.

310
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,020
As long as it can help you.

311
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,820
Thanks.

312
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,700
It smells good.

313
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,660
All dishes are served.
Please enjoy yourself.

314
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,820
-Thanks. -Thanks.

315
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,860
So much beef.

316
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,780
Shall I just put it in?

317
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,900
Of course.

318
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,540
Is it bad that

319
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,940
the two of us sneak out

320
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,340
to eat alone?

321
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,020
We need to give them

322
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,260
some space occasionally.

323
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,740
By the way,

324
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,700
how’s Shen Zhe recently?

325
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,100
What happened between him
and your sister?

326
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,940
They had another fight.

327
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,580
This time, it seems serious.

328
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,660
Well,

329
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,660
do you want me to check on Shen Zhe?

330
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,500
Never mind.

331
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,980
They fight every day.

332
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,740
They may make it up in two days.

333
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,540
The man at the next table is so hot.

334
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,660
I noticed him as soon as he came in.

335
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,220
He is super-hot.

336
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,740
Isn’t he?

337
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,460
I think so, too.

338
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,860
The woman opposite to him

339
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,660
doesn’t look like his girlfriend.

340
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,100
Is she his sister?

341
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,860
Never mind.

342
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,260
Let’s find an opportunity

343
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,060
to ask for his phone number.

344
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,860
Bai.

345
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,780
I want some beef.

346
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,980
Could you boil some for me?

347
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,100
What’s wrong?

348
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,860
Are you jealous?

349
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
I’m not.

350
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,780
Err, why does he sit next to her?

351
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,420
What is he doing?

352
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,860
It looks like...

353
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,660
Come on.

354
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,420
He is feeding her.

355
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,540
They’re really a couple.

356
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,700
He is really her boyfriend.

357
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,100
Nice.

358
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,500
I’ll boil some in the spicy pot for you.

359
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,620
All right. Don’t dream again.

360
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,220
Sure enough,
hot dudes all have girlfriends.

361
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,460
Let me feed you, too.

362
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,940
Your favorite beef ball.

363
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,620
Sure.

364
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,180
(Shen Zhe)

365
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,540
Sorry.

366
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,940
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

367
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,500
(Shen Zhe)

368
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,620
Pick it up. Ai Jing.

369
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,700
(Shen Zhe)

370
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,740
Hello.

371
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,500
Ai Jing.

372
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,500
I,

373
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,580
I’ve called you more than 100 times.

374
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,140
Why didn’t you answer the phone?

375
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,900
So what?

376
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,220
You feel being wronged?

377
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,740
No. No. No.

378
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,220
I, I, I,

379
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,940
I just want to explain to you.

380
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,780
The other day I didn’t really…

381
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,300
Shen Zhe,

382
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,060
how many times have you explained

383
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,620
about you and Xing Zhouzhou?

384
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,180
I don’t want to fight with you
over the same problem

385
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,300
again and again.

386
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,220
Why don’t we let each other go?

387
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,220
Shen Zhe, would you like to
have a walk tonight?

388
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,620
Forget it.

389
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,660
Come back.

390
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,460
I’m going to
invite Xing Zhouzhou over tonight.

391
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,700
Don’t interfere with us.

392
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,220
Xing Zhouzhou?

393
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,940
Why do you invite her?

394
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,260
None of your business.

395
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,540
You won’t do anything stupid,
will you?

396
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,500
Don’t worry.

397
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,980
Call me if you have problems.

398
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
Are you tired?

399
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,780
No.

400
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,580
I ate too much tonight.

401
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,100
Walking helps to digest.

402
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,340
I’m full, too.

403
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,900
Here we are.

404
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,260
Do you want to go back?

405
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,540
It’s past two o’clock.

406
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,620
Do you want to go back?

407
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,940
I still want to walk for a while.

408
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:14,860
Welcome.

409
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,300
I’m here.

410
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,500
Come in.

411
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,460
Have a seat.

412
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,460
I’ve got something for you.

413
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,700
What is it?

414
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,940
Wait for a second.

415
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,700
What is this?

416
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,700
I’ve got some drugs for you.

417
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,940
I’ll take them with you.

418
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,700
Don’t you like to take your own life?

419
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,580
I’ll die with you.

420
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,060
Drugs?

421
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,260
What’re the drugs?

422
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,500
You’ll find out after you take them.

423
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,260
What do you mean?

424
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
What’s the problem?

425
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,380
Aren’t these enough?

426
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,780
I’ve got much more here.

427
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,340
It’s more than enough.

428
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,660
Is it for real?

429
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,580
Don’t ask if it’s real or not.

430
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,620
My determination of
ending it with you is real.

431
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,780
You…

432
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,220
When you begged me to
change my mind,

433
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,220
it was real, too!

434
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,100
After you cheated on me
again and again,

435
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,180
it was long past.

436
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,540
I’ve forgotten it for long.

437
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,340
Cut the crap, Xing Zhouzhou.

438
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,700
Who will take these first?

439
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,740
You or me?

440
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,500
Shen Zhe, you, you…

441
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,460
You’re really mean.

442
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,140
You…

443
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,700
Excuse me.

444
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,940
Xing Zhouzhou.

445
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,580
No.

446
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,780
What was going on with your ex?

447
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,300
She looked as if she had seen a ghost.

448
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,540
I ended it all with her.

449
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,420
You’re determined this time.

450
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,500
You even used chocolate beans.

451
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Let’s go.

452
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,220
Grab some midnight snack.

453
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,540
What’s wrong with you?

454
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,940
You’ve got such a great
fluctuation of mood.

455
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,500
I’m in a good mood today.

456
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,620
It’s on me.

457
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,420
Let’s go.

458
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,740
Lovelorn men are terrible.

459
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,700
They alternate between
high spirits and low spirits.

460
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,100
Do you come or not?

461
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,220
I’m coming.

462
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,740
It’s past four in the morning.

463
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,820
I don’t think we’ll meet anyone now.

464
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,860
It’s hard to say.

465
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,140
Why don’t you

466
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,900
go up first?

467
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,100
I’ll come later.

468
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,140
We’d better split up.

469
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,940
OK.

470
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,900
I’m going up, then.

471
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,660
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

472
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,700
I’m starving.

473
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,220
Where’s Captain?

474
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,540
Captain. We just talked about you.

475
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,060
Where have you been?

476
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,460
I…

477
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,260
I just got up

478
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,340
and came down.

479
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,780
Where’re you going now?

480
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,060
Where’re you going?

481
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,620
We…

482
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,900
I’m happy today.

483
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
I’ll treat everyone to a snack.

484
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,020
Are you coming?

485
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,940
Come with us.

486
00:28:59,580 --> 00:28:59,980
I, I…

487
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
I know you’re hungry, too.

488
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,380
Come on.

489
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,700
Go, go, let’s go.

490
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,660
Let’s go.

491
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,700
Have some more, Captain.

492
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,740
This restaurant

493
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,860
makes delicious hotpot
according to my search.

494
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,660
Come on.

495
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,740
Let’s order. Excuse me.

496
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,620
Welcome, sir. What would you like?

497
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,220
They’ll order.

498
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,060
We’ll order. We’ll order.

499
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,820
-I want beef balls.
-OK.

500
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,820
Are you the one…

501
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,420
Please give us
four glasses of ice water.

502
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,700
Thanks.

503
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,740
Are you really not…

504
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,100
Four glasses of water.

505
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,900
OK. Right away.

506
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,900
Captain.

507
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,340
Are you thirsty?

508
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,020
Why are you sweating, Captain?

509
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,940
Are you hot?

510
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,940
Are you?

511
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,340
No.

512
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,860
The temperature set on
the air conditioner is high.

513
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,100
Here it is.

514
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,020
It’s not bad.

515
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,860
More dishes come.

516
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,380
Here they are.

517
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,740
Come on, bros.

518
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,140
Come on.

519
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,300
Is this restaurant

520
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,700
really that good?

521
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,780
I searched.

522
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,300
It’s the best

523
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,500
in the vicinity.

524
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,700
Good.

525
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,660
Captain, you must have some more today.

526
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,060
Yeah, you’ve lost weight.

527
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,420
Put some vegetables in.

528
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,220
No, no.

529
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,740
Don’t put so much.

530
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,900
It’s too much, too much.

531
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,540
Shen Zhe rarely spends money in treat.

532
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,900
Have some more, everyone.

533
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,660
Yes. How can you say that?

534
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,580
Let’s eat.

535
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,980
Didn’t I treat you before?

536
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,340
You’re forgetful.

537
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,060
Help yourselves.

538
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,940
I’ll put some more in for you, Captain.

539
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,660
Put more in.

540
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,220
-Come on.
-No, no, no.

541
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,780
Captain, you didn’t have dinner,
did you?

542
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,500
Of course I did. Look at me.

543
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,420
Do you see?

544
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,260
It’s too late.

545
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,780
It’s been a long time since dinner.

546
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,180
We haven’t had midnight snacks
for a long time.

547
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,820
Let’s take a picture to commemorate it.

548
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,100
Come.

549
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,220
Come.

550
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,420
One, two, three.

551
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,180
Did you take it?

552
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,020
Yes, I did.

553
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,380
-Eat, eat, eat.
-Put it on my Moments.

554
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,220
It’s so delicious.

555
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,100
You’re too exaggerating.

556
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,500
Captain, let me help you.

557
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,780
It’s incredible.

558
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,340
Well,

559
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,580
you’re still growing.
You should eat more.

560
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,460
You should eat, too.

561
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,060
I’m not hungry.

562
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,300
You’ve lost weight.

563
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,060
Come on, Captain.

564
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,500
Eat.

565
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,180
Eat.

566
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,060
I…

567
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,340
Put it down for a while.

568
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,020
I’m…

569
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,820
My teeth are a little sour.

570
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,860
I’ll eat later.

571
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,940
Are you all right?

572
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,100
I’m all right, all right.

573
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,060
Didn’t you like beef balls

574
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,980
best before?

575
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,100
Have one. Come on.

576
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,020
Eat.

577
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,140
Have one, Captain.

578
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,260
Yeah, I remember beef ball
is your favorite food.

579
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,340
Did I tell you I like beef balls?

580
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,380
-You did.
-Yes.

581
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
Is it good?

582
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,620
I’ll put it in your bowl,

583
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,380
OK?

584
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,460
Be careful, Captain.

585
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,660
97. 97.

586
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:58,980
Don’t grab.

587
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,300
(Ai Qing)

588
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,540
Are you asleep?

589
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,620
Look at 97’s Moments.

590
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,300
97.

591
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,100
Two hotpots a night.

592
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,020
Have some more.

593
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,100
I couldn’t turn them down.

594
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,860
Nice profile photo.

595
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,620
My girlfriend drew it.

596
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,620
Your seasoning tastes good.

597
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,180
Do you think so?

598
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,620
This is my secret recipe.

599
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,420
Do you want to learn it?

600
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,460
Tell me, please.

601
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,340
Let’s go. I’ll tell you
how to make one.

602
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,100
Really?

603
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,420
Why are you so happy?

604
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,700
You don’t understand.

605
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,620
Did Ai Jing forgive you?

606
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,940
Why do you speak only of my weak points?

607
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,500
Let’s talk about you.

608
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,500
Why do you send messages as if
you’re a thief?

609
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,220
Why do you go out like
you’re working undercover?

610
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,180
Does it make you happy?

611
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,300
I want to keep a low profile.

612
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,700
Why?

613
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,180
I don’t want anyone to disturb us.

614
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,900
I just want to be with her.

615
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,860
In secret.

616
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,420
Is it exciting?

617
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,780
Here.

618
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,020
Have some more.

619
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,100
Shut your mouth.

620
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,740
Yes.

621
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,060
Don’t you have some?

622
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,780
I’m full.

623
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,500
(Hotel)

624
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,460
-Morning.
-Morning.

625
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,340
Morning.

626
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,180
You got up early.

627
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,740
I just saw 97’s Moments.

628
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,780
Didn’t you just have
a midnight snack

629
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,100
a few hours ago?

630
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,700
What should I say?

631
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,020
We digest quickly.

632
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,300
Where’re your teammates?

633
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,740
Our boys prefer to lie-in

634
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,900
rather than

635
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,020
delicious food.

636
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,580
Where’s your captain?

637
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,940
Our diligent captain

638
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,340
went for a morning run.

639
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,340
Speak of the devil.

640
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,260
Morning.

641
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,260
-Morning, Captain.
-Morning, Captain.

642
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,020
Morning.

643
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,860
Morning.

644
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,260
Morning.

645
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,060
Here. Eat your breakfast.

646
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,740
Everyone got up early.

647
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,340
-Morning.
-Morning, Mr. Xiang.

648
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,180
Today, our sponsor will

649
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,380
organize a one-day tour of Suzhou.

650
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,660
Everyone must go.

651
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,500
Do you hear me?

652
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
Yes.

653
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,660
Gao,

654
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,380
listen to me.

655
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,180
Shall we go together later?

656
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,980
Sure.

657
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,500
Shall we go?

658
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,540
-Take your time.
-Bye.

659
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,100
OK.

660
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,580
-OK. Bye.
-Bye.

661
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,820
Captain.

662
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,100
How about

663
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,300
you make your own arrangements

664
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,100
and leave us some leeway?

665
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,340
You guys have fun.

666
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,460
I’m going to see Ai Jing.

667
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,740
OK.

668
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,900
Take your time.

669
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,580
I’m going back.

670
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,100
OK.

671
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,140
Gao,

672
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,580
it’s rare that SP and K&K
will all attend the activity.

673
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,340
You must ask the photographer

674
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,580
to take more photos.

675
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,500
Fans love to see that.

676
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,700
Yes, Mr. Xiang.

677
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,940
Especially,

678
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,180
take more photos of Wu Bai.

679
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,340
My cousin likes him very much.

680
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,260
Mr. Xiang, rest assured.

681
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,420
I’ll take care of it.

682
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
Zhou Yi.

683
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Zhou Yi. Zhou Yi. Zhou Yi.

684
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,060
Wake up, Zhou Yi.

685
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,860
Wake up. Wake up.

686
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,700
Zhou Yi. Zhou Yi. Zhou Yi.

687
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,540
Wake up.

688
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,340
-We got troubles.
-We got troubles?

689
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,500
Is anyone hurt?

690
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,820
Get my first-aid kit.

691
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,580
Drop it.

692
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,500
It’s our captain.

693
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,340
Did Captain have an accident?

694
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
I’ll get my first-aid kit.

695
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,860
No. Captain didn’t have an accident.

696
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,460
We must protect him.

697
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,980
Protect Captain?

698
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,940
Mr. Xiang hired someone
to sneak photos of Wu Bai.

699
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,100
Our mission today

700
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,540
is to stop it.

701
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,140
OK. But why do we have to stop it?

702
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,820
Why do you ask so many questions?

703
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,340
Go.

704
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,100
This way.

705
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,020
Let’s take a look at that.

706
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,140
OK.

707
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,020
Which do you like?

708
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,500
This?

709
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,100
That?

710
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,340
Is that tall guy Wu Bai?

711
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,300
-This is tasty, too.
-It looks like him.

712
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,500
-I’m going to buy one.
-Take photos. Take photos.

713
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,540
Thanks.

714
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,660
97.

715
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,140
Ai Qing.

716
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,260
Zhou Yi.

717
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,660
Where are Wu Bai and Ai Qing?

718
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,980
Let’s get in and have a look.

719
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,780
Go.

720
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,100
It’s strange.

721
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,500
It’s strange.

722
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,940
Find them.

723
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,940
No. No. Where are they?

724
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,100
Take a look over there.

725
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
Who’re they?

726
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,180
What’s going on?

727
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,260
Mr. Xiang

728
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,660
hired someone to sneak photos of you.

729
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,020
He wants some titbits.

730
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,540
Mr. Xiang

731
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,340
always acts on impulse.

732
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,260
What shall we do now?

733
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,860
(New Arrivals)

734
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,740
I have an idea.

735
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,420
Where are they?

736
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,700
They were here just now.

737
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,580
I didn’t see them.

738
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,620
(New Arrivals)

739
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,700
(New Arrivals)

740
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,060
-Hi.
-Hello.

741
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,980
97. Zhou Yi.

742
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,060
How come you’re here?

743
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,860
Who do you think we are?

744
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,060
What’re you doing?

745
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,540
-Shopping.
-Shopping.

746
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,340
My ankle!

747
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,100
What’s wrong?

748
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,580
My ankle is twisted.

749
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,020
Is it hurt?

750
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,340
A little.

751
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,060
Forget it. Let’s go.

752
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,500
Otherwise they’ll catch up with us.

753
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,260
Where’re you going?

754
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,340
To buy some ice

755
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,500
to put on your ankle.

756
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,500
It’s far enough.

757
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,860
They can’t catch up with us.

758
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,300
Don’t worry.

759
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,580

760

Hold on.

762
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,740
Let’s go over there to buy some food.

763
