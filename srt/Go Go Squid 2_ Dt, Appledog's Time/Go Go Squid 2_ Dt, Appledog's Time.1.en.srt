19
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,420
Dear spectators,

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,380
welcome to the final of

21
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,740
China Intelligent Robot
Fighting Competition of 2017.

22
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,020
This is an annual competition of

23
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,860
the highest level
concerning robot fighting.

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,540
Today, we’re going to present you

25
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,100
the most wonderful game
and the most vivid commentary.

26
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,780
Now, our staff is debugging

27
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,580
the robots.

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,540
First comes the Tornado!

29
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,140
Its operator is the known

30
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,300
best female operator in China,

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,460
(Robot: Tornado)
Appledog Ai Qing!

32
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,860
Everyone knows that seven years ago,

33
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,180
she won the national championship

34
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,180
as a member of the Solo Team.

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,900
So, she has the high aspirations to

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,500
win the championship today.

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,060
Tornado’s opponent is

38
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,700
Nobody...

39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,580
Where is Nobody now?

40
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,740
Nobody shows up behind the Tornado.

41
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,380
What a surprising presence!

42
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,380
(Robot: Nobody)
Its operator Wu Bai

43
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,660
enters the national final

44
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,940
in his first attempt in the tournaments.

45
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,060
Let’s look forward to their fighting!

46
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,700
Oh, no. The remoter goes wrong.

47
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,020
Fix it now. I’ll call captain.

48
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,500
She has a spare remoter.

49
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,020
(Entrance)

50
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,900
(Entrance for spectators)

(Exit 11)

52
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,540
“The inner ring road
is heavily congested.”

53
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,260
“Listeners who are driving,
you’d better”

54
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,940
“avoid the tunnel at Yan’an road.”

55
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,340
“And, we just received a message...”

56
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,420
Sir, I’ll get off now.

57
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,340
Now? We haven’t arrived yet.

58
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,340
It’s fine. I’ll get off here.

59
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,260
“The traffic is moving slowly now.”

60
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,660
(Exit 11)

61
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,860
Hello, captain of DT.

62
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,900
You’ve all got wet.

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,540
There’s still time
before the competition begins.

64
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,620
I’ll lead you to the
dressing room first.

65
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,820
You can change into dry clothes.

66
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,700
This way, please.

67
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,060
Now the captain of the other team

68
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,260
Appledog hasn’t arrived.

69
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,300
I’m afraid she’s stuck on the road

70
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,580
because of the heavy rain.

71
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,780
It’s really hard to say

72
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,620
whether she can arrive on time.

73
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,860
Did you hear that?

74
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,620
That guy said Appledog hasn’t come.

75
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,300
Does that mean

76
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,900
we’ll defeat them without fight?

77
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
I’ll be back soon.

78
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,780
Captain.

79
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,900
Where are you going, captain?

80
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,940
The competition is about to begin.

81
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,980
What to do?

82
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,060
What can I help you?

85
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,420
I wonder when they’ll come.

86
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,700
Me, too.

87
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,540

88
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,780
Where have you gone?

89
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,140
Finally you’re here.

90
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,620
Come on. It’s time to begin.

91
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,300
(Exit 11)
I’ll go inside first.

92

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,500
He, go tell the director that

94
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,340
they’re here.

95
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,420
Captain.

96
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,620
Didn’t you leave with an umbrella?

97
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,500
Why you got so wet?

98
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,380
Get me a dry towel.

99
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,420
Okay.

100
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,380
I’ll prepare for the competition,
Captain.

101
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,740

We can see that

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,580
the competition is reaching its climax.

108
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,140
Yeah.

Ai Qing deserves her title of pianist.

It’s already halfway through the game.

114
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,020
Ai Qing has totally seized the stage.

115
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,620
Yeah, experience counts.

116
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,340
Competition experience
is also part of strength.

117
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,540
Ai Qing! Ai Qing! Ai Qing!

118
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,380
You haven’t changed your
remoter set-up in seven years.

119
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,060
I know the position of your keys

120
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,660
even with my eyes closed.

121
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,100
But you are way more skilled

122
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,380
than seven years ago.

123
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,340
It’s hard to imagine
this is the performance

124
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,820
after you’ve been caught in the rain.

125
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,500
I’ve been waiting for this moment
for seven years.

126
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,300
Finally I stand

127
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,820
in front of you as a contestant

128
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,020
instead of a spectator.

Well done! Great!

132
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,060
What’s wrong with him?

Finally I’m competing with her.

137
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,620
Come on. It’s not competing.

138
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,700
You’re being beaten.

139
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,340
Fight back.

140
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,300
Watch carefully.

Nobody shoots off and

00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,620
overturns the defending champion!

144
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,060
Wu Bai’s operation is so unpredictable!

145
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,100
Faced with his attack,

146
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,940
Ai Qing has no time to respond.

147
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,180
Wu Bai!

148
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,100
It’s not finished.

149
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,620
Ai Qing won’t give up easily.

150
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,660
Ai Qing defenses herself

151
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,180
by hitting Nobody at full throttle!

152
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,860
What a killing move!

153
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,500
That’s really Appledog!

154
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,820
Captain.

155
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,860
There’s no need to keep going.

156
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,980
Just manage to run out of time,

157
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,420
we’ll be the champion with our points.

158
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,620
That’s not what I want.

159
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,500
It’s the most critical time now.

160
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,540
The winner will soon be decided.

161
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,220
It’s still a very close game.

162

There is no much time
for the two contestants.

Tornado! Tornado bites Nobody

164
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,660
and is pushing it to the fire.

push Tornado to the mace!

171
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,100
15 seconds left!

172
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,180
They are heading towards the mace again!

173
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,980
Now both robots break down
on the ground.

174
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,060
This is so exciting!

175
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,380
Weiquan, what do you think?

176
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,620
According to the rules,

177
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,020
the team who can first

178
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,380
restore the movement of its robot

179
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,500
will win the final victory!

180
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,860
Although Tornado is badly damaged,

181
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,420
it begins to move now!

182
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,660
It seems Ai Qing is going to win!

183
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
The game is not finished.

184
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,460
Nobody has bounced himself up

185
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,260
with its own weapons!

186
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,620
Nobody has resumed its movement!

187
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,660
However, Tornado lost
its movement ability again.

188
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,940
The game is set.

189
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,980
Nobody has defeated

190
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,660
the champion of last two competitions,
Tornado,

191
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,260
and become the new champion!

192
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,740
This is really unexpected.

193
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,100
The former champion Tornado

194
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,620
took all the advantages

195
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,540
in this competition,

196
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,420
but Wu Bai and his Nobody

197
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,980
turned the table at the last moment!

198
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,060
Let’s congratulate DT again!

199
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,500

You’ve got two gold medals
and one silver medal.

226
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,300
It’s a little ashamed

He

234
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,060
is still studying abroad.

235
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,220
He found a club and
formed a team temporarily

236
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,540
in his summer vacation.

237

you’ll feel regret,

245
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,100
because only
by winning the championship,

246
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,740
can you attend the AMC
(Asian MMA Championship).

00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,060
Anyway, thank you both.

341
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,780
But what will you use?

342
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,100
He

343
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,700
wants me to dry his hair?

344
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,180
Well…

345
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,700
Give it to me.

346
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,940
Wu Bai.

347
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,460
We meet again so soon.

348
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,340
Are you here to watch the competition?

349
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,060
I’m here for the speed racing.

350
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,820
Is it fun?

351
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,260
Yeah.

352
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,660
You can try it too.

353
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,820
Come in, please.

354
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,220
Let me help you!

355
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,860
Well, Captain,

356
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,780
you’re kind of conservative today.

357
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,620
Wear it. Don’t get cold.

358
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,700
I’ll get dressed.

359
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,780
Suit yourself.

360
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,820
I have to do my business.

361
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:54,580
Go, Solo! Go, Solo!
Go, Solo!

362
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,020
Are you studying me?

363
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,420
It’s a preparation

364
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,540
to learn from videos.

365
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,780
We’re back.

366
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,900
Captain.

367
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,100
Ai Qing, you’re here.

368
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,340
Come on. Come here.

369
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
Have some food.

370
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,380
Okay.

371
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,900
Who can wash fruits for me?

372
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,060
Let me.

373
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,300
I’ll help you.

374
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,460
Here.

375
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,020
This is good.

376
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,500
Try it.

377
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,060
What is this?

378
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,260
Are you happy now?

379
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,700
Your dream girl comes suddenly...

380
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,580
Lower your voice.

381
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,260
Since she’s here,

382
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,620
seize the opportunity.

383
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,260
Go for it, boy.

384
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,900
Wash the apples.

385
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,620
I’ll wash the apples.

386
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,020
You can wash the bananas.

387
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,900
Well, why wash bananas?

388
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,820
Just peel it and eat it.

389
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,580
Fine, fine.

390
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,740
I’ll go wash the bananas there.

391
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,260
Just wash your apples here.

392
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,340
It’s been seven years.

393
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,500
I finally have the chance
to stand beside you

394
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,780
and say it loudly that

395
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,900
I choose to enter this industry

396
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,380
because of you.

397
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,540
(Former champion lost to a newcomer.)
I think it’s full of tricks.

398
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,500
(At wit’s end or hollow victory?)
If she didn’t turn to speed racing,

399
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,740
(AD Team Forum)
she can’t go to AMC.

400
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,140
It’s really a trick that

401
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,300
Ai Qing went to AMC

402
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,820
by speed racing.

403
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,340
She’s not the girl seven years ago.

404
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,460
You can’t repudiate Appledog

405
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,220
just because of a failure.

406
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,500
She tried her best.

407
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,140
Best?

408
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,820
So, this is the result?

409
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,500
She disappointed all of us.

410
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,900
Is it... I should retire?

411
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,620
Are you brothers,

412
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,500
sisters,

413
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,060
or a couple?

414
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,540
They’re a couple.

415
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,500
How do you know?

416
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,300
They’re a male and a female.

417
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,700
So, they’re not sisters or brothers.

418
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,700
A male and a female

419
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,980
may be sister and brother.

420
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,860
They’re of different breeds.

421
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,140
So, they don’t have the same parents.

422
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,420
Well,

423
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,540
can cats of different breeds

424
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,020
be a couple?

425
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,580
Sure,

426
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,060
as long as they’re cats.

427
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,620
Will their babies

428
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,820
be of different breeds too?

429
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,340
Probably…

430
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,660
No.

431
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,580
Then,

432
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,660
they are sisters and brothers
of different breeds.

433
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,220
Why?

434
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,300
You can’t fall sleep either?

435
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,180
No.

436
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,820
So I come here to get some air.

437
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,620
What are you doing here?

438
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,540
Turn around and look at me.

439
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,940
-Get up.
-You can’t touch its belly.

440
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,220
Pet it like this.

441
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,260
It will feel safe and comfortable.

442
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,540
It seems you know cats well.

443
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,180
Not really.

444
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,580
What’s your name?

445
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,140
Ai Qing.

446
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,820
Try it.

447
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,580
I’ll get you up first.

448
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,820
Okay.

449
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,980
Ai Qing.

450
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,820
Actually, I...

451
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,060
What’s wrong with you just now?

452
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,820
I’m fine.

453
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,340
Maybe I’m too nervous

454
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,420
before the competition.

455
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,220
By the way,

456
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,060
what did you want to say to me?

457
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,420
Nothing.

458
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,060
I just wonder if you’d like to

459
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,820
go to the shooting hall
before the competition.

460
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,420
You also like to relax yourself
before the competition?

461
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,220
I learned it seven years ago.

462
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,100
Okay, 7:00 AM tomorrow.

463
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,540
See you in the lobby.

464
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,300
So it’s settled.

465
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,580
Okay.

466
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,940
It’s your turn.

467
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,220
Young man, are you

468
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,300
afraid of losing?

469
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,300
No.

470
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,060
The loser

471
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,580
will pay the bill later.

472
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,060
Let me try.

473
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
This young man in front of me

474
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,820
is calm and focused.

475
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,060
This is what athletics needs.

476
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,940
Right now,

477
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,820
I’m pretty sure

478
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,180
he is more qualified than me

479
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,660
to lead AD Team,

480
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,980
even lead China’s

481
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,300
robot fighting industry forward.

482
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,660
A narrow victory.

483
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,660
I’ll pay the bill.

484
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,900
Wait.

485
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,580
Wu Bai.

486
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,540
Are you interested in joining my team?

487
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,060
You don’t need to answer me now.

488
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,980
Tell me after you think it over.

489
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,820
Okay.

490
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,180
Ice cream.

491
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,740
Thank you.

492
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,340
I saw you shoot
with a professional posture.

493
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,740
Are you trained?

494
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,900
I didn’t do well.

495
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,420
It’s not stable enough.

496
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,300
To be frank,

497
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,860
I thought you were just an amateur,

498
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,100
and wanted to show you

499
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,180
how well I can shoot.

500
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,180
I didn’t expect
I’d almost embarrass myself.

501
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,900
But I won you by two shots

502
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,300
and got an ice cream.

503
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,860
I’m so satisfied.

504
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,580
Actually, I want to ask you a question.

505
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,380
You were in Solo Team back then.

506
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,300
Why did your team suddenly break up?

507
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,060
Why is this always asked?

508
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,220
It’s been a long time.

509
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,860
Tell me the truth.

510
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,260
Did you step into this field

511
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,380
because you admire Solo Team?

512
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,500
Who’s your idol?

513
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,020
Solo?

514
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,700
Or Han Shangyan?

515
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,380
Or is it because of me?

516
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,940
Fine, I’ll stop joking.

517
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,740
Actually,

518
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,140
you should’ve seen some gossips

519
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,500
and historical records on the Internet.

520
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,100
You can find a reasonable explanation

521
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,940
and believe it.

522
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,460
Enough of this.

523
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,620
Let’s go.

524
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,580
Have you ever played that?

525
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,980
What’s that?

526
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,860
Let’s go.

527
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:54,900
♪Love I fell in love are you♪

528
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:03,260
♪Love I see the sky yes you♪

529
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,500
♪Love Love I found you♪

530
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,340
At this moment, I sincerely hope that

531
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,660
this sunny and happy young man

532
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,700
can go all the way to

533
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,020
the top of the world

534
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,020
without any setback,

535
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,860
fulfill the dream

536
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,660
that we have failed to,

537
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,100
and win the world championship
for China.

538
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,060
♪This love for you♪

539
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,300
-Yeah, what is wrong?
-How could it be?

540
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,500
Ai Qing, what’s your number?

541
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,300
Shady deal. It must be a shady deal.

542
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,460
Look.

543
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,020
The contestants from the organizer

544
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,900
have relatively weak opponents.

545
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,260
Look at mine.

546
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,860
Mine is the last champion.

547
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,820
And the contestant from Australia,

548
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,740
who might possibly win the champion.

549
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,380
His opponent is strong, too.

550
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,540
Do you mean
the organizer is playing dirty tricks?

551
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,340
It’s so obvious that the organizer

552
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,300
is not even trying to hide it.

553
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,300
Look.

554
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,540
If I get through it this time...

555
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,020
(Han Shangyan)
(The organizer is playing dirty tricks.)

556
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,060
(Give me a contact.)

557
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,180
So, before the competition,

558
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,060
they had already decided

559
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,780
how hard the competition would be.

560
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,300
I’ll go ask the organizer.

561
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,060
You can’t affect the whole team

562
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,820
just because of me.

563
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,540
That’s unfair to you.

564
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,300
Slide.

565
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,580
(Han Shangyan)
(Contact this person)

566
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,780
Do you know

567
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,100
why I decided to join in robot fighting?

568
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,660
Because I once

569
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,340
saw an article
on an international forum.

570
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,340
It said there’s nothing worth mentioning

571
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,620
about China’s competitive race.

572
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,820
A few years ago,
they saw themselves as experts

573
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,580
and criticized us at their will.

574
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,380
But what now?

575
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,100
They even dare not fight with us.

576
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,060
I will get the championship

577
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,380
without changing my opponents.

578
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,620
In this battlefield,

579
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,020
only the one with absolute strength

580
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,420
can ignore all the injustice.

581
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,580
This is the commentary for

582
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,380
2017 AMC.

583
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,060
This is the final of
single-player racing.

584
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,420
Ai Qing from China

585
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,860
and her racing robot Ladybug

586
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,220
have made it all the way to the final.

587
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,740
Will she win the championship today?

588
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,540
Let us wait and see!

589
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,540
The competition is underway.

590
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,020
Both robots are moving fast
on the track,

591
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,900
trying to prevent the other passing.

592
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,900
Ai Qing’s Ladybug surpasses
her opponent at the curve.

593
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,500
Her opponent is running close
behind her.

594
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,300
No!

595
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,060
The robot from the Malaysian contestant

596
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,900
takes out its sawtooth.

597
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,020
Ai Qing is forced to give way.

598
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,380
The opponent takes the lead now.

599
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,740
It’s the last part of the track
with obstacles.

600
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,820
It’s difficult to surpass the opponent

601
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,340
in this area.

602
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,060
Ai Qing shortens the distance
when her opponent avoids the obstacles.

603
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,620
Ladybug is torching!

604
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,700
Ai Qing has a secret weapon too!

605
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,340
She has never shown us that before.

606
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,340
It’s almost the destination.

607
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,740
Will Ai Qing turn the tide?

608
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,140
Ai Qing speeds up suddenly.

609
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,700
Victory! No Problem.

610
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,940
Well done!

611
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,260
Ai Qing breasts the tape!

612
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,100
Ai Qing wins the championship!

613
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,220
Chinese delegation wins the championship
of single-player racing.

614
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,980
Congratulations to Chinese delegation!
Congratulations to Ai Qing!

615
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,580
This is Robot Fighting Group Competition

616
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,180
from 2017 AMC.

617
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,860
Wu Bai knocked out his opponent
thoroughly.

618
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,260
Now, it’s the second group competition.

619
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,340
Wu Bai is fighting
with Philippine contestant.

620
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,980
Nobody throws its opponent
towards the mace.

621
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,180
Great! Another KO!
Wu Bai wins!

622
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,180
Wu Bai has won twice in a row

623
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,900
in the group competition,

624
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,300
and ranks first now.

625
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,660
The fans present are

626
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,020
shouting with cheer for Wu Bai.

627
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,340
He wins! Three perfect victories

628
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,540
in the group competition.

629
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,740
Congratulations to Wu Bai!
Congratulations to Chinese delegation!

630
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,860
Wu Bai will challenge

631
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,500
the team championship of 2017 AMC

632
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,060
on behalf of China.

633
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,860
♪No matter how
Break through bravely with a free hand♪

634
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,470
♪It’s the dream of love
Already lightened by you♪

635
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,460
Congratulations.
You made it to the final.

636
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,700
Yeah, thank you.

637
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,620
Everyone,

638
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,380
we rank first in the group competition.

639
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,900
Anyway, what we achieved today

640
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,180
has created the history.

641
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,140
It doesn’t matter
whether we win or not in the final.

642
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,540
But if we win,

643
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,660
have fun in Singapore. My treat.

644
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,140
Really?

645
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,780
Are you serious?

646
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,220
I’ll go to the Universal Studios.

647
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,900
I heard the Sentosa Island is great.

648
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,940
And the biggest Ferris wheel,

649
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,060
the Singapore Flyer.

650
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,980
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,300
Where will you go, Ai Qing?

652
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,460
Whatever works. You decide.

653
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,620
Come on, let’s go celebrate.

654
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,540
Here, to Ai Qing’s championship.

655
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,420
To the championship
of the final tomorrow.

656
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:40,940
Cheers!

657
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,900
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

658
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,420
I’ve arranged the hospital.

659
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,060
Buy a ticket and fly back right away.

660
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,980
I haven’t finished my business here.

661
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,460
My eyes are fine for now.

662
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,620
Fine?

663
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,900
Do you think I’m blind?

664
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,660
You lost your sight

665
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,100
in the middle of the competition, right?

666
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,740
How long have you been like this?

667
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,700
Go get a ticket right now!

668
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,860
Don’t force me to come.

669
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,220
You’re not blind.

670
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,780
I’m going to be blind.

671
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,700
It’s been seven years.

672
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,540
Winning the world championship
is her dream.

673
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,860
I want to do that for her.

674
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,620
There are other opportunities.

675
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,340
But your eyes must be treated now!

676
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,540
That’s it.

677
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,300
I’ll book you a flight
the day after tomorrow.

678
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,140
I promise you

679
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,500
I won’t tell grandpa for now.

680
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,300
But you must come back immediately.

Captain.

683
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,180
Your eyes…

684
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,100
Orbital varix.

685
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,060
It’s not the worst stage,

686
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,340
but I begin to lose my sight
from time to time.

687
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,780
Then go have an operation!

688
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,660
It’s very risky.

689
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,620
Well...

690
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,020

692
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,420
I asked my parents in my childhood

693
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,260
why eyes can see things.

694
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,180
They said it’s because of light.

695
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,060
It’s been a long time ago.

696
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,220
I remember these words now.

697
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,860
It’s because of light.

698
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,460
It brings images to my eyes,

699
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,580
so I can see.

700
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,140
It’s the simplest principle.

701
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,700
But to me,

702
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,900
nothing can make me more nervous

703
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,260

becomes the biggest obstacle to me.

710
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,820
It’s a misunderstanding that
I like challenges

711
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,500
and I don’t want to be ordinary.

712

713
