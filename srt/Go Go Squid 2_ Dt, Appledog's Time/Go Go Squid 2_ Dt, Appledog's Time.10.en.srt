00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,540
Okay.

23
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,820
Where should we meet?

24
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,300
The 127th level of Bingo Pop.

25
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,260
I only used ten moves.
How many did you go?

26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,900
Seven.

27
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,020
Nice.

28
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,340
Come on and teach me.

29
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,540
Someone challenged me online.

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,820
Let me impress him.

31
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,940
No.

32
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,780
Teach me, please.

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,620
No.

34
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,100
Just teach me.

35
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,580
How about this.

36
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,380
Let’s see who can first go
ten moves in the 200th level.

37
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,500
I’ll teach you if you win.

38
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,740
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

39
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,180
It’s impossible
to go ten moves you know.

40
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,060
I’ve already started.

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,420
You... Wait... I...

42
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,380
It’s the second move.

43
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,100
You have to wait for me.

44
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,660
Two hundredth, two hundredth.

45
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,180
Third move.

46
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,220
Two hundredth.

47
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,780
-Alright.
-I’m on my third move.

48
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,260
Here we go. Let’s start.

49
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,380
-97.
-I’m, I’m on the fourth move.

50
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,100
Does, does this shirt look nice?

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,220
Come on. I’m on the first move.

52
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,060
Not bad.

53
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,220
Do you think the collar’s detail is...?

54
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,340
-It’s very...
-My first move is... You see.

55
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,900
-Yeah, yeah.
-First move.

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,100
-Second move.

57
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,460
I’m almost there. It’s the sixth move.

58
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,460
Second move.

59
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,740
-Shen Zhe.
-I have only one move left.

60
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,540
See this slogan...

61
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,780
I’ve three moves left, pal.

62
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,140
-It’s... I...
-Two moves.

63
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,300
Does it look good?

64
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,500
Sure. I think it’s nice.

65
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,740
Great.

66
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,340
I’m on my, on my fourth move.

67
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,660
Tenth move.

68
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,140
I passed.

69
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,300
Eleven moves.

70
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,900
Just one move more.

71
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,540
I said ten moves.

72
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,140
No.

73
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,860
-Just this one move.
-No, no. It doesn’t count.

74
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,180
-Ten moves only.
-Just one move more.

75
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,380
Do you think the shirt
in my left hand looks better

76
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,980
or the one in my right hand?

77
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,140
-Right hand.
-Left hand.

78
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,460
-Right hand.
-Left hand.

79
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,180
Which one exactly?

80
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,700
Both are fine.

81
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,860
I told you to play within ten moves.

82
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,060
I, I only used one more move.

83
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,660
Eleven doesn’t count.

84
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,660
I told you it doesn’t count.

85
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,860
Let’s play again, okay?
One last time.

86
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,500
Let me play again. I made a mistake.

87
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,100
You made a mistake? Then teach me.

88
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,700
-You teach me.
-Let me play again.

89
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,540
Not the one who lost will teach.

90
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:32,980
Yeah.

91
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,780
Playing again means you lost.
It means you lost.

92
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Why does it...? How am I...?

93
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,860
Team meeting.

94
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,740
Today’s meeting.

95
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,780
It’s mainly about

96
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,980
which shirt looks better
among these three.

97
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,700
Well...

98
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,780
Isn’t, isn’t this the kind

99
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,660
of black shirt you’d wear normally?

100
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,220
What are the differences?

101
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,700
They are different.
There are many details.

102
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,700
You see, they’re all different.

103
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,180
Well...

104
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,700
I can’t tell
if there are any differences.

105
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,540
You don’t get it.

106
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,740
Sit down.

107
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,060
You go.

108
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,940
The first one

109
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,100
is a little complex.

110
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,900
The second one is not delicate enough.

111
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,540
The third one

112
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,380
is suitable for dating.

113
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,700
Thanks.

114
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,860
What are you going to do, Captain?

115
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,020
Don’t you understand?

116
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,180
Of course it’s a date.

117
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,340
Bingo Pop is more suitable for you.

118
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,060
Come on.

119
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,140
No, I was really close. See?

120
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Thank you.

121
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,660
Order whatever you want.

122
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,380
What do you like?

123
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,700
I’m fine with anything.

124
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,860
Wu Bai?

125
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,580
How come you’re in Suzhou, too?

126
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,220
Lin Yin?

127
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,980
K&K is here for the competition.

128
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,020
Let me introduce.

129
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,460
He’s a friend I met abroad
during a competition.

130
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,420
Lin Yin.

131
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,220
And this pretty lady is...?

132
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,100
She’s my friend.

133
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,980
Ai Qing.

134
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,180
Hi.

135
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,940
I’m Wu Bai’s friend, Lin Yin.

136
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,020
Hello.

137
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,300
Let me introduce myself.

138
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,100
I have a quarter of Chinese,

139
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,540
a quarter of French.

140
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,780
The rest

141
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,500
are a bit complicated.

142
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,220
Let’s sit and talk, please.

143
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,380
Excuse me.

144
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,900
We’d like an extra set of tableware.

145
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,860
Who’d know?

146
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,420
You came back after all.

147
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,460
Last year,

148
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,180
Wu Bai and I met in the Europe Zone.

149
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,140
He’s the champion.

150
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,420
I won the second place.

151
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,660
You were the champion
of the Europe Zone last year?

152
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,060
Guess.

153
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,180
What do his international fans call him?

154
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,260
What?

155
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,180
Medusa.

156
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,620
Medusa?

157
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,420
Yes. Medusa in the Greek mythology.

158
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,660
The gorgon.

159
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,180
Why’d they call you that?

160
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,980
Because he was really aggressive.

161
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,940
There’s a player in my team

162
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,940
who’s very good.

163
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,860
He’s normally very cocky

164
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,100
and ignores everybody.

165
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,860
But when he met Wu Bai
in the competition,

166
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,260
he becomes very talkative.

167
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,740
There’s more.

168
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,500
There’s a guy before in our club.

169
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,260
He changed his mecha’s name

170
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,740
into General Famous

171
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,860
just to compete with Wu Bai.

172
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,140
He said he wants to make a couple

173
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,660
with Wu Bai’s Mr. Nobody.

174
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,220
There’s no such thing as a couple.

175
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,820
They were just fooling around.

176
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,100
I only know that three years ago,

177
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,180
he was called the Industry’s Dark Horse.

178
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,620
The Industry’s Dark Horse?

179
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,900
Three years ago?

180
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,620
Miss.

181
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,380
So are you Wu Bai’s girlfriend?

182
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,900
This is the first time I see him
taking a girl out.

183
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,420
No, no.

184
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,340
A friend, a friend.

185
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,940
Well, let’s order.

186
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,300
You are our guest.

187
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,180
You can order anything you want.

188
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,260
Miss, you go first.

189
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,380
Okay.

190
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,020
Be honest with me.

191
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,020
She is your girlfriend.

192
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,180
Right?

193
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
Not yet.

194
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,260
But soon, I guess.

195
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,340
Really?

196
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,700
What’s he talking about?

197
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,020
He said

198
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,700
the air here is pretty good.

199
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,540
Right?

200
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,540
Yeah.

201
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,820
The air is nice.

202
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,260
Suzhou’s weather is indeed fine.

203
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,300
But it’s getting cooler these days.

204
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,420
Check it out. What do you want?

205
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,660
Thanks.

206
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,140
By the way,

207
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,740
the host is having a party tonight.

208
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,860
Both SP and K&K are going.

209
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,980
Will you go, too?

210
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,500
I will if you will.

211
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,500
I’m the publicity chair,
of course I’m going.

212
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,100
Well, I’ll go with you tonight.

213
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,940
Louder. I can’t hear you.

214
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,820
Hello? I have no signal here.
No signal.

215
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,700
Don’t talk nonsense with me, okay?

216
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,260
Stop.

217
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,420
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

218
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,660
I’m really sorry.

219
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,860
Your clothes...

220
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,020
It’s fine.

221
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,900
I’m really sorry. My apologies.

222
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,140
I didn’t notice.

223
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,500
You gave me your clothes.

224
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,860
What about you?

225
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,060
I’m fine.

226
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,180
Let’s go back.

227
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,620
Ai Qing.

228
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,060
What happened?
How come you’re all wet?

229
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,060
Nothing. I accidentally got splashed
by water just now.

230
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,860
I’ll be back to my hotel now.

231
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,620
Wu Bai.

232
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,100
We are going to the karaoke
with SP tonight.

233
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,180
Are you coming?

234
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,380
How, how’s your clothes wet?
Where’s your jacket?

235
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,860
Boil some water for me.

236
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,060
We’re going to the karaoke tonight.
Are you coming?

237
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,100
Yeah.

238
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,660
That’s rare.

239
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,740
Is Ai Qing going, too?

240
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,740
You have too many questions.

241
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Really?

242
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,420
I don’t think so.

243
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,180
I’m going to pick her up.

244
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,740
See you later.

245
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,620
You are too sweet

246
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,060
to be separated for just one moment.

247
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,860
Thanks to my help today.

248
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,260
It’s a heaven’s sign, too.

249
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,740
The hero rescued

250
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
the girl who got splashed by water.

251
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,060
It’s the best gossip ever.

252
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,540
Hopefully they can be together at last.

253
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,060
To have a good ending.

254
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,620
So did they get together after that?

255
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,380
Can’t wait to know the follow-up.

256
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,260
Best wingman ever.

257
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,420
Can you set me up with a date?

258
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,180
Wingman, is your friend W cute?

259
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,980
Hello. Hi.

260
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,180
Two bottles of water to the room.
Thanks.

261
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,540
That fast?

262
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,740
Coming.

263
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Are, are you ready?

264
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,140
I’ll get things done, soon.

265
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,420
Sorry. Seems like...

266
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,700
I didn’t mean to look.

267
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,380
I...

268
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,060
Your jacket is wet.

269
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,180
Let... Let me wash it and give it back.

270
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,540
Well...

271
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,620
I’ll wait for you in the KTV.

272
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,940
Okay.

273
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,620
By the way.

274
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,620
This is boiled water.

275
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,900
This prevents you from getting a cold.

276
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,260
Eat it.

277
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,780
Thank you.

278
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,300
I’ll go change first.

279
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,420
I’ll come after I’m done.

280
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:24,980
Wait for me.

281
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,300
-Happy birthday.
-Whose birthday is it?

282
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,260
-Happy birthday to you.
-Don’t drink if you can’t.

283
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,180
♪Happy birthday to you♪

284
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,980
♪Happy birthday to you♪

285
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,300
-Nice.
-Why does this drink get to me so fast?

286
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,140
Are you okay?
Stop drinking if you’re drunk.

287
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,180
Sing a song.

288
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,260
I’m tone-deaf.

289
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,220
I can’t sing.

290
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,740
Seriously?

291
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,660
Sing.

292
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,980
I can’t, forget about it.

293
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,500
Ask her over.

294
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,340
Appledog.

295
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,540
What took you so long?

296
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,340
Come here.

297
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,060
Look at Ou Qiang as a wingman.

298
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,580
He still got it.

299
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,260
We are

300
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,420
not alert enough,

301
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,540
it needs to improve.

302
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,660
What wingman?

303
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,820
Zhou Yi.

304
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,180
Pull the

305
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,500
fire hydrant later.

306
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,860
Why?

307
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,780
Once the bell rings,

308
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,060
ask Wu Bai to run with Ai Qing.

309
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,740
It’d be romantic.

310
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,340
Nice move.

311
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
Well...

312
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,020
When should I do it?

313
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Let me sing a song.

314
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,500
I’ll be right back.

315
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,100
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

316
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,260
Zhou Yi.

317
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,140
We three

318
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,660
should sing this song.

319
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,780
Come on.

320
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,140
Okay.

321
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,220
Come on.

322
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,820

337
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,060
Continue.

338
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,620
I’m going to the bathroom.

339
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,340
Wu Bai.

340
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,580
While I was singing,

341
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,100
I wished your cousin were here.

342
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,660
He doesn’t fit in too many people.

343
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,740
It’s too much for him.

344

345

Han hasn’t changed at all.

346
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,860
Did you say that Han

347
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,740
is your cousin?

348
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,660
Yeah.

349
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,220

don’t you know that?

I’ve been retired for three years.

407
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,620
I know.

408
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,940
I’m now inviting you

409
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,300
to be the leader of SP Team One.

410
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,340
I’d like to bring everyone back

411
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,380

412

Them?

413
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,820
The former teammates.

414
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,740
Our friends.

415
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,100
I mean it.

416
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,780
I’m not drunk.

417
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,060
I have to form Team One

418
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,900
and make it the best out
of the circle.

419
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,540
Baona, you have to help me with this.

420
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,060
I’m not against with this idea.

421
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,380
But I disagree with the people
you are signing.

422
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,820
Except for Lin Yin and Fu Yiwen,

423
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,980
the rest aren’t qualified at all.

424
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,980
There are even two retired players.

425
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,820
Solo.

426
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,580
What are you thinking exactly?

427
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,420
I have faith in them.

428
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,580
I can personally lead the team.

429
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,620
I can be the coach

430
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,580
as well as the leader.

431
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,300
You can’t.

432
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,660
You are the head of SP Chinese Zone.

433
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,540
There are a dozen teams involved.

434
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,420
Male and female teams.

435
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,980
They all see you as the mainstay,

436
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,980
the chief commander.

437
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,980
You don’t have extra energy.

438
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,420
You aren’t allowed

439
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,660
to focus on just one team.

440
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,260
Solo.

441
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,060
You care for your former teammates.

442
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,180
I can understand that.

443
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,420
But you’re shouldered
with huge responsibilities.

444
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,580
Keep that in mind.

445
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,940
You don’t belong to yourself.

446
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,420
You don’t belong to any team.

447
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,940
You belong to SP.

448
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,420
What if I can find the best leader?

449
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,300
Someone who can multitask.

450
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,220
Sure.

451
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,500
If you can,

452
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,940
I’ll sign with you to form Team One.

453
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,060
But,

454
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,940
this person needs to be
as good as you.

455
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,580
Or I won’t sign.

456
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,180
Ai Qing.

457
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,420
Ai Qing.

458
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,700
Who?

459
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,580
That’s right.

460
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,540
I want to invite Ai Qing back.

461
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,580
She’s as good as me, right?

462
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,060
If you can do that,

463
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,820
I’ll sign.

464
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,060
Do what you say.

465
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
It’s a deal.

466
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,700
You are always by yourself.

467
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,700
I know you can be good

468
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,180
in any industry.

469
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,060
But what you really love

470
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,980
is here.

471
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,940
Not everybody has a chance

472
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,300
to do the things
that one loves as a job.

473
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,820
I am lucky to do so.

474
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,580
I hope that you are, too.

475
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,260
How are you sure that I still love it

476
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,940
or I’m still good at it?

477
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,980
Do you feel pity

478
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,300
that you didn’t attend
the world championship?

479
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,460
I do.

480
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,540
But everyone has regrets.

481
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,540
Maybe not in this,

482
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,100
but definitely somewhere else.

483
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,540
After all these years,

484
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,380
you’ve become more eloquent.

485
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,940
If you come to SP,

486
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,980
from now on,

487
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,100
you’ll be Ou Qiang’s leader.

488
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,700
You’ll take care of his daily life,

489
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,820
arranging his schedule,
competitions and training.

492
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,300
Some people are filled

493
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,260
with dreams and energy for life.

494
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,260
But they never win the world champion,

495
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,940
nor the grand slam.

496
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,580
They never give up until put
on the national flag

497
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,820
for the thing they love.

498

I’ll wait for you for a week.

Okay.

509

I’ll get back to you

00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,540

I’ll wait for you.

513
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,540
I never mention that Han Shangyan

514
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,980
is my cousin.

515
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,300
Sorry.

516
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,060
I’m afraid that...

517
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,220
I know how heart-broken you were

518
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,580
when your team dissolved.

519
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,860
So it’s hard to talk about it.

520
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,540
How come you’re back
from Suzhou so soon?

521
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,660
Why don’t you stay there
and have fun?

522
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,580
My premiere is next week.

523
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,260
It’s the first time for me
to be the leading actress.

524
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,460
You have to come.

525
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,180
Bring a handsome guy

526
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,580
to cheer me up.

527
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,620
Why are you in a daze?

528
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,940
What’s wrong?

529
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,900
What happened?

530
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,420
Solo offered me
to be the leader of SP,

531
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,900
the leader of Ou Qiang.

532
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,500
Did you take it?

533
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,620
Not yet.

534
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,820
I’m still thinking about it.

535
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,980
You want to go, right?

536
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,580
You said it on the day you got drunk.

537
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,900
You want to go back.

538
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,660
I always know that you want
to go back to the circle.

539
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,860
You want to win.

540
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,300
So,

541
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,780
don’t try to hide your thoughts.

542
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,260
Don’t depress yourself.

543
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,740
You see.

544
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,020
You want to go back.

545
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,180
Now the biggest club in the country SP

546
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,660
is waving.

547
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,980
Though I don’t understand the circle.

548
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,500
You’ve told me that joining SP

549
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,740
is a dream for many people,

550
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,580
including you.

551
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,180
But Solo is the boss
of Chinese Zone.

552
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,740
Are you afraid that people may gossip?

553
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,700
It’s like

554
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,740
I want to think beforehand

555
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,180
about how to deal with the gossips.

556
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,140
Do you still have

557
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,620
feelings for him?

558
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:14,940
No.

559
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,620
Not at all.

560
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,620
Yeah.

561
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,820
Then just treat him like an old friend.

562
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,780
Since there’s nothing between you two,

563
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,020
just let people say whatever they want.

564
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,020
It’s the most important to be yourself.

565
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,940
I need to think about it.

566
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,900
You’re killing me with your hesitation.

567
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,460
Why don’t you talk to Slide?

568
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,180
He’s known you for the longest.

569
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,580
Talk to him and ask for his opinions.

570
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,140
You come to my store every day.

571
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,660
It’s misleading for my parents

572
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,420
that they think I have a girlfriend.

573
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,420
Nonsense.

574
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,060
I’m just here to play some games.

575
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,540
What’s more.

576
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,940
Mr. Zhou watched me grow up.

577
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,380
He wouldn’t think of me that way.

578
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,860
(New Model)

579
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,260
That makes sense.

580
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,700
Who’d know

581
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,780
the former goddess of robot fighting

582
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,820
comes here

583
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,340
to play games every day.

584
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,220
I saw a gossip online

585
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,300
saying the activity was quite big.

586
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,700
Many people showed up, right?

587
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,780
You are being weird.

588
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,700
Forget it.

589
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,340
You were being difficult, okay?

590
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,220
You already saw the gossip online.

591
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,060
You’d know that I went there that day.

592
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,860
You’d know many things

593
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,580
happened that day.

594
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,580
I know.

595
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,620
I even downloaded the video

596
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,140
made for the Solo Team.

597
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,700
I thought it’d be useful

598
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,140
for the store’s publicity

599
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,740
one day.

600
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,900
Think about it.

601
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,700
The former best female operator

602
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,740
is waitressing

603
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,180
in my store.

604
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,700
People may flood in.

605
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,220
(New Model)

606
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,980
(Chinese Robot Fighting League
National Finals)

607
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
The Solo Team

608
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,340
used to be called Team One.

609
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,140
The players were very good.

610
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,860
Kid,

611
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,620
you know the Solo Team as well?

612
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,220
-We do.
-Of course.

613
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,180
Online people say

614
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,780
that the best three players were

615
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,060
Solo, Han Shangyan and Ai Qing.

616
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,860
Yeah. I heard that, too.

617
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,540
They were really cool.

618
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,100
Son, let’s go.

619
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,180
Coming. See you.

620
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,340
See you. Welcome again.

621
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,380
Did you hear that?

622
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,180
Solo invited me to join SP.

623
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,820
What do you think?

624
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,900
Do it.

625
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,700
Why would you hesitate?

626
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,300
I think you should go back earlier.

627
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,340
But I...

628
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,460
I heard that Wu Bai is in K&K.

629
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,660
Do you want to join K&K?

630
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,020
K&K is newly founded.

631
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,660
It’s not the best choice.

632
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,500
If you’re close enough with Wu Bai.

633
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,740
It’s not so hard to join them.

634
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,100
But I’d recommend SP.

635
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,140
Slide.

636
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,660
Actually,

637
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,540
I’ve been wanting to ask you a question.

638
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,060
Sure.

639
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,860
Why did you retire?

640
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,140
My God.

641
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,020
I’ve told you a million times.

642
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,060
When I was in Germany,

643
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,980
both the living and food

644
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,540
weren’t satisfying, right?

645
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,420
They’ve got nothing but burgers.

646
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,020
Our country is better.

647
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,620
I just retired earlier

648
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,780
to come back and enjoy the life
in my homeland.

649
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,900
Tell me the truth.

650
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,260
I got a fight in Germany

651
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,620
which injured my arm.

652
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,260
Then I retired.

653
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,820
How did it happen?

654
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,420
The team had different opinions.

655
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,940
The German players
have been looking down on me.

656
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,460
We lost one time

657
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,980
and we were all drunk,

658
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,740
so...

659
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,780
Does it hurt?

660
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,500
Can you still play using this hand?

661
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,180
Yes. It doesn’t affect anything.

662
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,260
Besides,

663
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,140
I never stop exercising.

664
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,460
Don’t be like this.

665
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,860
I’ve told you

666
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,300
it doesn’t affect anything.

667
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,380
Except that

668
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,740
it looks bad.

669
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,820
Can you tell me honestly

670
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,740
if you want to continue to play?

671
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,420
We were talking about you.

672
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,340
Why are we talking about me?

673
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,420
Answer me.

674
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,220
I do.

675
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,740
I wish for that.

676
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,220
Hello?

677
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,380
Hello, Solo.

678
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,740
Ai Qing.

679
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,340
I made my decision.

680
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,900
There’s something I want to tell you.

681
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,260
Okay, I’m listening.

682
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,700
I agree to join in SP

683
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,180
to be the leader.

684
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,460
I’d also like to recommend you

685
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,220
someone as the leader.

686
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,020
He’s got rich experience.

687
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,420
He’s also a good machinist.

688
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,340
I believe

689
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,540
him joining us

690
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,540
would be a great help to the team.

691
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,140
Are you recommending Slide?

692
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,580
How do you know?

693
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,460
In fact,

694
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,220
he’s on our list, too.

695
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,700
Ai Qing.

696
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,740
I’m really glad that you’re coming.

697
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,580
Thank you.

698
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,380
Right after I made this decision,

699
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,500
I can hear the sound of my heart breaks.

700
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,860
Because,

701
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,540
Wu Bai and I are missing each other.

702
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,500
Wu Bai,

703
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,700
the guy who shines so bright,

704
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,580
the guy who’s in the opposite team.

705
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,740
No matter how much I like him,

706
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,980
I can’t hold him back
from chasing his dream.

707
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,820
(Competitive Robot Fighting)

708
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,620
Are you teenagers?
Don’t worry about who should go.

709
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,700
It’s just a conference.

710
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,260
The team has already signed up.

711
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,940
Let’s go and destroy them all.

712
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,340
Really?

713
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,580
Thank you, boss.

714
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,860
Where did we get the money?

715
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,340
Yeah.

716
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,540
Lottery?

717
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,020
It has cost me a lot.

718
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,100
But,

719
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,820
for the long-term growth of our team,

720
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,900
the team starts

721
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,740
to increase income and cut spending.

722
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,180
We only eat vegetables now.

723
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,500
Come on, eat.

724
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,100
No meat?

725
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,460
Jing, time for dinner.

726
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,980
What happened, girl?

727
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,500
Wake up.

728
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,300
Let’s eat

729
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,820
while it’s warm.

730
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,100
Your favorite tomato.

731
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,100
Here, tomato.

732
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,140
Here’s the egg you like.

733
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,620
Not bad, right?

734
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,140
Yum.

735
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Dad,

736
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,260
I’m quitting.

737
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,740
Your job is fine.

738
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,500
Why’d you quit?

739
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,500
Do you remember

740
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,700
Solo?

741
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,340
Your puppy love boyfriend.

742
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,940
Dad, stop joking.

743
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,340
Alright. Your ex-boyfriend. Here.

744
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,780
He used to play
at a robot fighting club.

745
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,260
After retiring the year before last,

746
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,980
he became the head of the Chinese Zone.

747
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,220
That’s great.

748
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,420
He used to be poor.

749
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,740
He offered me to be the leader

750
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,100
to lead the team and compete.

751
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,460
As long as you’ve thought it through,

752
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,980
then go.

753
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,820
Why are you agreeing so fast?

754
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,140
Why not?

755
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,700
Dad, are you not against it?

756
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,540
Why should I be against it?

757
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,100
You’ve all grown up.

758
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,140
I don’t want to meddle in

759
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,940
your work.

760
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,980
Don’t you worry that I may fail

761
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,780
and be unemployed?

762
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,020
Don’t be afraid.

763
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,140
Just do it. Don’t hesitate.

764
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,580
Worst comes to worst,

765
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,340
I’ll support you.

766
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,980
Thank you, dad.

767
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,020
Girl, remember.

768
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,540
I’ll always stand firm behind you.

769
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,980
You should thank me, too.

770
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,580
I’ve tried hard to make
some money these years.

771
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,540
It’ll be enough

772
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,620
to cover the monthly payment.

773
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,940
Be fully concentrated on it.

774
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,740
I’ll take care of the family.

775
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,540
This is your sister’s private money.

776
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,860
Maybe I should keep it for you first?

777
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,540
Thank you, dad.

778
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,940
Thank you, Jing.

779
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,140
Come on. Don’t be emotional.

780
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,100
I can’t deal with it.

781
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,580
Your sister can’t stand you
being emotional.

782
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,300
Probably

783
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,100
she’ll hand out another bank card.

784
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,500
Jing, do you have another one?

785
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,220
No. I don’t.

786
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,060
Okay, as long as you are happy

787
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,340
and well.

788
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,860
I’m happy.

789
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,220
Let’s eat.

790
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,420
-Okay?
-Eat.

791
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,100
Come on.

792
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,740
Braised pork. It melts in the mouth.

793
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,540
You can’t eat it if you want
to lose weight.

794
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,540
You’ll get fat eating it at night.

795
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,980
I’m too thin to lose weight.

796
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,500
You’ve put on some weight recently.

797
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,140
My daughter is so pretty.

798
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,580
She won’t be single forever.

799
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,500
Besides,

800
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,300
your grandmother is planning

801
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,420
to set you up with blind dates.

802
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,940
Blind date?
