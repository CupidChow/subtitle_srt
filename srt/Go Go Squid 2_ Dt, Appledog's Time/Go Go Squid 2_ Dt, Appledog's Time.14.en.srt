=Episode 14=

19
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,220
Is this your uncle?

20
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,140
No, I’m not.

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,340
I’m not their relative.

22
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,940
I’m here for the blind date.

23
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,340
Blind date?

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,700
Then you’re here for
the same reason as Bai.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,860
Let’s do the blind date together.

26
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,020
This is my first time

27
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,660
doing a group date.

28
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,860
And this is also
a participant of the date?

29
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,860
No. No.

30
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,540
It’s not even human.

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,820
It doesn’t need to date.

32
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,020
That’s obvious.

33
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,540
Where’s Ai Jing?

34
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,740
She bailed.

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,900
What should we do?

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900
How can I know?

37
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,540
You found these people.
You should take care of them yourself.

38
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,660
I...

39
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,380
Well.

40
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,020
How old are you?

41
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,460
I’m 35 years old... 35.

42
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,140
35?

43
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,380
You’re ten years older

44
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,620
than my Bai.

45
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,540
I’m not significantly older, right?

46
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,940
Of course not.

47
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,620
You’re not young any more.

48
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,100
You’re now in your thirties.

49
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,980
Oh. Are you healthy?

50
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,620
Yes, I am.

51
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,460
Expert researches show that

52
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,060
the risk of chronic diseases for

53
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,780
men above 35 years old

54
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,540
will rise to 20.9 percent.

55
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,300
You must take care of your health.

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,580
Do more exercise.

57
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,940
Yes. You’re right.

58
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,100
Come. Take this.

59
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,460
Advertisement said that

60
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,300
this is particularly good for

61
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,620
people like you who’re turning 40.

62
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,100
Come. Take it.

63
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,940
No. I don’t need
nutrition supplement now.

64
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,740
I don’t need it.

65
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,860
This is a gift from me.

66
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,940
Take it. Come.

67
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,660
Thank you.

68
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,220
Thank you, sir.

69
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,300
Oh.

70
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,580
What do you do for a living?

71
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,580
I run my own company.

72
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,780
You’re young and successful.

73
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,300
My Bai isn’t as good as you’re.

74
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,220
But he’s determined.

75
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,660
He puts all his mind on robots.

76
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,820
But, at least,

77
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,580
he shares the same interest

78
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,220
with Ai Qing.

79
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,740
Oh.

80
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,860
How much do you earn a month?

81
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,500
Not too much.

82
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,820
I earn around a million every year.

83
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,220
I have two houses in Shanghai.

84
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,380
I bought them in full.

85
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,860
Not bad.

86
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,860
Without having to worry about houses,

87
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,300
youngsters’ stress
will be greatly relieved.

88
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,380
So,

89
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,380
I plan to prepare a house
for my wife and myself.

90
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,660
My father-in-law can live in
the other house.

91
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,300
My mom and my dad have their own house.

92
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,100
Great.

93
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,180
You have the traditional qualities

94
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,460
of a man from Shandong province.

95
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,380
You treat your parents so well.

96
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,380
Thank you, sir.

97
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,220
Oh.

98
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,860
On my way here,

99
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,380
I find the neighborhood

100
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,300
has the style of the old Shanghai.

101
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,060
Yes.

102
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,940
If Bai and his wife

103
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,820
love this place,

104
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,780
I can buy them

105
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,900
an old villa.

106
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,220
Old villas are very rare in Shanghai.

107
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,900
My grandson is rare too.

108
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,860
If he and his wife love it,

109
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,620
I’m willing to buy them one.

110
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,260
Sir, let me pour you more tea.

111
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,780
That’s enough. Come.

112
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,500
Thank you.

113
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,340
You only drink water?

114
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,900
Water tastes good.

115
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,340
Shen Zhe, what are you doing?

116
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,020
Now, you mustn’t answer any calls.

117
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,460
Let’s find a place

118
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,180
and get things straight.

119
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,300
I don’t want to talk to you.

120
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,220
Shen Zhe, good for you.

121
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,300
How dare you lay your hands on me?

122
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,740
You mustn’t accuse me
of the things I didn’t do.

123
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,500
When did I lay my hands on you?

124
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,340
Can’t you remember the way

125
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,060
you forced me to get into the car?

126
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,620
Do you know what
your behavior makes you?

127
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,180
A bandit.

128
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,620
You’re laughing?

129
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,620
Why are you laughing?

130
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,420
You’re a bandit. A bandit.

131
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,900
Fine.

132
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,940
I’m a bandit, okay.

133
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,700
Listen.

134
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,780
I’ll now take you home and

135
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,900
make you a bandit’s wife.

136
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,780
Cut your nonsense.

137
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,060
Drive carefully.

138
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,500
Where are you taking me to?

139
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,660
Don’t mind it.

140
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,780
You’ll know when we get there.

141
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,940
Stop cutting around the bushes. Tell me.

142
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,020
No.

143
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,620
Don’t be so anxious.

144
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,620
I’ve told you.
You’ll know when we get there.

145
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,580
Come here more often.

146
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,260
You’re welcomed to come by.

147
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,380
Of course.

148
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,020
Our families must be closer.

149
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,980
Well.

150
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,740
That’s not up to us.

151
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,140
It’s up to the kids.

152
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,220
Ai Qing.

153
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
Grandpa.

154
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,340
Come.

155
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,500
You must get along well.

156
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,380
Don’t get into fights.

157
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
Okay. Okay.

158
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,860
You’ll have plenty of time.

159
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,580
Oh.

160
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,860
We’ll leave now.

161
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,060
Okay. Be careful on your way home.

162
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,820
Goodbye.

163
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,340
Okay.

164
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,620
Bai, take care of Grandpa.

165
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,540
Bye, Grandpa.

166
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,340
Bye.

167
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,180
-Goodbye, sir.
-Bye, Grandpa.

168
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,100
Goodbye.

169
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,820
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

170
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,100
Let’s go.

171
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,860
Grandpa, why did you come here?

172
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,500
I think your relationship
isn’t going too well.

173
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,860
I’m here to help you.

174
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,860
Grandpa, thank you.

175
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,300
I’m not bragging.

176
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,620
The relationship between
your cousin, Han Shangyan, and Nian

177
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,900
could go smoothly all because

178
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,980
I’m friends with Tong family.

179
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,940
Grandpa, you’re the best.

180
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,300
This time, my assistance

181
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,420
is perfect.

182
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,140
Let’s go home, Grandpa.

183
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,900
No. No.

184
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,820
We don’t get to hang out very often.

185
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,620
Take me to your club.

186
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,900
Aren’t you tired?

187
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,300
I’m not.

188
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,500
I’ve always wanted to

189
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,260
see the club

190
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,660
you and your cousin run.

191
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,540
Okay. Let’s go.

192
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,940
Let’s go.

193
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,020
Here.

194
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,620
This is our club.

195
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,300
It’s so gorgeous.

196
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,340
Captain.

197
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,060
Grandpa, why are you here?

198
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,540
Grandpa wants
to take a look at our club.

199
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,980
So I took him here.

200
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,500
Grandpa, long time no see.
Do you still remember me?

201
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,540
I’m 97.

202
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,820
Of course, I remember you.

203
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,660
Why don’t you

204
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,700
visit me?

205
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,940
The training schedule is too busy.

206
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,700
Next time when I’m not occupied,

207
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,780
I’ll ask Captain to take me to see you.

208
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,980
Good kid.

209
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,260
Captain, you’re back.

210
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,460
This is...?

211
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,740
This is captain’s grandpa.

212
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,140
And also our boss’s grandfather.

213
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,420
Grandpa.

214
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,260
Or should I say grandfather?

215
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,860
It’s fine.

216
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,740
You’re both

217
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,220
Bai’s close friends.

218
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,540
You can call me the way Bai does.

219
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,380
Okay, Grandpa.

220
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,540
I’ll answer this call.

221
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:07,900
Hello.

222
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,900
This place is so pretty.

223
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,460
Grandpa.

224
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,540
This is our boss’s office.

225
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,460
-This one
-Yes.

226
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,620
is Han Shangyan’s office.

227
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
The headquarter just
asked for a phone meeting.

228
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,820
Can you take care of Grandpa for me?

229
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,740
-Okay.
-Don’t worry.

230
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,260
We’ll take good care of Grandpa.

231
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,460
Grandpa, let’s go take some rest.

232
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,540
Wait a second.

233
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,100
What is this?

234
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,900
This?

235
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,060
This is our captain’s robot.

236
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,260
It’s called Nobody.

237
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,500
What?

238
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,620
Bai’s robot is called Wu Liao.

239
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,660
Grandpa, Wu Liao is

240
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,940
a home service robot.

241
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,180
This is a combat robot.

242
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,940
Wait a second.

243
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,420
I’m more confused after hearing this.

244
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,620
It’s fine, Grandpa.

245
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,140
This one is

246
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,100
a robot he used years ago.

247
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,940
How about this, Grandpa?

248
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,500
I’ll show you

249
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,820
the robot we’re currently using.

250
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,140
Okay.

251
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,780
This robot is

252
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,420
the one Wu Bai currently uses.

253
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,780
It’s called The Nobody.

254
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,180
This is the place

255
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,780
where we repair and upgrade our robots.

256
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,460
You spent so much effort into

257
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,100
making this robot.

258
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,260
And when it goes into combat,

259
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,340
it’s destroyed so easily.

260
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,140
What’s the point of that?

261
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,340
It’s exciting.

262
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,460
The short 3-minute mecha fight
decides the winner.

263
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,020
That’s the romance for men.

264
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,020
Grandpa,

265
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,660
let me show you the training area.

266
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,460
That place is quite fun.

267
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,300
Here. This way.

268
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,860
Yes.

269
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,220
Grandpa,

270
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,900
this is the main battlefield
for Wu Bai and Shen Zhe.

271
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,860
In their daily life,

272
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,980
they do hundreds and thousands
of operation training here.

273
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,060
So they can cultivate muscle memory.

274
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,220
I think Captain has now

275
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,380
become part of his robot.

276
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,060
Don’t you feel tired?

277
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,340
Grandpa, we do this line of work

278
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,500
out of pure passion.

279
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,860
We don’t feel tired because we love it.

280
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,500
Yes, Grandpa.

281
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,300
We see a robot

282
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,900
born from our hands,

283
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,980
start from scratch,

284
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,380
defeat the rivals on its journey.

285
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,500
It’s all worth it

286
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,020
when we win the championship.

287
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,580
I see.

288
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,140
What you do is meaningful.

289
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,300
You turn your hobby into a profession.

290
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,100
Well done.

291
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,020
Grandpa, you know us well.

292
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,180
Grandpa,

293
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,060
do you want to try it yourself?

294
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,300
No. No.

295
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,420
If I break it,

296
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,380
you’ll have a lot of work to do.

297
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,620
Well.

298
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,900
Let’s use one we’re not afraid to break.

299
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,780
Start.

300
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,820
Grandpa, is this really
the first time you play it?

301
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,060
I’m no match for you.

302
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,940
Even Captain can’t beat you.

303
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,460
Amazing. Well done.

304
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,860
Grandpa, you’re so gifted.

305
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,260
You won again.

306
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,500
-Amazing.
-Come, 97.

307
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,860
Let’s play another round.

308
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,180
Captain.

309
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Grandpa,

310
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,820
they’re tired after today’s training.

311
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,860
-How about we play it next time?
-Tired?

312
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,820
Are you tired?

313
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,380
No, we’re not.

314
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,060
-Come. Hurry up.
-Come on.

315
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,700
Come on, 97.

316
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,780
Good job.

317
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,860
I can’t beat you.

318
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,180
You’re such a loser.

319
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,220
97, what’s wrong with you?

320
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,780
This weather is not ideal.

321
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,660
What?

322
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,180
(Fortune)

323
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,020
You didn’t check the weather report

324
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,180
before a romantic firework show?

325
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,980
Nothing works out.

326
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,780
This is the will of god.

327
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,380
Since we’re already here,

328
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,860
let’s drink.

329
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,860
Drinking isn’t fun enough.

330
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,500
Let’s play a game.

331
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,020
Okay.

332
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,980
The game’s name is
“I Never”.

333
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,820
I’ve never played this game.

334
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,460
I’ll say a thing

335
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,220
I’ve never done before.

336
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,380
If you’ve done it, you lose.

337
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,580
If you’ve never done it,

338
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,460
I lose. Then I’ll drink.

339
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,300
Okay.

340
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,020
This is interesting. Come on.

341
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,700
But you’ll drive.

342
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,300
Can you drink?

343
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,420
It’s fine. I’ll call driving service.

344
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,780
Start from you.

345
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,860
Okay, I’ll go first.

346
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,140
Never have I ever

347
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,100
had long hair like yours.

348
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,660
Drink.

349
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,700
It’s your turn.

350
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,860
Never have I ever
driven a car like you do.

351
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,540
You don’t know how to drive?

352
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,940
No way. You’re a grown man now.

353
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,060
How could you not know how to drive?

354
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,500
Why must I?

355
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,060
My sister and I have
poor senses of directions.

356
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,380
We can’t tell North and South
when we go out.

357
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,180
How can we drive?

358
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,540
Don’t you have navigation?

359
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,060
Use navigation.

360
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,260
Cheers.

361
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,180
It’s your turn.

362
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,420
Never have I ever

363
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,340
brought female friends to see firework.

364
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,060
Me neither.

365
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,620
Cheers.

366
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,180
I...

367
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,140
Never have I ever
confessed my love to anyone.

368
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,660
Me neither.

369
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,500
Isn’t this my turn?

370
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,100
Did you lose on purpose?

371
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,740
Never have I ever loved

372
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,020
a girl

373
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,340
the way I love you.

374
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,820
I’ve won, right?

375
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,620
Shen Zhe, you lost.

376
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,500
Listen carefully.

377
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,940
I’ll only say it once.

378
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,460
Never have I ever

379
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,220
loved a man the way I love you.

380
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,060
I think this is the god’s will.

381
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,220
Thank you.

382
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,180
You’re welcome.

383
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,820
I’m with your mom at the cafe.

384
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,340
Your mom asked you to come.

385
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,500
I’m afraid I can’t return your car now.

386
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,820
Come with me.

387
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,660
Where are you going? It’s so late.

388
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,060
To a cafe.

389
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,980
Xing Zhouzhou is messing around again.

390
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,980
Help me.

391
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,580
Zhouzhou,

392
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,620
Shen Zhe is only

393
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,180
throwing a tantrum.

394
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,820
Don’t mind it.

395
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,980
Mom.

396
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,900
I’m not throwing a tantrum with her.

397
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,580
Don’t make it worse.

398
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,940
Xing Zhouzhou,

399
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,220
stop pretending.

400
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,660
My mom’s health isn’t good.

401
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,940
You’re tormenting her

402
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,580
by dragging her here
during the Spring Festival.

403
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,820
What on earth do you want?

404
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,980
Can’t you talk nicely?

405
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,860
Zhouzhou is fulfilling her filial duty.

406
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,700
She invited me here for a short trip.

407
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,820
She paid for my plane tickets.

408
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,060
Why can’t you be reasonable?

409
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,420
Mom.

410
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,820
We broke up a long time ago.

411
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,700
We broke up last year.

412
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,140
I...

413
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,300
Go ahead.

414
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,780
Shen Zhe, I don’t want to
break up with you.

415
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,460
Xing Zhouzhou,

416
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,180
let me remind you one more time.

417
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,540
You’re the one who dumped me, right?

418
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,380
I have a girlfriend now.

419
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,460
Do you understand?

420
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,420
I have a girlfriend.

421
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,700
Be nice.

422
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,860
Since I’m already here,

423
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,740
let’s hang out this Spring Festival.

424
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,940
Okay?

425
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,060
You can enjoy your trip.

426
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,340
You’d better exclude me.

427
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,900
-My head is dizzy.
-Ma’am, are you all right?

428
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,860
Mom.

429
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,060
Has your blood pressure gone up again?

430
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Tell me about it.

431
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,660
The years I spent raising my son

432
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,460
have gone to waste.

433
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,940
He fails to fulfill his filial duty.

434
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,900
And he always gets on my nerves.

435
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,980
I raised him up for nothing.

436
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,420
Go. Go away.

437
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,260
I know you don’t care about me.

438
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,020
My life is so miserable.

439
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,780
Fine.

440
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,380
Tomorrow,

441
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,820
Ai Jing and I will

442
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,420
take you around.

443
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,340
I don’t know this Ai Jing.

444
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,940
I want Zhouzhou to accompany me.

445
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,140
Mom, I’m begging you.

446
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,100
I’m begging you.

447
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,060
Stop meddling in my relationships.

448
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,460
No, you’re my son.

449
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,340
I’m your mom.

450
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,820
You have to do whatever I tell you to.

451
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,420
It’s a deal.

452
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,140
Come here earlier tomorrow morning

453
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,740
to pick us up for the tour.

454
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,140
Okay.

455
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,820
Goodbye, Ma’am.

456
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,700
Zhouzhou, don’t worry.

457
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,220
I’m on your side.

458
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,140
Thanks.

459
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,380
She even persuaded my mom
to help her this time.

460
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,700
Calm down.

461
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,180
Let’s figure out a way.

462
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,940
I don’t know how to deal with her.

463
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,660
But you have to try.

464
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
What if she directly goes to

465
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,620
Ai Jing one day?

466
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,500
Ai Jing.

467
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,500
What else can I do?

468
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,820
I have to please my mom first.

469
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,860
Wu Bai.

470
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,620
I’m sorry.

471
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,500
I’m sorry. I have something emergent.

472
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,020
I can’t hang out with you today.

473
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,660
Liar.

474
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,780
Haven’t you said that
you have a date today?

475
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,300
He said he can’t come.

476
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,660
(He took his mom and me
to the Bund today.)

477
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,740
(If you don’t trust me,
I can text you the address.)

478
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,860
What’s wrong with you?

479
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,660
He took his mom and me
to the Bund today.

480
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,140
If you don’t trust me,

481
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,660
I can text you the address.

482
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,060
Where are you going?

483
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,380
To see a drama.

484
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,180
Hello, Ai Jing.

485
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,220
Where are you?

486
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,300
I’m

487
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,460
with my mom.

488
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,980
She suddenly came to Shanghai.

489
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,580
Why didn’t you tell me yesterday?

490
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,740
I... I forgot.

491
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,140
Just you and your mom?

492
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,540
Anyway, I’ll go see you
once I send her home.

493
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,820
I’m sorry for not being with you today.

494
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,740
I’ll make it up to you, okay?

495
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,780
Shen Zhe, are you lying to me?

496
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,380
No, how could I lie to you?

497
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,660
How dare I?

498
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,420
Okay, I’ll give you one more chance.

499
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,740
Think carefully for 30 seconds.

500
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,700
30 seconds is unnecessary.

501
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
I can answer you right away.

502
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,220
I’m telling you the truth.

503
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,540
Okay.

504
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,100
Turn around.

505
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,100
Turn around.

506
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,900
Ma’am, seagulls.

507
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,980
Ai Jing.

508
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,740
Are you surprised?

509
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,300
Yes, I am.

510
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,140
Keep acting.

511
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,660
Xing Zhouzhou,

512
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,660
she has just arrived a minute earlier.

513
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,940
Keep acting.

514
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,140
Listen.

515
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,620
My taxi is still running its meter.

516
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,620
Can you be more sensible?

517
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,140
Don’t waste my money.

518
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,380
I want to tell you.

519
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,700
But you reacted so dramatically

520
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,180
last time I told you.

521
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,780
I was afraid that you’ll be mad at me.

522
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,380
So I didn’t tell you.

523
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,500
She tricked my mom here.

524
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,980
I don’t know what else I can do.

525
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,700
You’re really good at acting.

526
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,860
Actually,

527
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,740
I want to hang out with you today.

528
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,500
So I bought these tickets
to the scenic spots.

529
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,060
I spent so much money on these.

530
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,380
Throwing them away is pitiful.

531
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,900
You can have them all.

532
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,100
What are you doing?

533
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,780
We can use them next time.

534
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,860
No need.

535
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,700
In the end, we’ve once dated.

536
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,220
This is our break-up fee.

537
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,780
Ai Jing. Ai Jing.

538
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Shen Zhe.

539
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,620
Shen Zhe, come take a photo.

540
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,580
You did this,

541
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,740
right?

542
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,020
So you don’t want to see me happy.

543
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,140
Right?

544
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,580
I want her to give up.

545
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,700
She’s my girlfriend.

546
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,500
Why does she have to give up?

547
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,700
What does she have to give up?

548
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,980
Give me another chance, please.

549
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,180
I want to make it up to you.

550
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,820
Xing Zhouzhou,

551
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,980
we’ve broken up.

552
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,620
Can’t we just go on

553
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,260
our different paths?

554
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,780
You have your life. I have mine.

555
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,140
And I beg you.

556
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,780
Stop going after Ai Jing.

557
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,140
What did she do wrong?

558
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,580
She’s just in a relationship with me.

559
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,100
Do you have to torture her like this?

560
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,740
But I don’t want to let you go.

561
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,260
Shen Zhe,

562
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,700
let’s try this.

563
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,020
Let’s try to go back to our old time.

564
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,060
We were so happy together in the past.

565
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Shen Zhe.

566
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,420
Shen Zhe.

567
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,860
Shen Zhe, where are you going?

568
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,140
It’s fine, Ma’am.

569
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,700
Let’s take photos.

570
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,820
Come on.

571
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,340
It’s fine.

572
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,180
Why do you have so many food
on the desk?

573
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
You broke up?

574
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,980
We broke up.

575
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,380
Again?

576
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,500
It’s about that girl.

577
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
I bought tickets to scenic spots today.

578
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,100
I wanted to hang out with Shen Zhe.

579
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,740
But his mom came.

580
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,100
And he took her mom
and that girl on a tour.

581
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,860
That girl.

582
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,820
Which girl?

583
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,220
His ex-girlfriend.

584
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,860
Oh.

585
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,220
I forgot to tell you.

586
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,380
Anyway, he lied to me.

587
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,260
Your relationship is so messy.

588
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,980
Let me think it through.

589
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,220
You got into a fight
before the Spring Festival.

590
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,580
Then you got back together.

591
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,220
Your relationship was going well
on the first day of lunar year.

592
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,620
You argued again two days later.

593
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,740
Then you got back together very soon.

594
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,180
What date is it today?

595
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,500
You’re arguing again?

596
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,020
Don’t even start it.

597
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,940
Drink with me.

598
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,860
Okay.

599
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
You.

600
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,980
Tell me your sad stories.

601
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,540
The saddest story, please.

602
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,260
I’m happy every day.

603
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,700
I don’t have any sad stories.

604
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,980
No way.

605
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,740
Last time,

606
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,220
you turned Wu Bai down,

607
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,980
you held on to the globe
and cried and screamed.

608
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,860
I couldn’t take the globe away from you.

609
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,580
Tell me that story.

610
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,980
Tell me.

611
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,980
Are you really my bigger sister?

612
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,980
I’m already so miserable right now.

613
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,140
Why can’t you tell me that story?

614
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,780
Are you really my younger sister?

615
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,220
Fine. Fine. I’ll drink with you.

616
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,620
How about this?

617
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,820
I’ll ask someone
to beat Shen Zhe for you.

618
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,740
No.

619
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,300
You see?

620
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,220
You still care about him.

621
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,500
I want to stab him. Stab him. Stab him.

622
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,740
Give it to me. Stop wasting food.

623
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,340
He’s been beating the sand bag
for an hour.

624
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,700
There’s more.

625
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,860
He also ran an hour on the treadmill.

626
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Captain.

627
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,340
What happened to him?

628
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,140
Xing Zhouzhou

629
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,580
tricked his mom into coming to Shanghai.

630
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,820
No way.

631
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,420
Good for Xing Zhouzhou.

632
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,060
Shen Zhe is so poor.

633
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,140
What can we do, Captain?

634
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,140
Whoever hung the bell
on the tiger’s neck must untie it.

635
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,940
Are you suggesting that

636
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,020
we get rid of Xing Zhouzhou?

637
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,420
That’s a bit too excessive.

638
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
No.

639
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,820
What Captain means is that

640
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,380
only Ai Jing

641
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,020
can make Shen Zhe recover.

642
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,700
I see.

643
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,020
But what should we do with Ai Jing?

644
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,420
Ai Qing.

645
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,740
Yes.

646
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,820
Then I should call her
and ask her for help.

647
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,340
Hello, Ai Qing.

648
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,540
Emergency! We need your help right now.

649
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,100
If you don’t come to the rescue,

650
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,060
Shen Zhe will exhaust his body.

651
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,780
Okay, I’ll be there right now.

652
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,780
What did she say?

653
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,820
She agreed.

654
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,580
Thank you, Captain.

655
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,220
Wait a second, Wu Bai.

656
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,180
Fine.

657
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,180
I’m your good brother after all.

658
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,140
Eat the chips.

659
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,140
Straighten your back.

660
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,060
A left hook.

661
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,820
Spin your body. Kick the ground.

662
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,980
Captain.

663
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,580
Your recent strategy is about

664
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,500
achieving your goal stealthily.

665
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,980
Well done.

666
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,900
Thank you.

667
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,220
It’s fine.

668
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,660
You can call me the best wingman.

669
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,740
Okay.

670
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,940
My

671
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,260
sidekick.

672
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,380
Please, don’t call me that.

673
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,740
I prefer wingman,

674
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,140
not sidekick.

675
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,940
They’re the same.

676
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,220
Fine.

677
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,940
Call me wingman.

678
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,980
Okay.

679
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,700
Ai Qing.

680
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,900
Are you okay that
I brought Captain with me?

681
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,700
I’m fine.

682
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Let’s go.

683
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,900
Go inside now.

684
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,300
Go upstairs first.

685
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,820
I’ll order coffee.

686
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,540
How can I let you buy coffee?

687
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,460
I want a Latte. Thank you, Captain.

688
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,540
Everything is fine for me.

689
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,460
Thank you.

690
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,980
Hello.

691
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,420
I want two Latte

692
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,620
and a Toffee Nut Latte.

693
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,820
Toffee Nut Latte?

694
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,500
Sir, we only offer that
during the Christmas season.

695
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,700
The season is over.

696
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,620
My friend really likes it.

697
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,420
Can you please make one for me?

698
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,940
Just one.

699
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,580
Fine. I’ll make you one secretly.

700
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,580
So you can please your girlfriend.

701
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,100
But keep it a secret.

702
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,620
Thank you.

703
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,740
I heard that their coffee tastes good.

704
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,900
Toffee Nut Latte.

705
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,700
Thank you, Captain.

706
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,820
They’re still selling this?

707
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,340
Isn’t this a Christmas special?

708
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,420
I don’t know.

709
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,940
The waitress recommended this to me.

710
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,900
I really like this flavor.

711
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,220
Ai Qing, listen.

712
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,660
Shen Zhe is torturing
himself in the club.

713
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,220
So this is what you want to talk about.

714
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,820
My sister is acting the same way.

715
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,180
She’s so gloomy at home now.

716
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,740
There’s some misunderstanding.

717
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,020
Xing Zhouzhou tricked Shen Zhe’s mom

718
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,860
into coming to Shanghai.

719
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,900
She even got his mom involved this time.

720
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,780
Her power can’t be underestimated.

721
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,540
So, Shen Zhe was forced this time?

722
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,820
My sister didn’t tell me everything.

723
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,980
So I don’t quite know

724
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,300
the whole situation.

725
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,860
Shen Zhe

726
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,980
really cares about your sister.

727
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,540
Yes.

728
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,980
Shen Zhe

729
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,500
is devoted to love.

730
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,140
Actually, everyone from K&K Team

731
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,900
is kind of stubborn in love.

732
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,260
I didn’t expect Shen Zhe

733
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,780
to be a spoony lover.

734
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,660
He’s far from Wu Bai.

735
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,180
Right, Captain?

736
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,940
But we can’t just sit and watch

737
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,260
Shen Zhe continue to act this way.

738
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,820
We need to make a plan to help him,

739
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,900
right?

740
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,940
I think our help group

741
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,620
needs to devise a concrete plan.

742
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,140
Yes.

743
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,220
What should we do?

744
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,340
I have a plan.

745
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,180
Hope to see you again.

746
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,020
It’s snowing.

747
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,420
It’s hard to hail a taxi
in a weather like this.

748
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,940
I’ll go inside to borrow an umbrella.

749
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,340
Captain,

750
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,060
can I borrow your car key?

751
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,820
What do you want my car key for?

752
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,900
It’s hard to find taxi
since it’s snowing.

753
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,220
I suddenly remembered
that a friend is looking for me.

754
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,380
I have to go now.

755
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,300
How about this?

756
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,940
Wait for taxi with Ai Qing.

757
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,300
I’ll go now.

758
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,700
I...

759
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,580
Hello.

760
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,260
It’s snowing outside.

761
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,060
May I borrow an umbrella?

762
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,740
Okay.

763
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,420
Thank you.

764
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,740
I’ll return it to you tomorrow.

765
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,060
Okay.

766
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,740
Thank you.

767
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,940
Is the Toffee Nut good?

768
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,180
Your boyfriend has begged me
so long for that.

769
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,900
He is really nice to you.

770
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,380
Stop being upset.

771
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,900
He cares about you so much.

772
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,580
Thank you.

773
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,740
Have a good day.

774
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,220
Where’s 97?

775
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,180
He needs to meet a friend,

776
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,780
so he took my car.

777
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,540
It seems that
we aren’t getting any taxi.

778
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,300
We have no choice but the bus.

779
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
Let me escort you.

780
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,580
Tell me about Han Shangyan.

781
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,980
What has he been through

782
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,740
these years?

783
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,340
When he retired out of anger,

784
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,980
he was quite downhearted
at the beginning.

785
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,500
I can imagine that.

786
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,820
I was on vacation at that time

787
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,900
So Grandpa asked me to take care of him.

788
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,060
I opened his door.

789
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,180
I saw all the leftovers of take-away

790
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,300
and unwashed dirty laundry.

791
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,380
I told him that

792
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,740
even though he has quit the game,

793
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,140
he doesn’t represent himself alone.

794
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,940
He still represents the whole Solo Team.

795
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,620
His decisions

796
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,980
announced the dismissal of the team.

797
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,820
You might be the only one in the world

798
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,260
who dares to speak to
Han Shangyan like this.

799
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,100
How did he respond?

800
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,900
He said and I quote,

801
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,540
Bai, I don’t want to swear at you now.

802
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,100
I won’t repeat it.

803
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,020
I said I’ll give you ten minutes

804
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,220
to get downstairs.

805
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,540
I need to have the cleaning lady
clean the room,

806
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,580
or there will be mice here.

807
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,700
There is always one person
to conquer another.

808
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,740
He followed your words so obediently?

809
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,260
Well, he had no other options,

810
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,860
because I could tell Grandpa.

811
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,740
What happened next?

812
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,020
He went to a university in Chicago.

813
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,940
We founded the K&K Club

814
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,580
and its China branch this year.

815
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,980
It has not started to profit yet,

816
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,100
but the US branch has

817
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,540
got on track.

818
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,900
So, he is living a relatively good life,

819
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,820
if we put aside the fact

820
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,780
he hasn’t got married until this age.

821
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,020
Thank you for telling me all this.

822
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,820
It’s really

823
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,220
meaningful to me.

824
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,340
Ai Qing,

825
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,620
Han Shangyan wasn’t trapped
in the moment

826
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,700
the team dismissed ten years ago.

827
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,340
Everyone has moved forward.

828
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,060
Are you in a quarrel with her?

829
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,700
When in a quarrel,

830
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,380
the boy should
say sorry to the girl first,

831
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,660
shouldn’t he?

832
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,580
Why aren’t you asleep at this hour?
What are you doing?

833
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,100
I just came back from outside.

834
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,340
All right.

835
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,100
Go ahead and admit your mistake.

836
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,660
Don’t make her sad.

837
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,100
You think I haven’t done that?

838
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
I have apologized.

839
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,820
Did it work?

840
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,220
If apologies work,
what are the police for?

841
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,660
Just tell him that

842
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,420
my sister is so sad that

843
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,300
she’ll get back together with Slide.

844
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,540
But I heard from Ai Qing that

845
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,780
Ai Jing and she are going to see Slide.

846
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,100
Slide?

847
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,900
What’s Slide’s role in this?

848
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,540
Is Slide Ai Jing’s ex-boyfriend?

849
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,100
I want to sleep now.

850
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,900
It’s a long night.

851
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,900
Go to bed early.

852
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,780
No, sit down.

853
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,060
What now?

854
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,020
Tell me everything.

855
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,100
You can’t sleep until
you’ve made things clear.

856
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,340
Love

857
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,140
is the same as glory.

858
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,580
You have to fight for it.

859
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,100
But, I did choose Ai Jing.

860
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,820
Slide.

861
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,180
Ai Jing, get up.

862
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,660
The sun is shining bright now.

863
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,980
Get up.

864
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,300
I’ve got Lovelorn Syndrome.
Leave me alone.

865
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,100
To cheer you up,

866
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,500
I’ve got a little gift for you.

867
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,340
A new phone.

868
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,180
Really?

869
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,740
Don’t lie to me.

870
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,260
I’m not lying.

871
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,500
Get up.

872
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,980
And you’ll see it in ten minutes.

873
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,260
See?

874
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,940
It has arrived in less than ten minutes.

875
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,580
Coming.

876
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,580
You’re really fast.

877
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,100
Of course.

878
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,780
Slide?

879
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,100
You two planned this.

880
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,740
Check it out.

881
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,020
Do you like it?

882
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,060
Are you surprised?

883
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,020
Listen.

884
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,100
I got this from a friend

885
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,260
with ex-factory price.

886
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,060
Try and see if it’s good.

887
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,500
If not, tell me and
I can exchange it for you.

888
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,500
I really don’t understand you two.

889
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,780
Who’s the elder one and
who’s the younger one?

890
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,420
All I see is her taking care of you.

891
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,620
Are you jealous?

892
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,900
I’ll need to study it.

893
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,100
Thanks.

894
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,740
This is what Wu Bai
left behind last time.

895
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,820
I can’t find him recently.

896
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,140
So give it to him for me.

897
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,580
What is it?

898
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,980
God knows. I didn’t open it.
