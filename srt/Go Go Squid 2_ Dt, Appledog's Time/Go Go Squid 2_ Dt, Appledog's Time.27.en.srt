SP Team

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,420
has won the national champion!

29
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,940
Oh, my God,

30
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,940
what an incredible battle!

31
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,060
Yes, we can see they

32
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,180
(Commentary)
both were well prepared

33
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,700
and responded quickly and cleverly.

34
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,260
It was a battle
between the best players

35
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,540
and best strategies.

36
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,540
The SP Team,

37
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,660
with the aid of Tao Qitao,

38
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,540
his ability to seize the opportunity,

39
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,260
has turned the table.

40
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,820
Yes.

41
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,580
Who dare say the team was incapable!

42
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,260
The SP team has given their answer

43
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,220
to whoever questions them.

44
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,060
Their kingdom has not yet fallen,

45
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,660
instead, their legend continues.

46
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:38,900
-SP! SP! SP!
-SP! SP! SP!

47
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,220
Everyone,

48
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,940
please again send
your congratulations to SP

49
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,460
for winning the national champion!

50
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,100
The team’s Captain Slide,

51
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,980
once won the group champion
in the AMC

52
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,900
as the Coach of the Chinese delegation.

53
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,740
He started the career
since he was in tens.

54
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,900
Despite quite a several times
in the course,

55
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,500
he does not fail the game today.

56
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Again, he leads the SP
to the champion!

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,980
Congratulations!

58
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,860
Please say something to the audience.

59
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,940
I think

60
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,020
every member of the team

61
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,180
has paid a lot of efforts

62
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,860
and made a great contribution

63
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,980
to our success.

64
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,860
So, I think we,

65
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,300
the SP, deserve this.

66
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,620
We are champions!

67
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,860
Congratulations to the champion team!

68
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,260
Cheers!

69
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:44,580
-SP! SP! SP!
-SP! SP! SP!

70
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,060
What’s the matter?

71
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,740
You can’t afford the loss?

72
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,940
You calculated me.

73
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,940
This was settled between us

74
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,500
before the game.

75
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,580
You should be fair.

76
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,580
Good.

77
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,820
How fair it is!

78
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,540
Next time,

79
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,100
I will win.

80
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Good.

81
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,860
I look forward to it.

82
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,020
What’s up?

83
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,780
You look unhappy.

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,860
It’s my honor to have won you.

85
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,060
And for today’s game,

86
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,700
I was in luck.

87
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,540
Ai Qing!

88
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,980
Ai Qing!

89
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,660
I am here.

90
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,460
What are you doing here?

91
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,700
-Coach.
-Hello!

92
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,020
Leave our coach,

93
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,100
or I’ll won’t be easy on you.

94
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,540
-There you are.
-Heroine.

95
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,540
Wear the champion medal.

96
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,420
Plan B.

97
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,340
-One, two, three.
-Slowly.

98
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,900
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

99
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,220
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

100
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,660
Stop.

101
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,100
You make me feel dizzy.

102
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,300
Put me down. Quickly.

103
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,420
Don’t make me over.

104
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,940
We won’t.

105
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,700
The Boss has arranged
a hearty party for our success.

106
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,220
Go.

107
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,100
Wait, Slide.

108
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,700
You go first

109
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,860
and I still have some words

110
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,860
with Wu Bai.

111
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,820
Don’t take too much time.

112
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,420
We...

113
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,100
You can go now.

114
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,340
Goodbye.

115
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,380
They will throw a victory party.

116
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,460
I have to join them as their coach.

117
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,700
I understand.

118
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,740
Then, I’ll leave now.

119
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,620
I’m leaving.

120
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,900
Go.

121
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,020
Then I go.

122
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,780
Goodbye.

123
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,860
You were doing
pretty well in Chicago.

124
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,500
What made you
come back to China?

125
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,220
For personal reasons.

126
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,500
Fine.

127
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,860
We’ve come back
and founded the K&K.

128
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,300
Han Shangyan is the responsible person

129
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,540
and I’m the Coach.

130
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,860
You are the Captain.

131
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,660
Our goal is to

132
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,060
get a strong footing here
within three years.

133
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,460
Do you have the confidence?

134
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,940
Three years have been too long.

135
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,260
It takes time to establish a club,

136
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,620
recruit people,

137
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,500
and run it.

138
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,940
I’ll convene the key players.

139
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,420
You already get men, right?

140
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,660
That’s great.

141
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,500
But you should know

142
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,100
that eighty percent

143
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,540
of the best players in our country

144
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,660
have been picked up by the SP.

145
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,540
I think you should have

146
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,980
heard of 97 and Shen Zhe.

147
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,420
Sure.

148
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,420
Are they your friends?

149
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,660
That’s great.

150
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,780
Plus you,

151
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,100
you three can form a battle team.

152
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,940
I’ll catch up with the SP

153
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,700
and surpass them

154
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,740
within one year.

155
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,580
Why have you been
obsessed with the SP?

156
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,740
What makes them your target?

157
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,220
Because they’re the best team
in the country

158
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,020
and I want to be the best, too.

159
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,420
Wu Bai,

160
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,380
why do you hide here?

161
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,060
I’ve been searching
for you everywhere.

162
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,660
You even didn’t answer my phone.

163
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,180
I was just thinking

164
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,580
it would soon be one year.

165
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,100
One year?

166
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,900
What is that?

167
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,580
One year after K&K
was founded in China,

168
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,060
it’s supposed to surpass the SP.

169
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,980
I didn’t know K&K

170
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,060
has such an ambitious plan.

171
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,420
So, K&K shall stand

172
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,980
on the highest platform

173
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,740
whatever it’s AMC
or World Championships.

174
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,140
You can leave now.

175
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,860
You must feel bad.

176
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
I’ve come to comfort you.

177
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,580
No worries.

178
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,540
I’ll be by your side even when
you lose the game.

179
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,740
Why was it a narrow win?

180
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,660
I did narrowly win the game.

181
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,660
I know.

182
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,180
I watched the game

183
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,420
and I know you narrowly won.

184
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,820
But do you know that

185
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,420
Wu Bai is worse than me?

186
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,780
He even got a ring.

187
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,380
He was to propose to your sister.

188
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,260
Proposal?

189
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,620
Don’t you think he is foolish?

190
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,860
He said only after
he won your sister’s team

191
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,420
would he propose to her,

192
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,260
or he would rather wait.

193
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,620
They’re loving rivals.

194
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,180
I don’t want to lose again.

195
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,860
It’s fine.

196
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,540
Don’t be upset.

197
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,300
You still have me.

198
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,940
I only show my weak side before you.

199
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,420
I don’t want others to know.

200
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,980
They are sad, too.

201
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,060
You can tell me.

202
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,820
Why are you so lovable today?

203
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,980
Today is a special day.

204
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,060
How is it special?

205
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,260
He won’t order delicious food for us.

206
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,860
Sure.

207
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,740
We can make a strategy.

208
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,020
The one with the most fans

209
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,180
should go first,

210
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,180
and the rest would wait
in the parking lot, all right?

211
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,980
-It’s fine.
-Okay.

212
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,500
Who will go the first?

213
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,300
Me.

214
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,740
No, it should be me.

215
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,420
-I have many fans.
-It must be me.

216
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,300
Look, there are many outside

217
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,980
holding boards with my name on them.

218
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,540
Well.

219
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,860
Absolutely, I have the most fans.

220
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,820
I’ll go.

221
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,300
I’ll leave it to you.

222
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,380
Go.

223
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,860
Hurry.

224
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,780
What are you doing?

225
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,620
Ou Qiang!

226
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,380
-Slide! Slide!
-Slide!

227
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,420
Please give me an autograph of you!

228
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,660
Okay.

229
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,100
They leave.

230
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,300
-Slide!
-Please give me a signature, Slide!

231
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,500
-Sorry, I’m late.
-Sit here, Ai Qing!

232
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,220
Sit here.

233
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,300
We all have been waiting for you.

234
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,900
Please take the seat.

235
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,220
You can sit there.

236
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,340
I prefer this seat.

237
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,820
No...

238
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,860
Sit down.

239
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,260
Since we’ve won the game,

240
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,700
why not give a speech, bosses?

241
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,900
Yep.

242
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,420
Solo is good at

243
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,660
mobilizing and public speaking.

244
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,380
Let Solo give a speech, all right?

245
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,740
You slurred your words.

246
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,020
Boss!

247
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,380
Let me say something.

248
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,100
Ten years ago,

249
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,980
our Solo Team

250
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,660
won the first national champion

251
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,940
in this stadium.

252
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,020
Ten years after,

253
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,100
today, we again won

254
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,780
the national champion in this stadium.

255
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,500
I believe

256
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,620
it won’t take another ten years

257
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,500
before we win another championship.

258
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,460
All of us

259
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,100
have been re-born.

260
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,420
To the SP.

261
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,300
Good.

262
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,620
Cheers!

263
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,540
-To the SP.
-To the SP.

264
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,500
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

265
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,860
It’s rare that we are all present

266
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,380
and we’ve won the champion.

267
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,740
Why not take a photo of us?

268
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,980
-Yeah.
-Great.

269
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,940
Waitress.

270
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,020
-I’m here.
-Hello.

271
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,220
Could you please take a photo for us?

272
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,700
Come here.

273
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,780
Thank you.

274
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,900
Ai Qing, you should stand
in the middle.

275
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,540
Come here, in the middle of us.

276
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,340
We can eat them later.

277
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,220
Come here.

278
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,500
Here.

279
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,580
Please look at me. Are you ready?

280
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,060
Follow me.

281
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,220
-SP.
-Victory!

282
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,340
I’m full.

283
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,420
Full.

284
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,260
The fish head tastes good.

285
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,460
Enjoyable!

286
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,060
The taxi has just arrived.

287
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,260
We should go now.

288
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,140
Okay. Let’s go.

289
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,020
Fine. Go back and have a good rest.

290
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,340
Thank you, Boss.

291
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,540
-We’re leaving.
-Bye.

292
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,820
Fine, have a rest.

293
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,740
Don’t play the game late.

294
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,300
Okay.

295
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,300
It’s time to go.

296
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,700
Solo.

297
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,620
My brother,

298
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,780
what’s wrong with you?

299
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,820
What?

300
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,060
I made an opportunity for you.

301
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,180
Why didn’t you seize it?

302
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,860
And the last time,

303
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,660
when I invited Ai Qing

304
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,260
to the old house,

305
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,460
you just didn’t care

306
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,340
about my good intentions.

307
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,460
No wonder she was alone

308
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,860
when I arrived.

309
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,060
It was your trick.

310
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,860
Okay.

311
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,260
We’ll not talk about the last time.

312
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,100
It was my fault.

313
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,500
I didn’t tell you clearly.

314
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,100
But for the next ones,

315
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,380
we need considerable discussions.

316
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,140
Yes,

317
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,980
I need to keep in touch with you.

318
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,500
Communication is important.

319
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,740
Stop.

320
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,620
Never mention it

321
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,860
again.

322
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,500
I don’t want to bother her.

323
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,660
She and I,

324
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,980
we’ve tried.

325
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,940
Now I think we’d better

326
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,300
leave the beautiful memory to the past.

327
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,140
Tried?

328
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,300
You told her?

329
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,260
She is Wu Bai’s girlfriend.

330
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,740
Wu Bai?

331
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,580
She... And Wu Bai?

332
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,500
No wonder last time

333
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,340
I thought they were different.

334
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,740
How?

335
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,980
I made a quiet effort

336
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,620
till I realize that

337
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,420
the more important thing

338
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,100
to me is that she can leave the past

339
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,140
and regain the happiness,

340
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,220
instead of being with me.

341
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,580
What about you?

342
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,300
Can you leave the past?

343
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,740
Anyone who only strives for love,

344
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,820
no matter a man or woman,

345
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,460
that guy is not worthy of love.

346
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,820
For the time being,

347
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,300
the most important thing to me

348
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,580
is to bring the SP to
the AMC and World Championships.

349
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,420
Just put it away.

350
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,580
Let’s go.

351
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,660
Have some fruits.

352
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,180
Thank you, my sister.

353
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,900
What’s up?

354
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,540
Why are you unhappy?
You’ve won the game.

355
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,380
I’m happy.

356
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,340
It’s happy to win the game.

357
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,780
You don’t look happy.

358
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,020
Don’t you think I am a fool?

359
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,900
I was thinking

360
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,060
when the SP is happy,

361
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,300
the K&K will be sad.

362
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,380
Yes, he not only lost the game

363
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,660
but missed the chance to propose to you.

364
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,260
How can he be happy?

365
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,220
Sometimes you win,
and sometimes you lose.

366
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,460
When there is a winner,
there is a loser.

367
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,340
I know.

368
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,580
But I also want to

369
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,460
do something for Bai.

370
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,900
Ever since we knew each other,

371
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,980
he’s been the one who keeps
doing things for me.

372
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,820
He’s been attracted to you
for ten years.

373
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,300
He’ll be happy as long as
you don’t leave him.

374
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,380
But since we are together,

375
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,180
we should do something for each other.

376
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,180
I’ve been enjoying

377
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,900
his love

378
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,740
but I didn’t make him feel safe.

379
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,100
And after

380
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,860
I quarreled with him,

381
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,980
I’ve re-examined our relationship.

382
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,620
I think it shouldn’t be like this

383
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,060
when we’re together.

384
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,220
Men,

385
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,940
they only look strong,

386
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,740
but they’re childish.

387
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,420
They often feel jealous
and think too much.

388
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,980
So, sometimes

389
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,300
we need to express our love bravely.

390
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,660
I’m on you.

391
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,420
But have you got a plan?

392
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,100
Just some ideas.

393
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,580
Tell me.

394
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,500
It’s confidential.

395
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,740
You try to keep it

396
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,660
a secret from me, don’t you?

397
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,700
I sliced the fruit.

398
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,100
You can slice one again.

399
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,980
Don’t be stingy.

400
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,340
I did the job every time.

401
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,780
Don’t you have the meal?

402
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,060
They all lost the appetite.

403
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,260
Shen Zhe is training in the room.

404
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,420
And 97

405
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,100
gives himself up
in the maintenance room.

406
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,420
They can’t solve the problem

407
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,780
even if they don’t eat anything.

408
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,540
I understand their feelings.

409
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,580
They’ll be more annoyed
if you try to comfort them.

410
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,500
Well,

411
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,340
I’ll leave some to them

412
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,700
so when they get hungry,

413
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,100
they’ll have something to eat.

414
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,260
Okay.

415
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,620
What’s up with you?

416
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,780
Another stay-up?

417
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,700
No worries.

418
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,900
I’m just tired.

419
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,500
You can have a rest now.

420
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,420
Anyway, the game is over.

421
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,820
Have a good rest.

422
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,100
Same to you.

423
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,300
Fine.

424
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,220
Enjoy the food.

425
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,860
What are you thinking?

426
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,300
The game makes

427
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,420
me feel wrong.

428
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,860
Just a loss.

429
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,700
It doesn’t matter.

430
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,020
Do you think it doesn’t matter?

431
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,300
I lost to Tao Qitao.

432
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,420
K&K lost to the SP.

433
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,540
Do you think it’s fine?

434
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,180
It was not your fault.

435
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,940
I underestimated them.

436
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,020
Was it your mistake
that caused the failure?

437
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,500
It was me.

438
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,860
I knew the design logic
of the Sea Breeze,

439
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,940
but I didn’t choose
another way to attack.

440
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,500
I underestimated them.

441
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,580
I didn’t expect they would

442
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,780
have it upgraded so soon.

443
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,540
I lost the final round.

444
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,420
It was my fault, wasn’t it?

445
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,420
So you start to blame yourself.

446
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,580
So what?

447
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,740
Didn’t I have the right

448
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,500
to blame myself, Wu Bai?

449
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,940
I beg you,

450
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,340
please don’t keep
every responsibility to yourself.

451
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,580
Enough.

452
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,380
If you’re talking about
who should be responsible.

453
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,260
It’s me that

454
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,780
you should blame on.

455
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,140
We’ve made it to the national finals,

456
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
but I made mistake

457
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,260
with the welding at the very moment.

458
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,380
I failed the K&K.

459
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,060
It was not your fault.

460
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,260
The Nobody couldn’t withstand

461
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,780
the bloody attack of the Beastmaster

462
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,940
even without that error.

463
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,900
Captain,

464
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,100
anyway, I left a weak point
for them to attack.

465
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,580
Please leave us alone

466
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,180
for a while.

467
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,820
We know how to spell

468
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,340
the word “shame”.

469
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,140
I guess you’ll be here.

470
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,820
I’m doing the strengthening practice.

471
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,180
You adapt to it well

472
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,460
after the hardware was upgraded.

473
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,580
Coach,

474
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,020
I didn’t fail you at the final, did I?

475
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,660
You were doing very good,

476
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,940
but

477
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,780
I think you could do better.

478
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,940
You’re strict.

479
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,820
I still have many years
to grow my ability.

480
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,060
Qitao,

481
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,580
I have a high expectation of you.

482
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,780
I hope you can get along with
Team I

483
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,420
as soon as possible and learn

484
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,060
how to be a good captain like Slide.

485
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,580
Captain?

486
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,700
Then what about Slide?

487
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,420
He’s good at organizing people

488
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,020
and others trust him,

489
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,580
yet he will lose his heyday

490
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,420
and may not be able to innovate.

491
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,940
He can try to be a coach someday.

492
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,300
What about you?

493
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,580
Me?

494
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,340
Anyway,

495
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,340
the future is better for us

496
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,700
and the future of the SP

497
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,660
belongs to you.

498
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,300
Come on!

499
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,540
Time for a meal!

500
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,940
Shen Zhe!

501
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,820
Time for a meal!

502
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,020
97!

503
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,420
Wouldn’t you like some noodles?

504
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,900
Zhou Yi made them especially for you.

505
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
Come here.

506
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,300
I joined the K&K halfway.

507
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,420
It’s said that you and Wu Bai
were childhood friends.

508
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,780
We’ve known each other
since we were kids.

509
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,180
Is he always like that?

510
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,940
Quiet, and doesn’t know
how to please others.

511
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,820
He’s better now.

512
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,100
He would not speak a word

513
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,420
if he was at odds with others.

514
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,340
What?

515
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,940
Did he affect you?

516
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,780
So you also use silence
to show your dissatisfaction?

517
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,300
Actually,

518
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,700
we fear that he might be
disappointed with us.

519
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,100
What?

520
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,500
Are you gonna deny it?

521
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,060
You’re the most sensitive one.

522
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,580
I don’t know who was talking

523
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,700
in his sleep last night

524
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,060
“Wu Bai, do you regret to
let me join the K&K?”

525
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,700
Shut up.

526
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,420
What?

527
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,780
You dare not admit what you said?

528
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,580
You’ll be annoying
if I don’t beat you...

529
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,780
Have some noodles.

530
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
Well.

531
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,820
Have some noodles.

532
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,460
They will be cold soon.

533
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,700
It’s imperative

534
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,900
to eat on time and
take care of your health.

535
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,460
The Captain will add
more training hours for you.

536
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,740
I saw his puffy eyes

537
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,100
because he has been staying up

538
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,620
to make the training schedule for you.

539
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,820
Don’t fail

540
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,420
his efforts.

541
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,820
Do you hear me?

542
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,220
I’ll go.

543
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,300
Bai.

544
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,540
Grandpa,

545
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,860
what brings you here?

546
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,740
What?

547
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,100
Can’t I come here just
because I want to come?

548
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,020
Grandpa,

549
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,220
please sit on the sofa.

550
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,020
Have some drink, Grandpa.

551
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,700
Bai,

552
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,460
I watched the game
last night and I know

553
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,420
you lost to Ai Qing’s team.

554
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,020
I was worried about you
and didn’t fall asleep last night.

555
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,540
That’s why I came here to see you.

556
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,820
No worries, Grandpa.

557
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,020
There is always a winner and a loser

558
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,820
in a game.

559
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,580
We’ll adjust ourselves accordingly.

560
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,300
But I heard that others said

561
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,340
that the outcome of the game

562
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,900
may affect the future development

563
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,980
of the club.

564
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,020
Bai,

565
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,820
to be honest with me,

566
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,860
is it a horrible loss?

567
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,500
The game is important

568
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,340
but we still have the AMC ahead

569
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,020
as well as the World Championships.

570
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,220
So, don’t worry, Grandpa.

571
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,220
You won’t have me
worried about you.

572
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,180
But remember that

573
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,300
your grandpa

574
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,540
will be the most loyal backer to you.

575
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,020
Take this

576
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,340
and upgrade your machines

577
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,700
to the best conditions

578
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,740
and win over the world champion!

579
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,540
So much?

580
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,660
Yep.

581
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
I’ll spare no effort

582
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,300
to help you

583
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,180
and Shangyan.

584
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,460
Grandpa,

585
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,460
I should not take this.

586
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,780
Please listen to me.

587
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,900
I was opposed to

588
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,060
your cousin Han Shangyan

589
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,500
when he wanted to set up the club,

590
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,300
because I thought
he was wasting his time,

591
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,100
and I didn’t give him

592
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,580
a penny.

593
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,220
Grandpa,

594
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,620
your company

595
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,660
has always been our biggest support.

596
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,100
I’m happy to see

597
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,580
the sincerity in your eyes

598
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,300
after you and your cousin

599
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,820
have suffered so much
for the robot battles.

600
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,620
As your senior,

601
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,620
I also want to

602
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,980
help you.

603
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,500
You know that

604
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,860
if I give this to

605
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,780
your cousin Han Shangyan,

606
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,940
he will not take it.

607
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,180
So,

608
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,500
you can take it

609
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,180
on behalf of your cousin.

610
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,380
If you don’t need it,

611
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,820
you save it,

612
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,020
so I don’t need to worry about you.

613
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,060
Grandpa...

614
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,060
Who should be the first to apologize?

615
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,260
Don’t you like to argue with him?
You first.

616
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,780
No, you first.

617
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,820
The old rules. Jan-Ken Punch!

618
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,580
It’s difficult to find what you love

619
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,980
and make it become your profession.

620
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,900
It’s a blessing, too.

621
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,740
I hope you

622
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,340
and your friends

623
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,260
can pursue your dream

624
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,780
without worrying about the money.

625
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,100
I’m at your back.

626
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,300
Xiaomi has just sorted out

627
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,380
the data of the finals.

628
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,500
We’ll begin to prepare for

629
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,460
the AMC from tomorrow.

630
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,820
There will be more training hours.

631
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,620
Do you still believe me?

632
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,620
Don’t ask me such a girlish question.

633
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,420
We’ll have a meeting tonight.

634
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,020
Everything will be discussed then.

635
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,340
Okay.

636
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,220
Yes.

637
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,540
Why labor yourself on a trivial thing?

638
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,220
And you,

639
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,460
if you can’t forget
the mistake you made,

640
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,460
you can start to practice
welding from tomorrow.

641
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,180
There is a lot of time for you.

642
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,420
All right.

643
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,180
Coach.

644
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,620
I believe in your ability.

645
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,980
I’m sure we can win the AMC.

646
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,620
-K&K!
-K&K!

647
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,220
Anything?

648
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,860
What did you say to Qitao?

649
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,900
Me?

650
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,660
What can I say

651
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,060
except for cheering him up

652
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,460
and some encouragements?

653
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
Okay.

654
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,820
I won’t ask
if you don’t like to tell me.

655
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,700
What was wrong with you yesterday?

656
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,420
What do you mean?

657
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,220
You and Solo,

658
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,940
you tried to avoid each other at dinner.

659
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,900
I have to show my preference

660
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,500
or it will be unfair
to both him and Bai.

661
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,300
How are you going, you and Wu Bai?

662
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,020
I think it’s my fault.

663
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,980
I’ve been careless

664
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,340
and didn’t make him feel safe.

665
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,180
Then you and Solo...

666
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,820
Fine.

667
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,780
I know that,

668
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,980
but I hope Baona and others
can understand, too.

669
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,300
By the way,

670
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,300
I’ve made a new career plan for you

671
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,380
that can be started
following this season.

672
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,780
A career plan?

673
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,380
Didn’t you just speak with
Qitao about this?

674
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,660
I think

675
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,380
you can go further.

676
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,180
I want to teach you

677
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,860
to be a good coach.

678
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,300
How do you like it, Captain Slide?

679
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,220
Do you have the confidence?

680
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,060
I didn’t expect I was included
in your growth plan.

681
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,780
What will you do
if I become the Coach?

682
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,300
As for me,

683
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,060
it’s time to be off work.

684
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,300
I’m leaving.

685
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,460
Wait.

686
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,660
You can’t wait to see Wu Bai,
can you?

687
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,380
Fine, I won’t meddle in the affair,

688
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,940
but you must not forget

689
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,940
tomorrow’s robot Expo.

690
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,860
-I’ll go.
-I know.

691
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,660
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

692
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,620
Hello, Bai,

693
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,180
are you available?

694
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,660
For now?

695
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,060
I want to see you.

696
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,740
Yes, I’m available,

697
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,100
but I need to go back tonight
for a meeting.

698
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,620
Fine.

699
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,940
See you later.

700
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,940
Okay.

701
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,100
Bai.

702
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,140
You look so cute in the clothes.

703
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,100
Sit down.

704
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,420
I tell you

705
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,260
that you also have one.

706
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,580
Couple dresses!

707
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,940
Does it suit me?

708
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,180
Yes.

709
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,260
Then I’ll wear it every day.

710
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,500
You’re exaggerating it!

711
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,300
Actually,

712
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,380
I was afraid you might say
I was childish.

713
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,940
Not at all.

714
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,420
But isn’t it that

715
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,460
only college students would wear

716
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,580
couple dresses
when they are in love?

717
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,260
No.

718
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,380
I think it’s cute.

719
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,660
Excuse me, ready to order?

720
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,860
Two cups of latte.

721
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,660
One without ice.

722
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
Okay.

723
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,540
Thank you.

724
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,900
Why did you suddenly think of
buying couple dresses?

725
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,820
Because

726
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,820
I suddenly realize one thing.

727
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,300
What is it?

728
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,060
Bai,

729
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,740
thank you

730
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,420
for always caring about

731
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,020
my feelings,

732
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,060
for loving me

733
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,580
in such a secret

734
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,900
and covert way.

735
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,620
After that day’s quarrel with you,

736
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,980
I’ve thought a lot.

737
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,500
I think

738
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,540
it was my fault

739
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,380
because I didn’t make
you feel safe with me.

740
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,540
We should tell the SP and the K&K

741
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,260
the relationship between us,

742
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,380
and I think we can

743
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,420
tell everyone

744
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,100
after the AMC.

745
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,820
Are you serious?

746
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,660
Ai Qing,

747
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,900
thanks.

748
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,180
The AMC is near.

749
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,660
We both want to
win the world champion.

750
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,020
I’ll work harder

751
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,660
and I hope you try your best, too.

752
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,060
Okay.

753
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,340
See you

754
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,180
in the battle.

755
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,180
Thank you.

756
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,420
Didn’t I say no ice?

757
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,060
Wait. You can drink it

758
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,620
after I get out of all ice.

759
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,180
No ice.

760
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,940
You can enjoy it now.

761
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,180
It tastes different.

762
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,900
Really?

763
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,340
What is different?

764
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,900
Mine

765
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,660
tastes better.

766
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,660
Captain.

767
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,180
Hm...

768
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,580
Excuse me,

769
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,100
are you Wu Bai?

770
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,140
Yep.

771
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,060
Why do you change your style?

772
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,260
Did I always wear the same style?

773
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,940
Didn’t you?

774
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,260
I’ve known you since we were kids.

775
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,500
Your clothes only have three colors.

776
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,660
Black.

777
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,660
Dark.

778
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,420
Raven.

779
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,180
Am I right?

780
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,740
Your girl bought it for you, right?

781
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,140
Couple dresses!

782
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,420
She is the only one in the world

783
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,140
that can change you.

784
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,380
I can’t imagine Ai Qing

785
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,660
also shares a girlish side.

786
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,900
And she told me

787
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,380
she will tell everyone
about our relationship.

788
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,780
That’s great.

789
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,060
Why have you been so happy

790
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,740
about this?

791
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,820
I want to see

792
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,820
that stupid Zhou Yi

793
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,260
drop his jaw

794
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,180
when he knows that you’re together.

795
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,700
It must be funny.

796
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,660
By the way,

797
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,340
did you contact Professor Chen?

798
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,980
I just want to tell you.

799
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,140
I’ve contacted him

800
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,420
and here are the data.

801
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,260
The time will be determined

802
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,460
after tomorrow’s Expo.

803
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,700
A good job.

804
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,140
We need to be serious
about the Expo.

805
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,620
Rest assured, Captain.

806
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,820
Let’s go up.

807
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,860
Can’t it be another couple dresses?

808
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,460
Let me have a look.

809
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,140
It’s my clothes.

810
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,020
Let me see.

811
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,060
How is it?

812
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,580
They’ve almost upgraded
all of their systems.

813
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,060
The AEO Team of Singapore.

814
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,660
It looks like they have
the mecha completely replaced.

815
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,100
Their mecha’s output capacity

816
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,460
has been multiplied many times.

817
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,420
Judged from the video we watched,

818
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,740
the real capacity should be
larger than the data they quoted.

819
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,260
Of course,

820
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,260
you won’t reveal the real data,
will you?

821
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,820
Who do you think

822
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,020
will be our biggest rival

823
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,260
in the AMC?

824
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,020
It must be the K&K!

825
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,180
It’s said that they’ve upgraded

826
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,260
both The Nobody
and the Trash Can.

827
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,660
But we don’t know what
has been changed.

828
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,660
I hope we could have an opportunity
to get some information from them.

829
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,020
Isn’t there a workshop this afternoon?

830
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,540
You

831
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,300
go and ask about it.

832
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,660
Me?

833
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,580
Don’t you worry about
my speaking skill?

834
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,420
I may disclose our secrets

835
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,420
before I get anything from them.

836
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,460
You can deal with Wu Bai.

837
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,340
Leave him to you. Come on!

838
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,380
I...

839
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,860
Come on, Coach.
