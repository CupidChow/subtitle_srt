19
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,260
So what if I said Wu Bai is
more handsome than you?

20
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,300
You don’t have to swim alone to let off

21
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,940
in the middle of the night.

22
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,420
You’re thinking too much.

23
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,740
It’s not because of it.

24
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,380
Then what is it about?

25
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,940
It’s just

26
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,660
a pile of nonsense.

27
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,860
It’s okay.

28
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,940
How come all of you

29
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,060
choose to think about life

30
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,540
tonight?

31
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,900
What do you mean?

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,340
Who else?

33
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,860
Nobody.

34
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,980
Though I don’t know
what’s bothering you,

35
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,100
it’s better to just do whatever
you want

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,220
than overly thinking about it.

37
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,260
You start to persuade me though

38
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,980
you don’t even know what’s upsetting me.

39
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,900
Isn’t it true that people’s troubles
all come from choosing?

40
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,580
I didn’t know you learned philosophy.

41
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,460
What philosophy?

42
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,300
From my experience,

43
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,820
all conclusions made
after rational thinking

44
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,140
are nonsense.

45
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,740
How you choose matters the most.

46
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,100
Whatever makes you happy
and comfortable rules.

47
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,780
So,

48
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,820
though I don’t know
what’s bothering you,

49
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,340
well, you have an answer
in your heart already,

50
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,860
don’t you?

51
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,860
Give it a guess.

52
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,700
What’s my answer?

53
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,420
How can I know that?

54
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,420
I’m going to sleep now.
Hurry and come up.

55
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:19,980
Good night.

56
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,460
Good night.

57
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,500
But if you join SP,

58
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
you can never defeat him.

59
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,620
He will always be your boss.

60
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,460
Only by joining K&K

61
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,100
will you have a chance
to beat Solo’s team.

62
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,460
Stop fooling me, okay?

63
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,820
I’m not fooling.

64
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,780
K&K currently

65
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,620
is both understaffed and poor.

66
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,900
Fine. Even if I and 97

67
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,860
join you to help you.

68
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,380
Only the three of us are qualified.

69
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,940
Wu Bai, your dream is
to be the champion.

70
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,780
It requires everyone in the team
to be the top in the industry.

71
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,940
It’s not enough at all

72
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,860
just by the three of us.

73
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,980
We can do it.

74
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,220
Naive.

75
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,020
We can be naive once

76
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,180
in this life.

77
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,180
Join K&K with me.

78
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,020
I’ll take you to win.

79
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,620
Wu Bai, what’s wrong with you?

80
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,500
Why did you book such an early flight?

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,540
I almost missed it.

82
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,020
Money and being the Captain.

83
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,260
I can give them up.

84
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,100
I only have one condition.

85
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,220
I’ll only sign for one year.

86
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,100
I’ll leave if we don’t win.

87
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,820
Sure.

88
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,780
A deal is a deal.

89
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,540
We’re young people.

90
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,140
Can we not be this old-fashioned?

91
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,620
Can I come in?

92
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,660
Plus,

93
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,740
don’t book early flights anymore.

94
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,540
It’s not humanitarian at all.

95
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Captain.

96
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,140
What Shen Zhe meant

97
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,420
is to join us in K&K, right?

98
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,540
Did you get him on board last night?

99
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,060
Yes.

100
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,140
You’re good.

101
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,980
What did you say to him?

102
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,540
Nothing much.

103
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,740
That’s great. That’s great.
That’s great.

104
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,460
K&K is one step closer
to winning the champion.

105
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,940
Zhou Yi, have you hailed a car?

106
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,580
I’ll do it now.

107
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,900
Zhou Yi.

108
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,820
Get a commercial vehicle.

109
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,860
There are only four people.

110
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,180
We can fit in a regular car.

111
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,300
Who says it’ll be only the four of us?

112
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,580
Do you want to go together?

113
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,500
We happened to hail
a commercial vehicle.

114
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,100
You can go first.

115
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,820
My sister hailed a car.

116
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,140
Captain. Here’s our car.

117
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,780
Let’s go.

118
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,420
Let’s go.

119
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,820
Wu Bai. Do you have a minute
after getting off?

120
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,380
Yeah.

121
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,300
Why are you all staring at me?

122
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,580
I suddenly remember somebody.

123
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,220
Do you still remember Slide?

124
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,460
Of course.

125
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,540
Do you want to meet him,

126
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,100
to meet our old friend?

127
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,100
Didn’t he go to Germany?

128
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,900
He...

129
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,460
He’s retired, too.

130
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,580
I’m just thinking

131
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,260
that if you are available today,

132
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,900
let’s visit him together.

133
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,500
He’d surely be happy to see you.

134
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,220
I mean

135
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,460
we can all go and visit him.

136
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,020
No. You two can go.

137
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,180
He’s your friend.

138
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,300
We don’t want to interrupt.

139
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,860
Yeah. You two can go.

140
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,580
We won’t interrupt then.

141
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,780
Let’s go.

142
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,460
I hope we can go together.

143
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,980
He just opened a store.

144
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,340
The more people the better.

145
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,740
Right. The more the better.

146
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,180
Let’s go together.

147
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,740
How should we deal with our luggage?

148
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,180
I won’t go then.

149
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,860
You can leave them to me.

150
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,940
I’ll take them back to the club.

151
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,580
That would be nice of you, Zhou Yi.

152
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,100
-I know, right?
-Thank you so much.

153
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,980
That’s too much trouble.

154
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,780
Let’s go.

155
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,860
Get into the car.

156
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,180
Let me help you.

157
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,820
(Shanghai Pudong International Airport)

158
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,700
(Nanpu Bridge)

159
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,300
Here we are.

160
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,660
Why did he retire?

161
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,580
I don’t know.

162
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,860
He wouldn’t tell me no matter
how many times I ask.

163
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,180
(New Model)
That’s why I wanted you to ask for me.

164
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,620
Look who’s here.

165
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,100
Wu Bai?

166
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,820
Long time no see.

167
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,860
It’s really been a long time.

168
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,420
You look more handsome.

169
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,180
97.

170
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,980
You grew taller.

171
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,180
You are a boss now.

172
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,980
This is...?

173
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
Shen Zhe.

174
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,540
Shen Zhe?

175
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,500
You’ve won quite a few champions
these years.

176
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,660
Slide.

177
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,660
I know you.

178
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,980
You were the leader of Chinese Team
during the ARCT.

179
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,500
Nice to meet you.

180
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,740
You can bury that in your heart.

181
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,500
You have the limited edition, too?

182
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,620
Put it down.

183
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,860
Put it down. It’s really expensive.

184
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,340
-I’m just looking.
-How are you?

185
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,180
How’s your retired life?

186
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,060
It’s actually not bad.

187
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,060
Running my own business

188
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,500
makes me sort of a boss now.

189
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,980
The business is good.

190
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,500
My life has been great.

191
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,500
Seems like you don’t ask for much.

192
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,180
I’m getting old.

193
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,060
I can only watch match videos

194
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,860
of hard-core competitors like you

195
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,420
to kill some time.

196
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,940
Why did you

197
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,300
retire at that time?

198
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,620
What are you doing?
Prying into my private life.

199
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,060
Tell me, did Ai Qing let you ask?

200
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,180
Is it you?

201
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,420
Of course not.

202
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,100
There are so many fans out there.

203
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,180
-So cute.
-97.

204
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,740
It’s Shen Zhe and 97!

205
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,220
Oh my god! 97!

206
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,060
-Shen Zhe!
-97!

207
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,260
It’s 97!

208
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,180
Isn’t he handsome?

209
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,620
Look at you guys.

210
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,860
My store has become popular
after you came.

211
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,100
How about...?

212
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,940
How about you run an autograph session?

213
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,260
Autograph session?

214
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,500
You see.

215
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,420
You are quite famous in the circle now.

216
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,500
Many fans came outside.

217
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,300
Of course.

218
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,180
You are good-looking and great.

219
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,380
Just give Slide a hand.

220
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,540
Help him to attract more customers.

221
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
If it’s not okay,

222
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,860
you can draw percentages, too.

223
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,500
You do have a business acumen.

224
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,740
Bai.

225
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,500
She’s helpful to future husband.

226
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,820
Yeah. Keep the benefits
for your own people.

227
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,980
We should help our people
as long as we can.

228
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,860
What do you think? Big star.

229
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
Do you not want to?

230
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,540
I don’t mind.

231
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,060
I listen to you guys.

232
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,180
It’s decided, then.

233
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,460
You’ll have plenty of different

234
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,660
autograph sessions in the future anyway.

235
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,500
This time is like a warm-up.

236
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,620
I’m fine with it.

237
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,540
What’s decided?

238
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,380
Don’t force people like that.

239
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,060
Don’t pretend you aren’t happy about it.

240
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,860
Hurry and set the table for autograph.

241
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,180
-Come on.
-Let’s go.

242
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,980
No. I’m not used to taking advantages.

243
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,620
It’s not taking advantages.

244
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,660
Why do you fool around
with them, too?

245
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,140
They are playing around here.
But your identities...

246
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,860
I listen to Ai Qing.

247
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,100
You...? Don’t listen to...

248
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,180
Thank you in advance
on behalf of my old friend.

249
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,020
You’re welcome.

250
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,740
Remember it by heart.

251
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,860
I got the board.

252
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,900
Let me write it.

253
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,820
Okay.

254
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,780
What should I write?

255
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,780
Popular MMA players.

256
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,860
Wu Bai, 97 and Shen Zhe
autograph in the store.

257
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,060
Customers who come to the store

258
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,180
will each get a player’s autograph.

259
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,020
Now, people won’t blacken that

260
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,620
you do it for the money.

261
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,140
They can get autographs
without purchasing anything.

262
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,900
(Popular MMA players.
Wu Bai, Shen Zhe and 97.)

263
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,620
No need to hurry.

264
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,740
Admission by ticket
for every customer.

265
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,300
Free autograph with no strings attached.

266
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,180
The ticket offers a discount
on next shopping. Come on.

267
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,700
Come on. Stand in line, please.

268
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,420
No need to hurry. We’re not in a rush.

269
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,460
We are not...

270
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,300
No need to hurry.

271
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Take your time. Thanks for coming.

272
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,460
Who are you?

273
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,300
You... You don’t know me?

274
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,500
Who’s the most handsome guy in K&K?

275
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,020
Wu Bai.

276
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,780
Fine.

277
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,220
Let me exclude a wrong answer for you.

278
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,060
Except for Wu Bai,

279
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,140
who’s the most handsome
and talented player in K&K?

280
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,220
I recognize you now.

281
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,900
You’re Zhou Yi.

282
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,580
Your eyesight is supposed
to be better at this age.

283
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,060
Thank you, Zhou Yi.

284
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,180
What’s so funny?

285
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,820
I’m selling my flesh here for you two.

286
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,340
Do you know that?

287
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,140
Wait. Your flesh?

288
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,940
Does anyone care?

289
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,340
Why are your words so mean?

290
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,180
How come

291
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,020
there are women who like you?

292
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,500
Do you want to know why?

293
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,820
Why?

294
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,940
Because I’m good-looking.

295
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,140
I don’t believe it.

296
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,020
Believe it or not.

297
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,620
See.

298
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,860
Wu Bai. Please sign for me.

299
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,940
Can you sign on my back?

300
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,780
Sign for me.

301
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,540
Wu Bai. Sign for me, please.

302
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,820
Sign it on the paper.

303
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,820
I really like you.

304
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,940
Now you don’t show off anymore.

305
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,740
Someone is more handsome than you.

306
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,980
Don’t crowd me. Line up.

307
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,620
(New Model)

308
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,740
Wu Bai. Sign for me.

309
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,820
Wu Bai is really handsome.

310
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,380
Seize the chance.

311
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,940
Thank you.

312
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,220
Why do you close so early?

313
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,420
What?

314
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,500
What’s wrong with closing it early?

315
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,420
Come on.

316
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,460
Do you think today’s business was
too good?

317
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,540
It’s not even six o’clock yet.

318
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,220
No store closes this early.

319
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,980
You know.

320
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,620
I feel really bad about the money
earned today.

321
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,940
I have to use it

322
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,820
to buy everyone dinner.

323
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,020
Let’s go. Whatever you want to eat.

324
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,620
Barbecue.

325
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,020
Here. We haven’t seen each other
for three years.

326
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,460
Here’s a toast to everyone.

327
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,860
Thank you very much

328
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,260
for doing me this favor today.

329
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,220
Here. Cheers.

330
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,420
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

331
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,140
Drink up the first cup.

332
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,940
You and me,

333
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,460
we should have three drinks.

334
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,540
It’s been so long.

335
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,460
It’s great seeing you.

336
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,140
Here. Cheers.

337
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,540
The third drink

338
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,740
is to celebrate our reunion.

339
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,100
-Come on.
-I want to join the third drink.

340
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,220
To celebrate our reunion in Shanghai.

341
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,300
Do you remember Singapore?

342
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,140
The night we won
the team championship.

343
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,940
Of course.

344
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,940
I’ll never forget.

345
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,420
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

346
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,940
Why exactly did you

347
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,540
retire at that time?

348
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,620
It didn’t go well in Germany.

349
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,300
I didn’t get along with them, either.

350
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,380
So I didn’t feel like

351
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,220
playing anymore. Then I quit.

352
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,500
Let’s not talk about it. Drink.

353
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,860
Don’t just focus on the barbecue.
Come on.

354
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,740
One more drink. Come on.

355
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,900
Cheers.

356
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,660
Together. Cheers.

357
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,860
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Cheers.

358
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,380
Thank you.

359
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,660
Here’s a toast.

360
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,020
-You drink it up.
-Cheers.

361
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,660
Slide.

362
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,020
I am 97.

363
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,660
I know you, Zhou Yi.

364
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,580
-Drink with me.
-Cheers.

365
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,660
I… I can’t drink anymore.

366
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,780
Drink with me.

367
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,260
I can’t.

368
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,380
Weak.

369
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,180
Let’s drink. Let’s solo.

370
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,860
-Come on.
-You owe me one drink.

371
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Jing.

372
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,260
You know what?

373
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,780
The first time I went
to the AMC Village.

374
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,460
I saw him.

375
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,020
He opened the door naked.

376
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,940
My sister saw you naked?

377
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,300
She’s drunk.

378
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,460
That’s not true.

379
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,380
I felt like my sister took advantage
of you.

380
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,620
And you’re happy about it.

381
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,060
You like her, right?

382
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,980
I...

383
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,020
Let’s hail a taxi

384
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,980
and send everyone home.

385
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,100
Okay.

386
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,420
Ai Qing. Ai Qing.

387
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,460
Let’s go home. Go home.

388
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,540
Go home?

389
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,860
You come to my home.

390
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,140
Come to my home.

391
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,660
What are you talking about?

392
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,940
Why do you want Wu Bai to come
to our home during this time?

393
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,140
Go home with me.

394
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,700
Your gold medal is still at my home.

395
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,300
So that gold medal is yours.

396
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,820
Great.

397
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,260
Never mind.

398
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,420
How about you all come to our home?

399
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,100
There are only me
and my sister anyway.

400
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,540
No one else.

401
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,180
You

402
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,860
don’t live with your parents?

403
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
We used to live with our dad.

404
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,180
Mom passed away early.

405
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,860
We lived in that kind of old house.

406
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,700
There’s no elevator
and only one bedroom.

407
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,060
Dad gave us the bedroom.

408
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,820
He slept in the living room
for half a lifetime.

409
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,740
A few years ago,

410
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,380
my sister bought an apartment
with a bank loan.

411
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,740
She asked me to live with her

412
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,780
to make room for our dad.

413
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,860
Isn’t she pretty?

414
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,740
Yes.

415
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,340
Isn’t she nice?

416
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,860
Friendly, right?

417
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,820
Sometimes, being too nice
isn’t great.

418
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,180
The team dissolved at that time.

419
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,100
She still feels guilty about everybody.

420
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,180
Especially that...

421
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,780
What’s his name?

422
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,300
Han...

423
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,380
Han Shangyan.

424
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,660
Yes, him.

425
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,460
A man with such a dramatic name.

426
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,820
Let me hail a taxi.

427
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,020
We are all drunk.
The taxi may not carry us.

428
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,940
I’ll find a way.

429
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,860
Ai Qing.

430
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,780
Ai Qing.

431
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,340
Hello?

432
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,140
Hello, Han.

433
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,740
It’s me, Bai.

434
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,180
Get me a car.

435
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,700
It’s so late and you’re not back
to the club.

436
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,180
What are you doing out there?

437
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,740
I’ll be back tomorrow.

438
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,620
Get me a car.

439
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,740
Give me the address.

440
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,900
I’ll ask the driver to pick you up. Bye.

441
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,140
Wait a second.

442
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,460
What else?

443
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,460
Someone mentioned you just now.

444
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,100
She said that your name

445
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,860
is very dramatic.

446
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,580
You’re too bored.

447
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,860
Why talking about me?

448
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,660
Sir, let’s go.

449
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,780
Hang on.

450
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,380
I want to drink water.

451
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,780
Me too.

452
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,540
I have iced mineral water here.

453
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,300
Thank you.

454
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,020
Thanks, Zebra.

455
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,980
Sir, let’s go.

456
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,380
Zebra. Direct me
to Jiangsu West Road Community.

457
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,780
Wu Bai. Take my sister upstairs first.

458
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,100
I’ll go up to open the door.

459
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,460
Why is it so cold?

460
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,460
Jing.

461
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,300
Why aren’t we home yet?

462
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,620
Soon.

463
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,660
Are you okay?

464
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,580
Just hang on a second.

465
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,540
We’re getting there.

466
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,940
I’m gonna throw up.

467
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,980
We’re home soon.

468
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,340
Hang on a bit more.

469
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,300
Come in. Come in.

470
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,980
No need to change shoes.

471
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,580
That’s my sister’s room.

472
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,060
What...? What’s going on?

473
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,580
Dad?

474
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,500
Hello, sir.

475
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,820
Hi.

476
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,940
Hurry and get in the room.

477
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,620
Stop spinning. I’m dizzy.

478
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,980
Right there.

479
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,020
Stop spinning,

480
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,340
I may throw up later.

481
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,820
How did your sister

482
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,260
get this drunk?

483
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,860
We drank with some old friends.

484
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,420
Who are they?

485
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,660
Friends who she played with.

486
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,180
Some are her junior fellow apprentices.

487
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,100
I... I should go.

488
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,580
No. It’s already late.

489
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,020
Your base is far away in the suburb.

490
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,660
Don’t go now.

491
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,860
Stay here for the night.

492
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,940
Wait, wait.
You can go back tomorrow.

493
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,820
Who, who will he stay with?

494
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,820
Dad. All of them are drunk.

495
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,060
I’m worried.

496
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,780
Hurry up.

497
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,420
Let them come up together.

498
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,540
Go.

499
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,860
There are more?

500
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,580
Dad. Though they’re all men,

501
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,340
it’s a complicated world out there.

502
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,780
Drunk men can be taken advantages, too.

503
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,740
Really?

504
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,820
Really.

505
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,220
Especially those who are pretty.

506
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,300
Many of them have experienced it.

507
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,020
Are, are these guys pretty?

508
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,780
See for yourself later.

509
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,700
This room.

510
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,180
Put him there.

511
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,660
Where am I?

512
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,420
Your physical quality is not bad.

513
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,340
Do you exercise a lot?

514
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,540
I go for running sometimes.

515
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
Great.

516
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,580
There’s one left downstairs.

517
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,100
Let me carry him.

518
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,580
Wait, one more?

519
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,580
Cold. He’s cold.

520
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,420
Cover him with the blanket.

521
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,300
This kid is interesting.

522
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,780
Not bad looking.

523
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,940
He’s really pretty.

524
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,780
A girlish face on a boy.

525
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,900
Boys with girlish faces

526
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,420
are always lucky.

527
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,260
Where, where are we?

528
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,820
Sir. I live nearby.

529
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,220
Give me a ride.

530
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,940
No problem.

531
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,180
Please send him back.

532
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,580
Okay. I will.

533
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,300
Are you okay?

534
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,300
Let’s, let’s have one more drink.

535
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,820
Let’s go.

536
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,660
I’m a little cold.

537
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,700
Cold?

538
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,940
Why didn’t you wear more? Let’s go.

539
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,780
Wu Bai.

540
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,660
My dad asked for you.

541
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,460
Sir. You asked for me?

542
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,660
Come. Take a seat.

543
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,580
What kind of party did you have?

544
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,500
Everybody drank a lot.

545
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,580
A friend.

546
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,180
We met with a friend
who we haven’t seen for long.

547
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,060
Slide.

548
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,340
Slide? Slide was there, too?

549
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,100
Yes. You know him. Slide.

550
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,460
We haven’t met for so long.

551
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,940
We were happy,

552
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,180
so we drank a lot.

553
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,820
You drank too much
though you were happy.

554
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,060
Look how drunk your sister got.

555
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,300
They got drunk because they were happy.

556
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,700
You don’t believe me?

557
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,300
I’m calling Slide now.

558
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,300
Hey.

559
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,420
Slide.

560
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,460
Tell my dad

561
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,060
if the guys here

562
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,100
used to play with you
in the competitions?

563
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,820
Slide?

564
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,940
(Slide)
Hello, sir.

565
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,420
What kind of party was that?

566
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,820
Why is everybody so drunk?

567
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,340
I’m sorry, sir.

568
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,020
We haven’t met in years.

569
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,300
We got drunk after meeting again.

570
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,300
They were supposed to stay
at my home.

571
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,300
But there isn’t enough room.

572
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,700
(Slide)
That’s why they ended up at yours.

573
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,820
We used to compete together.

574
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,340
As for Wu Bai,

575
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,220
he won the championship

576
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,460
with Ai Qing in the AMC.

577
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,220
We are all nice people.

578
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,500
You drank a lot too, right?

579
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,060
Okay. I got it.

580
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,460
Drink some water. Go to bed early.

581
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,940
See you.

582
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,540
You see? I was right.

583
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,940
Dad. Aren’t you going to sleep?

584
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,060
How can I go back?

585
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,540
Those three got really drunk.

586
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,300
Can you two manage

587
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,820
if they throw up during the night?

588
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,060
But, there are so many people.

589
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,300
There’s no room for you to sleep.

590
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,220
Of course there’s room for me to sleep.

591
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,900
Wu Bai would be too embarrassed
to sleep if you stay.

592
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,420
If I stay here,

593
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,100
would you be embarrassed?

594
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,660
I...

595
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,460
Dad. We’re all grown-ups.

596
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,340
Leave us some privacy, please.

597
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,820
Are all of you

598
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,540
teammates?

599
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,420
Of course.

600
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,620
The gold medal at home belongs to him.

601
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,900
The gold medal in there is yours?

602
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,940
Fine. I’ll go home.

603
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,220
Well...

604
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,100
Wu Bai, isn’t it?

605
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,100
Please take care of here, okay?

606
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,420
Of course.

607
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,060
I’m going now, okay?

608
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,660
Wait. Sit down.

609
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,700
Sit. Sit. Sit.

610
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,940
Don’t stand up. You’re too tall.

611
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,940
Don’t come out.

612
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,420
Dad. Be careful on the way home.

613
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,300
Alright.

614
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,300
Take care, sir.

615
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,580
Well, prepare some water

616
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,100
for them near the bed.

617
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,740
Everybody got so drunk.

618
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,900
Alright. Don’t worry.

619
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,940
Keep some lights on.

620
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,380
Or someone may trip over
when going to the bathroom.

621
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,460
I got it.

622
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,940
Alright. I’m going.

623
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,180
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

624
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,620
Rest early.

625
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,020
Please don’t mind.

626
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,380
He’s a parent.
He worries too much.

627
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,940
It’s okay.

628
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,180
Your dad

629
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,540
is lovely.

630
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,980
I know, right?

631
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,620
I’ve got barbecue smell all over me.

632
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,340
Let me take a shower.

633
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,980
Help me to watch my sister.

634
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,180
Jing.

635
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,940
It’s too hot.

636
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,460
Wu Bai.

637
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,460
It’s me.

638
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,700
I’m so glad

639
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,020
that you’re back.

640
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,260
Glad?

641
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,820
You’re a genius.

642
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,300
It’d be a shame

643
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,860
if you don’t come back.

644
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,940
I see.

645
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,700
Let me tell you secretly.

646
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,500
Actually...

647
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,900
Actually, I’ve been wanting
to go back to that circle

648
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,780
for so long.

649
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,940
It’s been so long.

650
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,980
Three years ago,

651
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,180
when my sister decided to retire.

652
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,500
I asked her

653
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,100
if she’d regret it.

654
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,020
What did she say?

655
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,940
She told me not to ask her that
at that time

656
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,300
and ask her a few years later.

657
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,820
She had to try a different life.

658
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,260
I know it all.

659
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,580
She forwardly took care
of the pressure of life.

660
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,660
She paid for the house’s down payment

661
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,740
and monthly mortgage.

662
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,780
At that time,

663
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,420
she really needed a stable job.

664
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,700
To be honest,

665
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,260
I know that she couldn’t give up
robot fighting in her heart.

666
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,780
She couldn’t hide it.

667
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,940
If you want to come back,

668
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,700
I’ll come with you.

669
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,940
(Certificate of Honor)

670
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,180
(ARCT ROBOT CHAMPION)

671
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,140
Jing.

672
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,860
I’m thirsty.

673
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,860
Jing.

674
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,740
What are you doing?

675
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,940
I need water.

676
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,540
You can barely walk.

677
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,740
Sit there. I’ll pour for you.

678
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,420
Wu Bai.

679
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,420
Why are you still here?

680
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,660
I need water.

681
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,740
Hurry and pour me some water.

682
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,540
One more glass.

683
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,420
Are you okay?

684
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,740
Water.

685
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,260
Be honest with me.

686
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,300
Why would you defeat me

687
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,340
at the competition three years ago?

688
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,660
I, I didn’t mean it.

689
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,180
Then how come you know

690
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,500
so well of all of my moves?

691
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
Because I know you well.

692
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,900
Then why,

693
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,940
why did you leave

694
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,140
without saying good-bye?

695
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,940
Because I went abroad

696
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,900
for surgery.

697
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,740
Who is it?

698
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,020
Dad.

699
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,940
Morning, Jing.

700
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,540
Why do you come so early?

701
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,140
I brought breakfast.

702
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,500
Where are you going? Put it here.

703
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,940
Well. Fine.

704
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
Sir.

705
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,340
You’re still here.

706
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,540
Well...

707
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,300
Haven’t the rest of them woken up?

708
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,340
Five o’clock.

709
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,380
Normal people don’t wake up
this early.

710
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,140
Fine. Come on.

711
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,100
Let’s eat, eat breakfast.

712
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,300
Sir. I’m good.

713
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,780
No, you have to eat.

714
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,780
Breakfast is very important. Come.

715
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,300
I brought you disposable toothbrushes.

716
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,460
Brush your teeth.
Then we’ll have breakfast.

717
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,420
What was the arrangement last night?

718
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,020
I slept with my sister.

719
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,660
Which room?

720
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,100
What are you thinking, Dad?

721
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,980
What do you mean? Be serious.

722
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,900
Answer my question.

723
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,740
I slept with my sister in her room.

724
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,420
Those two guys slept in mine.

725
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,500
What about him?

726
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,020
He’s tall. He stayed on the couch.

727
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,300
Son.

728
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,740
Have you brushed you teeth?

729
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,260
Come out to eat breakfast.

730
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,340
I’m done.

731
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,220
Here. Sit here.

732
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,340
Where do you come from?

733
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,860
I was born in Guangzhou.

734
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,740
Guangzhou? It’s a great place.

735
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,340
People in Guangzhou love drinking tea.

736
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,460
Next time, I’ll take you out for tea.

737
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,220
Drink tea. Drink tea.

738
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,140
How are you?

739
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,260
Hello. Hello.

740
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,020
You can understand but can’t speak?

741
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,780
I think you are not good

742
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,900
at expressing yourself.

743
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,300
You should introduce yourself.

744
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,820
I’ve set an example for you.

745
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,060
What Dad means is

746
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,940
to introduce yourself to him in detail.

747
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,980
Hello, sir.

748
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,780

00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,900

00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,220
