19
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,380
What was the arrangement last night?

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,900
I slept with my sister.

21
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,580
Which room?

22
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,020
What are you thinking, Dad?

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,900
What do you mean? Be serious.

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,820
Answer my question.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,660
I slept with my sister in her room.

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,340
Those two guys slept in mine.

27
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,420
What about him?

28
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,940
He’s tall. He stayed on the couch.

29
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,220
Son.

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,660
Have you brushed you teeth?

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,180
Come out to eat breakfast.

32
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,260
I’m done.

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,140
Here. Sit here.

34
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,260
Where do you come from?

35
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,780
I was born in Guangzhou.

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,660
Guangzhou? It’s a great place.

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,260
People in Guangzhou love drinking tea.

38
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,380
Next time, I’ll take you out for tea.

39
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,140
Drink tea. Drink tea.

40
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,060
How are you?

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,140
Hello. Hello.

42
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,980
You can understand but can’t speak?

43
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,700
I think you are not good

44
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,820
at expressing yourself.

45
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,260
You should introduce yourself.

46
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,740
I’ve set an example for you.

47
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,980
What Dad means is

48
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,860
to introduce yourself to him in detail.

49
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,860
Hello, sir.

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,700
My name is Wu Bai.

51
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,820
I was born in Guangzhou
and lived in Norway.

52
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,220
I majored in Computing.

53
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,580
I just finished my postgraduate study
this year.

54
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,340
Now I’m going to settle in the homeland.

55
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,220
I am a…

56
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,420
Alright. Alright.

57
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,300
It is not a blind date.

58
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,900
Dad, why are you asking so much?

59
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,900
Fine then. Let’s have breakfast.

60
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,820
The pan-fried pork buns are so good.

61
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,340
Oh, yes. And the other two men.

62
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,340
Hurry to ask them to have breakfast.

63
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,500
It’s early now.

64
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,660
It’s breakfast, surely at early morning.

65
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,020
Get back after finishing the breakfast.

66
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,100
They haven’t been back for one night.

67
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,620
Their parents may feel worried.

68
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,380
I know.

69
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,980
Don’t use that.

70
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,620
It’s better to use

71
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,300
disposable stuff less often.

72
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,780
Just use your hands.

73
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,900
Alright.

74
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,620
Use your hands.

75
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,860
For pan-fried pork buns,

76
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,780
you need to take a small bite first.

77
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,140
There is soup inside.

78
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,700
And then you can take a sip.

79
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,580
Be careful. It’s hot.

80
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,740
That’s right.

81
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,300
Here you are.

82
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,740
Thanks, sir.

83
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,140
When did you go abroad?

84
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,820
I went abroad in my 10s.

85
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,420
How long have you been there?

86
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,700
I…

87
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,020
I finished my high school
and university study there.

88
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,780
Do you have a girlfriend?

89
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,540
Not yet.

90
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,940
How many exes do you have then?

91
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,020
-None.
-None?

92
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,540
Good. That’s good.

93
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,780
Here you are, sir.

94
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,900
Okay. Okay.

95
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,420
Eat more.

96
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,260
After you have the soup, take big bites.

97
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,580
Thank you for taking us in.

98
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,300
You’re welcome.

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,980
You’re Ai Qing’s junior fellows
after all.

100
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,500
Junior fellows?

101
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,620
I told my dad so,

102
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,340
or how can I take you in?

103
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,180
After she wakes up,

104
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,780
tell her to drink more honey water.

105
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,700
Okay.

106
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,660
Thanks.

107
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,660
She’s my sister. What the thanks for?

108
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,020
We’re leaving then.

109
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,460
Bye-bye.

110
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,180
What’re you doing?

111
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,140
Do you like me now?

112
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,620
This’s my home. Let go…

113
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,060
Yes

114
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,620
or no?

115
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,540
What if I say no?

116
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,660
You can’t say no.

117
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,380
Yes. A little bit.

118
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,940
It’s better than no anyway.

119
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,820
Alright. Go back.

120
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,700
Don’t mess up my hair.

121
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,380
I’m leaving.

122
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,900
Bye-bye.

123
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,100
Ai Jing.

124
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,620
I’ll call you.

125
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,540
Where am I?

126
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,780
You’re finally awake.

127
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,100
What’re you doing, Jing?

128
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,620
Wash the bed sheet.

129
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,260
Didn’t you wash it days ago?

130
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,660
You have mysophobia?

131
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,300
How can I not wash it
after it was used by drunks?

132
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,940
Why didn’t you change my clothes
for sleeping?

133
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,900
There were many males at home.

134
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,020
How did I change your clothes?

135
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,220
Males?

136
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,580
Who?

137
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,780
Wu Bai asked me to give you this.

138
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,820
Wu Bai?

139
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,500
You don’t remember it?

140
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,020
He took care of you for the night,

141
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,580
and took you to the floor.

142
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,540
You said Wu Bai came to our home
last night?

143
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,100
You really don’t remember it?

144
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,220
No, I don’t.

145
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,380
He stayed overnight at our home,

146
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,540
and had breakfast with Dad.

147
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,500
Why does Dad get involved?

148
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,100
Beg me.

149
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,260
Beg me and I’ll tell you.

150
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,740
What happened?

151
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,780
-Hi, Goddess.
-Hello, Goddess.

152
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,220
-Morning, Goddess.
-Goddess.

153
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,940
-Morning.
-Goddess.

154
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,740
-Hi, Goddess.
-Goddess.

155
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,860
Look.

156
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,260
Goddess, hi there.

157
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,780
What’s wrong with you guys?

158
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,020
Goddess, welcome to descend to the world.

159
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,060
You scare me.

160
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,220
I’ve got Goddess’s WeChat number finally!

161
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,860
Stop! Stop!

162
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,260
What’s your exaggeration for?

163
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,220
How can I be a Goddess?

164
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,540
I can only be counted

165
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,460
as a former player.

166
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,660
We don’t believe that.

167
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,540
The whole office has watched the video.

168
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,580
People are paying respects to you
through some activities.

169
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,820
I don’t care. You’re the most famous

170
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,260
people we know anyway.

171
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,140
We even have prepared a notebook
for your autograph.

172
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,420
Sign it. Sign it.

173
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,380
-Sign…
-Here.

174
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,380
Alright. Alright.

175
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,500
Alright. Stop kidding.

176
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,300
Boss is coming soon.

177
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,500
Ai Qing is busy.

178
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,020
Happy wedding! Na.

179
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,460
Thank you. So sweet.

180
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,980
But compared with this,

181
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,900
I’d rather have Appledog’s autograph.

182
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,140
You’re also kidding at me?

183
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,700
I’m not kidding.

184
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,900
Can’t you see I’ve tried so hard

185
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,220
to control myself?

186
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,060
I don’t care.

187
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,580
Just now I got you out
of the predicament.

188
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,380
This weekend,

189
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,300
you have to accompany me to go shopping.

190
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,260
This weekend?

191
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,100
I can’t.

192
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,860
I’ve promised to the kids

193
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,620
I would go camping with them.

194
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,420
Go camping?

195
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,660
For how many days?

196
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,220
We’ll go on Saturday and
be back on Sunday.

197
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,900
So it’s overnight.

198
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,020
So many kids.

199
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,900
You have to take care of them.

200
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,660
It’s okay. When they heard of it,

201
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,660
they were quite happy.

202
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,060
I’m also happy when hearing it.

203
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,780
Morning, Goddess.

204
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,020
Na, your milk tea.

205
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,660
Come on.

206
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,580
I have milk tea, too?

207
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,900
Sure.

208
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,780
Then…

209
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,380
Where’s Ai Qing’s?

210
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,700
Here.

211
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,820
More milk, more tea, and more pearls.

212
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,260
It’s customized for Appledog.

213
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,820
Please accept it.

214
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,300
It must be so expensive.

215
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,100
No.

216
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:34,980
Thank you for that.

217
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
Never mind.

218
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,940
Is it a promotion of buying one
and getting one free?

219
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,540
How can it be?

220
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,060
Well. Am I so poor?

221
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,300
It’s customized.

222
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,060
The price is 52.1 yuan.

223
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,980
The meaning of this number.

224
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,700
Figure it out yourself.

225
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,620
Well. Goddess.

226
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,500
I heard that you’re familiar

227
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,540
with Mr. Xiang.

228
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,420
He seemed to respect you so much.

229
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,020
I don’t know if you can say

230
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,220
some nice words for me, even one word.

231
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,580
Where’s the straw?

232
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,100
Coming right away.

233
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,260
52.1 yuan.

234
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,620
Figure it out yourself.

235
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,820
It’s yours.

236
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,740
I don’t want it either.

237
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,540
(Shen Zhe)
Call me back if you aren’t busy.

238
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,100
Let’s have dinner together.

239
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,100
Okay.

240
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,020
I’m going to get it ready then, Director.

241
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,340
Okay. Go.

242
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,740
Sorry, Director. I’m late.

243
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,420
Why’re you so late?

244
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,740
I was stuck in traffic on the way.

245
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,820
Traffic?

246
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,340
I have good news for you.

247
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
(Jane Eyer)

248
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,380
Well. I…

249
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,100
You’ll play as Jane Eyer this time.

250
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,580
Really?

251
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,100
So great!

252
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,740
Thanks, Director! Thank you!

253
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,020
-Okay. Okay.
-Thanks, Director!

254
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,420
Thank you!

255
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,580
-Be well prepared for that.
-Okay. Okay.

256
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,580
Go for it.

257
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,540
Go in this way.

258
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,340
Over there. You go from there.

259
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,220
Okay. Okay.

260
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,900
Congratulations.

261
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,220
Thank you.

262
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,500
This is for you.

263
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,540
Drinking in broad daylight?

264
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,340
To celebrate you have such a nice role.

265
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,060
Drink a little

266
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,220
to find a better status.

267
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,580
To my Jane.

268
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,300
Cheers, Mr. Rochester.

269
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,420
The simple robots

270
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,660
we are looking now

271
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,940
are completed by the kids themselves

272
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,660
under the guidance of mentors.

273
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,420
Compared to those formal

274
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,740
FMB competitions,

275
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,620
this kind of competition is more friendly.

276
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,820
It can cultivate the kids’

277
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,460
love for robot career,

278
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,540
and motivate their

279
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,380
creation and innovation.

280
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,420
You were the Goddess of FMB.

281
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,380
Are you truly willing

282
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,980
to be the training mentor

283
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,980
for the kids?

284
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,980
For the company,

285
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,580
it’s not a profitable project.

286
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,700
But for the kids,

287
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,180
it has a very important meaning.

288
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,300
And for me,

289
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,820
I’m so proud of it.

290
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,180
I heard from the manager that

291
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,700
you applied for taking the kids out?

292
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,420
Yes. It’s on this weekend.

293
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,780
I want to take them to

294
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,900
get more social experience.

295
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,860
Let’s take a look over there.

296
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,020
Okay.

297
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,980
Luo Hui, you’re going
to meet your dream boy.

298
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,900
Are you happy?

299
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,460
Sure.

300
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,700
Look, Luo Hui. Is it him?

301
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,860
Not him.

302
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,980
Why?

303
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,740
I think he’s handsome, too.

304
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,540
But he’s not tall enough.

305
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,020
You know how tall he is?

306
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,100
I think you’ve never seen him in person?

307
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,020
But I

308
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,220
took a measure with my height.

309
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,900
His legs were so long.

310
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,700
I was not even at his waist’s height.

311
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,980
So tall?

312
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,500
Yeah.

313
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,860
How about this one?

314
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,580
He’s tall.

315
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,620
And he’s looking for someone.

316
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,820
He must be looking for you.

317
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,420
Not him again.

318
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,660
When will he come?

319
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,380
I’m Wu Bai.

320
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,100
Hi, Wu Bai.

321
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,220
Sit.

322
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,540
A gift for you.

323
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,540
Do you like it?

324
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,260
Thanks, Wu Bai.

325
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,660
This is my classmate, Feiyan.

326
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,500
Hello, Wu Bai.

327
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,260
Hello.

328
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,420
What do you want to eat?

329
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,100
Open the gift.

330
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,780
It’s a toy robot!

331
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,340
It’s so cool.

332
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,780
We have an exact same in the base.

333
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,780
You can come at some time.

334
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,780
Okay. When my dad isn’t busy,

335
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,580
I’ll ask my dad to drive me there.

336
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,500
Wu Bai,

337
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,820
Feiyan and I joined

338
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
in FMB Teen Camp.

339
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,860
Yeah. We have

340
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,980
some small robots in the camp.

341
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,140
We’ll go camping

342
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,220
the day after tomorrow.

343
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,220
Are you?

344
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,940
Where are you going?

345
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,940
Here.

346
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,980
See if you know it.

347
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,820
(Camp location)

348
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,300
Here?

349
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,100
It’s close to our base.

350
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Really?

351
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
Then I can ask the teacher for leave

352
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,300
and go to find you. Is it okay?

353
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,100
Okay.

354
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,340
The takeout is 50 meters away.

355
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,860
Keep moving.

356
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,020
Hello.

357
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,340
Are you Mr. Wu?

358
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,540
Yes. I want my takeout.

359
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,740
Okay.

360
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,900
Bye.

361
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,500
Safe trip.

362
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,420
It’s a nice place.

363
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,900
But where’s

364
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,980
the door?

365
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,820
Make way, please.

366
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,940
Who are you?

367
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,580
I’m asking you!

368
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,780
Wait! Wait a minute!

369
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,660
Here is K&K Club.

370
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,820
Calling Wu Bai for you.

371
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,660
So you’re a tour guide.

372
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,380
You’re quite good.

373
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,580
And milk tea here.

374
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,900
It’s considerate. Thank you.

375
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,780
Stop. Not for you.

376
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,420
Was someone talking?

377
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,420
Is someone talking?

378
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,700
I was confused how come this robot

379
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,740
was so cool.

380
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,620
So it’s like you.

381
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,460
How’s my hairstyle today?

382
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,820
Just so so.

383
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,460
Bad taste.

384
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,340
Open the door.

385
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,060
Lead the road.

386
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,020
You climb the stairs.

387
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,060
I walk on the ground. See you later.

388
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,940
You walk so slowly. Follow me.

389
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,540
Welcome to K&K Club.

390
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,940
You’re the only guest K&K receives today.

391
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,820
It’s detected 97 is generating
light and heat.

392
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,260
Let’s go.

393
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,780
97, we have a guest.

394
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,740
Hello there.

395
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,740
What? Are you coming

396
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,380
to join in K&K today?

397
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,860
What? Don’t you welcome me?

398
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,700
Sure. Welcome!

399
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,340
You don’t look like welcoming me.

400
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,540
I do.

401
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,020
It’s interesting.

402
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,380
Does it have a name?

403
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,180
Wu Bai’s son.

404
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,100
Wu Liao. (Means boring in Chinese)

405
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,380
Wu Liao?

406
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,980
Wu Bai hopes he can be more interesting.

407
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,940
But he forgets his surname is Wu.

408
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,820
Well. Wu Liao.

409
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,300
Why would your owner’s

410
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,540
surname be Wu?

411
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,220
Wu Liao.

412
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,420
Sounds like it may affect one’s luck
to get love.

413
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,020
I’d like to call your nickname

414
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,660
Liao.

415
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,180
Only my daddy can change my name.

416
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,980
What’s the tempting smell?

417
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,860
Zhou Yi.

418
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,300
He must be cooking something nice.

419
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,660
I’ll show you. Go.

420
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,540
Go.

421
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,740
Zhou Yi! Shen Zhe is here!

422
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,220
Shen Zhe is here?

423
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,180
I just made the popcorn. So sweet.

424
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,980
You can taste it.

425
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,380
You know what? Zhou Yi is

426
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,420
making good dishes here…

427
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,020
You… What the heck?

428
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,220
Hello.

429
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,420
Your look now

430
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,300
is better than that of you just now.

431
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,140
-You…
-Don’t waste it.

432
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,260
It’s food.

433
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,580
It… It tastes good.

434
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,260
Zhou Yi made it? Good cooking skills.

435
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,100
Anyway,

436
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,260
welcome to join in K&K.

437
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,460
Shake hands again?

438
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,700
Don’t you think it’s weird for two men

439
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,460
to shake hands all the time?

440
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,380
If you really want to welcome me,

441
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,620
it’s your treat

442
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,580
to buy us a nice meal in a restaurant.

443
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,700
-Good idea.
-Good.

444
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,900
Let’s go to eat Earth Pot Chicken.

445
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,260
Sounds good.

446
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,620
I don’t have money.

447
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,220
Save that.

448
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,820
Where’s your money?

449
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,020
Someone tricked it away.

450
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,460
Really? How did he trick you?

451
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,100
Someone extorted 500 yuan
from me with photos.

452
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,380
Are you okay?

453
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,700
It’s only 500 yuan.

454
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,020
Is it worth you holding grudge on it?

455
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,820
Return me my money then.

456
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,020
What photo?

457
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,540
What money?

458
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,780
Nothing.

459
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,020
Back to business,

460
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,380
Coach came today.

461
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,860
Hurry to sign the contract.

462
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,220
Now?

463
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,300
What about the meal we mentioned?

464
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,020
Braised chicken is also okay.

465
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,500
Or Bobo’s Chicken.

466
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,460
Okay. I know.

467
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,460
Bye.

468
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,500
This is our coach, Su Cheng.

469
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,220
-Hello.
-Hello.

470
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,700
I’ve been busy with business trips.

471
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,300
So your contract hasn’t been signed.

472
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,380
Welcome to join in K&K.

473
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,300
Never mind. We can sign it anytime.

474
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,940
Didn’t you say

475
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,900
shaking hands is old-fashioned?

476
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,060
That’s for men.

477
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,740
Except for beauties.

478
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,500
Wu Bai, I have something to tell you.

479
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,780
Come with me.

480
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,460
Please have a seat.

481
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,300
Okay.

482
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
You really give me a big surprise.

483
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,980
Shen Zhe’s joining in is like

484
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,220
adding wings to a tiger for K&K.

485
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,740
I want to talk with you about his salary.

486
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,980
I’m thinking to give him the same
with 97’s.

487
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,540
As the second hand of the team.

488
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,020
According to 97’s contract…

489
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,460
Share half of my salary to him.

490
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,900
Yours?

491
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,500
Half?

492
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,780
You don’t need to spend the money.

493
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,460
The club should do.

494
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,980
The club is newly initiated.

495
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,020
Money can be spent at anywhere.

496
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,340
Don’t argue with me.

497
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,860
Don’t tell him this.

498
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,020
You’ve decided it?

499
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,180
Fine. You’re the Captain.

500
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,780
You have the right to make decisions.

501
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,220
Your contract.

502
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
What’s wrong? What’s the problem?

503
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,580
So Wu Bai

504
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,500
really agrees to give me his half salary?

505
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,500
Yes.

506
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,740
But he told me to keep it from you.

507
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,100
Okay.

508
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,460
(Party B Shen Zhe)

509
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,060
You’re in charge of finance, right?

510
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,220
Yes.

511
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,860
Well.

512
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,660
You don’t need to give me the money.

513
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,100
Set up a reserve fund

514
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,700
for K&K.

515
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,780
I can talk to the accountant.

516
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,340
But you two

517
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,180
really confuse me.

518
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,860
Though I shouldn’t take this money,

519
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,980
once thinking I’m gaining
petty advantages from him,

520
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,220
I’m kind of happy.

521
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,820
Put down the pen.

522
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,460
Sorry.

523
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,860
It’s a habit.

524
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,740
-Nice to work with you.
-Nice to work with you.

525
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,860
You’re the host now.

526
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,500
Guys,

527
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,660
from today on,

528
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,100
K&K Club has fully teamed up.

00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,500
Welcome to join in K&K.

530
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,260

nor history,

537

or those

538
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,820
stirring legends and stories.

539
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,100
It’s a brand-new team.

540
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,220
From inside and out, all are new here,

541
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,860
including me as the Captain.

542

But I hope…

00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,740
I hope we can

544
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,740
create a miracle next year.

545
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,100
A brand-new team.

546
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,580
It’s completely started from scratch.

547
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,100
It’ll fight to the end
and win a championship for China!

I don’t want to waste your time.

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,740
You can go back to your training now.

554
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,100
I never know

555
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,940
Captain is quite eloquent.

556
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,460
Sure he is.

557
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,980
From today on,

558
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,980
we’re brothers.

I’m relieved
when seeing you are so united.

570
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,820
Shen Zhe’s contract has been signed.

571
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,020
I need to report to Boss now.

572
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,260
You guys have fun.

573
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,140
Bye, Coach.

574
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,220
Bye.

575
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,700
Captain,

576
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,940
the Earth Pot Chicken tonight,

577
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,500
I think it’s necessary to go there.

578
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,540
Go.

579
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,180
Yeah. Bobo’s Chicken is also okay.

580
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,260
I have a date.

581
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,620
I can’t be with you.

582
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,780
If Shen Zhe is hungry,

583
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,660
take him to have a casual dinner.

584
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,180
Captain, he’s a guest anyway.

585
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,710
Will it be too casual?

586
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,940
That's right.

587
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,700
He’s not a guest anymore.

588
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,620
He’s one of us.

589
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,700
One of us.

590
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,740
Captain, one of us, right?

591
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,020
-He’s one of us.
-Yeah. One of us.

592
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,220
Well.

593
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,020
How about we...?

594
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,620
Then you order takeout.

595
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,980
I want one, too.

596
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,100
Thanks, we go training first.

597
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,300
I…

598
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,540
Let’s drink, buddy.

599
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,140
Are you going out tomorrow?

600
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,420
I’ll take the kids to an outing.

601
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,140
Cold medication, band-aids, lollipops.

602
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,820
It’s fully prepared.

603
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,300
Just in case.

604
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,300
Well.

605
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,420
An excellent player like you,

606
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,060
engages in

607
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,300
the career of taking care of kids,

608
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,180
with no grudge.

609
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,340
Do you remember I played games
when I was young?

610
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,980
It was tough indeed.

611
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,700
No one supported or understood me.

612
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,860
All players were doing
out of their hobby.

613
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,300
No systemized

614
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,100
or specialized education was given.

615
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,820
So you want to be their guide?

616
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,340
Though they are young now,

617
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,860
maybe

618
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,300
the future star of MMA

619
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,260
will be one of them.

620
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,260
Really?

621
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,220
Are they as good as Shen Zhe and Wu Bai?

622
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,900
Sure.

623
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,740
But,

624
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,660
even if they can’t be a professional player,

625
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,460
all this is also very meaningful.

626
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,260
Think about it. If kids can learn
from young age,

627
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,940
there will be more people

628
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,780
knowing MMA.

629
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,980
One day,

630
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,140
it will not be a niche sport anymore.

631
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,300
Maybe

632
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,340
one or two kids will be a scientist

633
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,220
in structural mechanics or materialogy.

634
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,900
I will definitely support your career.

635
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,100
We can’t delay cultivating

636
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,900
the future scientists.

637
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,260
Tell me. What can I do for you?

638
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,980
Then please

639
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,780
wash the bowls for me.

640
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,980
Thanks, Jing.

641
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,180
No problem.

642
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,540
Luo Hui, look.

643
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,060
It’s a mechanical dog I design.

644
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,620
It’s better than Miss Ai’s design.

645
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,020
How can it be better than Miss Ai’s?

646
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,700
It is better than Miss Ai’s.

647
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,660
Miss Ai. Look.

648
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,140
Xiaogang designed it days ago.

649
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,220
He said it’s better than yours.

650
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,500
Let me see.

651
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,540
Dynamic balance system program.

652
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,780
The assembling and movement
of mechanical skeleton.

653
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,420
Follow dynamic target objects.

654
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,660
They’re the three questions Xiaogang
has been wanting to solve, right?

655
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,100
How can you know just by one look…?

656
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,900
So she’s our teacher.

657
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,020
She’s the best in the world.

658
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,340
No. The second in the world.

659
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,900
Who’s the best then?

660
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,060
The best…

661
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,020
It’s your dream boy.

662
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,940
-Your dream boy!
-Your dream boy!

663
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,420
-No!
-Yes!

664
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,300
Not my dream boy.

665
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Butterflies there!

666
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,180
Don’t run around!

667
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,980
Be safe!

668
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,100
Okay!

669
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,620
Hello, sir.

670
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,980
Sorry, Miss Ai Qing.

671
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,020
The car is malfunctioning.

672
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,500
The car doesn’t work?

673
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,660
Well. When can you come today?

674
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,020
It can’t be fixed today.

675
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,900
How about tomorrow morning?

676
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,940
I’ll be there tomorrow morning.

677
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,580
Sorry. I’m so sorry.

678
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,100
Alright. It’s okay.

679
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,780
Bye.

680
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,180
Miss Ai Qing. Miss Ai Qing.

681
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,140
When can we eat?

682
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,580
Wait a minute.

683
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,540
I’ll go to find you something to eat.

684
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,620
Okay.

685
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,420
I have nothing to eat.

686
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,900
Me either.

687
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,940
How about I call Wu Bai

688
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,980
and ask him to send us some?

689
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,580
Okay. Go call him quickly.

690
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,060
My cellphone is out of power.

691
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,740
How about I go to borrow
Miss Ai Qing’s cellphone?

692
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,580
Yeah. Go now.

693
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,620
Okay.

694
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,780
You see it? Like this.

695
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,060
Yes.

696
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,020
How’s it?

697
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,340
It’s nice.

698
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,340
The mecha attacks the same type

699
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,780
with that of the mecha I used before.

700
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,460
But its attack force and operability
are better.

701
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,820
Actually I like how it looks more.

702
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,660
It’s cool and suits me better.

703
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,780
Zhou Yi designed the performance
and programmed its dynamics.

704
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,860
Good for you, Zhou Yi.

705
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,740
You’re kind of talented.

706
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,700
Actually I can do better.

707
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,900
Do you feel flattered

708
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,740
when hearing Shen Zhe’s praise?

709
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,980
No.

710
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,660
How would I be flattered?

711
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,900
What’re you doing?

712
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,220
You’re leaving?

713
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,660
You try to escape?

714
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,380
I’m telling you.

715
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,900
We have to

716
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,860
decide who’s the winner today,

717
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,580
so that the entire K&K knows

718
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,220
who is the real king.

719
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,940
You are really a sunflower.

720
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,700
What does that mean?

721
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,700
You just bloom with the sun.

722
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,980
How’s it?

723
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,020
Are you satisfied with the machine?

724
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,660
Zhou Yi and 97 will help you improve

725
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,500
if anything is troubling you.

726
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,540
No. It’s smooth.

727
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,460
I know you’ll say so.

728
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,580
We not only watched
your competition videos

729
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,860
to learn your operation habits,

730
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,820
-and this…
-And what?

731
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,060
Your arrogant character.

732
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,420
We made a mecha specially for you

733
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,940
according to your characters.

734
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,460
Thanks for your time then.

735
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,820
How do you feel?

736
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,980
Can you feel warmth flow to your heart?

737
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,700
I think you

738
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,580
have planned on me for long, haven’t you?

739
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,580
Haven’t you?

740
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,140
The commonest mecha

741
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,700
takes at least a month
from its designing to building.

742
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,580
Not to say this

743
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,580
mecha that’s customized to a player.

744
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,220
We have to do early arrangement work.

745
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,220
What if I didn’t come?

746
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,100
I know

747
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,580
you’ll come.

748
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,060
It’s your scheme.

749
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,700
Your scheme indeed.

750
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,420
Looks like Captain loves you truly.

751
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,380
Thank him then.

752
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,260
Give the robot a name now.

753
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,340
It’s hoary color in round shape.

754
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,780
It uses its high-speed revolution

755
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,180
to destroy all subjects touching it.

756
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,420
I’d like to call him Trash Can.

757
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,580
Trash Can?

758
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,900
The elder brother is called Nobody.

759
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,980
And now the junior is called Trash Can.

760
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,180
My poor kids.

761
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,860
What’s the meaning?

762
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,620
Trash should be thrown into Trash Can.

763
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,260
I’ll use it to sort all the trash

764
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,460
in competitions.

765
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,060
Grunt as you are!

766
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,260
Arrogant enough.

767
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,060
97.

768
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,180
Schedule him a practical test
as soon as possible.

769
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:43,820
Okay.

770
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,900
Do you need to change the drive parts?

771
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,380
I don’t think so.

772
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,620
Though Trash Can’s drive parts
are normal,

773
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,940
his specialty is not running

774
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,580
but to make his opponents
have no way to run.

775
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,220
Moreover,

776
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,020
my skills can be a strong support.

777
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,340
I’m testing the mecha’s strength.

778
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,820
Add in a smart mixed control part.

779
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,940
Coming. Coming.

780
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,860
Quick. Quick.

781
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,700
(Wu Bai)

782
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,140
Miss Ai Qing knows Wu Bai?

783
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,500
(Frigg)

784
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,260
Answer it.

785
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,780
Who is it?

786
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,420
Do you know you’re sweating?

787
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,100
Yeah, Captain. It’s been ringing for long.

788
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,700
Maybe it’s emergent.

789
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,820
Or I can answer it for you.

790
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,260
I’ll answer it myself.

791
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,860
Hello.

792
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,300
Hello.

793
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,060
Wu Bai. I’m Luo Hui.

794
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,260
Where’re you?

795
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,500
We’re in the camping site.

796
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,780
Come quickly. Get us some food.

797
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,780
December.

798
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,220
Why are they all expired?

799
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,620
How to cook?

800
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,900
Miss Ai. Miss Ai.

801
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,140
I’m done with using the cellphone.

802
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,980
Put it there.

803
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,900
-I’m leaving.
-Okay.

804
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,860
Luo Hui.

805
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,340
How about eating roasted potatoes later?

806
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,860
Is it good?

807
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,420
Yes. Go.

808
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,740
Okay.

809
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,540
What will be inside?

810
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,860
Let’s go in to have a check.

811
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,060
Okay.

812
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,100
There’re ducks.

813
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,420
Yeah.

814
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,180
It’s my first time seeing real ducks.

815
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,620
So cute.

816
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,820
Look.

817
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,180
The chicks are so cute.

818
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,740
So cute.

819
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,620
Look over there.

820
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,980
Look. It’s black.

821
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,500
-So cute.
-Look. That one.

822
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,980
So cute.

823
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,340
I want to touch it so much.

824
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,140
Wait a minute.

825
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,900
What if they go out?

826
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,340
Just one touch.

827
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,500
Look how cute they are.

828
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,980
Don’t you want to touch them?

829
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,260
Well.

830
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,380
Just one touch then.

831
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,660
There’re eggs.

832
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,220
You see it?

833
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,260
What should we do?

834
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,540
What should we do?

835
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,620
What should we do? They’re out.

836
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,860
Let’s catch them back.

837
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,980
What should we do if Miss Ai Qing comes?

838
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,060
Go. Go out. Go.

839
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,060
Go. Go. Out.

840
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,140
-Go.
-Go out. Go.

841
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,700
Go out. Go out.

842
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,380
-Go out.
-Quickly.

843
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,380
-Help, Miss Ai!
-Miss Ai!

844
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,740
My God.

845
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,860
Oh, my God.

846
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,900
Alright. Alright.

847
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,860
It’s okay.

848
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,580
How come they all come out?

849
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,180
Go out first. Out.

850
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,500
Go out first.

851
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,460
Oh my God.

852
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,700
Go home. Go home.

853
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,100
Get in.

854
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,980
Go. Go.

855
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,420
There. Go home.

856
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,300
Go home. Go home.

857
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,820
Follow my orders.

858
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,380
Go home.

859
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,900
Get in.

860
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,620
