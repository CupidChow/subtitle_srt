It doesn’t work.

Jing, why didn’t you...

21
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,570
Hi.

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,180
Close, close the door.

23
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,020
Sorry.

24
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,130
Continue. Sorry, sorry.

25
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,210
Continue.

26
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,670
I’ll continue then.

27
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,490
Get up.

28
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,740
Alright. You should go.

29
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,420
Where should I go?

30
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,420
Go back.

31
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,530
We haven’t finished.

32
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,210
Go.

33
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,310
Go.

34
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,740
Tell me you’re not mad anymore.

35
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,660
Are you still mad?

36
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,330
Go.

37
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,540
Fine.

38
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,610
You’re not mad, right?

39
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,820
Give me a smile.

40
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,570
Smile.

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,130
I’m leaving.

42
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,330
Adjust your clothes.

43
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,740
See you, madam.

44
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,970
Come for dinner on the third day
of the new year.

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,330
I’ll break with you
if you dare to be late.

46
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,420
Okay.

47
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,850
Bye, sister-in-law.

48
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,180
Welcome again.

49
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,100
Okay.

50
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,410
Jing,

51
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,410
it’s the daytime.

52
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,330
Why did you do that without closing

53
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,410
the window or the door?

54
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,690
None of your business.

55
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,190
Remember to lock the door next time.

56
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,850
Let me ask you.

57
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,470
How did you chase Nian at that time?

58
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,490
Grandpa, why are you asking me this?

59
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,860
It’s not your business.

60
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,620
Just answer my question.

61
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,860
Well...

62
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,660
I texted her, casually cared for her.

63
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,330
Asked her out

64
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,910
to the supermarket
for some food and drinks.

65
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,860
Wait... Slow down. I...

66
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,690
Keep, keep going.

67
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,580
Well... I sat at her door
in the middle of the night

68
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,780
and pretended to be sad.

69
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,750
These, these are cheap shots.

70
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,390
You were keeping her up. Oh my god.

71
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,140
Wait... Wait.

72
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,220
Did it work?

73
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
Of course.

74
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,900
Okay. Keep going.

75
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,830
You want more?

76
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,700
Well... I sometimes played games

77
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,340
or went to the mall with her.

78
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,780
Grandpa.

79
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,900
Why are you asking me exactly?

80
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,340
Hello, this is the exchanged size
that you ordered.

81
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,130
Thank you.

82
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,190
You’re welcome.

83
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,860
Good morning.

84
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,420
Good morning.

85
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,060
New clothes?

86
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,390
No, the old one was too big.
I exchanged the size.

87
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,180
All are exchanged clothes?

88
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,050
Exchanging is pretty convenient now.

89
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,030
(Fortune)

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,620
You bought so many things.

91
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,450
Are we expecting guests?

92
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,390
I told you.

93
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,830
Shen Zhe is coming for dinner
on the third day of the new year.

94
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,220
Today is the New Year’s Eve.

95
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,010
You already start to prepare
for that day.

96
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,330
I get busy visiting relatives
during the festival.

97
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,270
So I prepared beforehand.

98
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,500
To be honest,

99
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,300
seems like all these food
you’ve prepared

100
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,460
is for serving kids.

101
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,460
Don’t laugh at me.

102
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,550
But seriously, Qing.

103
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,050
Shen Zhe is nice.

104
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,450
He’s outgoing, kind and energetic.

105
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,660
What do you say?
Why don’t you take a shot, too?

106
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,020
As long as you’re happy

107
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,990
and cherish him.

108
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,430
By the way.

109
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,110
Shen Zhe said Wu Bai is staying
at Shanghai for the festival, too.

110
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,620
He’s bringing him over for dinner, too.

111
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,390
Worried? You can’t let go?

112
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,330
Why should I be worried?

113
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,420
I welcome them.

114
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,550
I’ll give each of them

115
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,460
a red packet.

116
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,430
That’s generous.

117
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,830
It’s boring.

118
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,840
There’s no atmosphere
of the festival at all.

119
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,950
Nice. Paying me a New Year call
at the right time.

120
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,220
Happy New Year.

121
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,600
Happy New Year.

122
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,670
Where are you?

123
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,060
Where can I be?

124
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,430
I’m at K&K Club.

125
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,620
How’s the club decorated?

126
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,550
Does it have an atmosphere of New Year?

127
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,550
The point is,

128
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,340
is there anyone cooking
the New Year’s Eve dinner for you?

129
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,830
Nobody.

130
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,740
I cooked instant noodles by myself.

131
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,020
Poor you.

132
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,710
It’s okay.
Come to my home sometime,

133
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,870
I’ll ask dad to cook for you.

134
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,220
Are you inviting me over now?

135
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,430
What do you think?

136
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,270
It’s a deal. Don’t cancel on me.

137
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,670
What do you like to eat?

138
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,430
Do you want...

139
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,300
Spicy food? Sichuan Cuisine?

140
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,500
Or... Regular cuisine?

141
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,350
Happy New Year.

142
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,070
(Fortune)

143
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,270
Come in.

144
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,240
Still up?

145
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,390
What’s up?

146
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,670
Let’s have a meeting since you’re up.

147
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,400
Before the teleconference,

148
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,960
let’s have a meeting
on behalf of the Chinese Zone.

149
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
Alright.

150
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,630
Be ready for a three-year loss of money.

151
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,960
Working with you,

152
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,920
I should be prepared
for a five-year loss.

153
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,400
Great.

154
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,360
You’ve learned to be prepared
for danger in times of safety.

155
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,280
That’s it?

156
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,790
You came to talk about losing money
on New Year’s Eve?

157
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,040
Then what?

158
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,510
Let’s talk about Ai Qing?

159
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,550
Time for the teleconference.

160
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,120
You’re being shy.

161
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,110
I don’t want to talk
about personal stuff with you.

162
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,160
We only talk about

163
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,720
working between us.

164
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,870
But we’re at home.

165
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,160
It’s the same.

166
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,160
I don’t want to talk about her with you.

167
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,430
Do you know why she
turned you down?

168
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,310
Because of you.

169
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,920
Not entirely.

170
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,070
Also because of Xiaomi and Ou Qiang.

171
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,400
Okay.

172
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,970
It’s not okay.

173
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,280
You’re always tough
on threatening me all day.

174
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,550
How come you’re being
such a coward to Ai Qing?

175
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,960
Do you know what to do?

176
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,510
Bai.

177
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,550
Ai Qing is more coward than you

178
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,510
on dealing with relationships.

179
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,070
All these years,

180
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,160
she felt that she owed it to us a lot.

181
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,630
But in fact,

182
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,810
we’ve never blamed her.

183
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,800
The barriers in her heart,

184
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,720
I’m afraid you need to accompany her

185
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,850
to overcome them one-by-one.

186
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,810
Don’t crave for love

187
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,360
like a child thirsting for candies.

188
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,800
You should

189
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,920
stand by her side

190
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,970
as a comparative match

191
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,920
and a man.

192
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,630
Okay.

193
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,960
Go back to business.

194
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,280
Has the Chinese Zone joined us?

195
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,990
We’re here.

196
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,880
Me and Wu Bai.

197
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,480
I’m taking off.

198
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,600
For what?

199
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,550
It’s personal.

200
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,970
Leave me alone.

201
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,630
Grandpa.

202
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,250
Come here.

203
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,240
A red packet from me.

204
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,170
I wish you to find a girlfriend
that you like.

205
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,870
Thank you, Grandpa.

206
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,510
But I...

207
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,280
No. There’s no but.

208
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,440
Chasing girls requires

209
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,670
patience and perseverance.

210
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,200
Sometimes you need

211
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,960
to be shameless.

212
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,190
Does it work?

213
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,680
Of course.

214
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,920
In the past,

215
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,640
that’s how I chased

216
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,200
your grandmother.

217
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,870
Well... Surely

218
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,840
it depends on the actual situation.

219
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,080
Be flexible.

220
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
I got it.

221
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,480
Thank you, Grandpa.

222
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,850
That’s right.

223
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,870
Bye, Grandpa.

224
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,410
Surplus year after year.

225
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,750
(Full of vigor Bring in wealth
and treasure Surplus year after year)

226
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,850
How come she’s still not here?

227
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,050
-I’m coming.
-Come here.

228
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,200
I’ve been waiting for you for so long.

229
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,730
-That’s right.
-I’m sorry. Traffic jam.

230
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,190
I told you not to be late
for the fans’ meeting.

231
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,640
-I’m sorry.
-What if we miss Hu Xia?

232
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,000
We’ve been waiting for long.

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,760
Is this the board you made

234
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,880
that you mentioned?

235
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,760
(Hu Xia)
Yeah. Isn’t it nice?

236
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,110
-It’s pretty.
-Did you make it by yourself?

237
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,490
You’re so talented.

238
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,330
(Hu Xia)

239
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,930
If what happened

240
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,680
three years ago was a shame.

241
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,120
Right now,

242
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,080
I somehow sense
the obvious disappointment

243
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,320
in my heart.

244
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
I know.

245
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,290
I’ve fallen in love with a boy
named Wu Bai.

246
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,320
When I realize this,

247
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,080
I’ve lost him already.

248
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,230
(Year-end Sale Low Price Paradise)

249
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,080
Hello.

250
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,810
-Hello.
-I’d like both of them.

251
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,760
Okay.

252
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,640
Please pay here.

253
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,200
I’ll wrap them up for you.

254
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,570
No.

255
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,080
Well,

256
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,490
can you open up all the chocolates

257
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,860
for me?

258
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,320
You want the notes wrapped within?

259
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,380
Yes.

260
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,050
I only need one note.

261
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,080
Which one exactly?

262
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,730
(I’ve met everybody in this world,
you are the only one I fall for.)

263
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,880
I understand.

264
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,410
You don’t have to open them all.

265
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,080
The numbers underneath match

266
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,260
with the content of the notes.

267
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,250
As long as finding the specific number,

268
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,850
you can locate the sentence you want.

269
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,050
Wait a second. Let me look for you.

270
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,500
The note within would
be the one you asked for.

271
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,970
Thank you.

272
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,850
Sir.

273
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,680
You’ve paid for both of the jars.

274
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,880
Don’t you want them?

275
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,250
They are yours.

276
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,560
Hurry up, guys.

277
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,410
-Are you okay?
-Excuse me.

278
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,000
-I’m okay.
-Sorry.

279
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,370
Sorry.

280
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,910
(Hu Xia)

281
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,650
-I’m fine.

Han.

297
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,450
I want to have the surgery immediately.

298
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,560
I will never

299
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,650
let anything happen to you.

300
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,900
Never.

301
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,050
Do you understand?

302
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,620
What a coincidence

303
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,410
to meet you here.

304
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,860
I’m sorry that I didn’t make it

305
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,270
to the concert three years ago.

306
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,980
Sorry.

307
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,570
It’s okay.

308
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,690
It has passed for so long.

309
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,030
I actually made it to the concert

310
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,790
three years ago.

311
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,780
But suddenly something went wrong
with my eyes.

312
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,450
So I left.

313
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,660
It was serious.

314
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,410
I could be temporarily blind.

315
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,870
Not only on the day of the concert,

316
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,270
it started even earlier

317
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,050
on the night at the beach.

318
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,550
I left without saying goodbye
for surgery.

319
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,820
It was a risky surgery.

320
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,330
It failed on the first time.

321
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,980
Han Shangyan took me
to different hospitals.

322
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,670
There were three surgeries in total.

323
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,060
I remained blind off and on

324
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,210
for a year.

325
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,540
After that,

326
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,690
I promised grandpa out of guilt
to stay with him

327
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,180
and finish studying
if the surgery succeeded.

328
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,570
That’s why I didn’t come back

329
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,150
for three whole years.

330
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,060
I opened a whole jar of chocolates
that night.

331
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,270
But I didn’t find the sentence I wanted.

332
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,170
I guessed

333
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,690
that maybe God doesn’t even want
to help me.

334
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,390
There’s one last chance.

335
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,460
I’ll leave it to you.

336
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,140
By the way,

337
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,940
Han Shangyan’s been fine
all these years.

338
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,620
Don’t push yourself too much.

339
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,580
Go home early.

340
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,550
Happy New Year.

341
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,220
Happy New Year.

342
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,790
Since I was fifteen,

343
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,180
I’ve been working hard to be qualified

344
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,660
to stand by your side.

345
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,620
I believe that I’ll keep going

346
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,580
until I’m able to experience

347
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,900
all the failures and honors with you

348
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,420
side by side.

349
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,720
(I’ve met everybody in this world,
you are the only one I fall for.)

350
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,820
I’ve met everybody in this world.

351
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,870
You are the only one I fall for.

352
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,160
(I’ve met everybody in this world,
you are the only one I fall for.)

353
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,880
Staring at the chocolate paper?

354
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,340
I’ve met everybody in this world.

355
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,870
You are the only one I fall for.

356
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,150
Magical.

357
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,310
What does it mean?

358
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,940
It’s the will of heaven.

359
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,270
Aren’t you moved at all?

360
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,790
Do you want

361
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,910
to stay single forever?

362
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,920
Or... Do you have concerns?

363
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,760
We work in the same industry.

364
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,300
If we are together,

365
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,030
people will say it influences
the competition.

366
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,820
Let alone if we break up.

367
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,940
Plus,

368
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,310
I think he’s too outstanding.

369
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,340
Not only because he’s got many fans,

370
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,230
but also I think the entire industry,

371
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,110
all the clubs are focusing on him.

372
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,340
Stop.

373
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,460
I’ve got only one question.

374
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,400
Do you like him or not?

375
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,000
It’s not that simple.

376
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,340
It’s not that complicated, either.

377
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,680
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

378
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,390
I used to think it’s not
that complicated, too.

379
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,510
So what if you like him?

380
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,000
So what if you love him?

381
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,460
But now it’s different.

382
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,990
He’s the captain of K&K.

383
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,750
I’m leader of SP.

384
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,220
I don’t want to influence everybody

385
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,870
due to my personal life.

386
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,670
Don’t find yourself these excuses.

387
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,160
Let me ask you one thing.

388
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,430
Do you like him or not?

389
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,260
(The five blessings have descended
upon on the house)

390
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,190
Happy New Year, Bai.

391
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,180
If you have no plan for the New Year,

392
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,110
come to Ai Jing’s home with me.

393
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,460
You come for Ai Qing.
I come for Ai Jing.

394
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,580
We can also pay

395
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,990
our future father-in-law a visit.

396
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,920
What a great opportunity.

397
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,280
No.

398
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,040
Why not?

399
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,820
Listen to me.

400
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,700
You’ve got to seize the chance

401
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,830
to be nice to Ai Qing.

402
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,520
Ease your relationship.

403
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,950
Show her your heart

404
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,230
as well as your sincere love.

405
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,800
Do you have anything else to say?

406
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,460
Otherwise I’m hanging up.

407
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,880
I do. Wait a second.

408
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,470
You can choose not to go.

409
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,160
Well...

410
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,640
Lend, lend me your car.

411
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,150
What’s that for?

412
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,220
I’m taking Ai Jing
to somewhere romantic

413
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,750
and show her my heart.

414
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,920
Whatever.

415
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,430
Come tomorrow for the car.

416
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,520
It’s a great opportunity
to visit Ai Qing

417
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,070
during New Year.

418
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,350
Why wouldn’t he go?

419
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,710
No.

420
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,510
I need to come up with a plan.

421
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,470
Hello, kid.

422
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,400
Wu Bai.

423
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,520
I’m here for the car key, Wu Bai.

424
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,160
Hi.

425
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,470
What’s wrong?

426
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,430
Thanks.

427
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,710
Zhe.

428
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,830
Grandpa, you’re here.

429
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,710
Hello, Grandpa.

430
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,710
-Come here more often.
-Okay.

431
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,400
Grandpa, I’ll go up first.

432
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,710
Alright.

433
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,950
I’ll see you, Grandpa.

434
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,350
Zhe.

435
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,280
Do you have Ai Qing’s address?

436
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,040
Yes.

437
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,520
Send it to me.

438
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,710
Copy that.

439
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,880
A bus is approaching

440
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,240
30 meters along on the left front.

441
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,800
A take-out motorcycle

442
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,880
is 80 meters away on the right rear.

443
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,470
Green light in three seconds.

444
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,880
Old man passes by, please give way.

445
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,280
Thank you.

446
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,640
Old man passes by, please give way.

447
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,470
Thank you.

448
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,760
Excuse me, Sir.

449
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,070
You can’t

450
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,950
bring it to the mall.

451
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,830
Why not?

452
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,800
It’s the mall’s regulation.

453
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,600
Where are they?

454
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,160
Please take a look at here.

455
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,650
It’s, it’s not a pet.

456
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,110
Then it’s...?

457
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,230
It’s just like that.

458
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,640
A battery bank?

459
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,520
Yeah, a bigger one.

460
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,000
-A large-size battery bank?
-Yeah.

461
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,110
Welcome. Have fun shopping.

462
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,240
Okay. Thank you.

463
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,470
Let’s go.

464
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,760
Hello.

465
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,160
How may I help you?

466
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,200
I’d like to check on gold bracelets.

467
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,410
Okay.

468
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,400
These are

469
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,240
the latest styles of the season.

470
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,810
They’re very popular.

471
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,350
Let me see that one.

472
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,570
Is it a gift to your wife?

473
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,680
No... It’s a first-time gift
to my granddaughter-in-law.

474
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,680
May I ask

475
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,110
how old she is?

476
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,810
She’s in the twenties.

477
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,070
If it’s for a young lady,

478
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,200
she may not like this kind of style.

479
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,470
Really?

480
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,200
What styles would they like?

481
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,810
Young girls

482
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,810
are fond of special designs.

483
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,690
For example, you can design

484
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,080
a string of beads based
on personal preference.

485
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,600
There are rose quartz,

486
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,410
agates, colored glaze beads,

487
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,810
and gold beads which
are very popular this year.

488
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,800
I see, very nice.

489
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,120
I’d like a string, please.

490
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,050
Okay. Please wait for a while.

491
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,480
Alright.

492
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,680
It’s beautiful.

493
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,430
Nice. How much is it?

494
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,720
Please wait.

495
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,160
All of these will be 5,690 yuan

496
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,690
in total.

497
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,530
How would you like to pay?

498
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,810
You got it.

499
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,190
I’m, I’m sorry.

500
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,480
It’s not I can’t afford it.

501
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,530
I left my wallet at home.

502
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,720
It’s fine. E-payment is available, too.

503
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,960
E-payment?

504
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,840
You can use Alipay

505
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,190
or WeChat Pay.

506
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,280
I... I don’t understand.

507
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,080
Showing QR code.

508
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,440
Scanned successfully.

509
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,720
Your payment is completed.

510
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,360
Please wait for me to wrap it up.

511
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,890
Okay.

512
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,890
Well done.

513
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,170
A payment of 5,690 yuan has been made.

514
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,830
I’d like to pay.

515
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,360
Okay. How would you like to pay?

516
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,530
Scan it.

517
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,050
Okay.

518
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,540
-Payment completed.
-Okay, your payment is completed.

519
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,290
A payment of 2,730 yuan has been made.

520
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,840
I want all of them.

521
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,360
Scan it.

522
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,600
Payment completed.

523
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,410
Scan it.

524
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,890
Payment completed.

525
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,470
(A fast payment of 999 yuan
A fast payment of 752 yuan)

526
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,930
Well... I bought too many
because I was happy.

527
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,050
How should I take them
to Ai Qing’s home?

528
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,660
Looking for Ai Qing’s address.

529
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,080
Do you need navigation?

530
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,770
Of course.

531
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,320
But we need a car first.

532
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,290
Calling Mr. Liu for you.

533
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,600
The destination is, Ai Qing’s home.

534
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,480
Nice work.

535
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,770
I was right to take you with me.

536
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,490
Isn’t this Ai Qing’s home?

537
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,960
Have some water, Sir.

538
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,720
Thank you.

539
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,580
Well. Did you pay

540
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,080
for this apartment?

541
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:14,810
Yes.

542
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,180
You’re very capable

543
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,490
to afford such a big apartment
in Shanghai.

544
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,450
I bought it with a bank loan.

545
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,240
That’s, that’s still impressing.

546
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,290
Here.

547
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,290
Eat some fruits.

548
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,290
Thank you. Thank you, Sir.

549
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,420
Come on.

550
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,530
Sir.

551
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,170
May I ask where the bathroom is?

552
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,780
Going to the bathroom right
after eating some fruits.

553
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,570
You digest well.

554
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,890
The, the bathroom is over there.

555
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,200
Okay.

556
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,700
Look at this kid, very healthy.

557
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,720
Dad, what are you doing?

558
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,330
Why would you invite

559
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,360
the blind date to home?

560
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,490
You know well

561
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,960
about your grandma’s temper.

562
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,820
Don’t take it seriously with the guy

563
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,020
your grandma introduced.

564
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,540
I’ve told her

565
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,120
to meet outside.

566
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,850
But she said

567
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,060
it’s cheaper to meet at home.

568
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,060
It still doesn’t make sense.

569
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,580
Two for one.

570
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,180
I agree, Dad. Have you seen
a blind date like this?

571
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,970
Grandma said

572
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,900
that this kid is fine.

573
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,900
Both of you should check him out.

574
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,780
Whoever is interested in him
continues dating.

575
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,420
If not,

576
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,320
just see it as making a new friend.

577
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,380
Take... Take a look.

578
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,960
(Shen Zhe: Open the door
in three minutes.)

579
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,130
Take a look at what?

580
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,580
I... I’ve got packages downstairs.

581
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,360
Let me go get them.

582
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,580
Why, why did she startle?

583
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,370
What? I haven’t eaten the apple.

584
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,720
Why? What’s wrong?

585
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,900
What should I do?
Shen Zhe is coming up.

586
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,330
Isn’t he supposed to come
in the afternoon?

587
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,700
Check out the time, okay?

588
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,610
It’s already the afternoon.

589
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,250
You take care of him.

590
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,580
I’ll deal with the one inside.

591
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,780
I didn’t bring my phone.

592
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,330
Hi.

593
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,780
Hi.

594
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,580
Wait.

595
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,300
You’re not here to welcome me, are you?

596
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,020
Yes.

597
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,330
I’m here to welcome you.

598
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,490
Where’s your sister?

599
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,700
She’s with a guest upstairs.

600
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
A guest?

601
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,900
She didn’t tell me there’s a guest.

602
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,130
It’s someone my grandma introduced.

603
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,450
We are not really close.

604
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,490
They’re talking upstairs.

605
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,900
Okay. Let’s meet him.

606
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,050
Shen Zhe. Well...

607
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,060
It’s the New Year now.

608
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,970
There are many guests upstairs.

609
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,140
You may not have space to sit.

610
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,130
Why don’t we

611
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,730
walk around here for a while?

612
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,060
You and me?

613
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,380
Forget it. I’m afraid someone
may get jealous.

614
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,780
Speak of the devil.

615
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,130
What happened?

616
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,170
Didn’t you say you’re not coming?

617
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,620
Why are you here?

618
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,410
She’s keeping me

619
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,660
from going up.

620
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,170
What’s wrong?

621
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,780
Bad timing?

622
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,490
Let me talk to Wu Bai.

623
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,860
Well,

624
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,150
my sister hasn’t

625
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,970
told my dad about her boyfriend.

626
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,780
You can’t blame her for it.

627
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,180
I think she wants to invite him over

628
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,970
after being together long enough.

629
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,970
Besides...

630
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,250
Besides, my grandma

631
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,420
set up a blind date at home.

632
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:55,890
If Shen Zhe comes up,

633
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,780
they will have a fight
after meeting each other.

634
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,140
Is it a blind date for your sister?

635
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,780
-No.
-What? My sister...

636
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,100
Is it for you?

637
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,350
No, it’s, it’s not for me, either.

638
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,580
How can I tell you?

639
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,170
It’s the three of us together.

640
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,690
The three of you?

641
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,890
Listen to me.

642
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,970
Grandma introduced her

643
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,860
former student to come over.

644
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,350
She’d like the three of us to...

645
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,460
I can’t explain.

646
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,490
Don’t take it wrong.

647
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,550
My sister and I weren’t aware of it.

648
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,540
We didn’t want to do it anyway.

649
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,890
The most important thing for now is

650
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,590
to keep Shen Zhe from going up.

651
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,820
In case he does anything rashly.

652
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,580
Do you understand?

653
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,540
Got it.

654
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,860
Let me talk to him.

655
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,380
Wait, what’s happening?

656
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,100
What? What’s up?

657
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,380
Ai Jing...

658
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,390
Ai Jing is having a blind date upstairs.

659
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,420
Shen Zhe!

660
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,420
Why did he go up?

661
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,100
I told you to stop him.

662
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,410
Do you like sports?

663
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,870
Yeah, I like playing basketball.

664
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,310
That’s great.

665
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,420
Where do you come from?

666
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,420
Shandong.

667
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,700
Shandong is a nice place.

668
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,630
Many talents born in Shandong.

669
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,540
Yeah.

670
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,700
Excuse me,

671
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,590
Dad.

672
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,580
I suddenly need to go to the troupe.

673
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,890
Why are you going there in the New Year?

674
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,780
The director said
the rehearsal is urgent.

675
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,500
Urgent?

676
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,110
Hurry up.

677
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,300
I’m going now.

678
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,350
Wait, why don’t I drive you there?

679
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,660
No, thanks. I’ll hail a car.

680
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,980
Wait, where’s your sister?

681
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,740
She’s fetching the packages downstairs.

682
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,630
She’ll be back soon. See you.

683
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,790
Alright.

684
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,180
Be safe.

685
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,110
Here. Take a seat.

686
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,870
Why are you here?

687
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,210
Come. Come.

688
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,650
Ai Jing, what’s wrong with you?

689
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,420
Why are you having a blind date?

690
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,350
I haven’t told my father yet.

691
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,870
I didn’t mean it.

692
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,390
So when are you going to tell him?

693
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,500
Or you want to date me

694
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,660
as well as other people

695
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,730
-and choose whichever you like?
-Shh.

696
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,930
It’s an accident.

697
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,660
What accident?

698
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,870
A blind date requires mutual consent.

699
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,420
How can it be an accident?

700
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,460
Fine. Even if it’s an accident.

701
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,740
What should I do if they introduce you

702
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,790
-more guys?
-Shh.

703
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,150
Why are you being so mean?

704
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,740
What do you mean more guys?

705
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,150
Let’s hide for now.

706
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,420
Once the guy leaves...

707
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,150
Do I need to hide now

708
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,150
on meeting my girlfriend?

709
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,830
I told them I’m rehearsing
at the troupe.

710
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,700
They’d know I lied

711
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,310
if they saw me here.

712
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,580
Fine.

713
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,310
You’re single.

714
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,590
It’s none of my business,

715
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,670
okay?

716
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,830
I’ll go.

717
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,940
Shen Zhe.

718
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,220
Why are you being childish?

719
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,150
Fine.

720
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,220
Let me show you what childish is like.

721
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,790
Put, put me down.

722
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,140
Wu Bai, what did you say to him exactly?

723
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,790
I didn’t say anything.

724
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,310
She is done.

725
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,500
She won’t be able to explain.

726
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,590
It’s going to be a mess upstairs.

727
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,390
Are you cold?

728
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,310
Do you need my jacket?

729
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,740
I’m good.

730
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,550
I’ll go up soon.

731
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,710
Bai.

732
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,220
Grandpa?

733
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,390
Why are you here?

734
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,990
Help me to carry the gifts. Come on.

735
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Why?

736
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,180
Is it inappropriate for me to come?

737
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,900
No, it’s not.

738
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,830
It’s appropriate.

739
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,590
Well...

740
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,070
-Let me help you to go up.
-Alright.

741
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,070
You’re Ai Qing, right?

742
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,180
Yeah.

743
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,470
You look more beautiful than the photo.

744
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,390
This is my grandpa.

745
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,460
Hello, Grandpa.

746
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,260
Great.

747
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,900
We’re all great.

748
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,900
Very pretty.

749
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,830
Shen Zhe, put me down.

750
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,500
Shen Zhe.

751
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,030
Why is he carrying my sister?

752
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,670
Put me down.

753
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,630
Put me down.

754
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,360
Isn’t this Zhe?

755
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,420
Good for him

756
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,670
for carrying the girl.

757
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,590
See you.

758
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,800
Bai.

759
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,740
I,

760
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,120
I’ll try hard.

761
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,500
Okay.

762
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,360
So, you’re a friend of Ai Qing?

763
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,500
I’m sorry that you have

764
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,230
to come all the way here.

765
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,080
It’s alright.

766
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,260
My grandson

767
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,510
is a bit of shy.

768
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,660
He doesn’t say pretty words.

769
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,740
He may be inconsiderable.

770
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,150
So, I’ve prepared small gifts

771
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,990
for coming here the first time.

772
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,190
That’s too many
and they’re not small gifts.

773
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,790
You’re being too nice.

774
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,270
It’s fine.

775
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,750
Is this an uncle of yours?

776
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,670
No... I’m not...

777
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,880
I’m not a relative.

778
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,460
I’m here for a blind date.

779
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,870
Blind date?

780
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,230
Same as Bai, nice.

781
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,390
Let’s talk and do this together.

782
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,550
