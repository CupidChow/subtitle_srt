00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,920
I want some water.

35
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,310
Oh, here’s the fridge.

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,240
Why is the fridge so big?

37
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,830

38

Why can’t I open it?

42
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,390

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,930

49

Apple vinegar? Be right there.

50
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,960
Jing, what took you so long?

51
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,040
Why is it you?

52
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,740
I’ve bought you apple vinegar
and hangover drug.

53
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,940
Enjoy them.

54
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,130
Apple vinegar?

55
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,970
Didn’t I...?

56
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,620
Didn’t I ask my sister to buy it?

57
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,000
Drink no more!

58
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,400
I’ll put the drug here.

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,320
Come.

60
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,930
Sit down.

61
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,760
Now that you’ve come,

62
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,470
drink...

63
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,760
Drink with me.

64
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,100
Don’t you know
you’re not good at drinking?

65
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,160
Who told you?

66
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,930
I’m very good at drinking.

67
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,270
I’m just a little bit...

68
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,130
A little bit drunk.

69
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,000
Fine, you’re not drunk.

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,130
Put your coat on, all right?

71
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,990
Put it on.

72
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,970
What for?

73
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,760
I feel so hot! I won’t put it on.

74
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,880
Put it on.

75
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,370
Fine.

76
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,850
Drink with me

77
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,410
and I’ll put it on.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,530
No, no, no.

79
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,250
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

80
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,970
I forgot it. My bad.

81
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,970
You’ve got a competition to go.

82
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,530
You can’t drink.

83
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Put it on.

84
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,160
Oh, Wu Bai,

85
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,970
today I reviewed the list

86
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,410
for the preliminary.

87
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,410
I estimated

88
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,280
who you would meet in the quarter final.

89
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,000
You’ll meet Naya.

90
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,200
Am I brilliant?

91
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,810
Yes.

92
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,090
Naya is a very, very mean man.

93
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,760
You must be very cautious.

94
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,410
He’s good at having a psywar

95
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,600
and stalling for time.

96
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,440
He’s too dilatory
to look like a real man.

97
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,370
Can you zip up a coat or not?

98
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
This is

99
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,690
how it should be zipped up.

100
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,850
Why did you drink so much?

101
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,370
You feel unhappy?

102
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,820
I don’t feel unhappy.

103
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,440
I don’t feel unhappy at all.

104
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,570
Instead, I feel quite happy.

105
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,250

109
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,410
Nothing else

110
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,850
could make me happier.

111
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,860
Well,

112
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
I’m not good at saying goodbye.

113
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,850
I love to look back

114
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,370
and think about the past.

115
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,650
However,

116
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,050
now I realize

117
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,260
saying goodbye

118
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,770
makes people happy.

119
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,250
Because we can’t embrace new hope

120
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,970
unless we say goodbye to the past.

121
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,330

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,660
Sit down.

176
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,790
Drink with me.

177
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,500
Wu Bai,

178
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,620
don’t...

179
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,340
Don’t fall into his trap!

180
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,580
(I’ve met everybody in this world,
you are the only one I fall for.)

181
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,590
Lin Yin.

182
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,500
-Coach.
-Where are Xiaomi and the others?

183
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,660
They’ve gone to the site,

184
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,540
to get familiar with the surroundings.

185
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,660
They said they weren’t nervous.

186
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,180
They just pretended.

187
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,300
What about you? Are you nervous?

188
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,350
Me?

189
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,060
Last year, I competed against Wu Bai

190
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,100
in this place.

191
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,150
I’m not nervous.

192
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,470
You and Wu Bai?

193
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,500
Lin Yin,

194
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,030
how long have you

195
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,060
known Wu Bai?

196
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,470
Quite long.

197
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,350
For three years.

198
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,500
Now that you know him so much,

199
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,030
tell me

200
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,420
about his information on Wikipedia.

201
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,660
Wikipedia?

202
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,150
I read that.

203
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,390
There’s very little information.

204
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,070
Even less than what I know.

205
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,420
Tell me

206
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,740
what else you know.

207
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,030
I swear

208
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,660
no one else knows more than I do.

209
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,150
You know what?

210
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,980
Wu Bai is the best

211
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,860
throughout the United States.

212
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,600
He’s the real pride of China.

213
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,950
Some foreigners weren’t convinced.

214
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,740
Later,

215
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,670
they were defeated and became his fans.

216
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,060
I told you, didn’t I?

217
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,830
Someone changed his account number

218
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,300
for Wu Bai.

219
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,980
Someone used his photos

220
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,710
for the desktop.

221
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,740
He’s my idol without doubt.

222
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,590
Awesome!

223
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,470
Well,

224
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,150
over the past few years,

225
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,980
has he had any pink news?

226
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,390
I don’t think so.

227
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,260
Has he had any girlfriend

228
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,110
or any girl he liked?

229
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,950
He likes you, doesn’t he?

230
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,420
What? Don’t talk nonsense.

231
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,480
Then I’m sure

232
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,710
he loves no one else.

233
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Let’s go.

234
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,950
You didn’t forget the tactics
we set yesterday, did you?

235
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,960
Rest assured, Coach.

236
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,540
Morning.

237
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,230
Morning, Ai Qing.

238
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,830
Morning, Goddess.

239
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,630
-Morning.
-Morning.

240
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,990
Morning.

241
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,360
Thank you for last night.

242
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,710
You’re welcome.

243
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,190
I’m sorry I was drunk last night.

244
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,480
I didn’t talk nonsense,

245
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,480
did I?

246
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,710
You did say something,

247
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,780
but that wasn’t nonsense.

248
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,480
You don’t remember?

249
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,990
I... I don’t.

250
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,870
Morning, everybody.

251
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,670
-Good morning.
-Morning.

252
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,510
Coach,

253
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,710
here’s the breakfast.

254
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,240
Thank you.

255
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,260
You’re welcome.

256
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,720
You haven’t had breakfast yet, right?

257
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,110
Come and have some.

258
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,790
Thank you, Ai Qing.

259
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,120
I’ve got some.

260
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,950
We don’t mean that.

261
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,760
We don’t mean that, Fu Yiwen.

262
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,520
Thank you, man.

263
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,310
We don’t mean that.

264
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,960
It’s no big deal.

265
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,390
Just enjoy it.

266
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Uh, yesterday...

267
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,870
Don’t drink cold water.

268
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,360
Have some hot water.

269
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,760
Tastes good.

270
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,380
You have a stomach problem, don’t you?

271
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,430
What if you have a stomachache

272
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,190
during the game?

273
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,480
Thank you.

274
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,150
Coach,

275
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,960
why do you talk so gently to him?

276
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,150
Yeah,

277
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,310
you sound so gentle!

278
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,590
I...

279
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,270
Why...? Why are you so nagging?

280
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,790
Focus on your breakfast.

281
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,480
Here’s the result.

282
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,180
Be quick.

283
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,120
Who do we have?

284
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,640
Oh, an old rival.

285
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,000
Captain of RAP.

286
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,790
Xiaomi,

287
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,720
you’re familiar with him.

288
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,120
Don’t worry.

289
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,790
Come on, dude!

290
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,880
Lin Yin,

291
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,030
you have the highest accumulated points

292
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,000
among our team members.

293
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,000
You have chance to go to the final

294
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,140
and compete with Wu Bai for champion.

295
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,780
What? Scared?

296
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,910
No, not really.

297
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,070
Come on, then!

298
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,880
-You, too.
-What makes you scared?

299
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,150
You’re younger than him.

300
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,070
Don’t be scared. Come on!

301
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,840
-Yeah.
-What about me?

302
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,550
You blocked it.

303
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,480
-Naya?
-Naya?

304
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,910
Naya?

305
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,760
-It’s really him.
-Naya?

306
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,720
He’s the defending champion.

307
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,550
Can...? Can you do that?

308
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,240
Can you?

309
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,880
Yes.

310
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,670
I certainly can.

311
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,120
There’s no “can’t” in my dictionary!

312
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,640
That’s fine, then.

313
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,490
Naya got many accumulated points
in European Championship.

314
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,840
Be very careful.

315
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,890
I... I’ll go to the toilet.

316
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,640
Naya...

317
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,550
Look.

318
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,700
(2021 THORPE MARK ROBOT)

319
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,900
(MARK THORPE)

320
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,830
(Wu Bai)

321
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,990
(MARK THORPE)

322
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,560
KO!

323
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,270
Shen Zhe!

324
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,320
Even Shen Zhe was knocked out.

325
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,910
Luckily, it was an individual game.

326
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,960
Team scores won’t be affected.

327
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,800
Hope Wu Bai will do a good job!

328
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,760
Leave him alone.

329
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,960
When he lost the game,

330
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,310
he must be feeling bad.

331
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,320
But he...

332
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:02,320
He looks like

333
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,000
he doesn’t care for anything.

334
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,910
In fact, he cares the most.

335
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,960
You’re right.

336
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,800
After all,

337
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,480
he nearly ended in a draw with Naya.

338
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,640
Xiaomi lost the game?

339
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,680
As an experienced player,

340
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,850
he used to have stable performance!

341
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,760
Come on, dude! Come on!

342
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,890
It doesn’t matter.

343
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,430
We’ll count on you.

344
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,440
Xiaomi!

345
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,270
Leave him to me.

346
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,250
Don’t feel stressed.

347
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,130
In K&K’s game,

348
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,920
Shen Zhe also lost to Naya.

349
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,770
You’ll fight Wu Bai in the final.

350
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,080
We count on you.

351
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,190
Coach, what you said

352
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,760
makes me more stressed.

353
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,800
Don’t feel that.

354
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,490
Do as you used to.

355
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,030
Set up your mind and just go.

356
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,120
Remember what we said,

357
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,530
make Wu Bai play the game
in the way you want.

358
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,070
Relax,

359
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,640
and devote every effort.

360
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,130
Don’t feel stressed.

361
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,650
Try hard! Come on!

362
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,530
Come on!

363
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,180
(ONE WAY)

364
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,910
I know you don’t make Doggie worried.

365
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,530
Tell me about it.

366
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,400
What?

367
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,650
I just feel

368
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,770
I didn’t do a good job.

369
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,680
It doesn’t matter.

370
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,880
When we’re back,

371
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,250
Solo and Doggie will analyze for you.

372
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,280
Everyone experiences ups and downs.

373
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,360
I’ll review the game first.

374
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,490
Go tell Doggie

375
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,800
to ask Lin Yin

376
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,970
to play the game carefully

377
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,520
and not lose the game.

378
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,720
I’ll leave you alone, then.

379
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,490
Hello, everyone.

380
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,130
Welcome to the Mark Thorpe’s finals.

381
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,080
Today, the battle will be between

382
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,970
the two Chinese players,

383
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,490
Lin Yin from SP

384
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,160
and Wu Bai from K&K.

385
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,800
Hello, everybody.

386
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,130
I’m Commentator Wang Tao.

387
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,560
I’m Commentator Lu Yang.

388
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,130
Wang Tao,

389
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,200
you’re well-known for wrong judgement.

390
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,320
Who do you think

391
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,250
will win this game?

392
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,160
Lu Yang, don’t slander me.

393
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,490
Every time,

394
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,600
I judge based on professional analysis.

395
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,150
However, the players always behave

396
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,730
beyond my imagination.

397
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,160
I don’t give wrong judgement.

398
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,770
So, in this game,

399
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,770
why don’t you seriously analyze

400
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,200
today’s players?

401
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,440
All right. Let me introduce you.

402
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,080
Look.

403
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,560
Lin Yin is a new player,

404
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,850
but he defeated many strong opponents.

405
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,490
He’s very popular now.

406
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,550
Wu Bai wins games

407
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,280
in the past few years.

408
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,250
But due to the competition arrangement,

409
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,680
he hasn’t met any strong opponent.

410
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,890
It’s very unfavorable for him.

411
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,730
Look at Lin Yin.

412
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,250
Behind him is Ai Qing, the famous coach.

413
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,250
What a new way will he use

414
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,890
according to the cooperation with her?

415
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,850
It’s hard to say.

416
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,010
It sounds like

417
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,770
you support Lin Yin more?

418
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,200
No, no, no. You’re trapping me again.

419
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,280
Don’t say that.

420
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,250
Will Lin Yin keep winning the game?

421
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,200
Or will Wu Bai

422
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,730
maintain his invincible record?

423
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,920
We won’t know before the finals.

424
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,560
Yeah. Let’s wait and see.

425
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,680
Fine, let’s expect

426
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,280
the beginning of the game.

427
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,730
Check the junction points carefully.

428
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,680
Okay.

429
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,770
What? Nervous?

430
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,920
Relax.

431
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,730
Just do what you usually do.

432
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,080
All right. The game starts.

433
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,320
Lin Yin and Wu Bai compete directly

434
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,930
when the game just starts!

435
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,930
Are they going to

436
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,400
push the game to a new high so quickly?

437
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
Neither of them seems

438
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,280
(Wu Bai)
to reserve their power.

439
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,370
So fierce at the beginning?

440
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,290
Lin Yin’s Beastmaster
brandished his axe.

441
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,290
But he missed.

442
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,530
Wu Bai dodged perfectly.

443
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,560
Beastmaster is

444
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,680
running after Wu Bai’s Nobody!

445
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,400
The Nobody dodged and dodged.

446
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,380
With a quick turning,

447
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,400
it managed to dodge from Beastmaster!

448
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:54,940
(Wu Bai)

449
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,970
The Nobody was stopped by the formation.

450
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,450
Beastmaster brandished its axe.

451
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,770
It rolled over.

452
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,560
It brandished again.

453
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,570
-It cut the edge of the Nobody.
-Yes!

454
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,130
Wu Bai will give no more chance!

455
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,620
The Nobody sticks with Beastmaster

456
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
and will use the catapult.

457
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,140
Yeah.

458
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,050
The Nobody follows closely.

459
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,380
Beastmaster is knocked over.

460
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,290
The left front wheel of Nobody was cut!

461
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,740
He’s been wounded.

462
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,570
He’s running back.

463
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,810
Beastmaster is running after him.

464
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,050
Wu Bai is in trouble!

465
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,320
His robot is badly damaged.

466
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,410
If it continues,

467
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:32,850
the following two games...

468
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,330
What happened?

469
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,860
Can’t be continued.

470
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,280
Yeah.

471
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,050
What will Wu Bai do?

472
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,380
Wu Bai raised his hands!

473
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,620
Wu Bai raised his hands!

474
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,410
He signaled to pause the game.

475
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,570
Let’s go it if no one objects.

476
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,810
Okay.

477
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,620
KO.

478
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,540
Let’s congratulate Lin Yin

479
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,290
on winning the first round!

480
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,820
Congratulations, Lin Yin!

481
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:38,570
SP! SP! SP!

482
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,570
Come on!

483
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,540
How is it?

484
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,580
The left front wheel is too damaged
to be used again.

485
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,810
Ai Qing found out
the defect of our robot.

486
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,100
We need immediate adjustment.

487
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,380
What do you mean?

488
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,740
Install a baffle
to protect the front wheels.

489
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,030
I see.

490
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,500
Lin Yin,

491
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,870
Wu Bai realized your plan.

492
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,330
Do you remember

493
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,020
how I analyzed the three rounds?

494
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,260
You said the game between Wu Bai and me

495
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,690
would exactly start in the second round.

496
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,150
Here comes the second round!

497
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:14,940
Lin Yin and Wu Bai

498
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,260
still fight directly.

499
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,620
Lin Yin’s Beastmaster

500
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,270
banished his axe twice

501
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,290
towards Wu Bai’s Nobody!

502
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,870
Looks like adjustments have been made

503
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,020
on the Nobody.

504
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,750
When Beastmaster is cutting him madly,

505
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,630
he doesn’t look scared at all.

506
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,580
As we can see,

507
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,290
the Nobody suddenly turned around

508
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,390
and knocked over Beastmaster!

509
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,140
He then continued

510
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,810
to push Beastmaster to the sideline...

511
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,740
No, to the Out Zone!

512
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,860
Beastmaster was pushed to the Out Zone

513
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,270
and knocked over!

514
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,630
-Wu Bai won a round
-KO!

515
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,860
and made the score 1-1!

516
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,150
What a majestic counterattack!

517
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,670
Wu Bai learned the lesson
from the last round.

518
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,340
What happened?

519
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,030
Instead of fighting against you,

520
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,300
he directly kicked you

521
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,630
to the Out Zone!

522
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,450
Well,

523
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,690
we’re better expecting

524
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,420
the next round.

525
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,390
Let’s wait and see.

526
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,180
-K&K! K&K! K&K!
-K&K! K&K! K&K!

527
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,940
The baffle is out of shape.

528
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,060
Support point of the axe is also broken.

529
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,100
Remove it.

530
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,270
Be careful.

531
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,310
Yes, yes. Yes.

532
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
I...

533
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,900
If you think

534
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,700
that was what you could really do,

535
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,620
there’s quite a big gap

536
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,140
between you and Wu Bai.

537
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,850
If you don’t think so,

538
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,610
you’ve got another chance

539
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,860
to prove to Wu Bai
what you can really do.

540
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,660
What if

541
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,110
I still lose the third round?

542
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,830
You’re still young.

543
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,830
Take it as an experience.

544
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,870
I believe you can defeat Wu Bai.

545
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,220
Even if not today,

546
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,180
you’ll make it some other day.

547
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,350
Listen to me and just do your best.

548
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,190
Compete in the best way you can.

549
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,550
Do you hear me?

550
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,070
Come on!

551
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,990
Don’t worry. We’re all here.

552
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,790
You’ll just focus on the game.

553
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,390
Leave the rest to us.

554
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,350
Come on!

555
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,620
Come on!

556
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,700
The third round for the championship

557
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,110
has started!

558
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,150
No matter Lin Yin or Wu Bai

559
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,070
wins the game,

560
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,560
they’ll make a history!

561
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,460
The audience are
enormously enthusiastic.

562
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,860
They expect a wonderful performance.

563
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,640
(Wu Bai)

564
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,110
At the beginning of this round,

565
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,550
the Nobody knocked over Beastmaster

566
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,030
two times in a row!

567
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,790
Beastmaster rushed to the Nobody

568
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,750
and cut his catapult device.

569
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,750
What a wise decision!

570
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,270
He aims directly at the essential part!

571
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,870
Oh, my God.

572
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,430
Lin Yin learned the lesson
from last round

573
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,520
and didn’t give Wu Bai a chance

574
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,220
to use the same strategy.

575
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,550
Fine. Let’s see.

576
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,710
Beastmaster is running after the Nobody.

577
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,790
Right now, we can see that

578
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,270
the site formation rises.

579
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,030
The Nobody is jacked up.

580
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,280
His entire catapult device

581
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,360
is exposed in the air.

582
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,140
Beastmaster aims

583
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,340
at the catapult device

584
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,580
and brandishes its axe towards it.

585
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,940
He’ll do it one more time.

586
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,620
Again, he brandishes towards the device

587
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,350
of the Nobody.

588
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,560
How terrible!

589
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,790
Wang Tao, what a terrible scene!

590
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,590
Look at the Nobody.

591
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,110
In my memories,

592
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,590
it’s his first time

593
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,360
to be repressed in two rounds.

594
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,040
(Wu Bai)

595
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,080
We can see that

596
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,710
the Nobody suddenly catapulted reversely

597
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,800
and bounced Beastmaster.

598
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,150
Beastmaster was bounced away!

599
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,940
But we see

600
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,180
the catapult plate of the Nobody

601
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,700
is half open.

602
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,900
Is it out of control?

603
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,150
What’s going on?

604
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,080
Is it out of control?

605
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,390
When the Nobody is losing control,

606
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,190
Beastmaster will seize the chance.

607
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,830
He’s moving to the Nobody.

608
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,080
No! The catapult plate is closed!

609
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,100
It’s not out of control.

610
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,470
A dramatic scene happened!

611
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,830
We can see that

612
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,560
Beastmaster turned around

613
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,120
and ran away immediately!

614
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,840
Well, now the Nobody

615
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,040
starts to chase Beastmaster.

616
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,760
What a hot pursuit!

617
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,150
At present,

618
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,820
Beastmaster’s rushing directly
to the catapult device.

619
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,180
What’s happening?

620
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,470
Is he trying to suicide?

621
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,590
He’s like killing himself.

622
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,280
Is he giving up?

623
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,760
Turns out he wants
to crush on the Nobody!

624
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,470
That’s amazing!

625
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,760
What a great move!

626
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,560
It’s now a competition on their weight!

627
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,430
Only thirty seconds to go

628
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,560
before the game ends.

629
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,040
Yes,

630
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,840
there isn’t much time for the Nobody.

631
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,840
His points were deducted
because he was jacked up by the trap.

632
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,230
If he doesn’t struggle,

633
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,190
he may possibly lose the game.

634
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,190
The Nobody’s rushing to Beastmaster,

635
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,870
and pushing it to the formation!

636
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,500
It crashed! It crashed!

637
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,950
Come on! Come on! Come on!

638
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,630
It looks like

639
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,600
Beastmaster is going to be destroyed!

640
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:22,910
We can see that

641
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,470
the two robots stick to each other

642
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,400
so closely

643
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,000
that they can’t easily be separated.

644
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,470
Beastmaster got away! Got away!

645
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,470
Oh, dear!

646
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,150
The Nobody keeps kicking Beastmaster.

647
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,230
Beastmaster wants to get away,

648
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,000
but doesn’t have a chance at all!

649
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,430
Such a fatal blow

650
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,390
looks like a meat grinder!

651
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,800
Ten.

652
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,320
Go. Go.

653
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,050
Time is running out.

654
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,080
