Is this for Boss?

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,860
You guys, look.

21
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,900
There’s a piggy on the surface.

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,020
Nian, are you changing another way
to express you love to Boss?

23
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,060
Totally PDA.

24
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,580
So sweet!

25
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,380
Zhou Yi, take it to Boss.

26
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,900
Why me?

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,940
Xiaomi should take the job.

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,860
Shen Zhe, you go.

29
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,980
Me? Let’s go together.

30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,020
Come on, let’s go.

31
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,900
Go. Go.

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,980
Let’s go together.

33
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,780
Watch out.

34
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,380
The piggy could be gone.

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,460
Alright. Take it easy.

36
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,980
What do you think? Good?

37
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,660
Not bad.

38
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,740
By the way,

39
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,060
the thing you mentioned last time…

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,900
It has been solved.

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,100
Thank you for your help last time.

42
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,620
What’s going on?

43
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,100
You got something in mind.

44
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,660
Actually,
I got a few questions to ask you.

45
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,220
Sit, please.

46
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,940
Actually,

47
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,620
I’ve planned a proposal as well.

48
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,460
But it didn’t end up well.

49
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,460
Did Ai Qing reject you?

50
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,820
Nope.

51
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,900
But a gaffe occurred

52
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,140
before I even started.

53
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,220
So, what I wanna ask you is,

54
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,100
as a girl,

55
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,180
how would you like to be proposed?

56
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,340
I only have failed experience.

57
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,620
Then, give me some details

58
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,300
on how Han Shangyan proposed to you.

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,700
I can take it as a negative example

60
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,020
and know what I can’t do.

61
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,820
I can share with you

62
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,180
but I don’t suggest you do that.

63
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,420
OK.

64
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,940
Are you gonna put it down?

65
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,580
Of course.

66
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,300
Alright.

67
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
He

68
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,820
proposed to me

69
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,180
right after the National Champs.

70
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,740
Right after the National Champs?

71
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,460
First, don’t propose after competitions.

72
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,540
It’s too sudden.

73
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,420
He proposed in front of a Train Station.

74
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,820
A Train Station?

75
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,660
Second, the environment can’t be noisy.

76
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,580
He just took out the Champ Ring,

77
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,900
and put it on my finger,

78
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,860
and told me,

79
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,660
“Tong Nian, marry me,

80
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,740
will you?”

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,580
My head went black at that moment.

82
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,100
In fact, for girls,

83
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,340
it’s important to have a romantic
proposal ceremony.

84
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,460
But most importantly,

85
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,100
you should give her

86
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,580
faith in your future life.

87
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,060
Faith?

88
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,500
Correct.

89
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,700
You gotta make her believe

90
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,820
you’re ready to

91
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,940
be with her the rest of your life.

92
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,580
Let her know

93
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,820
she’ll be

94
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
as free as when she was single.

95
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,700
The only difference is she has you now.

96
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,500
You’ll know what she thought

97
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,700
without a word.

98
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,460
You’ll stay with her all the time

99
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,860
and do anything she wants with her.

100
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,780
The sense of security is
the top priority.

101
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,300
You must love her with all your heart.

102
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,620
I might talk too much.

103
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,900
The above is just for your reference.

104
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,820
Not at all.

105
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,660
These are very precious advice.

106
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,020
Thank you so much.

107
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,620
Good luck. Wu Bai.

108
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,460
Captain?

109
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,420
Wu Bai?

110
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,180
Is he out of his mind?

111
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,180
Could it be that Nian said something

112
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,220
making him uncomfortable?

113
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,140
Would she?

114
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,020
She is too adorable

115
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,820
to say things

116
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,060
that might hurt him.

117
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,620
So far, the only thing confused Captain

118
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,100
is how to propose.

119
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,660
I have an idea.

120
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,140
What’s it?

121
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,940
I can definitely make it this time.

122
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,660
But I have to take it step by step.

123
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,060
-Step by step?
-Step by step?

124
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,060
To be specific…

125
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,900
Are you ready?

126
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,740
Totally.

127
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,900
Remember your sequence?

128
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,740
Never forget.

129
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,860
You didn’t forget your tools, did you?

130
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,740
Don’t nag

131
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,940
like an old lady.

132
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,100
That’s called prudence.

133
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,340
Prudence, OK?

134
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,260
Don’t worry.

135
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,300
Everything is settled.

136
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,980
Didn’t Wu Bai leave a long time ago?

137
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,420
How come he hasn’t arrived yet?

138
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,180
Heavy traffic, maybe?

139
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,220
I suggest

140
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,860
we find a cover and hide now.

141
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,900
I guess

142
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,940
they’ll arrive in a few minutes.

143
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,300
Yeah.

144
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,980
Let’s move.

145
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,580
Go.

146
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,780
Wait a sec.

147
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,260
Take these.

148
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,460
Bai. Bai.

149
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,580
Bai. Don’t walk that fast.

150
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,700
My feet hurt.

151
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,660
Your feet hurt?

152
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,140
My heels are worn out.

153
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,500
Let me carry you on my back.

154
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,100
No, thanks.

155
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,820
It’s too hot for you to carry me now.

156
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,500
Let’s sit down for a while.

157
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,180
OK.

158
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,060
Take your time.

159
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,980
Still hurt?

160
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,980
Better.

161
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,900
It’s fine. I’ll put a Band-Aid on it.

162
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,220
Our granddaughter brought us
bamboo shoots.

163
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,820
Let’s make Pork and Bamboo Shoots
tonight.

164
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,100
Later, we can go to the food market

165
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,900
and cook a Stir-fried Eel with Hot Oil?

166
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,260
You

167
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,420
have changed nothing since we met.

168
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,260
You’re always quiet

169
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,780
like a dumb.

170
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,340
She’s talking about you.

171
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,820
I’m not that quiet, OK?

172
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,100
Seriously?

173
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,980
When my parents wanted me

174
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,180
to marry somebody else,

175
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,380
you got down on your knees,

176
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,900
like boom,

177
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,940
and said,

178
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,420
“trust me,

179
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,100
I’ll bring her happiness
for the whole life”,

180
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,260
did you?

181
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,340
That was a long time ago.

182
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,180
Don’t mention that.

183
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,660
You stubborn old man.

184
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,860
Let’s play slides.

185
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,340
That’s not for old people

186
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,940
in our age.

187
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,860
Don’t you feel embarrassed
to play slides?

188
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,660
I wanna play this.
You got a problem with that?

189
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,900
OK. OK.

190
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,180
Be careful. Be careful.

191
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,140
I know. I know.

192
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,380
Be careful.

193
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,140
OK. OK.

194
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,380
I’ll be there for you.

195
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,580
OK. Ready?

196
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,820
Not yet. Not yet.

197
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,620
Ready? Go.

198
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,940
Happy now?

199
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,660
Let’s go home for dinner.

200
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,860
OK. Go.

201
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,460
I’m so happy.

202
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,220
It’ll be great

203
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,740
if we can be like them when we’re old.

204
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,940
When you’re old,

205
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,580
even you wanna go bungee jumping,

206
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,700
or go parachuting,

207
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,020
I’ll go with you.

208
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,540
Alright. Let me help you on this.

209
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,820
Bai.

210
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,620
Let’s get married.

211
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,980
Why didn’t you say anything?

212
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,820
Don’t you wanna marry me?

213
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:38,980
No.

214
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,460
Ai Qing.

215
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,780
Actually, I’ve made plenty of plans

216
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,100
and preparations,

217
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,820
which didn’t work well.

218
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,020
But it doesn’t matter now.

219
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,060
Will you marry me?

220
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,620
Put it on for me.

221
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,700
♪Love I fell in love are you♪

228
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,660
Bai.

229
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,580
Thank you.

230
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,860
♪My life my heart this love for you♪

231
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,420
I’m so happy now.

232
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
You’ll be happy forever.

233
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,060
But

234
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,420
I’m curious.

235
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,300
What was your plan?

236
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,300
It doesn’t matter now.

237
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,100
Let’s get out of here

238
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,140
and go home.

239
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,980
Why hasn’t Captain arrived yet?

240
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,260
Are there mosquitoes at your position?

241
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,100
I’ve been bitten for 5 times.

242
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,620
Maybe something happened to him
on his way here?

243
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,500
Looks like he failed.

244
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,260
According to my analysis,

245
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,180
as Wu Bai hasn’t shown up
with Ai Qing,

246
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,940
he probably has failed again.

247
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,380
What a poor man he is!

248
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,100
He still has a long way to go
before getting engaged.

249
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
So,

250
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,180
when he comes back,

251
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,420
we must be very careful

252
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,300
and not to get on his nerves.

253
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,020
We should comfort him more.

254
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,380
Let him know he still has his brothers.

255
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,300
Zhou Yi, cook him some delicious food.

256
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,980
As his heart is cold now,

257
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,500
let’s keep his stomach warm.

258
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,860
I’m on it.

259
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,860
Captain.

260
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,380
Wu Bai.

261
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,300
Whatever happened,

262
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,980
you still have our support.

263
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,100
Wu Bai. If you wanna talk,

264
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,540
we’ll be here for you.

265
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,940
Wu Bai.
Zhou Yi is gonna cook some snacks.

266
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,740
Do you wanna eat something?

267
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,500
Yeah. Captain.

268
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,300
Tell me what you wanna eat,

269
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,660
however hard it is,

270
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,980
I’ll cook that for you.

271
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,100
Then,

272
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,500
I want noodles.

273
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,500
Noodles.

274
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,460
Noodles.

275
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,660
Noodles. Noodles.

276
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,700
Noodles.

277
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,620
He wants noodles!

278
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,620
Captain.

279
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,820
Tell me if you think it’s salty

280
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
or if you need more eggs or meat.

281
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,300
It’s a bit hot. Let me cool it off
for you.

282
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,540
You just came back.

283
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,420
Let me clean your hands.

284
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,740
Come on.

285
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,940
Come on. Wu Bai.

286
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,460
Have some water.

287
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,540
Did all of you know about that?

288
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,580
Well,

289
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,580
Boss got engaged

290
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,580
upon his former failure.

291
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,740
So, a failed proposal means nothing.

292
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,620
Right.

293
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,700
That almost became K&K’s tradition.

294
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,020
It’s not a big deal.

295
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,140
I’m gonna call Ai Jing

296
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,100
and ask her
what Ai Qing was thinking about.

297
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,460
Wu Bai. Don’t be upset.

298
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,700
Ai Qing loves you.

299
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,020
What’re you talking about?

300
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,660
Didn’t you just fail to propose again?

301
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,420
-You lost it?
-You lost it?

302
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,740
Is it stolen?

303
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,060
Did it disappear?

304
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,660
I made it.

305
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,140
You made it?

306
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,860
Awesome. He made it.

307
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,500
I know you made it.

308
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
You’re excited like

309
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,020
you’re the one who got engaged.

310
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,860
I’m just excited for him.

311
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,900
It takes years for him to be engaged.

312
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,060
Such perseverance and luck,

313
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,180
I can’t help being thrilled for him.

314
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,820
Good for you.

315
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,620
Now that you got engaged,

316
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,140
we should celebrate today.

317
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,140
I’ll go grab some beers.

318
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,500
Definitely.

319
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,940
One beer for each of us.

320
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,460
Coach?

321
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,380
But today we can have an exception.

322
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,300
There you are.

323
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,740
Listen.

324
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,860
When I was browsing in Cloud Moment,

325
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,900
I found an interesting ID.

326
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,740
Haven’t you found anything different

327
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,580
about me today?

328
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,460
Your noses and eyes are still there.

329
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,540
Nothing wrong.

330
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,660
Seriously?

331
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,860
Did Wu Bai propose to you?

332
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,980
He seriously proposed to you?

333
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,180
That’s true.

334
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,340
Let me see. Let me see.

335
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,820
Beautiful.

336
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,220
It’s gorgeous.

337
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,380
Envy me?

338
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,580
You like it?

339
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,420
Then, tell Shen Zhe to buy one for you.

340
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,620
I don’t give a shit.

341
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,060
He has asked me to marry him
for thousands of times,

342
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
but I reckon it’s too early.

343
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,580
Then, when do you wanna get married?

344
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,100
Like, when you are fifty?

345
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,180
Unlike you guys,

346
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,140
Wu Bai fell in love with you
for 10 years,

347
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,900
and you’re his only Goddess.

348
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,420
We’re just ordinary lovers.

349
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,580
We still got time.

350
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,260
No. No. No.

351
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,980
You’re completely not ordinary.

352
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,420
You fight with each other
almost every day.

353
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,460
You’re not ordinary at all.

354
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,780
Alright. Stop talking about us.

355
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,660
Look.

356
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,300
There’s a Cloud Moment ID,
which has been so popular lately,

357
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,700
called Assisting Genius.

358
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,380
It mainly talks about the story
between you and Wu Bai.

359
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,900
Me and Bai?

360
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,300
(Assisting Genius)

361
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,100
I know who is behind this.

362
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,020
Who?

363
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,140
First, the W…

364
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,900
W stands for Wu Bai.

365
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,500
Goddess is you.

366
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,020
Everyone in the world knows it.

367
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,100
Someone who knows both Wu Bai

368
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,260
and me,

369
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,300
and Wu Bai’s long-term affection for me,

370
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,860
and likes to gossip in the internet.

371
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,780
There’s only one person.

372
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,660
That will be

373
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,260
-97.
-97.

374
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,340
Bai.

375
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,740
We’ll fly next Monday.

376
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,140
Do you have any problem
with your passports and visas?

377
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,420
By the way, don’t forget

378
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,940
to take the medicines.

379
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,460
Xiaomi will do that.

380
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,180
Don’t worry.

381
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,100
Come in.

382
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,180
Captain. There you go.
Your take-outs.

383
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,180
Thank you.

384
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,180
Captain.

385
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,020
Who’re you speaking to?

386
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,020
I’m in the middle of a meeting call.

387
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,420
What’s up?

388
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,700
I seemly heard Ai Qing’s voice.

389
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,460
You took the wrong person.

390
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,020
What’re you waiting for?

391
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,180
Shut the door for me.

392
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,220
People change when they get engaged.

393
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,460
Love and training are all they got.

394
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,260
Wasn’t he like this before?

395
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,540
Was he?

396
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,100
You ordered take-outs?

397
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,780
I ordered some for you too.

398
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,300
It should come in a minute.

399
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,780
You’ve also ordered for me?

400
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,140
There you go. Your take-outs.
Coach.

401
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,500
Come in.

402
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,460
Are these all mine?

403
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,820
Correct. All yours.

404
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,220
Bai. Why did you order so much?

405
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,580
Coach.

406
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,660
Are you sure you can eat these up?

407
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,460
Sure.

408
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,780
I’ve got a good appetite recently.

409
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,980
I can eat a cow.

410
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,740
Well,

411
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,260
enjoy your meal, Coach.

412
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,100
I gotta go for training.

413
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,980
OK.

414
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,260
Work hard.

415
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,580
Bai.

416
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,820
You’ve ordered so much.

417
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,620
I can’t even finish it in 3 days.

418
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,300
No.

419
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,700
This is just for a meal,

420
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,100
which contains your lunch,

421
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,460
desserts,

422
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,540
and fruits.

423
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,540
You worked so hard,

424
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,500
I just wanna reward you with these.

425
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,580
Bai.

426
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,460
You’re so sweet.

427
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,340
By the way,

428
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,940
that Assisting Genius

429
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,820
is 97, right?

430
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,380
Drop the act.

431
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,940
My elder sister told me

432
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,580
he’s been posting his assisting diaries
on Cloud Moments for a long time.

433
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,460
It can’t be anybody but him.

434
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,180
I really don’t know about this.

435
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,220
Alright.

436
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,180
I’ll send you a link,

437
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,340
and you’ll see.

438
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,700
Enjoy your meal.

439
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,500
Bye-bye.

440
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,100
Bye-bye.

441
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,500
Don’t forget to finish those food.

442
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,420
(Assisting Genius)

443
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,980
Follow me,

444
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,620
you’ll obtain a relationship soon.

445
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,220
I’m gonna fry 97’s butt.

446
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,660
See?

447
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,500
I’ve finished reading his diaries.

448
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,700
So, you had started the plan
like 3 years ago.

449
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,660
I had thought

450
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,860
you were just a simple young man.

451
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,180
It turns out
you got more tricks than anyone else.

452
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,460
Without these tricks,

453
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,740
how could I get my Goddess, Appledog?

454
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,780
Someone just said he knows nothing
about it.

455
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,780
That is a lot for one meal.

456
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,420
(Solo)

457
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,780
Hi.

458
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,180
Hi. Wu Bai.

459
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,260
Before the RoboCup,

460
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,860
I wanna gather SP and K&K
to train together.

461
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,740
What do you say?

462
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,940
No problem.

463
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,300
Two strong teams’ training together

464
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,940
will do good to both of us.

465
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,100
I’m glad we’re in the same page now.

466
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Deal. See you this afternoon.

467
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,420
OK.

468
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,900
The reviews recently have been

469
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,180
skyrocketing.

470
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,460
No. No way.

471
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,500
What’s up?

472
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,820
He knows.

473
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,300
He knows what?

474
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,660
What should I do?

475
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,300
(Assisting Genius)
Recognized by W.

476
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,220
It’ll be right
to implement your assistance in reverse.

477
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,300
You’re dead.

478
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,340
No way. No way.

479
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,940
It’s impossible for him to use this app.

480
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,540
He definitely won’t.
After all, he has always been occupied.

481
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,460
Captain.

482
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,620
Tell everyone to get ready.

483
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,220
SP will come over to train
with us together this afternoon.

484
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,060
-SP?
-SP?

485
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,340
Coach.

486
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,220
Don’t we have to prepare
for the RoboCup?

487
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,940
Why did we come here?

488
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,100
Still call me “Coach”?

489
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,180
I don’t care.

490
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,700
You’re the only Coach of SP in my mind.

491
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,940
Boss has ordered

492
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,660
that all the training has to be done
in K&K club

493
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,300
before the RoboCup.

494
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,700
But aren’t we opponents?

495
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,660
This is the first time for our country

496
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,660
to have two teams enter

497
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,100
into competitions like RoboCup
at the same time.

498
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,060
However, at this time,

499
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,780
isn’t that more important to make sure
China can win a championship

500
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,540
than individual wins and losses?

501
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,940
So, from now on,

502
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,940
we’re gonna be trained together

503
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,180
to get ready to fight
with the strong opponents out there,

504
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,820
and analyze their strengths
and weaknesses.

505
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,060
Then…

506
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,220
What if we meet in the finals?

507
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,820
The champion surely will belong to K&K.

508
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,540
These codes can automatically

509
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,940
correct the driving technology
with the gyroscope.

510
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
For different opponents,

511
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,900
we can choose different control styles

512
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,940
to achieve accurate shooting.

513
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,340
How amazing!

514
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,580
Thus,
the operation would be more accurate.

515
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,420
Exactly.

516
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,660
I’m gonna update these into my code.

517
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,340
Is the armor that your team usually uses

518
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,820
(The Nobody)
Hummer 600?

519
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,420
No.

520
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,180
We use TC21 Titanium Alloy,

521
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,420
an Aerospace material,

522
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,580
which is only held by us.

523
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,220
Besides,

524
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,220
we did a stress analysis with NSYS.

525
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,020
Only at such thickness

526
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,180
can there be such a good defense effect.

527
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,900
I see.

528
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,460
The most important thing
during the competition

529
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,580
is to be flexible.

530
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,580
You gotta make your strategy adjustable

531
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,660
according to different opponents
and fields.

532
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,660
Yes.

533
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,180
And you also have to be aware

534
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,820
of your opponent’s next move in time.

535
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
Remember.

536
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,980
What's the most important is

537
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,180
to seize the initiative,

538
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,260
and never be led by your opponent.

539
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,580
♪The first ray of sunlight♪

540
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,660

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,180
Thus,

546
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,180
SP and K&K

547
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,060
began to prepare for RoboCup together
without hiding anything.

548
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,580
We did a lot of mutual back-scratching

549
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,900
to get ready for RoboCup.

550
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,700
Are you ready?

551
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,420
-There you go.
-There you go. Yeah.

552
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,580
Let’s go together to fight
for the country’s glory this time.

553
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,100
For we veteran players,

554
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,060
not being able to stand on that stage

555
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,180
has become the biggest regret
in our lives.

556
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,660
♪Like a sunlight♪

557
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,540
And now,

558
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,980
we bring our teams back.

559
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,540
We Chinese team

560
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,660
must take the world championship
at this time.

561
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,060
Break a leg.

562
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,060
-Break a leg.
-Break a leg.

565
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,180
Let’s go.

566
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,420
Let’s go.

567
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,900
Don’t worry.

568
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,780
Your regret,

569
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,140
I will help you make up for it.

570
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,060
Thank you.

571
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,940
Welcome.

572
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,100
We’ve checked in.

573
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,220
-Here you go.
-Thank you. Coach.

574
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,740
Here you go.

575
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,500
OK.

576
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,420
Thank you.

577
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,180
Here you go.

578
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,940
Thank you.

579
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,940
Let’s go.

580
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,540
We’re in the hotel of Chicago.

581
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,300
Don’t forget your belongings.

582
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,580
The higher floors are more comfortable
here.

583
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,980
Hi, would you please be careful
while carrying my luggage?

584
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,220
-Thank you.
-Go.

585
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,660
Hey.

586
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,860
You’re in Chicago, right?

587
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,180
Go to the headquarter this afternoon.

588
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,660
What’s the matter?

589
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,980
Nan Wei has something important
to discuss with you.

590
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,980
What’s going on?

591
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,580
Han Shangyan asked me
to go to the headquarter of K&K.

592
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,220
Did he tell you what it’s about?

593
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,700
They haven’t gotten over the photo thing
of us,

594
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,940
have they?

595
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,420
I’ll know after I go there.

596
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,340
Let me go with you.

597
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,540
Go.

598
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Welcome back.

599
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,140
Nan Wei is waiting for you
in his office.

600
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,700
I’ll go in then.

601
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,380
I’ll wait for you here.

602
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,380
This way.

603
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,540
Shall we have a sit-down?

604
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,340
OK.

605
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,940
This way.

606
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,780
Congratulations. Wu Bai.

607
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,420
You’re extraordinary excellent. Wu Bai.

608
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,820
Congratulations on achieving your goal
ahead of schedule.

609
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,180
You’ve made K&K

610
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,100
one of the top two clubs

611
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,260
in China within one year.

612
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,180
At the same time,

613
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,020
on behalf of the Board of Directors,
I hereby declare,

614
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,660
you will be reinstated

615
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,860
as the leader of Team I of K&K China.

616
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,580
Thank you.

617
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,260
Have a seat, please.

618
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,380
K&K China is growing like crazy.

619
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,900
We could be better.

620
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,540
Would you please be specific?

621
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,740
In the past one year,

622
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,620
China’s Combat Robot industry

623
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,740
has grown way faster
than the global average.

624
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,660
It can be said to have entered

625
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,380
the prime time of the industry.

626
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,940
Han and I plan to expand our business.

627
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,180
Yeah.

628
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,860
For example.

629
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,380
Like,

630
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,500
working with Youth Training Camp

631
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,900
to form Team II.

632
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,500
At the beginning,
K&K China was newly established.

633
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,700
We had poured all our resources

634
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,460
into the first team.

635
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,580
Now that the first team

636
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,940
has made amazing achievement,

637
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,540
I suppose,

638
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,220
it is the right time to plan
for Team II.

639
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,660
Except for that,

640
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,860
we also intend

641
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,020
to develop special training programs
for each player

642
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,540
based on their characteristics.

643
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,820
Meanwhile,
we’re going to develop new mechas.

644
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,180
-Very impressive. Good.
-Very impressive.

645
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,860
Really?

646
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,740
It’s been a long time.

647
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,100
Here you go. Have some coffee.

648
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,260
Thank you.

649
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,980
Are you guys…

650
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,900
That’s great to hear.

651
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,420
The captain’s wish for so many years
has finally been achieved.

652
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,940
I saw Wu Bai’s post

653
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,940
in Weibo.

654
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,220
It was so touching that I even cried.

655
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,820
Wish you guys all happiness.

656
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,980
Thank you, Alice.

657
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,100
What is it
that makes you guys so happy?

658
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,820
That’s a secret.

659
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,660
Shall we get going?

660
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,740
Then, we may leave now.

661
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,580
I’ll see you next time.

662
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:11,980
Bye.

663
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,100
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

664
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,860
What a perfect match!

665
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,940
Bai.

666
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,580
Have some fruit.

667
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,900
Are these fruits cut for me?

668
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,100
By the way,

669
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,380
they didn’t give you a hard time
just now, did they?

670
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,060
No, they didn’t.

671
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,820
We just had a small talk

672
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,380
about the plans for K&K.

673
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,740
That’s good.

674
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,060
They reinstated me
as captain by the way.

675
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,900
Seriously?

676
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,020
Such good news,

677
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,860
why didn’t you tell me earlier?

678
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,580
Actually,
it doesn’t make any difference to me now

679
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,460
whether I am the captain or not.

680
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,060
You are so calm.

681
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,300
I’m like this

682
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,740
with everything else but you.

683
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,580
Bai.

684
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,500
I just realized that you’ve changed.

685
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,540
What have I changed?

686
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,660
You become sweeter.

687
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,460
Captain. We’re here for the pep rally.

688
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,780
Pep rally?

689
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,100
Will it be inconvenient
for me to be here?

690
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,460
Not at all.

691
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,700
You just stay in my room.

692
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,140
Are you sure I can hear about it?

693
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,140
OK.

694
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,300
Then I’d like to hear

695
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,980
how you conduct your pep rally.

696
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,420
I’ll go inside.

697
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,260
Come on.

698
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,260
I’m coming. I’m coming.

699
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,740
What’re you dawdling about?

700
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,140
What’s the rush?

701
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,460
Come in.

702
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,580
Did you hide someone inside?

703
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,020
You better not or I’ll tell Ai Qing.

704
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,060
What’re you dawdling about?

705
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,740
Captain. How sweet you are

706
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,500
to cut the fruit for us!

707
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,060
Come on.

708
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,100
Try this. Try this.

709
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,220
These are not for you guys.

710
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,620
Do you know

711
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,620
if there are any fashion boutiques
around here?

712
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,220
I wanna buy something for Ai Jing.

713
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,380
Speaking of Ai Jing,

714
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,220
I got a question for you, Shen Zhe.

715
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,060
You and the captain are dating
two sisters.

716
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,060
Is it because you two are so close

717
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,380
that you got the same tastes?

718
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,140
Same tastes? How come?

719
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,860
Isn’t Ai Jing being way more beautiful
than Ai Qing?

720
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,380
Keep bragging.

721
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,220
Wu Bai doesn’t even care
to argue with you.

722
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,340
Ai Qing is the Goddess of Wu Bai.

723
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,820
But in your case, love is blind.

724
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,180
Yeah.

725
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,900
Someone loves carrots
while someone loves cabbages,

726
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,580
right?

727
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,380
Then, who is the carrot?
Who is the cabbage?

728
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,100
Ai Qing is the carrot.

729
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,580
Ai Jing is the cabbage.

730
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,460
Never mind. Never mind.

731
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,220
Oh, this is how the famous K&K

732
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,540
holds their pep rally.

733
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,660
What are you doing?

734
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,980
The rally starts.

735
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,740
Does this have anything to do

736
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,100
with your taking away my phone?

737
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,140
Take it seriously.

738
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,380
Now, let’s start the pep rally now.

739
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,580
The systematic programs
of the Nobody and Trash Can

740
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,140
have been updated.

741
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,940
My speed of repairing the machine
on the spot

742
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,180
has broken the record.

743
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,460
There will be absolutely no problem
this time.

744
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,540
Trash Can and I are ready

745
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,740
to fight for it.

746
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,100
If we can make it to the end

747
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,020
and win in the finals,

748
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,820
K&K will obtain

749
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,700
the highest honor
in the history of the team.

750
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,540
We Chinese team will also
set a new world record.

751
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,740
Guys.

752
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,300
Not only are we competing,

753
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,380
but also we’re making the history

754
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,940
and fighting for the country’s dignity.

755
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,460
Come on.

756
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,100
Break a leg.

757
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,020
-Go for it, guys.
-Go for it.

758
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,740
Come on.

759
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,500
Bai.

760
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,260
Hm…

761
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,980
I’m glad

762
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,780
you can think in this way.

763
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,540
Dismiss.

764
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,980
That soon?

765
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
We still got…

766
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,980
-…a lot to say.
-Yeah.

767
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,540
That’s almost everything

768
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,500
for today.

769
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,380
Go have some rest, you guys.

770
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,660
But I… Alright.

771
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,260
Let’s go. Let’s go shopping.

772
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,220
Why is the rally so short today?

773
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,180
Go. Buy yourself something.

774
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,340
We’re going shopping, then.

775
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,900
K&K’s pep rally

776
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,820
is quite different than what I thought.

777
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,820
They have been training
for their dream for so long.

778
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,500
It doesn’t really matter what you say

779
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,660
right before the competition.

780
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,780
Let’s go grab some food.

781
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,100
Wait.

782
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,100
I got a question for you.

783
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,660
Who do you think

784
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,860
is the carrot and who is the cabbage?

785
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,340
Let’s go have some food.

786
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,340
Carrot or cabbage, you may eat

787
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,980
whatever you like.

788
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,140
I don’t like the both.

789
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,020
I love meat.

who has successfully advanced
to the quarterfinals.

defeated by RF Team, Australia.

802

Let’s pay tribute to SP.

803
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,980
Although SP Team

804
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,580
hasn’t made it to the final,

805
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,900
they’ve already qualified

806
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,420
for the Top 8 Teams of the World Cup.

807
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,860
This is their best achievement

808
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,180
in the world tournament.

809
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,180
Don’t give up.

810
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,380
As a rapidly improving Chinese team,

811
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,740
they deserve our respect.

to win the RoboCup in the last decade.

823

I wasn’t aware of that.

829

One day, fifty years from now,

855
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,340
when we are walking
on a summer night,

856
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,460
the moon that shines

857
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,580
on Wu Bai and me knows

858
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,900
we have never changed.

859
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,900

when I saw her for the first time,

860
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,700
I’ve been thinking about

861
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,180
the next life between the two of us.
