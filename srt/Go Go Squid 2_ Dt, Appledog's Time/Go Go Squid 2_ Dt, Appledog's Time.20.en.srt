=Episode 20=

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,540
I thought we could arrange
our time freely.

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,060
What we did was like free sparring.

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,100
I’m more tired, okay?

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,940
They dragged me out for half a day.

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,180
I blame Wu Bai.

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,380
I should ask him for compensation.

25
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,740
I need some, too.

26
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,060
Captain, I’d like some compensations.

27
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,340
He replied a period.

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,420
What does he mean?

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,660
It means no.

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,340
You sure have imagination.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,660
I want to report it
as occupational injury.

32
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,660
Me too.

33
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,860
Don’t you have plans
with SP this afternoon?

34
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,540
How come you have time to harass me?

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,420
Right.

36
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,820
We have plans with SP later.

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,620
What time is it?

38
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,300
Is this the place?

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,660
Yeah.

40
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,740
Here they are.

41
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,700
You finally came.

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,020
We’ve been waiting for you.

43
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,100
You lost the game

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,620
but invited us for shooting.

45
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,500
Where’s Wu Bai and Shen Zhe?

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,740
They’re fully scheduled.

47
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,500
Forget about them.

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,700
Let’s play first.

49
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,580
Okay.

50
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,820
Who’s better at this?

51
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,620
Me.

52
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,060
You?

53
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,140
You’re just a kid.

54
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,220
Do you know how to use a gun?

55
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,220
I’m an adult.

56
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,140
Wu Bai has taught me before.

57
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,260
Dare to give it a try?

58
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,380
Sure.

59
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,060
Who else?

60
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,100
The sharpshooter is here.

61
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,500
Xiaomi, go.

62
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,980
You guys play first,

63
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,140
I’ll watch for a bit.

64
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,580
Fine.

65
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,900
I’ll play, I’ll play.

66
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,500
-Let’s play.
-You and me together.

67
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,620
-Okay.
-Come on.

68
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,420
43.

69
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,220
40.

70
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,500
40, 40.

71
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,140
Young people aren’t good enough.

72
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,460
Maybe the older one should play.

73
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,500
What do you mean we aren’t good?

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,020
It’s probably the gun’s fault.

75
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,100
I prefer robot fighting.

76
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,460
Don’t be cocky.

77
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,660
Come on, Xiaomi.

78
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,380
Teach them a lesson.

79
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,580
Yeah, Xiaomi. Go get them.

80
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,140
Hurry.

81
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,380
Revenge for us, Xiaomi.

82
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,260
-Hurry, here you are.
-Come on.

83
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,420
Let’s give the sharpshooter a chance.

84
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,220
I don’t know why.

85
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,860
Lately my hands shake when I’m nervous.

86
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,340
43.

87
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,380
45.

88
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,020
45.

89
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,100
Xiaomi, you got

90
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,340
less than 30 in total.

91
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,060
Impossible.

92
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,460
Did you count it wrong?

93
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,060
No.

94
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,180
Xiaomi,

95
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,860
what happened

96
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,140
to the sharpshooter today?

97
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,380
Did you get drunk when you left today?

98
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,260
Both of the young and old

99
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,140
of SP lost today.

100
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,580
Were you being soft to us?

101
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,140
We weren’t adapted to it.

102
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,860
We haven’t warmed up yet.

103
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,500
Let’s play again.

104
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,380
Sure.

105
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,620
Hi, Coach.

106
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,380
We’re still at the shooting range.

107
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,100
Okay.

108
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,580
I’ll tell them.

109
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,740
Coach said

110
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,260
that she went back first.

111
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,140
We’ll meet at the lobby

112
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,300
in two hours

113
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,180
and go back to Shanghai.

114
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,740
Okay.

115
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,740
Great.

116
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,940
Now that we’ve got time,

117
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,300
don’t say we were bullying you.

118
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,980
The former ones don’t count.

119
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,020
Let’s start over.

120
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,220
Okay.

121
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,380
Be good, Xiaomi.

122
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,140
Come on.

123
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
You guys play.

124
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,740
I’ll go to the toilet.

125
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,820
Who’s playing then?

126
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,260
We will.

127
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,140
I’ll go, too.

128
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,660
What’s wrong?

129
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,660
Are you okay?

130
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,260
I’m fine.

131
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,660
I didn’t sleep well last night.

132
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,980
I’ll wash my face.

133
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,420
I’m okay.

134
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,860
Seriously.

135
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,780
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

139
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,020
Hello?

140
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,580
Are you from the drama club?

141
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,420
Yeah, who are you looking for?

142
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,260
Ai Jing.

143
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,860
Is she here?

144
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,580
Ai Jing? We didn’t see her.

145
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,980
Maybe she went out.

146
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,580
Okay.

147
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,420

I’m not sure

185
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,780
if you still like this flavor.

186
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,700
If you do,

187
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,700
I’ve prepared more.

188
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,460
So many cans.

189
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
How should I clean up?

190
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,260
I’ll do it.

191
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,020
Are you silly?

192
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,620
The silliest thing I’ve done

193
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,740
is falling in love with you.

194
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,980
Wang.

195
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,380
Regarding to your current situation,

196
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,460
we’re deeply concerned.

197
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,260
I understand your concerns.

198
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,460
But I’d like to stress a point

199
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,220
that there’s no ever-victorious general
on the battlefield.

200
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,780
One failure in Chicago doesn’t

201
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,180
mean there’s anything wrong

202
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,540
with SP China.

203
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,540
I don’t know it starts from when

204
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,540
a second-place means

205
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,740
nothing to you.

206
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,060
Wang.

207
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,580
We’re not claiming responsibility.

208
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,700
We’re simply addressing our concerns.

209
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,700
I believe

210
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,980
you can see K&K’s combined score

211
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,820
is overtaking SP’s.

212
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,340
Getting the highest combined
points this year

213
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,740
is the goal for China Zone
set by the head office.

214
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,740
On the regular meeting next week,

215
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,300
I’d like to see an adjustment scheme

216
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,340
of SP China for next season’s work.

217
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,140
No problem.

218
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,260
We’ll give you a satisfying solution

219
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,580
next week.

220
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,340
See you next time.

221
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,420
One week.

222
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,020
Can we make it?

223
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,860
Let me think about it.

224
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,460
Okay.

225
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,980
I’ll give you

226
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,300
some time alone.

227
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,700
See you.

228
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,620
These are

229
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,940
the members of SP Team I.

230
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,220
Welcome

231
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,860
back.

232
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,420
SP.

233
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,940
-Come on!
-Come on!

234
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,980
Shouldn’t he take a rest?

235
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,620
Does he look like having a rest?

236
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,940
What happened to your foot?

237
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,100
I...

238
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,340
I accidentally hurt it.

239
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,060
It’s fine.

240
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,300
You’re in your thirties.

241
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,300
Don’t be so careless.

242
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,340
Be careful.

243
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,100
When did he start?

244
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,780
He started from six o’clock.

245
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,340
I should talk to Solo,

246
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,540
we should help Xiaomi.

247
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,140
I actually talked to Xiaomi last night.

248
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,780
You two?

249
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,300
What did he say?

250
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,420
We first talked about

251
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,540
some shared experiences.

252
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,980
Then he said

253
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,980
he’d like to try one more time with us.

254
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,700
It’s great

255
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,860
for him to think so.

256
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,700
Yeah.

257
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,740
Give him some time.

258
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,900
He’ll come back.

259
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,980
Did you stay up all night?

260
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,180
I’m fine.

261
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,900
Is it because of Xiaomi?

262
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,860
This is the transfer order

263
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,460
addressed from the head office just now.

264
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,260
They think Xiaomi isn’t suitable
for staying at Team I.

265
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,020
They want him to be the Captain
of Team II.

266
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,420
Have a look.

267
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,500
Didn’t we settle on the meeting

268
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,620
to give him a week to adjust?

269
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,180
But they just checked

270
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,420
the recent training report this morning.

271
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,700
(Xiaomi)

272
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,420
This, is what I want to tell you.

273
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,140
It’s true that Xiaomi’s recent status
isn’t ideal.

274
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,460
It’s probably because he just came back
from Chicago.

275
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,180
He needs some time to relax.

276
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,420
But you are not sure

277
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,740
that he’ll be fine within a week.

278
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,380
What’s your point?

279
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,420
Maybe we should transfer him to Team II

280
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,460
for him to adjust himself.

281
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,740
You were a player before.

282
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,780
Do you know what it will mean
to him if he got transferred?

283
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,820
Yes, I was a player before.

284
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,020
That’s exactly why I know

285
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,980
what a player’s status

286
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,220
means to the whole team.

287
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,500
But I trust him.

288
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,060
Nobody knows him better than I do.

289
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,140
He’ll take care of it for sure.

290
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,260
I know your original intention
of forming the team.

291
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,620
It’s to help everyone
to live a better life.

292
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,620
But if it’s to sacrifice the team,

293
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,980
I don’t think that’s what they want.

294
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,380
Next season’s competitions
are coming.

295
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,260
I hope you can decide sooner.

296
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,300
Come in, please.

297
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,780
Baona is here, too.

298
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,900
Boss,

299
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,740
I’ve got Xiaomi’s training plan

300
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,820
to report to you.

301
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,780
You came at the right time.

302
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,860
We want to discuss about Xiaomi

303
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,340
with you, too.

304
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,420
Really?

305
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,700
We can talk together.

306
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,540
Yeah.

307
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,700
According to Xiaomi’s recent status,

308
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,220
the club has decided

309
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,540
to transfer him to Team II

310
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,420
as the Captain.

311
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,580
What was that?

312
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,180
Just one failure and he
got transferred to Team II?

313
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,140
Baona.

314
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,900
I want to know the reason.

315
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,060
You are aware of how much effort

316
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,340
the guys have made recently.

317
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,140
Yeah.

318
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,100
I know.

319
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,980
But you know this industry.

320
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,500
Winning a competition isn’t
about how hard you try.

321
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,660
Plus, Xiaomi has been down

322
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,940
for not only one game.

323
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,300
Based on his recent situation,

324
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,740
even if he has performed normally,

325
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,620
the result would be just so so.

326
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,980
How can he continue

327
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,100
the following games on behalf of SP?

328
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,980
Give him some time.

329
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,940
Xiaomi can do it.

330
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,900
There’s no time for SP.

331
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,020
The competitions in Shanghai
are beginning soon.

332
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,660
SP can’t take the risk.

333
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,580
But it’s as well risky
to suddenly promote

334
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,500
a player from Team II.

335
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,860
There will be a chance at least.

336
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,580
A chance which Xiaomi can give, too.

337
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,620
What if he fails?

338
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,980
Who’s to take the responsibility?

339
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,740
Me.

340
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,860
If Xiaomi fails the competitions
in Shanghai,

341
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,340
I’ll take the blame and resign.

342
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,820
Me, too.

343
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,620
Wait.

344
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,820
You are moral kidnapping me.

345
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,700
Baona,

346
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,460
it’s not about that.

347
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,540
It’s taboo to switch players
shortly before the games.

348
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,580
You don’t want to make everyone

349
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,700
unsettled before the games, right?

350
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,180
Baona.

351
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,220
Put off the transfer offer for me.

352
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,740
This time, it’ll be our last chance.

353
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,980
Let’s try our best again, okay?

354
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,620
Yeah, Baona.

355
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,540
Let’s try again.

356
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,260
Yeah.

357
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,100
Fine.

358
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,380
Let’s try again

359
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,460
together.

360
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,420
Doggie, you came.

361
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,820
Xiaomi.

362
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,100
I designed a training plan for you.

363
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,540
Let’s try it

364
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,980
tomorrow.

365
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
Okay.

366
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,620
(Mi Shaofei’s training plan)

367
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,020
There’s even simulation of...

368
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,980
What’s wrong?

369
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,620
You look upset.

370
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,580
Did Baona

371
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,860
say anything to you?

372
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,780
No.

373
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,140
I’m guessing

374
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,500
they want to transfer me to Team II.

375
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,540
Xiaomi, actually...

376
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,740
You don’t have to.

377
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,340
Doggie,

378
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,620
the five of us used
to be best friends before.

379
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,540
I understand what’s on their minds.

380
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,100
It’s not decided yet.

381
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,380
We have to work hard together, Xiaomi.

382
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,980
I’m from Solo Team.

383
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,860
I won’t shame you.

384
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,220
I’ll take care of this plan.

385
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,060
I’ll cooperate as much as possible.

386
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,940
I can do it.

387
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,060
I know.

388
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,020
You can do it.

389
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,580
We’ve played many games together.

390
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,780
But I’ve noticed many problems
from them.

391
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,900
Our team has been founded
for months.

392
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,020
However, we don’t cooperate well as SP.

393
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,420
Especially some players,

394
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,540
don’t stand out too much,

395
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,620
don’t get led by the nose.

396
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,940
What’s up?

397
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,380
Many people caught cold recently.

398
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,500
Besides, we had a meeting

399
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,660
with SP the day before yesterday.

400
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,220
Two got infected.

401
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,460
Everyone,

402
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,500
have some 999 Coldrine, please.

403
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,420
Just in case.

404
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,220
Thank you, Coach.

405
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,260
Thank you, Coach.

406
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,780
Let’s have dinner tonight.

407
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,460
Well...

408
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,860
Is SP’s coach okay?

409
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,060
Ai Qing?

410
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,660
She’s fine.

411
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,380
I saw her sending medicines

412
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,900
to Solo and others that day.

413
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,860
Continue the meeting.

414
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,860
Bai,

415
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,180
I have to work overtime.

416
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,780
Look at you.

417
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,420
You didn’t train hard.

418
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,380
One more training, is it OK?

419
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,060
OK.

420
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,260
OK.

421
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,420
OK.

422
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,060
Hurry up.

423
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,980
Are you serious?

424
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,140
Go.

425
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,260
Seriously?

426
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,380
Are you being jealous?

427
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,140
Why do you always

428
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,580
think about love affairs?

429
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,580
I know you.

430
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,700
No.

431
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,540
I’m thinking about strategies.

432
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,180
Listen to me.

433
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,660
Being jealous

434
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,420
is necessary.

435
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,660
Being jealous in front of

436
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,180
a girl

437
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,540
will make her happy.

438
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,740
It’s also a strategy.

439
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,860
Can you be frank in a love affair?

440
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,180
Nerd.

441
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,420
This is temperament.

442
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,020
How was your day with Ai Qing?

443
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,260
Well,

444
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,740
you were too aggressive
in the competition that day.

445
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,380
Do you know?

446
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,500
All you know

447
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,140
is competition.

448
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,180
Can you talk about something else?

449
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,620
It’s training time.

450
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,020
Wipe off the unnecessary stuffs

451
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,820
from your mind.

452
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,260
You should do it first.

453
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,540
What’s up?

454
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,420
Training.

455
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,660
Don’t be so listless.

456
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,780
Drink some water.

457
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,780
Thanks.

458
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,780
What’s this?

459
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,420
(Big surprise: they’re
in secret relationship)

460
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,300
You hid it quite well.

461
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,460
Don’t laugh.

462
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,660
It’s a big matter.

463
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,540
What a jerk.

464
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,140
I’ll report them.

465
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,380
Am I going to be

466
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,060
famous?

467
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,020
97, come to train.

468
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,140
Slide, you’re responsible to

469
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,140
help Xiaomi upgrade.

470
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,420
Get it.

471
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,420
Take it easy, you’ve got us.

472
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,660
(Ai Qing)

473
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,820
Zhou Yi.

474
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,180
What are you doing?

475
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,260
Adding some energy.

476
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,260
Do it later.

477
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,260
I have something to tell you.

478
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,180
What?

479
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,820
How about we start a living streaming?

480
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,140
Why?

481
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,500
The fans have paired us as 98 team.

482
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,140
98 team.

483
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,820
97 plus 1.

484
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,060
98.

485
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,140
98.

486
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,900
98 Team.

487
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,780
What can it do?

488
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,900
A team

489
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,180
has the most fans.

490
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,140
If we get fans,

491
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,500
we become popular.

492
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,900
When we become popular,

493
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,420
more people will purchase.

494
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,180
Do you understand?

495
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,860
Can I sell vegetables for my mother?

496
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,700
Selling vegetables?

497
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,900
We can make some

498
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,020
cute robots to sell it.

499
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,140
Why selling vegetables?

500
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,380
What’s wrong with vegetables?

501
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,940
We plant organic vegetables

502
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,260
that are natural
and environmental-friendly.

503
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,020
They’re the best vegetables.

504
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,780
I’m not speaking ill of your vegetables.

505
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,260
Can we sell something else?

506
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,300
I don’t want others

507
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,540
but vegetables.

508
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,300
Yes or no?

509
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,060
OK. I accept it.

510
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,380
Do we really sell vegetables?

Let’s see it.

580
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,580
The first question is:

581
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,940
What do you and Zhou Yi usually do?

582
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,060
What do we usually do?

583
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,660
As for me,

584
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,740
I like roller skating,

585
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,820
skiing,

586
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,140
playing games and so on.

587
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,340
As for Zhou Yi. He…

588
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:01,900
As for me,

589
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,060
I like cooking.

590
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,820
I think many of you may

591
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,860
like cooking,

592
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,540
so I’ve prepared,

593
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,420
look,

594
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,620

595
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,020
This is my farm.

596
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,740
Today...

597
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,660
We have lots of

598
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,420
fresh vegetables and fruits.

599
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,620

600
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,180

601

Well.

607
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,820
Let’s look at the second question.

608
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,300
My own watermelon.

609
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,380
They’re so good.

610
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,380
Listen to it.

611
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,260
It’s ripe.

612
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,220
This…

613
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,460
It will be good if you juice it.

614
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,620
Let me cut it for you.

615
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,460
Well… He’s kind of excited today.

616
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,260
I don’t know why.

617
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,740
Don’t mind it.

618
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,060
Let’s see other questions.

619
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,980
Someone said,

620
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,780
97’s clothes is pretty,

621
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,820
is Shen Zhe who bought it?

622
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,420
Of course not.

623
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,260
I take him to buy clothes.

624
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,020
If I don’t ask him to,

625
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,540
he won’t buy anything.

626
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,300
You know?

627
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,180
Look!

628
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,060

629
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,300

I just show you.

631
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,420
Look at its color.

632
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:57,900
It’s red.

633
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,900

634
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,620

637
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,140
Shen Zhe and I…

638
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,620
So delicious.

639
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,660
Oh my God.

640
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,540
-Everybody.
-Taste it.

641
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,020
No, no, no.

642
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,780
It’s…

643
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,380
It’s…

644
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,780
It’s Shen Zhe’s suit.

645
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,660
Shen Zhe’s suit.

646
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,460
I borrowed it from him.

647
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,860
It’s the latest one.

648
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,180
What shall I do?

649
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,660
Don’t worry. I’ll wipe it.

650
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,100
It gets messy. Stop it.

651
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,820
Well… I’m sorry.

652
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,980
I’ll… I’ll deal with it.

653
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,660
Zhou’s Farm, remember it.

654
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,380
Impossible.

655
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,460
What did you do?

656
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,180
Well…

657
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,220
You said your mom can deal with it.

658
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,380
But it can’t be wiped.

659
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,540
My mom thought it was mine,

660
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,980
so she made that.

661
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,140
Actually it’s quite pretty.

662
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,060
It matches the suit.

663
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,340
We’re doomed, you know?

664
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,020
Buddy.

665
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,260
Its…

666
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,900
What are you doing?

667
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,420
Nothing.

668
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,180
This is my suit.

669
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,940
Give it to me if you’ve washed it.

670
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,020
I’ll put it

671
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,820
in your room later.

672
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,380
I… I haven’t washed it.

673
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,340
Okay.

674
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,980
I’ll do it myself.

675
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,780
How about me putting it into you room

676
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,060
after washing it?

677
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,780
Just give it to me.

678
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,500
I’ll do it by myself.

679
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,420
No, no.

680
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,380
It’s…

681
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,300
97, what’s wrong?

682
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,860
Well…

683
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,660
Is it pretty?

684
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,820
It’s not my fault.

685
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,380
This is limited, you know?

686
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,060
It’s not my fault.

687
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,220
It’s not your fault?

688
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,380
Then who is to blame?

689
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,380
Explain it.

690
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,340
Well... It’s an accident.

691
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,060
What the hell did you do?

692
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,820
Accident?

693

694

You?

695
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,940
No.

696
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,540
None of my business.

697
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,300
Not you? Who?

698
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,860
Not you.

699
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,940
There’s somebody else.

700
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,180
Help me, Captain.

701
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,980
I’ve got business to do.

702
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,780
I have no time.

703
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,860
Where’re you going?

704
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,500
Take me with you.

705
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,300
Don’t go anywhere.

706
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:54,780
Ai Qing.

707
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,580
This is not my fault.

708
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,180
-I’m going. See you later.
-Explain it.

709
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,620
It’s… I could have fixed it.

710
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,140
It’s not my fault.

711
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,380
Did you fix it? In this way?

712
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,420
Not me…

713
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,100
No, no, no.

714
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
-97.
-Don’t… We have a competition.

715
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,540
97.

716
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,500
You’re not innocent, right?

717
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,860
It’s none of my business.

718
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,420
I’ll hit you.

719
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,580
Good.

720
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,940
I’m in a good state.

721
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,100
Another two rounds.

722
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,860
Okay.

723
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,420
Bai,

724
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,660
my work hasn’t been done.

725
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,260
Maybe I’ll be a little bit late.

726
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,940
Good news.

727
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,180
Guess what?

728
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,340
The main force of Knight Team

729
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,700
just announced retirement.

730
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,940
His mecha blueprint

731
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,220
has been posted on the internet.

732
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,660
In my view, up to now,

733
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,980
his mecha

734
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,420
is the most similar to yours.

735
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,700
Great.

736
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,420
Now,

737
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,540
ask all the members

738
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,340
to come to the meeting room.

739
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,100
Hurry up.

740
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,100
Let’s go.

741
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,900
Go.

742
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,340
This is the park ice cream’s new type

743
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,340
special for spring.

744
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,460
Do you want a taste?

745
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,060
No interest.

746
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,660
Just an ice cream.

747
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,020
It hazelnut latte flavor.

748
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,260
So delicious.

749
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,300
Well, let’s try it.

750
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,100
Let’s go.

751
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,660
Here you are.

752
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,660
Slide said he found the blueprint for

753
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,220
Xiaomi’s mecha.

754
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,100
The competition in Shanghai
is about to start.

755
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,020
Is there still time?

756
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,660
We gotta try anyway.

757
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,500
OK.

758
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,580
Let me help.

759
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,660
No.

760
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,580
You’re responsible for the chip upgrade.

761
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,180
-You have no spare time.
-Exactly.

762
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,140
Doggie.

763
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,540
Xiaomi is my good friend

764
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,500
as well as your friend.

765
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,220
You can

766
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,180
help.

767
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,340
Why can’t I?

768
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:19,900
OK, OK.

769
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,220
I can’t win you.

770
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,060
But you have

771
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,900
loads of work to do now.

772
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,140
It’s okay.

773
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,540
No problem.

774
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,060
Buddy.

775
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,180
Stop.

776
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,060
Don’t be so courtesy.

777
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,020
Let’s discuss it

778
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,540
and decide the plan.

779
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,420
OK.

780
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,660
Look.

781
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,580
Clear up this.

782
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,580
This… And that…

783
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,700
Put them together.

784
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,220
OK.

785
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,700
Yes.

786
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,060
Hello.

787
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,780
Miss,

788
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,220
a spring special
hazelnut latte ice cream.

789
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,100
Fifteen yuan.

790
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,380
OK.

791
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,340
Here.

792
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,620
Miss,

793
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,780
a hazelnut latte ice cream.

794
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,300
OK.

795
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,980
Miss,

796
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,180
hazelnut latte

797
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,940
should be special for winter, right?

798
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,740
Lots of customers have said that,

799
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,740
so we won’t sell it

800
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,460
tomorrow.

801
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,620
This is limited.

802
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,180
Your ice cream.

803
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,100
Take it.

804
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,580
