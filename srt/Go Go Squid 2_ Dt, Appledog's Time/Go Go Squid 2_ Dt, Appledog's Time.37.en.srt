=Episode 37=

19
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,290
We’re home.

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,370
Dad’s prepared a table of food,

21
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,160
and wine.

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,540
(Drunk as a lord)

23
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,370
Drunk as a lord.

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,200
I’m sure my sister wrote this.

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,380
Okay.

26
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,250
Now it’s only two of us here.

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,640
Eat something.

28
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,610
Ai Qing.

29
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,160
You first.

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,640
Please.

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,290
Why?

32
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,370
Please.

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,220
Wait for a while.

34
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,290
What’s up

35
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,800
your sleeve?

36
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,650
This is

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,290
my bank card.

38
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,690
The bonuses I got from
winning games are all in it.

39
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,770
My dear Bai,

40
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,520
are you gonna hand over

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,920
your financial rights to me so soon?

42
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,700
I was about to propose to you

43
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,930
when we were
at the City Street Garden.

44
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,250
But I was one step ahead of you.

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,220
Then please tell me

46
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,210
how would you

47
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,860
propose to me if I haven’t asked you.

48
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,560
97 and the others were just around,

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,280
each holding a box

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,490
like this.

51
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,340
97?

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,290
Were they all there?

53
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,900
What is this?

54
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,360
Your car key.

55
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,210
Car key?

56
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,560
I was thinking sometimes
I might be too busy

57
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,210
to pick you up,

58
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,640
so I’ve brought a car for you.

59
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,610
But first of all,
you need a driver’s license.

60
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,930
This is

61
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,140
the key of our wedding house.

62
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,810
Wedding house?

63
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,340
You have a wedding house in place?

64
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,490
The house...

65
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,160
It...

66
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,420
Bai,

67
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,000
I feel like

68
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,890
I was to marry

69
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,620
Doraemon.

70
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,010
I think I haven’t prepared enough.

71
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,980
It’s enough.

72
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,770
Actually,

73
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,900
I can do without these

74
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,690
as long as I get you.

75
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,810
No.

76
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,530
I’ve been imagining it for ten years

77
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,820
and I’ve been preparing for it
for ten years.

78
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,730
Could you tell me

79
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,380
what we will become in ten years?

80
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,340
We’ll be happier.

81
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,690
Bai.

82
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Bai.

83
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,620
Do you feel anything special?

84
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,660
For what?

85
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,170
Before and after we married.

86
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,060
Yes.

87
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,170
Such as...?

88
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,820
Such as tonight.

89
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,450
I’ll sleep soundly

90
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,660
on your bed.

91
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,140
Bad boy!

92
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,980
This is my right.

93
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,850
-I...
-Is that Grandpa?

94
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,850
Grandpa.

95
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,820
Hello Bai,

96
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,380
where are you?

97
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,340
In Ai Qing’s home.

98
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,900
Brushing my teeth.

99
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,380
For such a good day,

100
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,380
you should take her

101
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,570
to some romantic place.

102
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,540
I thought you would be
cleverer than your cousin,

103
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,340
yet you are as silly as him

104
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,570
when it comes to
such a critical moment.

105
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,010
Grandpa, you’ve misunderstood him.

106
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,820
It’s my idea.

107
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,060
Qing,

108
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,500
you can’t protect him like this

109
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,900
even before your wedding.

110
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,540
You should tell me

111
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,100
if he makes you

112
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,380
feel wronged.

113
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,850
Thank you, Grandpa.

114
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,820
Goodbye, Grandpa.

115
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,450
Did you hear it?

116
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,300
If you dare to bully me,

117
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,740
I’ll tell Grandpa.

118
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,910
I’m gonna bully you.
Can you stop me?

119
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,830
I’m calling Grandpa.

120
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,790
What are you doing?

121
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,110
Now, you can’t tell him.

122
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,990
(Mom)

123
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,380
My mom.

124
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:24,970
Mom.

125
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,390
Bai,

126
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,910
can I have a word with
my daughter-in-law?

127
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,570
Mom, it’s the first day...

128
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,250
Never mind.

129
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,180
Please speak, Auntie, I’m here.

130
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,700
You’re still calling me Auntie?

131
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,580
Please speak, Mom.

132
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,740
Bai,

133
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,260
what are you doing?

134
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,970
-Brushing teeth.
-Watching the movie.

135
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,670
What are you doing exactly?

136
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,380
-Watching the movie.
-Watching the movie.

137
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,350
Bai,

138
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,900
I have to blame you.

139
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,250
Even a man as straight as your dad

140
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,950
won’t do so unromantic things

141
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,580
like you.

142
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,850
Am I right?

143
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,350
Wu Bai, your mom is right.

144
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,780
You should be more thoughtful.

145
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,860
Hm...

146
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,260
Then I’ll hang up.

147
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,970
All right.

148
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,290
I’m sorry to bother you.

149
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:14,910
Goodbye.

150
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,300
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

151
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,700
Why not watch the movie?

152
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,130
Okay.

153
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,930
Which movie should we watch?

154
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,340
What about...?

155
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,300
You really want to watch the movie?

156
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,500
What are you working on?

157
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,140
The Champion Food we invented.

158
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,660
The more you eat,
the more champions you’ll get.

159
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,020
It’s the starter.

160
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,350
Gold shrimp and egg dumplings.

161
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,230
I’m gonna make
the winner’s oil-fried dumplings.

162
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,870
And the champion’s fried dumplings.

163
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,380
And...

164
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,420
I haven’t finished yet.

165
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,310
Though the name is strange,

166
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,870
it tastes good.

167
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,820
Shen Zhe!

168
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,140
Come and see
our championship display case.

169
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,060
Let’s go.

170
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,620
How is it?

171
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,700
What the hell are you doing?

172
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,350
We’re different now.

173
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,430
What’s different?

174
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,460
We’re the champion team.

175
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,990
Things should be changed.

176
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,620
Yes.

177
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,620
So?

178
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,740
What comes first to others’ eyes

179
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,190
when they come to visit us?

180
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,190
Of course, it’s the environment.

181
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,190
This is the “face” of K&K!

182
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,260
Isn’t it amazing? Look.

183
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,790
I’ll call all other teams

184
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,990
and ask them to

185
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,310
visit us.

186
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,630
Isn’t it...?

187
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,430
Although we’re champions,

188
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,430
we need to be low-key.

189
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,700
Am I right, Captain?

190
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,870
Since you’re all here,

191
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,630
we’ll have a meeting.

192
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,750
I’ve strictly examined myself.

193
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,140
Although we’ve got good results,

194
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,310
we can’t be arrogant.

195
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,430
Even though we have won
the world champion,

196
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,580
we still have many things

197
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,630
that could be improved.

198
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,750
Yes.

199
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,030
I bet that Naya

200
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,940
will upgrade their mecha.

201
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,880
But I think I might have

202
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,060
underestimated them.

203
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,670
So I will schedule

204
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,550
an upgrade of The Nobody,

205
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,070
just recently.

206
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,360
Shen Zhe.

207
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,440
I’ve thought a lot
after we’ve competed with

208
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,700
the world’s best players.

209
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,790
I... I will lock myself up
to do some practices.

210
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,380
Come on!

211
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,620
Fine.

212
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,670
A great team should never be

213
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,800
satisfied with victory
or be daunted by losing.

214
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,620
Captain, why I find you

215
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,460
smiling strangely?

216
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,350
Were you intimidating us?

217
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,550
I didn’t say anything.

218
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,460
You made the summary,

219
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,670
and that was good.

220
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,270
Captain,

221
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,430
you’re a bad boy.

222
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,350
Fine. Let’s get back to the point.

223
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,230
Wu Bai,

224
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,760
what were you gonna tell us?

225
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,200
Actually,

226
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,710
I have one thing to tell you.

227
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,240
What is it?

228
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,680
I get married.

229
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,820
Really?

230
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,230
You are married.

231
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,760
When is the wedding party?

232
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,140
Next month.

233
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,390
Buddies,

234
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,380
let’s buy some formal suits.

235
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,030
Let’s go.

236
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,060
Get it done.

237
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,870
Where is the Captain?

238
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,680
I don’t know. Where is he?

239
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,380
-Wu Bai.
-Wu Bai.

240
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,240
Wu Bai.

241
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,630
You look good.

242
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,470
A fake gentleman.

243
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,460
A fictitious lord.

244
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,790
Mind your words!

245
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,800
Don’t worry.

246
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,830
We only speak good words.

247
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,560
Do you think

248
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,060
she will love it?

249
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
Of course.

250
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,320
You’re the most handsome man

251
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,200
in our team.

252
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,630
She should be satisfied with that.

253
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,510
Rest assured, Captain.

254
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,630
I’m sure Ai Qing will like it.

255
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,470
Come on!

256
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,390
Fine.

257
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,800
Grandpa,

258
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,000
these are all formal suits.

259
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,120
Yes.

260
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,590
Weddings nowadays need

261
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,360
more than one suit.

262
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,680
We need to prepare some
for our children’s wedding.

263
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,200
Yes.

264
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,920
Hello.

265
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,270
Hello,

266
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,390
do you need some formal suits?

267
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,270
Yes.

268
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,710
My grandchild is about to marry.

269
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,720
Please give your recommendations.

270
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,510
I’m the Grandpa.

271
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,830
He is the dad.

272
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,800
Here is a robot.

273
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,800
How do you like it?

274
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,070
Good.

275
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,440
I’ll buy them.

276
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,070
All of them?

277
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,030
Which payment method you prefer?

278
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,030
Scan it.

279
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,950
Okay, I’ll pack them for you.

280
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,280
Fine.

281
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,950
Grandpa, you’ll buy all of them?

282
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,000
Won't it will cost you too much?

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
Don't say that.

284
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
We’ll soon be one family.

285
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,390
Don’t be ceremonious with me.

286
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,770
Right.

287
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,030
A friend of mine

288
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,840
recommended an interior designer
to me.

289
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,270
Why not help our children
with their house designing?

290
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,390
That’s a good idea.

291
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,570
They are too busy

292
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,890
to look after that.

293
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,560
But you must not grab the bill again.

294
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,400
You... You pay?

295
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,570
I can share it with you.

296
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,890
Let’s go and have a cup of tea.

297
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,010
Fine.

298
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,710
It’s on me.

299
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,200
Please sit here.

300
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,830
I’ve looked

301
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,450
the floor plan of your house.

302
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,640
And may I know which style

303
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
you prefer,

304
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,840
the general style?

305
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,880
I hear that the newlyweds

306
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,600
are athletes.

307
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,690
Yes, they are.

308
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,070
Robot fighting athletes.

309
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,240
Sounds good.

310
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,320
Our children are working on high-tech.

311
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,520
Not only robots,

312
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,280
but artificial intelligence.

313
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,480
Just like this robot.

314
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,010
Hello.

315
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,000
Then should we have some

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,560
technological elements

317
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,930
in the house?

318
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,040
Please look at this.

319
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,710
This?

320
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,390
No, no, no.

321
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,330
I’ve been to their base.

322
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,680
It’s all copper and iron.

323
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,400
It would startle them

324
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,560
if they got up at midnight and saw this.

325
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,160
Not this.
Show me some loving designs.

326
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,330
Loving?

327
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,560
What about the minimalist style?

328
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,400
It’s popular among young people.

329
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,760
It renders a sense of the future

330
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,770
while being suitable for family living.

331
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,590
Minimalist?

332
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,120
I know this.

333
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,960
It’s just like

334
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,360
an empty house.

335
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,120
It is not

336
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,520
warm.

337
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,440
No. I don’t like it.

338
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,210
It's not suitable.

339
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,450
What if the traditional Chinese style?

340
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,000
Traditional Chinese style?

341
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,840
Isn’t it mahogany plus rosewood?

342
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,770
That’s old-fashioned.

343
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,390
Young people won’t like it.

344
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,760
And

345
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,800
it’s too expensive.

346
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,000
It’s not suitable.

347
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,210
Too expensive.

348
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,200
It’s not suitable, right?

349
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,930
What about this European vintage style?

350
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,450
Please look at it.

351
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,720
This one?

352
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,210
Isn’t it lace?

353
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,560
Lace or something.

354
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,810
This is absolutely not.

355
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,040
And this is also expensive.

356
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,840
This is not suitable, too.

357
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,240
Can you describe

358
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,880
the style you want

359
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,970
to me?

360
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,490
I’ll keep a note.

361
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,870
It’s like...

362
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,870
For example,

363
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,280
it should be simple but not plain,

364
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,450
low-key but a little luxurious.

365
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,150
Yes.

366
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,040
And then…

367
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,440
Some tech elements…

368
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,520
Some tech elements
in a loving environment.

369
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,490
Yes.

370
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,000
Also…

371
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,930
Some festive air...

372
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,970
Right.

373
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,350
Some festive air in an elegant manner.

374
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,330
Yes.

375
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,640
Mr. Ai,

376
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,280
do you have anything to add?

377
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
It's good.

378
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,120
You’ve spoken all I want.

379
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,970
The most important thing is…

380
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,810
The most important thing is?

381
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,850
A reasonable price.

382
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,520
Right.

383
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,000
Even if my client
embarrasses me a thousand times,

384
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,930
I’ll still treat him as my first love.

385
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,720
When one day I become the boss,

386
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,850
I’ll embarrass
all design institutes on earth.

387
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,550
Hush!

388
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,880
Bai, there you are. Come here.

389
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,090
Look what your grandpa

390
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,880
has bought.

391
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,410
What did you buy?

392
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,000
Isn’t it that
you and Ai Qing are married?

393
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,610
I know you two are busy,

394
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,610
so I’ve settled the deal

395
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,280
for your new house’s decoration

396
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,810
with Ai Qing’s dad.

397
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,330
Decoration for the new house?

398
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,280
Yes.

399
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,210
You’re married.

400
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,010
Soon or later,
you’ll need to furnish your house.

401
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,610
Have you finished with
my cousin’s house?

402
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,570
You should help him first.

403
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,930
Your cousin has been

404
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,970
very choosy.

405
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,360
I won’t meddle in his affair.

406
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,330
Come here and see.

407
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,930
I know young people

408
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,690
don’t like traditional things.

409
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,330
So I’ve chosen the smart home devices.

410
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,120
They said

411
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,760
it’s the color-changeable light

412
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,460
with voice controller.

413
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,850
How do you like it?

414
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,690
It is

415
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,090
special.

416
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,090
Yes.

417
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,210
It takes time before Ai Qing’s dad
and I settled on this one,

418
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,890
but I think the color

419
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,880
should be adjusted.

420
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,160
Grandpa,

421
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,450
I think the house
I am living in is good enough.

422
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,450
Isn’t it that my cousin
still needs a new house?

423
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,400
You should choose
a design scheme for him.

424
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,850
And his style should be

425
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,220
more festive than mine,

426
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,760
or he would complain that
you’re partial to me.

427
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,530
Yes.

428
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,450
You’re right.

429
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,880
Fine.

430
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,610
I should take this opportunity

431
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,360
to find a good design for him.

432
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,620
Then

433
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,360
I’ll leave it to you.

434
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
I’ll go now.

435
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,400
Congratulations!

436
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,120
You’ll soon have a new house.

437
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,090
-Bai.
-Grandpa.

438
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,050
Quick and help me.

439
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,580
It’s heavy.

440
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,730
There you are, Dad.

441
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,530
Grandpa,

442
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,890
what’s in it that makes it so heavy?

443
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,210
Mahjong.

444
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,050
Grandpa.

445
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,640
I’m bored staying at home alone.

446
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,760
So,

447
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,970
I’ve come

448
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,490
to play mahjong with you.

449
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,690
Mahjong?

450
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
That’s great.

451
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,330
I was thinking of playing mahjong.

452
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,820
Ai Qing,

453
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,400
can you play mahjong?

454
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,610
I saw my dad playing it,

455
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,410
so I knew the rules.

456
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,330
That’s fine.

457
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,700
You, me, and Bai.

458
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,410
We play mahjong.

459
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,880
Grandpa, I can’t play mahjong.

460
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,250
You knew that.

461
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,130
My grandson is so clever

462
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,740
that you should know the rules
after two rounds.

463
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,690
Mr. Wu, can you play mahjong?

464
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,210
I...

465
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,880
He can’t.

466
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,940
He can’t.

467
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,770
I totally have no idea of the game.

468
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,890
Right.

469
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,740
No more of it. We’ll start soon.

470
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,170
One, two, three, four.

471
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,410
We four play mahjong.

472
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,500
Hurry.

473
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,580
I should put it first

474
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,890
that it’s a real game.

475
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,410
Of course it is.

476
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,740
Fine.

477
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,820
Grandpa,

478
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,050
shouldn’t we talk about

479
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,650
the rules first?

480
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,770
Bai, don’t you have
the basic knowledge of it?

481
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,220
I don’t, but I can learn.

482
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,760
Mahjong is simple.

483
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,640
You must have a yaozi.

484
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,050
If you have all shunzi, kezi,
and jiangpai on your hand,

485
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,530
you win.

486
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,340
Yes.

487
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,860
Let’s begin.

488
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,810
Begin.

489
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,050
Let’s play mahjong.

490
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,770
Yi wan.

491
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,530
Xi feng.

492
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,130
I have a good hand.

493
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,940
Which one should I give out?

494
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,410
Does anyone like yi tong?

495
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,530
No, I don’t need it.

496
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,250
Wait, Grandpa.

497
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,620
I need yi tong.

498
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,530
Thank you,  Auntie.

499
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,890
I win.

500
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,220
It just matches.

501
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,410
Yes.

502
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,650
Wait a minute.

503
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,230
It seems I win, too.

504
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,980
Same color and neat.

505
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,580
A big win for you.

506
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,380
Brilliant. How smart you are!

507
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,530
Let’s go on.

508
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,740
Another round.

509
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,580
Er wan.

510
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,290
It’s mine.

511
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,580
I have three of it.

512
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,410
Liu tong.

513
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,500
Thank you, Grandpa.

514
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,940
Win!

515
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,660
Si tong.

516
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,500
I win.

517
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,980
Both of you’ve won?

518
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,500
I win.

519
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,770
I win.

520
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,500
Again, I win.

521
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,820
Again, I win.

522
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,990
Grand slam!

523
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,980
You’re amazing, today.

524
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,890
Bai,

525
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,060
you’ve won the day.

526
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,500
Grandpa must have been tired.

527
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,940
Let’s stop here.

528
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,780
Qing,

529
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,460
let me buy some

530
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,990
wedding dresses for you.

531
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,530
Do you mean bridal gowns?

532
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,250
Let’s go. Bai, you’ll be the driver.

533
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,170
Fine.

534
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,770
Let’s go. Hurry.

535
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,350
-Grandpa, we’ll leave now.
-Sure.

536
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,780
Go.

537
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,180
We’re leaving.

538
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,370
I didn’t know you’re

539
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,230
so good at cooperating.

540
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,870
Are you happy?

541
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,890
Dad, you should

542
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,340
have told me in advance

543
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,950
so I can have some preparations.

544
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,020
You just made me nervous.

545
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,500
Don’t worry.

546
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,780
We still have many opportunities.

547
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,130
Because they won’t take

548
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,980
our money directly, will they?

549
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,630
We must find a method
to make them take our money.

550
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,290
Nice, give me five!

551
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,870
Yes.

552
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,780
Two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

553
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,290
That’s a lot.

554
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,540
Enough?

555
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,250
We still need some else.

556
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,060
We’ll go and buy shoes tomorrow.

557
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,770
Mom,

558
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,470
Ai Qing needs to work tomorrow.

559
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,660
She can’t go shopping with you.

560
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
Right.

561
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,820
Ai Qing has work to do.

562
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,580
How can she go shopping
with you every day?

563
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,860
Then you tell me
the size of your shoes.

564
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,940
I’ll buy them for you.

565
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,290
I shouldn’t bother you anymore, Auntie.

566
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,630
I can buy them myself.

567
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,750
Just tell her to fulfill her wish.

568
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,860
What’s her size?

569
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,230
36.

570
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,660
Okay, I’ll keep that in mind.

571
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,460
My dear,

572
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,060
don’t you think they are beautiful?

573
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,110
How did you know my size?

574
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,470
I know

575
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,900
all about you.

576
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,710
It’s time to go, Mom.

577
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,010
I’ll send Ai Qing home.

578
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,470
Wait.

579
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,230
Qing should stay one night with me.

580
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,590
You, too.

581
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,010
Qing will sleep with me.

582
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,100
Mom, what about me?

583
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,140
You sleep with your dad.

584
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,870
Is it okay, Qing?

585
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,990
I just want to chat with you.

586
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,830
I’m fine, Auntie.

587
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,420
Please, Auntie.

588
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,900
Bai,

589
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,740
come here.

590
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,540
What’s up?

591
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,420
What should I do? I’m nervous.

592
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,300
What do you think
your mom will ask me?

593
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,790
I don’t know.

594
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,180
You’re her son.

595
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,300
You should know something.

596
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,140
I didn’t have
any girlfriends before you.

597
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,180
I don’t know what she

598
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,870
will talk about with my girlfriend.

599
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,380
I have no idea, really.

600
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,780
What should I do?

601
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,510
I have an idea.

602
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,870
What is it?

603
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,870
Keep quiet.

604
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,950
When I was a kid,

605
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,580
if I didn’t know how
to answer the question,

606
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,110
I just stayed quiet.

607
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,300
They get used to it.

608
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,510
Keep quiet?

609
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,630
Isn’t it impolite

610
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,060
if I just keep quiet

611
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,540
when she speaks to me.

612
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,750
No worries. They’ve gotten used to it.

613
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,870
So I...

614
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,270
Auntie.

615
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,780
Bai,

616
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,830
why are you here?

617
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,760
You should go to bed now.

618
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,590
I... I will go to bed soon.

619
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,990
No worries.

620
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,950
I know you like her

621
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,380
since you were a kid.

622
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,510
I’ll take care of her.

623
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,550
Don’t worry.

624
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,350
I won’t tell her your little secrets.

625
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,350
Go find your dad

626
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,420
and have a chat with him.

627
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,070
-Go.
-Okay.

628
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,420
Quick.

629
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,540
-Go.
-Goodbye.

630
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,180
Do talk with him.

631
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,140
Let’s go to bed.

632
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,600
Yes.

633
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,750
Let’s go.

634
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,640
I’ve especially brought

635
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,350
his childhood photos.

636
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,870
Do you like to see them?

637
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
Yes.

638
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,550
Wait.

639
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,350
Come here.

640
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,630
Look.

641
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,870
Look at it.

642
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,710
It is when he was a kid?

643
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,260
Wow, cute!

644
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,670
He was fat back then, wasn’t he?

645
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,660
Was he cute?

646
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,590
He was five years old then.

647
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,420
His dad and I

648
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,060
had taken him to a park.

649
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,120
He was very happy then.

650
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,950
And this one.

651
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,640
This is when he was seven years old.

652
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,260
We took him for

653
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,640
an outing

654
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,540
and bought him a white hat.

655
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,120
He liked it

656
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,710
and couldn’t wait to put it on.

657
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,430
He was narcissistic.

658
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,470
What are you thinking?

659
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,520
Nothing.

660
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,950
Are you worried your mom
may embarrass your wife?

661
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,120
I’m afraid she might be nervous.

662
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,540
Bai,

663
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,510
your mom asked me
to give you a lesson,

664
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,120
a premarital lesson.

665
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,360
I think

666
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,470
marriage is

667
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,390
a holy ceremony.

668
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,910
So, you should...

669
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,190
Hm...

670
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,390
Wu Bai,

671
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,870
you’ve grown up

672
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,480
and you’re clever.

673
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,910
I think you should know.

674
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,430
So,

675
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,960
no more of it.

676
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,910
We’d better

677
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,910
have a nice sleep.

678
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,000
Fine.

679
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,270
(Wu Bai)
Living room.

680
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,720
Your mom is asleep.

681
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,880
You must be tired,

682
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,480
shopping with her

683
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,650
and chatting.

684
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,150
Can you adapt to it?

685
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,790
I’m fine.

686
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,790
Haven’t you been

687
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,310
following us for the day?

688
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,840
Yes.

689
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,000
Your mom gave me

690
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,530
a necklace this morning.

691
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,240
She said

692
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,880
she had put it in ready ten years ago.

693
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,960
She said giving me
was the same as giving it to you.

694
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,960
No wonder.

695
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,130
No wonder what?

696
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,120
Since they knew I liked you,

697
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,640
I haven’t received any birthday gifts.

698
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,640
Actually, they and my grandpa

699
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,310
all prefer girls to boys,

700
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,190
but they only had boys.

701
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,530
So they adore you very much.

702
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,640
By the way,

703
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,130
what did my mom tell you?

704
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,010
She has talked

705
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,130
a lot about

706
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,000
her and your dad.

707
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,480
I can tell that

708
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,970
she loves your dad very much.

709
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,310
They get along well.

710
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,200
It reminds me of my dad

711
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,080
after talking so much with her.

712
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,680
My dad and mom
get along well, too.

713
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,560
But

714
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,790
my mom passed away early.

715
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,850
After she died,

716
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,390
he’s paid all his attention

717
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,200
to me and my sister.

718
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,770
It’s obvious.

719
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,190
So,

720
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,200
he’ll be lonelier

721
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,040
after both of us are married.

722
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,270
We are his

723
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,790
companies.

724
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,600
For now it’s sure,

725
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,790
but what about the future?

726
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,320
The same.

727
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,280
We’ll be his companies like always.

728
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,160
We’ll live in Shanghai

729
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,680
and support him.

730
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,400
Bai,

731
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,040
thanks.

732
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,400
Earphone?

733
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,560
I didn’t see him
ever wear an earphone.

734
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,200
Zhou Yi,

735
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,890
what should I give Wu Bai

736
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,970
at his wedding the day after tomorrow?

737
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,760
We’re more than friends.

738
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,730
Your wishes to him

739
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,250
will be the best gift.

740
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,800
It sounds right.

741
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,570
Wu Bai doesn’t need anything.

742
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,640
What kind of gift can represent

743
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,200
our great friendship?

744
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,770
That’s a good question.

745
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,920
But I’ve already picked one.

746
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,050
Have an apple.

747
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:22,880
Thanks.

748
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,330
Can you tell me what you will bring?

749
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,770
It’s a gift

750
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,360
made by myself,

751
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,720
showing my regards.

752
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,290
What is it anyway?

753
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,920
I won’t tell anyone.

754
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,320
You won’t tell me?

755
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,600
Sir, what will you take with you?

756
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,530
I won’t tell you.

757
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,090
What’s yours, Zhou Yi?

758
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,680
You’ll know.

759
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,450
Where is your gift?

760
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,680
Why should I tell you?

761
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,360
-Morning, Captain.
-Captain.

762
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,680
Morning.

763
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,840
What’s up?

764
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,120
Who will be the first?

765
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,490
Me.

766
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,730
My gift has the most
significant meaning.

767
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,970
I’ll be the last.

768
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,490
The last one? Okay, you’ll be the last.

769
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,690
What gift?

770
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,340
Wedding gift.

771
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,600
Let me be the first.

772
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,160
Wu Bai,

773
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,970
I’m not eloquent.

774
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,400
I wish you happiness with Appledog.

775
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,060
Like the inseparable birds
and may you have a baby soon.

776
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,090
Have many children and grandchildren.

777
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,120
Coach,

778
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,570
I never saw you as rigid as this.

779
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,210
What did you know?

780
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,600
Though it might be old-style,

781
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,640
the meaning is good.

782
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,820
Thank you.

783
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,600
Okay, next one.

784
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,810
It’s my turn.

785
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,410
What’s this?

786
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,170
It’s handmade by myself.

787
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,880
Captain, please press this.

788
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,730
Press this.

789
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:17,790
(Happy Wedding)

790
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,540
(Forever Love)

791
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,440
That’s good.

792
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,010
That’s a good idea.

793
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,640
I know you don’t need anything.

794
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,690
It’s just a token of my wishes.

795
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,020
That’s why I made it.

796
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,540
I wish you a happy wedding
and forever love.

797
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,090
It’s thoughtful of you.

798
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,160
Shen Zhe, it’s your turn.

799
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,580
Didn’t you say you’ll be the last one?

800
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,400
Yes.

801
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,050
You should be the one
before the last one.

802
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,490
-Yes.
-Yes, you’re right.

803
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,810
Don’t you know it?

804
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,610
Of course I do.

805
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,010
I’m afraid you don’t know it.

806
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,050
What a joke!

807
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,090
Here you are.

808
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,920
What is it?

809
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,540
A hammer.

810
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,770
Isn’t it the one you
used for daily maintenance?

811
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,680
You give him a hammer?

812
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,690
You can save it.

813
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,400
You’ve been shallow.

814
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,160
This has meaning.

815
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,570
I’ve kept this hammer with me

816
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,210
for three years ago
since our team was still called DT.

817
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,120
It’s witnessed

818
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,300
many successes made

819
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,770
by me and Wu Bai.

820
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,490
It’s the lucky hammer.

821
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,400
Now I’ll give it to Wu Bai

822
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,490
and wish his marriage life

823
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,570
be happy and smooth.

824
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,880
Hammer away at it!

825
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,290
Captain, it’s yours.

826
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,890
Hammer away at it!

827
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,400
That’s meaningful.

828
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,810
Sure.

829
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,820
Now, somebody can
stop laughing at me

830
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,770
and take out his amazing gift.

831
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,580
I’ve thought of many things,

832
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,050
but nothing will be more
meaningful than this.

833
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,060
(Reserve Fund)

834
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,260
Reserve fund?

835
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,930
-What is it?
-Reserve fund.

836
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,060
What do you mean?

837
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,450
You’re not serious about it, are you?

838
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,920
Why not give him
three massage coupons?

839
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,050
At least he can do
some massage with them.

840
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,890
You don’t know.

841
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,060
It’s a secret between Wu Bai and me.

842
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,820
When he asked me to join the team,

843
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,820
he promised that he would give
half of his wage to me,

844
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,810
which I have never used.

845
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,650
I let Su Cheng set up an account.

846
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,770
Now you’re married

847
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,500
and the money put into
this account increased.

848
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
It’s yours now.

849
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,650
What are you talking about?
I’m confused.

850
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,650
You can explain it to them, coach.

851
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,020
Wu Bai didn’t know about

852
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,640
the reserve fund account.

853
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,690
He thought he was depositing money

854
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,730
into Shen Zhe’s account every month,

855
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,780
but actually...

856
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,650
Anyway it’s Shen Zhe’s money.

857
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,370
He has the right
to decide the use of it.

858
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,260
It was yours

859
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,970
and I return it to you.

860
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,890
Half of the sum

861
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,890
will be used for team building

862
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,740
and the rest will be
bonuses for the future.

863
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,330
Are you serious?

864
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,850
Happiness suddenly comes.

865
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,580
I can’t breathe.

866
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,840
Enough of you.

867
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,600
It hasn’t fallen into your hands.

868
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,300
And you’re like you can’t breathe.

869
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,740
I don’t care for others.

870
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,120
Forget about the bonus,

871
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,090
but I must have a share
of the team building.

872
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,200
Why not use this opportunity

873
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,650
to hold a bachelor party for him?

874
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,100
Good.

875
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,890
I noticed there was always
a bachelor party

876
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,130
in TV dramas before
the hero got married.

877
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,780
We should have one, too.

878
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,010
Swimming pool.

879
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,540
A big house.

880
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,580
Beauties.

881
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,780
And champagne.

882
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,300
We should have one, too.

883
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,260
Bachelor party?

884
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,980
Swimming pool and beauties?

885
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,850
I’ll take you to some place.
Follow me.

886
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,850
You’ve arranged it?

887
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,850
Let’s go.

888
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,890
Today’s a good day. And tonight...

889
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,370
What about us?

890
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,780
You help pack the captain’s gifts.

891
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,130
We’re leaving.

892
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,410
This is a really good idea.

893
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,300
I also want to go.

894
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,780
Me, too.

895
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,570
(Happiness)

896
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,190
(Happiness)

897
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,280
(Happiness)

898
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,850
All right.

899
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,260
Well.

900
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,980
When will the dresser arrive?

901
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,510
At 6 a.m. tomorrow.

902
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,940
Okay.

903
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,980
Good.

904
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,140
This...

905
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,850
(Happiness)
Set it right.

906
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:56,740
Okay. It’s all right.

907
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,180
Go to bed early tonight.

908
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,620
Don’t drink water,

909
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,740
or you’ll get a puffy face.

910
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,030
Do you hear it, Qing?

911
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,930
I know.

912
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,790
Okay.

913
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,580
I’ll go now.

914
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,820
Dad,

915
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,210
won’t you stay here tonight?

916
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,450
No, I have gotten everything in place.

917
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,580
Don’t mess it up.

918
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,830
Now we can wait for tomorrow.

919
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,820
By the way,

920
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,660
the jujubes and longans

921
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,450
I put in front of the sofa

922
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,210
are with good meanings.

923
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,690
You must not touch them.

924
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,210
You must not.

925
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,210
-I know.
-Do you hear me?

926
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,100
I understand.

927
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,370
All right.

928
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,980
Well.

929
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,850
I’ll go now.

930
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,890
Okay.

931
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,780
I just said you must not eat them.

932
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,210
What the hell is in your head?

933
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,610
What’s wrong with you?

934
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,740
I won’t touch them.

935
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,170
That’s it. All right.

936
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,820
I’ll go now.

937
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:42,780
Dad,

938
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,370
can you change your suit tomorrow?

939
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,300
Well. Don’t worry about that.

940
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,850
Be careful on your way home.

941
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,030
Have a safe trip.

942
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,270
Hello.

943
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,790
Hi, my dear.

944
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,370
Wu Bai lied to us.

945
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,860
There is no bachelor party or anything.

946
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,990
I and 97 are in his room

947
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,340
watching him ironing clothes.

948
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,890
I’m bored to death.

949
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,210
I’m not bored.

950
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,700
Isn’t it good?

951
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,220
Save and conserve your energy.

952
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:13,930
I tell you,

953
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,420
he needs you and 97 to drink wine
for him tomorrow.

954
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,820
I know, but...

955
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,750
No more of it.

956
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,340
I need to talk with my sister.

957
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,270
Jing, I...

958
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,220
Damn it. My Jing won’t talk with me.

959
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,780
Be quiet.

960
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,340
I’m playing the game.
