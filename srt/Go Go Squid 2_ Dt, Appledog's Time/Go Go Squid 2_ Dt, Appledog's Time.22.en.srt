Dad, time to go to bed.

21
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:45,990
OK.

22
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,670
Go to bed, go to bed.

23
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,910
Go on drinking.

24
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,150
-Take care.
-Older brother!

25
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,550
-Drink, drink, drink. Go, go, go.
-Older brother!

26
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,390
You drank so much wine.

27
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,910
Here, have some water.

28
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,710
I’m not gonna drink water.

29
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,750
I’m gonna drink wine with
my older brother.

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,070
Your older brother has gone to bed
in the room.

31
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,230
Here, here, here. Drink water.

32
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,950
Ai Qing.

33
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,390
I’m serious.

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,190
I know.

35
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,150
I know you are serious.

36
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,830
Are you sleepy?

37
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,510
Shall I take you back home to sleep?

38
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,550
OK.

39
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,750
OK, get up.

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,910
Can you do it?

41
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,430
No problem.

42
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,670
Take care, take care, take care.

43
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,590
Take care.

44
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,470
That’s not your home.

45
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,670
Wrong direction.

46
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,190
Go. Go home.

47
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,710
Older brother, I’ll come to see you
next time.

48
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,710
OK, OK, OK.

49
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,550
Come to see your older brother
next time.

50
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,430
Let’s go.

51
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,710
I seem to hear the front door clicking.

52
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,070
What’s strange about that?

53
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,310
Captain is back.

54
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,390
Yes.

55
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,470
-I’m not drunk.
-Take care.

56
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,790
Aren’t we just at K&K?

57
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,510
I can walk back with my eyes closed.

58
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,430
You are going the wrong way, Wu Bai.

59
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,710
It’s this way.

60
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,070
Take care. Be careful.

61
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,990
Are you OK?

62
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,990
Yes.

63
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,430
Didn’t you say you could walk straight?

64
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,430
Be careful.

65
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,230
Be careful.

66
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,470
My older brother…

67
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,310
Shh…

68
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,190
Be careful.

69
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,150
I’m not drunk.

70
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,470
Yes, yes, yes. You are not drunk.

71
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,150
We are almost there.

72
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,790
-I said I can walk there with my eyes closed.
-OK, OK, OK.

73
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,470
Keep it down.

74
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,030
Take care, take care, take care.

75
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,990
It’s hot.

76
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,070
Be good, tuck yourself in,

77
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,590
or you’ll catch a cold at night.

78
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,550
Thank you

79
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,550
for drinking so much
with my father today.

80
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,470
Have a good sleep.

81
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,030
I’m going.

82
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,590
Bye.

83
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,270
My head aches.

84
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,830
Are you having a headache?

85
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,230
Well,

86
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,790
don’t drink so much if you can’t.

87
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,350
I’m happy drinking with
my older brother.

88
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,030
What older brother? He’s my father.

89
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,910
He’s my father.

90
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,150
My father is also to blame.

91
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,230
I told him you are having an allergy.

92
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,790
He still made you drink so much.

93
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,670
What a nuisance!

94
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,670
Do you feel better this way?

95
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,510
Don’t drink so much next time.

96
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,390
Do you hear me?

97
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,350
Good boy.

98
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,470
Wait for me here.

99
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,550
I’ll go and make you a glass of
honey water.

100
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,230
Lie still.

101
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,950
Stay with me a little longer.

102
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,630
I’m not going. I’ll stay with you.

103
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,630
I’ll just make you a glass
of honey water

104
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,230
which can make you feel better.

105
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,670
I’ll be away for just five minutes.

106
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,830
Five minutes?

107
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,030
Just five minutes.

108
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,270
Not a minute more.

109
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,030
Good boy.

110
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,350
Wait for me.

111
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,470
Something is not right.

112
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,870
I seem to have heard a sound
in the kitchen.

113
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,630
That’s because captain is hungry

114
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,390
and cooking something in the kitchen.

115
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,430
He doesn’t share midnight snack with us.

116
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,190
This won’t do.

117
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,350
I must go to see him.

118
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,910
Shen Zhe!

119
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,230
Shen Zhe, let’s go.

120
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,670
Go to captain for some midnight snack.

121
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,110
Can we do that?

122
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,470
Eating, eating, eating.

123
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,110
It’s the only thing you do all day long.

124
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,670
Then don’t go in a while.

125
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,070
Everybody who sees it has a share.

126
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,070
See,

127
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,630
you are just mouthing it.

128
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,070
Let’s go.

129
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,830
I’m not going.

130
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,230
I’m dealing with a bug here.

131
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,750
All right.

132
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,110
-Bug, what bug?
-Shut it down.

133
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,350
-Hurry up.
-Go, go, go.

134
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,070
Bai,

135
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,510
get up to have a sip of water.

136
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,470
Here.

137
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,910
Take care.

138
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,230
Another sip.

139
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,510
A gulp.

140
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,110
A gulp, a gulp.

141
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,190
Do you feel better?

142
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,030
Here.

143
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,990
Here, lie down.

144
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,350
Here, lie down.

145
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,270
Lie still.

146
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,910
Be good.

147
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,070
Have a good sleep

148
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,870
and I’m sure your headache will go away
tomorrow morning.

149
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,110
Have a good sleep.

150
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,230
Sleep tight.

151
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,910
Captain,

152
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,030
it’s not our K&K’s tradition

153
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,310
to keep food to yourself.

154
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,990
Yes.

155
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,430
As Shen Zhe said just now, everybody who
sees it has a share.

156
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,150
What shall we do?

157
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,310
Where shall I hide?

158
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,390
I’ll send them away.

159
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,350
Where are you going?

160
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,550
Take care.

161
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,910
You… You can barely stand firm.

162
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,430
How can you go?

163
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,350
No problem.

164
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,910
Take care.

165
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,950
Why is there a smell of wine instead of
food?

166
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,150
I see.

167
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,470
You are eating liquor-marinated shrimp.

168
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,110
I’m gonna have some, too.

169
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,870
Come on, there’s no liquor-marinated
shrimp or crab.

170
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,110
Can’t you see?

171
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,350
He’s had a drink.

172
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,830
-A drink?
-A drink?

173
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,710
Captain, are you OK?

174
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,990
Why did you suddenly have a drink?

175
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,030
Her father asked me to.

176
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,230
Her father?

177
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,270
-Whose father?
-Whose father?

178
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,150
My girlfriend’s.

179
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,710
Your girlfriend?

180
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,790
Captain,

181
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,110
you are so ungrateful.

182
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,550
You are dating a girl secretly

183
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,990
without telling us.

184
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,110
Yes, captain,

185
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,350
you kept the secret so well.

186
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,470
Captain,

187
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,790
who is your girlfriend?

188
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,670
Just tell me

189
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,830
if we know her.

190
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,790
Yes.

191
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,950
I bet you do.

192
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,030
And you know her well.

193
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,190
I see.

194
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,310
She must be Miss Huang,

195
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,310
the receptionist of Alliances, right?

196
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,430
She ogled at you before.

197
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,670
I saw it all.

198
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,910
Then she must be Mr. Xiang’s secretary
Miss Zhu.

199
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,150
Otherwise why does she buy you breakfast
every day?

200
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,910
RAP’s coach Miss Zhou, right?

201
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,950
She’s given you gifts
three times, right?

202
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,710
No.

203
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,030
Who is she then?

204
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,310
Wu Bai, you are quite something.

205
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,110
You’ve seen her family so soon.

206
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,950
How was it going?

207
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,550
Was your father-in-law happy with you?

208
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,670
What father-in-law?

209
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,150
He’s my older brother!

210
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,470
Was our older brother happy with you?

211
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,550
Of course.

212
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,070
Is he really drunk or just pretending?

213
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,990
He remembers the good words well.

214
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,710
Then you must treat your bros to
a hearty meal.

215
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,750
-Of course.
-Of course.

216
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,550
The hangover is coming up.

217
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,150
My head… My head aches.

218
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,750
Pretend, pretend.

219
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,230
Well,

220
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,470
his head aches every time we ask him to
give us a treat.

221
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,510
-It’s such a powerful hangover.
-Yes.

222
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,790
Your head aches, right?

223
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,550
Come on.

224
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,790
Let me go in to give you a massage.

225
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,150
I seem to feel much better, much better,
much better.

226
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,830
-There must be something wrong.
-There must be something wrong.

227
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,870
Administrator rights enabled.

228
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,110
What did Wu Liao say?

229
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,190
Isn’t captain outside?

230
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,830
My girlfriend is inside.

231
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,590
Your girlfriend is inside?

232
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,790
Wu Bai.

233
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,430
Captain,

234
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,070
take us to see your girlfriend.

235
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,950
-Yes.
-Yes.

236
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,150
Let us see her.

237
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,990
You wanna see her?

238
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,110
Yes.

239
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:02,950
I…

240
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,270
I come to think of it,

241
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,670
my girlfriend says this has to be
kept secret.

242
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,830
I have to do what she says.

243
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,310
Just forget about

244
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,950
what you’ve seen today, OK?

245
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,430
OK, OK, OK.

246
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,470
OK. Let’s

247
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,750
not bring it up later.

248
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,150
All right?

249
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,830
OK, OK, OK.

250
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,910
Go to bed, go to bed, go to bed.

251
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,710
OK.

252
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,630
Watch… Watch… Watch out for your safety.

253
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,990
Go to bed, go to bed, go to bed.

254
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,670
Bai.

255
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,710
What do you mean?

256
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,630
You didn’t ask me to come when you swore
to be brothers with your father-in-law.

257
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,670
Next time, we’ll do it together
next time.

258
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,790
Next time.

259
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,990
The three of us will swear
to be brothers.

260
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,190
Go to bed, go to bed.

261
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,270
Wish you a good night.

262
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,270
Guys, don’t get up until seven…

263
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,710
No, until eight tomorrow.

264
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,670
Go.

265
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,670
Rest easy.

266
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,510
Here at K&K,

267
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,310
I am the boss.

268
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,390
Bai.

269
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,270
Well,

270
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,310
who is the receptionist Miss Huang?

271
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,390
Why does she ogle at you often?

272
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,230
And Miss Zhu,

273
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,150
are the breakfasts she brings you
delicious?

274
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,910
What kind of breakfast does
she bring you?

275
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,870
My head aches. The hangover is coming up
again.

276
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,750
Wu Bai,

277
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,750
I do suspect whether you are
really drunk

278
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,270
or pretending to be drunk.

279
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,830
Be quick to tell me who Miss Zhu is.

280
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,030
♪My love♪

281
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,790
♪Sweet love♪

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,710

♪It’s you It’s you♪

289
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,430
Zhou Yi was talking nonsense.

290
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,230
♪It’s you♪

291
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,230
You are the only one in my eyes.

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,350
♪Rain and rain♪

293
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,030

♪It’s you♪

295
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,830
It’s getting late.

296
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,790
I’ve got to go.

297
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,870
Let me see you home.

298
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,030
Let’s go.

299
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,310
Come out quickly. There’s nobody now.

300
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,510
Let’s go.

301
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,390
Go.

302
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,990
Wait a minute.

303
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,910
Is anybody peeping at us?

304
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,110
No way.

305
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,270
Turn around to have a look.

306
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,390
You see, as I said, there’s nobody.

307
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,990
Let’s go.

308
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,070
Rest easy.

309
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,190
As I said, at K&K,

310
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,790
nobody dares to disobey me.

311
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,310
I thought

312
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,670
captain was sexually abstinent.

313
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,830
Yes.

314
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,990
Did you see clearly?

315
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,830
Was that a woman?

316
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,310
Cut the crap.

317
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,670
Of course that was a woman.

318
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,830
Is there any inside information?

319
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,030
Where’s the girl’s hometown?
Is she pretty?

320
00:15:59,230 --> 00:15:59,670
Yes.

321
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,950
Does she know anything about robots?

322
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,030
What does she talk about with captain
if she doesn’t?

323
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,270
Yes, she knows quite a lot.

324
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,030
She’s perfectly good enough for Wu Bai.

325
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,790
Does she know as much as coach Ai Qing?

326
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,670
Well…

327
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,310
It’s getting late. Time to go to bed.

328
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,590
We’ve got training tomorrow morning.
Go to bed, go to bed.

329
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,950
Go to bed, go to bed.

330
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,030
Who on earth is she?

331
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,870
Zhou Yi, go to bed.

332
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,430
Tell me about it.

333
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,390
Where are you going after retirement?

334
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,230
I may go and help my mom run the shop.

335
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,350
Don’t you think I’ll make big money

336
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,510
if I open a milk tea shop in Shanghai?

337
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,750
No.

338
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,630
Won’t that be unworthy of your talent?

339
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,470
Have a look at this.

340
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,790
Why?

341
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,350
This is the recruitment info of several
top clubs.

342
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,430
Take your time to pick one.

343
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,990
No, thanks.

344
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,070
I’ve finally made up my mind to retire,

345
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,790
and you are pulling me back again.

346
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,830
Xiaomi,

347
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,990
I really don’t want our bros to disband
like this.

348
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,510
Do you still remember the old house of
Solo Team?

349
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,150
I’ve bought it.

350
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,150
In the hope that one day we bros will…

351
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,030
Leader,

352
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,590
didn’t we agree to let me have a free
and easy time?

353
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,230
Why are you doing this?

354
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,190
I respect you.

355
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,670
OK.

356
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,110
I just want to tell you

357
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,950
Solo Team is always there.

358
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,710
As long as you want to come back,

359
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,310
there will always be a home
waiting for you.

360
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,630
Come in.

361
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,070
Sorry.

362
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,870
Am I disturbing you?

363
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,590
No.

364
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,870
I’ll let you guys talk.

365
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,390
I’m going back to pack my things up.

366
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,870
Let’s have dinner when you have time.

367
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,590
Take a seat.

368
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,270
Retiring now

369
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,670
may be the best choice for Xiaomi.

370
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,510
Maybe.

371
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,830
Let’s drop this.

372
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,790
What is it that you come
to see me about?

373
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,470
Thank you for letting me take Xiao’ai
with me.

374
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,790
You are probably right.

375
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,870
It would be better for Xiao’ai

376
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,270
if she stays with you.

377
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,710
I’ve contacted the school

378
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,630
and hospital there.

379
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,550
She can be hospitalized for treatment
as soon as we get there.

380
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,310
Remember to call me

381
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,590
if there’s anything I can help.

382
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,310
My cellphone is on 24 hours.

383
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,750
You’ve already done enough.

384
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,990
Don’t worry.

385
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,470
I’ll surely take good care of Xiao’ai.

386
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,550
I’m off.

387
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,510
Su Cheng.

388
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,470
Take good care of my daughter.

389
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,510
Don’t worry.

390
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,670
Solo,

391
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,470
you’d better take good care of yourself
as well.

392
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,350
You always think about others

393
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,470
like the head of a big family.

394
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,990
What about yourself?

395
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,630
Have you thought about yourself?

396
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,510
This is also the reason

397
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,350
why we split up back then.

398
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,710
Because I always felt you cared

399
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,110
nothing but your team and your dream.

400
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,350
I didn’t have a place in your heart.

401
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,390
I’m inclined to worry,

402
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,590
and I’m used to it.

403
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,350
Bros, team, daughter,

404
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,110
sense of responsibility and honor.

405
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,590
Solo,

406
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,030
you should live for yourself once.

407
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,510
After all,

408
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,310
we are no longer young.

409
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,830
Thanks.

410
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,110
Think more about yourself.

411
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,230
I’m off.

412
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,510
Don’t see me out.

413
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,950
Did you promise her?

414
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,150
Do you have the heart to

415
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,630
let her take your child away?

416
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,350
I’ve thought it through.

417
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,910
It’s better for Xiao’ai

418
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,990
to stay with her mom.

419
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,270
Just think about it,

420
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,190
I’m so busy with my work every day that

421
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,710
I don’t have time to look after her.

422
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,350
When they go abroad,

423
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,590
they’ll have better education and
medical resources.

424
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,750
And Su Cheng specially quit her job

425
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,270
to focus on taking care of Xiao’ai.

426
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,950
As my daughter grows up,

427
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,230
it’s better for her to stay
with her mom.

428
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,750
Think it over again.

429
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,350
Xiao’ai is your lifeblood.

430
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,710
I’ve thought it through.

431
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,150
All right, time for the meeting.

432
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,110
Go.

433
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,990
Su Cheng?

434
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,110
Are you still working on weekends?

435
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,390
We are in a period of personnel change.

436
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,750
I’m here to work extra hours.

437
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,990
It’s laborious work.

438
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,350
I’m going upstairs first.

439
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,590
Ai Qing.

440
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,990
I’m going abroad with Xiao’ai.

441
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,470
How about K&K?

442
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,990
I’ve quit, in the middle of handover.

443
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,630
Once I leave this time,

444
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,870
I’m not coming back

445
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,590
except for special circumstances.

446
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,870
I made you and Solo split up

447
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,750
because of me and Xiao’ai.

448
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,750
Over the years,

449
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,110
I’ve always wanted to make a formal
apology to you.

450
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,750
Sorry.

451
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,230
That happened long in the past.

452
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,110
You don’t have to take it to heart.

453
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,110
Thanks.

454
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,950
Take care of yourself.

455
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,990
I’m going for now.

456
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,270
Take care of yourself, too.

457
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,590
What is

458
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,110
your plan next?

459
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,510
I’m going back to run my great shop.

460
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,510
You brat!

461
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,870
You are going

462
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,990
and you didn’t tell your bro, did you?

463
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,470
I’m back here to tell you.

464
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,950
Xiaomi, where are you going?

465
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,990
Yes, Xiaomi.

466
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,950
Cut it out.

467
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,110
Let’s drop this.

468
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,030
Would you like

469
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,830
another round before you go?

470
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,910
I’m unconvinced of the result last time.

471
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,670
Are you in?

472
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,590
-Come on.
-Come on.

473
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,990
Who’s afraid of who? Come on.

474
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,070
-Go.
-Come on, come on, come on.

475
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,230
OK, I’ll be the referee.

476
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,270
-Come on.
-Come on.

477
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,270
Are you ready?

478
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,510
Yes.

479
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,470
Ready.

480
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,350
Three…

481
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,350
-Go!
-Two…

482
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,790
Coach, they jumped the gun.

483
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,470
You guys are losing!

484
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,630
Losers will wash team uniforms
for a month.

485
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,990
Xiaomi,

486
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,470
are you really leaving?

487
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,430
You are still crying as a grown-up.

488
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,950
Aren’t you doing the same?

489
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,590
You even say that about me.

490
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,350
All right.

491
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,230
It’s not that we’ll never meet.

492
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,110
Go back.

493
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,750
I’m going.

494
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,430
Coach,

495
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,590
we are going back for now.

496
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,670
Go back.

497
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,950
Do you remember the time when Solo
disbanded?

498
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,190
I thought we’d

499
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,750
never be together again.

500
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,230
Later,

501
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,070
Solo invited me to join SP.

502
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,990
I was quite happy

503
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,790
and thought there’d be another chance

504
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,710
to fight side by side with my bros.

505
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,430
And then,

506
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,310
you and Xiaomi came,

507
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,750
and I was even happier.

508
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,230
I thought

509
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,270
we’d never part ways

510
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,270
no matter what happens later.

511
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,030
Wasn’t I silly?

512
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,510
When Baona transferred Xiaomi to
Team No.2,

513
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,550
I thought I must do something

514
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,670
and as long as I try hard,

515
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,110
I’d certainly be able to keep him.

516
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,350
But in the end,

517
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,270
I managed to keep nothing.

518
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,310
Actually that’s also what I thought
before.

519
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,710
But I thought it over in the
past few days.

520
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,870
Given Xiaomi’s personality,

521
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,070
he’d rather choose to take a perfect
curtain call

522
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,550
than leave us

523
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,030
the slightest bit of trouble.

524
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,310
So his current state

525
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,030
may be

526
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,830
the best choice for him.

527
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,350
Actually the one

528
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,590
who can’t accept his retirement is not
himself,

529
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,870
but us.

530
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,950
But I can see that

531
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,950
he hasn’t given it all up yet.

532
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,990
He’s still keen on this profession.

533
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,150
I’m sure

534
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,790
he’ll come back.

535
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,350
Which of the giant clubs

536
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,710
haven’t we tried?

537
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,990
Only the K&K Team.

538
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,830
Let’s go to K&K then.

539
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,710
So

540
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,390
you want me to take in

541
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,390
the entire Taotao Team by way of
a challenge?

542
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,350
We will prove

543
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,350
the strength of the League’s
King of Rookies team.

544
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,070
Let’s talk about it

545
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,190
after you beat Shen Zhe.

546
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,270
OK.

547
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,630
It’s a deal.

548
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,390
Tao Qitao,

549
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,030
from the Taotao Team.

550
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,590
Is he a very strong player?

551
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,630
The biggest dark horse this year.

552
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,110
After their defeat in the Shanghai game,

553
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,230
all their original sponsors

554
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,430
have withdrawn investments,

555
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,110
so they’ll announce their dissolution

556
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,070
at the end of this month.

557
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,350
We can talk with them first.

558
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,230
Have they raised any specific terms?

559
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,910
He asks to bring all his team members.

560
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,910
But the levels of those team members

561
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,670
are not up to SP’s standards.

562
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,230
In that case,

563
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,830
it’ll be a bit difficult indeed.

564
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,910
I can kind of make it out.

565
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,310
Let me keep watching.

566
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,470
OK.

567
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,710
We are inferior in skills.

568
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,110
Your team’s problem

569
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,270
is not about skills.

570
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,430
Anyway,

571
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,390
thank you all the same.

572
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,510
K&K is the first club

573
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,310
that’s willing to take up our challenge.

574
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,150
I can give you a chance.

575
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,590
Come for a three-week trial training.

576
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,070
Maybe you can find the answer you want.

577
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,790
Don’t rush to say no.

578
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,670
Think it over.

579
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,550
Taotao

580
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,190
is quite a strong team.

581
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,990
They almost tied with Shen Zhe just now.

582
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,790
If they’ve played in enough games,

583
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,830
they’d probably be good
enough for Top 5.

584
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,870
Despite outstanding individual strength,

585
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,710
with such big weaknesses as a team,

586
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,470
they won’t beat us.

587
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,150
I just had a close look at him.

588
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,870
I think

589
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,790
we must by no means take him lightly.

590
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,590
I think what you said makes sense.

591
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,550
Are these enough for dinner?

592
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,310
Yes, yes. I’m sure they are.

593
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,070
I did it anyway.

594
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,830
What are we gonna do next?

595
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,310
Let’s take a break.

596
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,190
What is it that you come to see me about

597
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,350
after such a long drive?

598
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,270
I got drunk last night.

599
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,470
Did I say anything wrong?

600
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,910
You didn’t say anything wrong.

601
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,350
Except that you kept calling my father
older brother.

602
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,390
Let’s talk about work.

603
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,590
OK,

604
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,430
Captain Wu Bai.

605
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,830
Tao Qitao has come to see me.

606
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,870
Actually

607
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,870
I saw him a couple of days ago.

608
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,950
But we didn’t reach an agreement.

609
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,550
I heard about it.

610
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,110
You turned down the terms he raised.

611
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,270
Is your K&K

612
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,790
in need of an operator?

613
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,310
He’s a player with good potential.

614
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,950
It’s a bit of a pity for him

615
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,590
to lose chances of competing in games.

616
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,350
Is your K&K

617
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,270
going to take in their team as a whole?

618
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,230
Not yet.

619
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,670
I’ll talk about it with the board.

620
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,710
But

621
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,350
I’ve invited him for a trial training
at K&K.

622
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,030
I was also thinking

623
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,710
how to swallow his whole team.

624
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,270
It’s a bit hard.

625
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,950
But I have a strong hunch that

626
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,910
Tao Qitao

627
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,150
will end up with

628
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,510
our SP Team.

629
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,030
What do you think,

630
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,590
Captain Wu Bai?

631
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,670
Would you like to make a bet with me?

632
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,550
OK.

633
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,390
It remains to be seen who will win.

634
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,070
Wu Bai,

635
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,070
the day of victory is yet to come.

636
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,790
I have a question for you.

637
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,550
What do you think of

638
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,030
K&K as a team?

639
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,750
It’s very strong as a whole.

640
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,270
As individuals?

641
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,390
There are weaknesses.

642
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,870
How are you gonna address them

643
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,390
if you are the captain?

644
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,670
Aren’t I here for a trial training for
operator?

645
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,990
Why do you test my management ability?

646
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,590
I’m not here to be a captain.

647
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,550
A soldier who does not want to
be a general

648
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,270
is not a good soldier.

649
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,710
I’m gonna take a call.

650
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,470
The brat who challenged us the other day

651
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,990
is here for trial training today.

652
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,070
He’s here for trial training?

653
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,070
But Shen Zhe and captain

654
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,550
are working very well together.

655
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,470
They are called K&K Gemini on the
community forum.

656
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,230
There’s no need to have another one.

657
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,670
Let me show you the analysis.

658
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,750
In the best case scenario,

659
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,590
we are doing it for the national finals.

660
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,870
We buy Tao Qitao first

661
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,430
to catch SP unprepared.

662
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,510
And

663
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,790
what about the worst case scenario?

664
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,670
In the worst case scenario,

665
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,190
what does the arrival of a newcomer

666
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,150
who joins through connections mean?

667
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:39,990
What?

668
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,350
Change of power, replacement of the old.

669
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,630
But Shen Zhe is already strong enough,

670
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,670
we don’t need a newcomer who joins
through connections.

671
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,830
Being strong doesn’t mean he has no
weaknesses.

672
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,030
Tao Qitao was a captain before.

673
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,110
He must know teamwork better than
Shen Zhe

674
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,550
and have more experience.

675
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,950
What are you guys talking
about sneakily?

676
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,710
I’ve found a secret.

677
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,950
Do you want to hear it?

678
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,510
You’ve finally got to know

679
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,590
the team bought all your fans for you.

680
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,310
What?

681
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,630
Of course not.

682
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,990
What I want to say is about our team

683
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,110
and about you.

684
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,590
Fair enough,

685
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,750
if you are not interested,

686
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,990
just forget about it.

687
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,630
Don’t leave me in suspense.

688
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,670
Go ahead.

689
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,270
Tao Qitao of the Taotao Team is here.

690
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,830
Don’t know whether he’ll be

691
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,510
a vice operator for you or for captain.

692
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,150
It’s also likely that

693
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,510
he’ll take charge on his own.

694
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,070
Wu Bai,

695
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,630
what do you mean?

696
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,190
Why didn’t you talk to me about
taking in a new member?

697
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,670
The finals are coming soon.

698
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,510
I want K&K

699
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,470
to have a new tactical layout and
way of playing.

700
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,990
Is he gonna be the main operator or
vice operator?

701
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,390
Not decided yet.

702
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,310
OK. I’ll put my cards on
the table first.

703
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,790
He can be a vice operator for anybody
but me.

704
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,510
I can operator Trash Can alone.

705
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,470
I don’t need a vice operator.

706
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,030
But K&K needs one.

707
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,350
Wu Bai, if you have any problems
with me,

708
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,550
just tell me straight, OK?

709
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,150
Shen Zhe,

710
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,550
the finals are far from

711
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,070
being as easy as you imagine them to be.

712
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,990
We need to be as fully prepared
as we can.

713
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,750
I want K&K

714
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,190
to win this championship for China.

715
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,670
Isn’t it enough to have the two of us?

716
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,230
Far from enough.

717
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,910
Captain,

718
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,710
why don’t we have dinner first?

719
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,790
Yes. Well,

720
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,790
let’s have dinner first.

721
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,310
There are quite a few dishes today.

722
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,790
Tell everybody

723
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,310
to gather after dinner.

724
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,830
I’ve got an announcement to make.

725
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,710
I think you guys have already
known him,

726
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,190
Tao Qitao.

727
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,510
Starting from today,

728
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:04,030
he officially joins our team to start
trial training.

729
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,150
This is Shen Zhe,

730
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,310
whom I think you’ve known.

731
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,350
97, industrial designer.

732
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,950
Zhou Yi, software engineer.

733
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,670
As to the following upgrade
of Sea Breeze,

734
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,150
we can talk about it together.

735
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,030
Meanwhile, I’ll also arrange

736
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,230
your operation training with me and
Shen Zhe.

737
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,070
OK.

738
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,510
Little did I think

739
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,270
the No.1 rookie of the league

740
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,630
would so easily agree to be other’s
vice operator.

741
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,190
You deserve to be a former captain

742
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,030
who’s broad-minded indeed.

743
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,750
I’ll prove my worth

744
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,630
and prove that Taotao Team is worth it.

745
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,550
Tao Qitao has joined K&K.

746
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,990
I know.

747
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,550
You know?

748
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,910
Did Wu Bai tell you?

749
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,030
He knew you were going to poach Tao and
still beat you to it?

750
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,670
He didn’t know I was going to poach Tao.

751
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,110
We seldom talk about work.

752
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,870
What’s more,

753
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,830
he told me after he had made
the decision.

754
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,790
Don’t sigh.

755
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,630
I still think there will be a
favorable turn for this matter.

756
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,790
A favorable turn?

757
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,950
Is there any useful information?

758
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,230
Just think of it as

759
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,870
a woman’s sixth sense.

760
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,190
Sixth sense?

761
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,270
Shen Zhe, time for dinner.

762
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:49,750
I have no appetite.

763
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,630
I’m going for training.

764
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,590
Let’s eat then.

765
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,070
This dinner was meant to
welcome Tao Qitao,

766
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,030
but he went to deal with matters of his
old team.

767
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,270
Captain has also gone out to
run an errand.

768
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,430
Now even Shen Zhe skipped the dinner.

769
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,950
What do I cook all these dishes for?

770
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,470
Cook less food in the coming days.

771
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,590
I reckon Shen Zhe would
have no appetite

772
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,670
as long as Tao Qitao is here.

773
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,790
Why?

774
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,030
Isn’t the situation clear enough
at today’s meeting?

775
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,390
What situation?

776
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,750
I tell you what,

777
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,750
from my experience of reading the
secret manuals of tycoons

778
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,670
and watching palace and household
intrigue dramas

779
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,430
spanning ancient and modern times,

780
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,230
Tao Qitao

781
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,190
is someone to be reckoned with.

782
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,150
How did you see that?

783
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,270
Judging by his performance
at the meeting today,

784
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,230
he was undoubtedly like a new concubine

785
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,390
paying a call on the empress

786
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,550
who failed to enforce authority

787
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,030
but got dissed instead.

788
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,430
Empress and concubine?

789
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,190
Don’t you even know that?

790
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,630
Have you watched palace intrigue dramas?

791
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,510
No.

792
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,830
I’ll put it in a way
understandable to you,

793
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,790
OK?

794
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,470
For example, you feed on delicacies of
meat and fish every day.

795
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,750
Suddenly, you are given a dish of

796
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,670
tofu mixed with chopped shallots to
clear your palate,

797
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,350
how would you feel?

798
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,430
Refreshing.

799
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,910
Yes.

800
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,790
If Shen Zhe were that fish

801
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,110
and Tao Qitao were this tofu,

802
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,910
how do you think the fish would view
the tofu?

803
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,390
But why did Shen Zhe

804
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,190
have to eat Tao Qitao’s tofu?

805
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,670
You

806
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,590
are not enlightened.

807
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,510
I can’t get it across to you.

808
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,390
Go on eating your own tofu.

809
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,830
This is our K&K’s

810
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,310
self-developed simulator.

811
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,630
It may be somewhat different from
your team’s.

812
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,950
I’ve never used a simulator before.

813
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,270
Maybe each team

814
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,470
has different habits.

815
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,950
It’s OK.

816
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,710
It’s just like playing games,

817
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,670
very easy to handle.

818
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,510
You are in charge of directions

819
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,190
and Shen Zhe is in charge of attacks.

820
00:39:59,310 --> 00:39:59,670
In this way,

821
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,830
your automatic understanding is trained

822
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,470
without wearing and tearing
on the machine.

823
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,310
Give it a go.

824
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,950
Can we start, bro?

825
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,030
OK.

826
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,910
Ready.

827
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,270
Gone.

828
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,590
I was… Was gone just now.

829
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,830
Move ahead.

830
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,510
Go, now go!

831
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,390
Go! Now! Go!

832
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:56,870
Go!

833
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,350
What do you mean?

834
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,470
It’s too risky to rely on attacks alone.

835
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,910
So?

836
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,830
It’s not risky if you dodge, right?

837
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,270
Because I have stable defense skills.

838
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,950
Basically I won’t have big problems.

839
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,070
So you think I’m a bad operator?

840
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,830
Not bad,

841
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,070
but unstable.

842
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,710
You were too reckless.

843
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,710
Say it again.

844
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,750
All right, all right.

845
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,670
Take a break.

846
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,270
Get ready for the second round of
training.

847
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,470
What’s the point of training?

848
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,030
I wonder why you have such

849
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,910
strong complaints about him.

850
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,710
I don’t like his way of playing.

851
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,990
Have you watched him playing in a game?

852
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,470
Of course.

853
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,830
It was long and tedious.

854
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,990
He always relies on defense

855
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,430
to disrupt others’ attack.

856
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,950
He doesn't dare to be tough head-on.

857
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,870
It’s not a man’s way of playing at all!

858
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,230
Taotao Team’s strength

859
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,950
didn’t give him the confidence to be
tough indeed.

860
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,270
But even if he played overcautiously,

861
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,390
he still achieved good results

862
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,070
which made him the League’s
King of Rookies.

863
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,190
He’s a strong-willed player.

864
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,630
Do you think so highly of him?

865
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,230
Do you know in what areas

866
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,390
we’ve lost points in this season?

867
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,390
When we go along with other’s pace.

868
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,550
As you often say,

869
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,630
our pace is disrupted by the opponents.

870
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,030
Then let him take care of his own pace

871
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,430
and not get in my way.
