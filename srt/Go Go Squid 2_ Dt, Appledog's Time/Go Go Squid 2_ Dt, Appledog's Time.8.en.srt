What are you doing here?

I’ve been asked

21
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,420
to deliver some food.

22
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,660

-Yes.
-No.

Yeah. It’s nearby.

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,460
We need to run a physical test
to get more details.

and check it out?

68
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,380
Good idea! Let’s go!

69
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,180
Hello?

70
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,300
Now?

71
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,220
OK. Got it.

72
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,540
Who is it?

73
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,220
Wu Bai.

74
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,700
He needs us to run some errands.

75
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:12,860
Zhou Yi.

76
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,220

77

Alright, I’m gonna show you some magic.

79
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,620
Okay.

80
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,180
You guys don’t eat this?

81
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,340
Look.

82
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,980
Here’s a small ring.

83
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,460
I didn’t realize K&K was so good

84
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,220
not only at robot fighting,

85
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,260
but at everything else.

86
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,300
Zhou Yi takes after his mother
in cooking.

87
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,500
He can make
all kinds of delicious food.

88
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,060
97 hangs out with him every day.

89
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,540
I suppose he’s learned a lot.

90
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,580
Excuse me, sir. Can I eat this?

91
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,540
It’s not properly done yet.

92
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,660
It’d give you diarrhea if you ate it.

93
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,220
Go play for a while.

94
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,220
I’ll bring it over to you later.

95
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,060
Okay.

96
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,740
Here, have something sweet first.

97
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,420
Thank you!

98
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,700
Go ahead.

99
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,820
Focus! Don’t blink.

100
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,860
Three. Two. One.

101
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,580
Now the rope is through the ring.

102
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,700
-Amazing, right?
-So amazing!

103
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,980
I didn’t know that Shen Zhe

104
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,140
can be so good with kids.

105
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,460
Especially girls.

106
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,980
Look closely.

107
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,780
Awesome!

108
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,180
Well then, I have to warn my sister.

109
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,620
Anyway, thank you for today!

110
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,620
If you guys hadn’t

111
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,140
brought us all this delicious food,

112
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,220
I would’ve had no idea what to do.

113
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,660
It’s my pleasure.

114
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,140
No need to thank me.

115
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,940
No, no.

116
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,780
After all, we don’t know
each other that well.

117
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,340
It’s only proper

118
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,620
to thank you for your help.

119
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,220
You… You misunderstood me.

120
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,620
I was just worried that

121
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,180
the kids would think us
the wrong way.

122
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,420
-So, I…
-I was kidding!

123
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,220
Why do you take things so seriously?

124
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,460
Why are you smiling?

125
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,860
Nothing.

126
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,260
I just think that the way you talk

127
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,220
is always so dead serious.

128
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,180
Alright.

129
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,380
Don’t move.

130
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,980
Aren’t you going to clean up?

131
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,500
I don’t think so. The hot water

132
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,420
has been used up by the kids.

133
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,860
I’ll wait till tomorrow when I’m home.

134
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,940
You can go wash up in K&K.

135
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,460
In K&K?

136
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,780
We got quite a few shower rooms there.

137
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,420
And the water temperature
and pressure are quite stable.

138
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,300

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,860
It’s alright.

173
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,460
If I remember right,

174
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,860
that should be Nobody, right?

175
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,140
Yes.

176
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,740
Do you want a tour?

177
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,980
Sure.

178
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,020
Come on.

179
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,260
What do the marks mean?

180
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,060
Every time I go to a place
for competitions,

181
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,100
I leave a mark here.

182
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,620
This is the place where we first met.

183
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,460
I remember

184
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,500
it was pouring that day.

185
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,460
My remote control fell into the gutter.

186
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,020
You helped me fish it out.

187
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,700
And you won against me.

188
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,620
We met in Singapore for the second time.

189
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,700
We came across a couple of cats.

190
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,700
Do you still remember?

191
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,140
Of course.

192
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,940
I asked you whether
they were brothers, sisters,

193
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,420
or lovers.

194
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,700
We went to a shooting range
the next day.

195
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,340
I forgot to wear my gold medal
when we took the group picture.

196
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,580
You gave me yours.

197
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,460
It’s still in my place.

198
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,420
I know.

199
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,820
I saw it

200
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,420
when I went to you home that day.

201
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,940
I was drunk that night.

202
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,020
Did I say anything stupid to you?

203
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,300
Nope.

204
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,140
That’s a relief.

205
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,980
I was afraid that I might scare you.

206
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,420
You can’t scare me
no matter what you do.

207
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,460
Why?

208
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,100
Because…

209
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,860
I’m very brave.

210
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,820
Actually, now I think about it,

211
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,660
we really don’t know each other well.

212
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,060
I barely know anything about you.

213
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,700
What do you want to know?

214
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,300
Like…

215
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,620
Where do you come from?

216
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,660
Where were you born?
Where did you grow up?

217
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,740
Guangzhou.

218
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,300
I was born in Guangzhou.

219
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,060
I went to elementary
and middle school there.

220
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,740
Then I moved to Norway with my grandpa.

221
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,460
I also went to high school in Norway.

222
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,660
After Singapore,

223
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,980
where did you go

224
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,500
and what did you do?

225
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Norway.

226
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,660
I went back there.

227
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,860
To fulfill my grandpa’s wish,

228
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,060
I went to
California Institute of Technology,

229
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,860
in Los Angeles.

230
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,540
I finished all my studies in two years.

231
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,260
During that time,
K&K North America was established.

232
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,580
We flew around for competitions.

233
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,620
Seoul,

234
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,780
Tokyo,

235
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,420
Vancouver,

236
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,380
Barcelona…

237
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,980
I’ve traveled half of the globe.

238
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,060
Later, when K&K China was established,

239
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,260
I returned to Shanghai.

240
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,620
Why did you come back?

241
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,180
Someone important is here.

242
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,580
Family?

243
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,780
Someone I can’t forget about.

244
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,820
Someone I love.

245
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,660
Someone…

246
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,140
you love?

247
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,420
Someone I love.

248
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
Captain!

249
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,500
Why are you here?

250
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
No wonder I couldn’t find you!

251
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,940
Ai Qing, you are here, too!

252
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,420
Hello!

253
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,100
What are you guys doing here?

254
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,420
You know what?

255
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,700
I fully showed my cooking skills today!

256
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,220
I cooked a lot of tasty food!

257
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,260
Those kids were so happy!

258
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,180
Well,

259
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,300
actually, I can’t take all the credit.

260
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
97 also helped.

261
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,860
Speaking of this,

262
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,980
Shen Zhe was the real sly one!

263
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,700
He kept eating

264
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,260
and didn’t help at all.

265
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,340
He didn’t prepare food or drinks

266
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,620
for the kids.

267
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,660
He only did magic for a few girls.

268
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,620
What’s the big deal
about his magic tricks?

269
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,740
I think I can learn it

270
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,740
if he’s willing to teach me. Right?

271
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,820
Thank you so much for today.

272
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,140
Don’t mention it, Ai Qing!

273
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,740
That’s what friends are for.

274
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,300
Right, captain?

275
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,900
Today…

276
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,380
Oh, right, Ai Qing,

277
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,780
I have a proposal!

278
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,620
Captain, hold it for me.

279
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,980
I think

280
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,180
since the kids don’t come here often,

281
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,180
we could throw them a welcome party!

282
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,140
I think we can make some cupcakes

283
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,380
and snacks.

284
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,860
They’ll surely love them!

285
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,540
What’s wrong, captain?

286
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,380
Something wrong with your throat?

287
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,460
Did you catch a cold?

288
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,660
Zhou Yi.

289
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,580
Go get a glass of water.

290
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,580
Don’t worry! I’m not thirsty.

291
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,260
But I’m not so sure about

292
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,380
what kind of food the kids like…

293
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,620
I am!

294
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,340
I just boiled some water in the kitchen!

295
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,420
Help yourself.

296
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,700
Don’t get burnt, though!

297
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,660
I only drink the water you give me.

298
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,780
I got you!

299
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,860
I’m on it!

300
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,020
I’m going!

301
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,780
Zhou Yi

302
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,540
is very friendly!

303
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,980
He talks too much!

Water is here!

317
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,260
Water…

318
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,180
It’s getting late.

319
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,700
I need to head back to the campsite.

320
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,220
I’ll walk with you.

321
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,700
You don’t want the water?

322
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,540
Here we are.

323
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,140
I can go inside myself.

See you tomorrow.

325
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,060
It’s tomorrow already.

326
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,580
Well, you’re right.

327
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,740
Then, see you today.

328
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,180
See you today.

329
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,700
But…

330
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,580
nobody says goodbye this way.

331
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,460
It’s true.

332
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,380
Then let’s separate for now

333
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,660
and see each other later today.

334
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,660
Goodnight.

335
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,220
Goodnight.

336
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,740
Remember to close the window screen.

337
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,540
And use the mosquito-repellent.

338
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,140
Mosquitoes are abundant here.

339
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,540
I will.

340
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,900
Have a glass of warm milk
when you get back.

341
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,420
It’s good for your stomach.

342
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
Sweet dreams.

343
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,460
You, too.

344
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,140
If we keep talking,

345
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,740
we’re gonna see the daylight soon.

346
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,260
No time for dreams.

347
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,860
I’m sorry.

348
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,660
Stop saying sorry!

349
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,220
Captain of K&K!

350
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,060
Now, please walk back along this path

351
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,420
and go to bed!

352
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,420
Don’t turn around!

353
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,900
I’ll see you today.

354
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,860
See you today.

355
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,540
Bye-bye.

356
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,940

Miss Ai Qing!

389
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,060
Why are you still up?

390
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,220
Are you Frigg?

391
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,660
Why do you say that?

392
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,700
Because Frigg is Mr. Wu Bai’s goddess.

393
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,580
Who told you that?

394
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,060
I figured it out myself.

395
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,340
I saw the way

396
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,340
Mr. Wu Bai looked at you today!

397
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,780
You must be his Frigg!

398
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,940
As a little kid,

399
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,660
where did you learn all this stuff?

400
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,860
Just back to sleep!

401
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,620
Mr. Wu Bai adores you!

402
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,780
I can see that!

403
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,940
Alright! Go back to sleep now!

404
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,300
So are you going to tell him

405
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,980
that you adore him, too?

406
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
About that…

407
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,780
I’ll answer you tomorrow.

408
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,820
Tomorrow?

409
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,300
Tomorrow you’ll

410
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,700
love him even more!

411
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,220
You little smarty!

412
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Go to sleep!

413
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,700
Is it all?

414
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,780
Yes, sir!

415
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,020
Thank you!

416
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,300
I got it.

417
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,340
Morning!

418
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,780
Not cool.

419
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,140
You only said morning to Wu Bai.
What about us?

420
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,460
Who do you think you are?

421
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,220
Why should she say morning to you?

422
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,540
What do you mean?

423
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,500
I don’t deserve it?

424
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,340
After all, last night I…

425
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,380
Last night you what?

426
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,460
-I…
-You what?

427
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,820
Just go to work!

428
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,060
Come on, guys!

429
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,780
Captain, Ai Qing!

430
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,180
Miss Ai Qing! Mr. Wu Bai! Morning!

431
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,460
Zhou Yi, take the kids to the campsite.

432
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,340
Alright! Let’s go!

433
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,380
Come on! Run!

434
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,380
No food for late comers!

435
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,100
Thank you.

436
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,500
No need

437
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,380
to say “thank you” to me.

438
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,380
And you don’t have to say “sorry”.

439
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,100
Do you have plans for today?

440
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,580
Luo Hui told me earlier that she wanted

441
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,220
to go to K&K Club to see Wu Liao.

442
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,420
We can go together.

443
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,420
Are you sure?

444
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,380
It’s great! Well then,

445
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,420
the kids will be so excited!

446
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,460
Then it’s a deal.

447
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,140
What do you think?

448
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,420
This is our K&K Club,

449
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,300
guys!

450
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,260
Look over there.

451
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,220
It’s awesome, isn’t it?

452
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,300
Yes!

453
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,620
Guys, here’s a quiz for you.

454
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,140
Does anybody know this robot?

455
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,100
I do! I do!

456
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,340
It’s Nobody.

457
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,660
It’s the first robot Mr. Wu Bai used

458
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,180
when he made his debut.

459
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,620
He won the ARCT with it!

460
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,540
Bingo!

461
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,020
But I can only give you nine points,

462
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,220
for you missed a very important part.

463
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,740
Does anybody know

464
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,100
who designed Nobody?

465
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,700
Who? Is it Mr. Wu Bai?

466
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,940
Do you know?

467
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,100
You don’t know?

468
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,820
Let me tell you! Keep it in mind!

469
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,700
Nobody was designed and assembled

470
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,460
by Wu Bai and me!

471
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,540
You can even call it our first child!

472
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,180
Back then, Wu Bai and I

473
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,100
were like a father

474
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,460
and a mother…

475
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,860
We are hungry!

476
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,980
You are?

477
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,620
Follow me! I’ll take you to eat!

478
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,340
Come on!

479
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,420
I…I haven’t finished yet!

480
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,580
This is our K&K’s first warrior!

481
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,340
Let’s go eat.

482
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,220
Thank you for letting the kids here!

483
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,020
They are very happy!

484
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,420
Don’t you remember?

485
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,100
No need

486
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,660
to say “thank you” to me.

487
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,580
Guys,

488
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,100
since you are having such a good time,

489
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,900
I’d like to show you

490
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,300
our K&K’s latest secret weapon!

491
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,100
Do you want to see it?

492
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,700
Yes!

493
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,420
(Trash Can)

494
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,060
-What’s this?
-What is this?

495
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,460
The name is Trash Can!

496
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,940
-Trash Can!
-Trash Can!

497
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,060
It looks like a Roomba!

498
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,780
Right! It looks like a vacuum cleaner!

499
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,580
So cool! What’s its rotating speed?

500
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,340
Its…Its rotating speed is around…

501
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,780
A quick question for you.

502
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,460
Do you know what type

503
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,500
of robot this Trash Can is?

504
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,380
Note

505
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,620
that it’s not the usual horizontal
or vertical type.

506
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,900
I know! I know!

507
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,420
It’s full body spinning rotational
weapon type!

508
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,820
Miss Ai Qing taught us in class!

509
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,660
Good job!

510
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,060
So, who gets to control it?

511
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,100
It’s me, Shen Zhe!

512
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,820
You are so amazing!

513
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,340
Since you are here today,

514
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,820
would you like to see

515
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,820

Yes. Every one of it.

Guys,

549
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,740
take a look at this drone.

550
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,900
How many handles does it have?

551
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,020
Six!

552
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,900
Very smart!

553
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,460
When it’s in the air, look,

554
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,180
here’s a camera.

555
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,340
We can use this to control it,

556
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,700
and it can take pictures for us.

557
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,300
Isn’t it amazing?

558
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,460
Yes.

559
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,780
And this small one…

560
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,580
This small one can also fly.

561
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,620
I tried it last time.

562
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,220
Stop looking!

563
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,740
Your eyes are about to fall out!

564
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,460
I’m thinking

565
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,420
she could be a good team leader.

566
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,820
You change topics so fast.

567
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,740
When will they go back?

568
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,940
This afternoon.

569
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,820
Here comes another separation.

570
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,740
Not this time.

571
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,340
Get on the bus!

572
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,340
Hurry!

573
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,940
Seven, eight.

574
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,980
Have a safe trip.

575
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,380
Miss Ai Qing,

576
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,580
it’s time to go!

577
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,300
Okay.

578
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,620
Mr. Wu Bai, bye!

579
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,300
Mr. Wu Bai, bye!

580
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,820
I have to go.

581
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,100
See you.

582
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
See you.

583
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,180
Why would I listen to you?

584
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,060
Because my design paper says so!

585
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,980
I think this is good!

586
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,660
You guys are arguing again!

587
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,860
Listen! Take a look!

588
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,220
It’s definitely better than yours!

589
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,300
Just give it a shot!

590
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,460
Young man, you are here!

591
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,900
Mr. Zhang.

592
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,820
Here. I’ve signed it.

593
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,820
From now on,

594
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,020
this house

595
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,620
is yours.

596
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,140
You must be reluctant to leave
after living here for years.

597
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,180
Not really.

598
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,380
I do believe that you guys are meant

599
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,540
to own this old house.

600
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,620
I feel relieved that

601
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,980
you are the one who has it.

602
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,940
You see, my son is
getting married this year.

603
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,980
He wants me to move in with them.

604
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,700
My wife has passed away for years.

605
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,260
I feel lonely living alone.

606
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,220
In the future,
I can be with my grandkids

607
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,620
and won’t feel lonely.

608
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,780
Yes. It’s nice to be with family.

609
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,780
That’s right.

610
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,420
By the way, young man,

611
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,900
you are not married, right?

612
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,660
Did you buy this house

613
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,980
for getting married?

614
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,900
I do have this plan.

615
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,300
But I’m still working on it.

616
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,300
Good luck!

617
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,140
I know you can make it!

618
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,660
Alright, I’ll leave you to it.

619
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,780
Take care, Mr. Zhang.

620
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,420
That’s quite a view here!

621
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,340
I know, right?

622
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,180
Three months’ rent paid in advance
and one month deposit.

623
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,580
The rent is very reasonable.

624
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,140
But,

625
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,340
where did you get the money
to rent the house?

626
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,420
Take a guess.

627
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,980
I borrowed it.

628
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,380

00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,340
I was just in the neighborhood
for business,

671
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,460
and I bought you some pan-fried buns.

Ai Qing, do you still remember…

677
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,860
The cats live in this community.

678

Don’t be afraid.

679
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,380
They won’t attack you.

680

It’s okay.

681
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,380

00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,780

684
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,980
I forgot that until you said it.

00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,380

00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,300
After all, we haven’t seen each other
for years.

688
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,700
What were you

689
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,420
going to say to me?

690
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,540
Nothing.

691
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,380
I just passed by and came to see you.

692
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,460
You are carrying so many things.
Go upstairs.

693
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,060
Then I’ll go home now.

694
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,300
Bye-bye.

695
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,820
Bye-bye.

696
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,700
You are home!

697
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,540
I’m back!

698
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,460
I’m so tired!

699
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,180
What’s in your hand?

700
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,620
Pan-fried buns!

701
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,340
Awesome! I’m hungry!

702
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,460
Enjoy.

703
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,580
Have you eaten?

704
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,580
I have.

705
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,140
Those were bought by Solo.

706
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,580
Solo?

707
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,220
Why was he here?

708
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,220
Don’t know.

709
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,820
He said he just passed by.

710
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,380
Hope so.

711
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,180
Enough about him.

712
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,180
Tell me something about your trip.

713
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,380
How was it?

714
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,460
Not bad.

715
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,660
I bumped into a friend.

716
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,700
Who?

717
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,260
Shen Zhe.

718
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,700
Shen Zhe?

719
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,060
What was he doing there?

720
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,540
I’m kidding.

721
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,700
Our campsite this time

722
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,180
was very close to K&K Club.

723
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,020
We had some trouble,

724
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,540
so, Wu Bai called Shen Zhe
and others to help.

725
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,180
Wu Bai?

726
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,820
You met him again?

727
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,540
It must be destiny!

728
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,540
I can tell from your look

729
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,900
that something happened!

730
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,980
What did you guys do?

731
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,900
Actually,

732
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,980
we didn’t do much.

733
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,380
I bet something happened.

734
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,620
Now, spill it!

735
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,540
I took a shower at his place.

736
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,900
And then, he…

737
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,980
You took a shower together?

738
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,620
What shower together?

739
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,220
I took a shower by myself!

740
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,620
I soiled myself in the campsite,

741
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,140
and we were out of hot water,

742
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,700
so, he let me take a shower at his place.

743
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,100
And then what?

744
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,180
And then, he gave me

745
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,300
a tour in the K&K Club

746
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,900
and showed me his custom-made globe.

747
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,820
He also told me
something about his past.

748
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,940
And what happened after that?

749
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,500
After that,

750
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,900
he told me

751
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,620
that someone he loves is here.

752
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,420
This means he told you he loves you!

753
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,620
It’s got to be you!

754
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,580
I don’t know.

755
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,420
How come you don’t know?

756
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,620
He got interrupted by Zhou Yi

757
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,740
before he could finish.

758
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,620
I really don’t know
who he was referring to.

759
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,820
I can tell

760
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,060
that you’re touched.

761
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,460
Let me feel your heart.

762
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,820
The speed…

763
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,780
It even hurts my hand!
