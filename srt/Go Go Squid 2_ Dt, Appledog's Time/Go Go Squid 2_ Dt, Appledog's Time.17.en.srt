And third,

93
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,460

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,300
She’s gone

175
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,060
to wash her face.

176
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,300
Wash her face?

177
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,820
I gotta go, Idol.

178
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,860
Wait for me in the shuttle.

179
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,700
All right, Captain Champion.

180
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,060
Let’s go.

181
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,620
Go. Be quick.

182
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,780
For the next ten years,

183
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,300
it’ll be renamed

184
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,980
Frigg Trophy.

185
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,060
Sometimes, I think

186
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,860
love can be

187
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,740
quite a magical thing.

188
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,500
It takes only a second to feel it.

189
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
We don’t need to be determined

190
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,180
or think carefully about it.

191
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,300
At that time,

192
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,100
I suddenly want to be brave,

193
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,940
for...

194
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,020
for my own love.

195
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,380
I suddenly remember

196
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,740
I’ve got something to give you.

197
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,700
What’s it?

198
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,900
You told me that

199
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,500
after you opened a pot of chocolate,

200
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,380
you didn’t find what you wanted.

201
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,460
I opened the last piece.

202
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,620
Look

203
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,780
if this is what you want.

204
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,820
(I’ve met everybody in this world,
you are the only one I fall for.)

205
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,100

Ai Qing!

226

228
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,060
I’ll hide myself first.

Wu Bai.

230
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Mr. Xiang.

231
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,700
Did you see Ai Qing?

232
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,460
I...

233
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,980
I didn’t.

234
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,660
What...? What are you doing here?

235
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,860
I come

236
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,780
to review my winning moment.

237
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,300
I didn’t know you were so narcissistic.

238
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,780
Can Ai Qing be in there?

239
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,900
You’re alone?

240
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,980
She can’t be.

241
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,860
I’m alone.

242
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,900
You’re really alone?

243
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,940
I am.

244
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,260
Get in and check if you don’t believe.

245
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,700
All right. I’m just joking.

246
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,780
I’ll keep looking for Ai Qing.

247
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,220
Come quickly.

248
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,580
Mr. Xiang didn’t see me, did he?

249
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,700
No.

250
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,100
He’s going far.

251
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,620
That’s fine, then.

252
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,460
Let me hug you.

253
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,620
Wu Bai,

254
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,940
shall we go back first?

255
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,780
Aren’t they waiting for you?

256
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,940
Just one minute.

257
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,460
One minute only.

258
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,620
Fine, then.

259
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,020
I’ll count down.

260
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,620
59,

261
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,060
58,

262
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,700
57,

263
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,860
56.

264
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,180
Wu Bai,

265
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,780
thank you.

266
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,940
Have something to eat, Captain.

267
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,300
Put it here. Thank you.

268
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,780
What are you doing?

269
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,860
Modeling.

270
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,580
On what?

271
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,300
I used WebCrawler

272
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,460
to capture discussions

273
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,180
on dating places.

274
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,460
I set variables as women

275
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,460
(1 Cinema 2 Amusement Park 3 Mall)
between 25 years old to 30 years old

276
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,740
who had the first date.

277
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,420
Then I used them

278
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,260
to set a mathematical modeling

279
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
that can infer the best place

280
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,340
for the first date.

281
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,140
Captain, what a surprise!

282
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,420
You also care for sociology.

283
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,140
To be honest,

284
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,940
I’ve also been studying
the sowing time for our farm

285
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,420
with the help of big data.

286
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,700
But I wonder

287
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,140
if I need some other variables.

288
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,860
(1 Cinema 2 Amusement Park 3 Mall)
How about season?

289
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,820
You make some sense.

290
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,340
I’ll put it in.

291
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,180
Well, Zhou Yi,

292
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,820
make some noodles for me, too.

293
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,420
I’m hungry.

294
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,580
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

295
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,460
I’m just hungry now.

296
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,500
Go.

297
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,180
Captain,

298
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,500
you nearly put it on your face

299
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
that you’ll date Ai Qing.

300
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,100
Don’t you fear he’ll see you through?

301
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,380
I don’t think he will.

302
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,820
You’re right.

303
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,540
How is it going?

304
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,980
Does big data help a lot?

305
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,340
What have you got?

306
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:32,900
Cinema.

307
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,420
Cinema?

308
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,980
You used big data
for such an easy decision?

309
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,580
Are they reliable? Let me have a look.

310
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,140
Don’t... Don’t touch it.

311
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,620
You can ask me next time

312
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,580
for where you can go, right?

313
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,460
For example, parks. Just ask me.

314
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,380
The big data isn’t reliable.

315
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,500
I’ll confirm a few times.

316
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,220
Leave me alone.

317
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,540
Come on, let me help you.

318
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,020
I’ll do it a few more times, I...

319
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,660
I’ll do that.

320
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,780
Good morning, Madam.

321
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,220
This is your hot milk.

322
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,700
Mine?

323
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,740
Yes, it is.

324
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,900
Thank you.

325
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,900
You’re welcome.

326
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,500
You got the milk, huh?

327
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,580
Drink it and go to bed early.

328
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,980
You got the milk, huh?

329
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,540
Drink it and go to bed early.

330
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,300
Thank you.

331
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,020
Well,

332
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,420
see you tomorrow.

333
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,460
(Ai Qing)

334
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,380
See you tomorrow.

335
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,940
Go to bed early, too.

336
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,220
Good night.

337
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,900
What a coincidence!

338
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,340
Yeah, what a coincidence!

339
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,860
What a coincidence!

340
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,180
Hello, guys.

341
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,220
Here?

342
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,460
I really suspect

343
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,580
you bribed the airline.

344
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,620
Otherwise,

345
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,420
why were only four of us upgraded?

346
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,860
Let me make it clear.

347
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,100
We paid to get ourselves upgraded.

348
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,700
We’re not as lucky as you.

349
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,780
This is our fate,

350
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,780
I guess.

351
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,020
Is there something to eat?

352
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,900
I’m hungry.

353
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,340
I’ve got some.

354
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,220
You love chocolate, don’t you?

355
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,180
Why don’t you want it now?

356
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,540
Are you quitting chocolate

357
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
after you find the note you want?

358
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,300
I’ll have it, then.

359
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,420
We’re in a relationship, aren’t we?

360
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,580
But...

361
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,940
-I know what worries you.
-I...

362
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,820
I just want to be with you

363
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,180
and not to be disturbed.

364
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,940
We’ll make it public when it’s time.

365
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,300
Okay.

366
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,820
It’s so hard to overcome the jet lag.

367
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,300
I’m so sleepy.

368
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,780
Rest your head on my shoulder.

00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,380
I believe, anyway.

392
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,700
I want a chocolate pie, too.

393
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,100
(Excited. They’ve got closer.)

394
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,180
Look what I’ve prepared for you.

395
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,060
It’s your first date.

396
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,980
You must dress beautifully.

397
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,340
It’s for me?

398
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,300
It feels so good.

399
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,260
Do you like it?

400
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,420
Oh, it’s also

401
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,060
my favorite brand.

402
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,020
Sure.

403
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,940
I always have a good taste.

404
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,420
Also, I only give you the best.

405
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,940
Thank you, my dear sister.

406
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,460
I want it on your face.

407
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,700
I’ll go get changed.

408
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,260
Keep the box.

409
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,580
Morning.

410
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,820
Morning, Grunt.

411
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,900
Morning, Zhou Yi.

412
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,660
Morning, come and have breakfast.

413
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,660
Rice!

414
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,580
At last we have rice again.

415
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,100
What dishes?

416
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,140
Your favorite dishes.

417
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,700
Where’s Captain?

418
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,260
He’s just back from Chicago,

419
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,060
isn’t he?

420
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,820
-Locked himself up again?
-Yeah.

421
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,300
He’s indeed our captain.

422
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,140
Ca... Captain.

423
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,300
Time for breakfast.

424
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,700
Enjoy it without me.

425
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,580
I’m leaving.

426
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,940
Why is he in such a hurry?

427
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,100
Don’t ask.

428
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,380
He’s just coming out.

429
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,900
Coming out?

430
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,260
The retrogression of Xiaomi

431
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,540
makes me realize

432
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,180
there’s a golden period for any career.

433
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,700
When the golden period is gone,

434
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,660
we’ll decline.

435
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,460
To players,

436
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,300
this is the cruelest thing.

437
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
You’re worried about Xiaomi?

438
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,180
He’s not doing right

439
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,540
in recent days.

440
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,660
I knew you would realize it.

441
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,700
During last competition,

442
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,220
he told me he wanted
to collect his thoughts.

443
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,340
He’s a man

444
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,260
with his pride.

445
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,180
Leave him alone.

446
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,940
Fine, then.

447
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,540
I’ll go prepare
the retrospective meeting.

448
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,260
Keep an eye on him.

449
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,420
Xiaomi fought against Captain of RAP.

450
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,540
His robot restrains Xiaomi’s.

451
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,860
I’ll make a plan

452
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,980
to carefully study

453
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,660
how to fight lifting robots.

454
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,300
It doesn’t matter, Doggie.

455
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,700
You don’t need to be scrupulous.

456
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,220
I failed to do a good job.

457
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,980
Lately,

458
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,860
I’ll try to figure out the reason.

459
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,100
Come on!

460
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,220
We had a few retrospections.

461
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,300
We’re exhausted, aren’t we?

462
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,740
Yes. Yes.

463
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,900
All right. Dismiss.

464
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,060
Yes!

465
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,100
-Let’s go.
-Go back and get some sleep.

466
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,220
-Okay.
-Thank you, Boss.

467
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,100
I’ll get back to sleep until the noon.

468
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,860
Oh, until the afternoon.

469
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,020
Boss,

470
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,740
during the break,

471
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,020
I’ll make a new plan.

472
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,460
I’ll tell you about Xiaomi

473
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,780
after the seminar.

474
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,300
Okay.

475
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,940
You had hard work. Have some good rest.

476
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,980
If there’s nothing else,

477
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,180
I’ll leave.

478
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,340
Bye-bye, Boss.

479
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,580
You arrived so early?

480
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:24,980
I should have left home

481
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,500
half an hour earlier.

482
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,580
I’m a coach.

483
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,540
I’m used to setting out
half an hour earlier.

484
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,380
Besides,

485
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,980
you arrived a quarter earlier.

486
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,500
Well,

487
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,420
I’ll pick you up next time.

488
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,660
Is it...?

489
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,540
Is it your first time to date?

490
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,300
You look so nervous.

491
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,300
Let’s pick a film.

492
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,700
(Youth Diary, Fired War,
Maimai’s Mind, Peppa Pig Legend)

493
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,300
Which one would you like to see?

494
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,420
I’ve bought eight tickets
for four films.

495
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,540
Which one do you prefer?

496
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,780
You... You want to see four films?

497
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
No.

498
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,460
I just didn’t know
what you would prefer.

499
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,740
You could have asked me.

500
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,540
I will, next time.

501
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,020
Let me introduce you.

502
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,380
(Youth Diary)
The first film is a youth film,

503
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,580
with a high public praise.

504
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,100
The second film is

505
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,340
about gunfight.

506
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,460
It’s a typical Hollywood film, though.

507
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,140
(Youth Diary, Fired War,
Maimai’s Mind, Peppa Pig Legend)

508
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,620
The third film is suitable for a family.

509
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,420
The fourth one is a cartoon film.

510
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,220
It’s warm and healing.

511
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,260
Which one do you prefer?

512
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,220
How about this?

513
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,380
Count down on three,

514
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,660
and let’s make a choice.

515
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,380
Three, two, one.

516
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,420
(Fired War, Peppa Pig Legend)

517
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,500
(Peppa Pig Legend, Fired War)

518
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,620
Let’s watch this.

519
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,580
-Okay.
-All right?

520
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,580
Let’s go.

521
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,220
Excuse me, what would you like?

522
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,820
Give me each bottle

523
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,020
of all drinks in the fridge.

524
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,060
You want to buy all the drinks?

525
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,820
I don’t know what you prefer.

526
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,740
You can ask me.

527
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,420
What would you like to drink?

528
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,100
I’d like that one.

529
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,500
Strawberry drink.

530
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:49,860
Okay.

531
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,820
Two bottles, please.

532
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,620
Okay.

533
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,300
I keep that in mind.

534
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,220
I’ll buy this for you next time.

535
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,100
Sir, would you like some snacks?

536
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,860
What snacks would you like?

537
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,340
You’ve learned quickly.

538
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,740
I want...

539
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,780
popcorn.

540
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,740
Popcorn, please.

541
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,620
Okay.

542
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,020
38 yuan, sir.

543
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,860
Thank you.

544
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,860
Let’s go.

545
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,940
I’m not very used

546
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,460
when I’m so carefully taken care of.

547
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,900
Get used to it, then.

548
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,620
Excuse me.

549
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,340
Hello, Mr. Xiang?

550
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,180
Now?

551
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,100
Hello?

552
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,420
Now?

553
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,100
But I...

554
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,620
Hello?

555
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,100
97 asked me

556
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,980
to go back to the club immediately.

557
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,180
Mr. Xiang also called,

558
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,700
asking me to go to K&K.

559
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,820
He hung up before he explained.

560
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,860
Why did they bring us back in a hurry?

561
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,020
I don’t know.

562
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,980
Why is it so dark?

563
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,580
Yeah. Is there a power failure?

564
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Anybody in?

565
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,980
Anybody?

566
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
Nobody is in.

567
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,780
♪Happy birthday to you♪

00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,260
Happy birthday!

575
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,820
You’re late again.

576
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,380
I was stuck in traffic jam.

577
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,580
When did you arrive?

578
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,340
Captain,

579
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,220
why did you come with Ai Qing?

580
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,860
We met at the door.

581
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,820
Say no more.

582
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,380
Let me finish, all right?

583
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,140
Wu Bai,

584
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,180
today is your birthday.

585
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,340
Su Cheng and I

586
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,900
prepared such a birthday party for you.

587
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,300
Hope you’ll like it.

588
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,060
Hope all of us will have fun today!

589
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,620
Let’s wish Wu Bai a happy birthday,

590
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,660
all right?

591
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,700
Okay.

592
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,300
Wu Bai,

593
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,660
I know you don’t like to talk.

594
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,820
But you must talk today.

595
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,140
It’s your birthday and you’re the star.

596
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,500
You must say something.

597
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,740
Everybody, thank you
for preparing the birthday party.

598
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,660
I’m very grateful.

599
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,100
That’s all?

600
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,420
Good. Good.

601
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,500
Good point.

602
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,500
He’s indeed tight-lipped.

603
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,060
Well, let’s cut the cake.

604
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,940
Yes. Yes.

605
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,780
Wait, wait a minute.

606
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,220
Before cutting the cake,

607
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,620
I’ve got a little request.

608
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,620
I’ve got a cousin,

609
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,380
who is your loyal fan.

610
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,340
Before I came,

611
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,420
she especially asked me

612
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
to contact her

613
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,860
through the video chat.

614
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,220
A blind date.

615
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,220
She wants to confess her love to you

616
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,420
through the video chat.

617
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,380
Mr. Xiang,

618
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,500
since when were you a matchmaker?

619
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,580
I’m not a matchmaker.

620
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,060
I’m considering for Wu Bai.

621
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,820
My cousin is a good girl.

622
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,380
She...

623
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:09,900
You know what?

624
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,260
My cousin...

625
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,180
Mr. Xiang,

626
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,700
I’ve got the girl I like.

627
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,660
Fine, then.

628
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,100
Come and make a wish.

629
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,580
Come on.

630
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,260
Awesome!

631
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,380
Wu Bai,

632
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,660
what wish

633
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,580
did you make?

634
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,420
Why don’t you share it with us?

635
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,660
Yeah. Tell us about it.

636
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,660
Tell us about it.

637
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,300
-Wu Bai, tell us about it.
-Go head.

638
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,820
All right. Just tell us.

639
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,740
You...

640
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
Thank you, everybody.

641
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,500
Wu Bai.

642
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,060
Captain.

643
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,180
Wu Bai! Wu Bai!

644
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:55,780
You...

645
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,580
You forced him to leave.

646
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,660
See?

647
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,980
You forced him to leave.

648
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,580
I didn’t force him out.

649
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,660
You know what? He’s just shy.

650
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,260
Let’s cut the cake.

651
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,460
Let’s do it. Cut the cake.

652
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,940
-Come on.
-Let’s cut the cake.

653
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,500
Come on. Come.

654
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,380
Take this big piece.

655
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,980
I’d like... I’d like a small piece.

656
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,580
-Okay.
-Cut it into even pieces.

657
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,660
Give it to me.
Give me the piece with words.

658
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,700
Okay.

659
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,340
97,

660
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,140
what’s this for?

661
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:19,980
This?

662
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,740
Wu Bai made it.

663
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,420
It’s his son.

664
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,220
Its name is Wu Liao.

665
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,260
Wu Liao?

666
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,980
How boring!

667
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,420
I’m not boring.

668
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,900
It can talk?

669
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,460
Look, interesting.

670
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,220
Yeah, 97,

671
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,140
what can it do?

672
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,740
It?

673
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,340
It can do a lot of things.

674
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,220
Well,

675
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,900
I’ll ask its father

676
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,700
to explain to you.

677
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,140
Wu Bai!

678
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,900
Happy birthday, Wu Bai!

679
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,380
You sneaked out, too?

680
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,660
Today’s your birthday,

681
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,540
but why didn’t you tell me?

682
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,700
I just want to spend it with you.

683
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,900
But,

684
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,380
I haven’t prepared any gift.

685
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,900
When you’re with me,

686
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,380
♪It’s a surprise to meet you again♪

687
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,540
it’s the best gift for me.

688
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,460
♪I have so many words to say♪

689

690
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,660

691
