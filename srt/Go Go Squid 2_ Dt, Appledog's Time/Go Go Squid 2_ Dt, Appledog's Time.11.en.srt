My daughters are so beautiful.

20
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,300
How can’t they get married?

21
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,220
What’s more,

22
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,060
your grandma said

23
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,140
she will arrange a blind date for you.

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,660
-Blind date?
-Blind date?

25
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,500
I don’t need it.

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,780
With my great charm,

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,300
many people are attracted.

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,620
Ai Qing can go for the blind date.

29
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,060
No, I don’t.

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,180
I don’t need it. I’m charming, too.

31
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,180
-OK.
-Let her go.

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,020
I will eat that since you don’t need it.

33
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,340
She should lose weight.

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,740
Seriously, you need a blind date.

35
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,460
The meat is for me.

36
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,300
Dad, look at her.

37
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,860
You need to lose weight, Jing.

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,860
You lose weight. You.

41
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,500
Morning.

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,540
Please hold on.

43
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,060
The store isn’t open yet.

44
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,380
It’s been a while.

45
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,940
Nice to see you.

46
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,420
You’ve been back for years.

47
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,980
But you never contact

48
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,940
any old friends.

49
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,740
Ai Qing told you I’m here?

50
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,740
Yes.

51
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,100
Tell me.

52
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,660
What’s up?

53
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,620
I won’t believe

54
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,100
boss of the biggest Robot Fighting club

55
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,780
will come to me for a talk
on the early morning of a working day.

56
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,820
Same as Ai Qing,

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,820
I’m here to invite you to come back.

58
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,620
Come on, my friend.

59

are kept for you.

(Personnel Employment Contract)

63
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,180
Tell me,

64
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,580
when should I report for duty?

65
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,460
(I never mentioned Han Shangyan
and I are cousins. Sorry.)

66
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,740
So,

67
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,180
Ai Qing doesn’t know
your relationship with Han Shangyan?

68
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,780
Don’t peep.

69
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,340
All right.

70
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,540
We all know you like Ai Qing.

71
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,740
It’s not news.

72
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
What’s wrong?

73
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,620
You made an apology,

74
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,020
but she didn’t reply, right?

75
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,980
I can see it from your face.

76
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,020
Now,

77
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,740
listen.

78
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,580
When you are given

79
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,340
a cold shoulder,

80
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,780
draw back distance with her.

81
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,500
You should be at a distance with her.

82
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,220
Give her some time for thinking.

83
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,620
Understand?

84
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,780
No.

85
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,740
Ai Qing is not that kind of person who

86
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,380
doesn’t reply after reading the text.

87
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,620
There must be something happened.

88
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,060
So?

89
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,900
I’m going to find her.

90
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,900
You…

91
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,180
It won’t be that easy.

92
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,420
I’ve reminded you.

93
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,380
She’s leaving like that.

94
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,740
What a pity!

95
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,060
Now you are leaving.

96
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,380
I’m alone here.

97
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,900
I will come back to see you.

98
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,180
Don’t forget that.

99
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,340
Here you are.

100
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,780
It’s the project report I wrote for you.

101
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,340
Keep it well.

102
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,060
You are the best.

103
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,700
Thank you for your hard work
all these years.

104
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,900
Feel free to come back

105
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,220
at any time you want.

106
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,780
Thank you, boss.

107
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,460
You may take some time to go

108
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,820
to the youth training camp
to say goodbye.

109
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,060
They may cry if they know

110
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,900
you are leaving.

111
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,460
I don’t want to leave, either.

112
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,460
I will come back to help

113
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,900
when I have some time.

114
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,940
Of course, feel free to come back.

115
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,580
I’m really happy for you.

116
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,580
When you came to Jiayi three years ago,

117
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,580
I knew you would return

118
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,820
to the team some time or other.

119
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,340
After all,

120
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,860
your love for it cannot be hidden.

121
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,060
Good luck, Ai Qing.

122
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,340
Good luck, Ai Qing.

123
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,420
Good luck, Ai Qing.

124
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,620
Good luck.

125
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,820
Ai Qing.

126
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,780
Hey, Ai Qing.

127
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,660
I can’t believe you are so great.

128
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,660
You will be the coach of SP Team.

129
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,380
Maybe we’ll have a chance to cooperate.

130
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,260
I’ve done something to offend you

131
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,740
before in working.

132
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,980
Please forgive me.

133
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,420
Good luck!

134
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,780
See you then.

135
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,460
Sure.

136
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,300
Well.

137
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,180
The car has arrived.
Let me take you downstairs.

138
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,340
This is heavy.

139
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,660
I got it.

140
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,980
OK.

141
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,900
OK.

142
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,180
I’m leaving now.

143
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,100
See you, Boss.

144
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,780
See you.

145
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,060
See you all.

146
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,460
See you.

147
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,100
Ai Qing.

148
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,420
Tomorrow

149
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,820
will be better.

151
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,740
I used to think

152
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,100
dreams fade over time

153
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,180
and become ordinary daily life.

154
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,220
Now I see dreams are like seeds.

155
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,820
They hibernate but never die.

156
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,940
Thank you for giving me a forget-me-not.

157
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,140
I don’t know who you are.

158
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,100
But because of you,

159
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,740
I never feel lonely

160
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,940

resigned.

Resigned?

175
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,740
at SP Team next week.

176
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
Dt.

177
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,220
Dt. Dt.

178
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,420
Is there any message for me

179
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,820
from Mr. Xiang?

180
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,340
Xiang…

181
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,620
No.

182
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,700
I’m leaving.

183
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,820
Dt. You…

184
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Can you think about it?

185
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,540
What kind of hairstyle would you like?

186
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,540
Cut it.

187
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,500
Cutting your long hair

188
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,100
would be a shame, isn’t it?

189
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,140
Miss, you may look very beautiful

190
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,180
if you have a permanent wave style.

191
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,140
No, thanks.

192
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,620
Please cut it.

193
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,140
You want to cut your hair

194
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,220
because you are crossed in love?

195
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,380
Miss.

196
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,300
Don’t take things too hard.

197
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,140
You wanna put the past behind?

198
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,820
No.

199
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,020
I want to return to the past.

200
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,780
Cut it.

201
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,140
OK.

Don’t make me lose face, you know?

225
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,700
Who is that, Boss?

226
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,380
You will know.

227
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,740
Here she is.

228
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,260
Hello, Doggie.
Haven’t seen you for a long time.

229
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,700
Finally you are here.

230
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,940
It’s been a while.

231
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,540
Oh, please let me introduce.

232
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,740
Fu Yiwen, a senior of SP.

233
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,660
Hi, Senior.

234
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,140
We’ve met in Guangzhou.

235
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,700
Do you remember it?

236
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,900
Please allow me introduce myself.

237
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,340
I’m Fu Yiwen, mechanic engineer of SP.

238
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,180
Hello.

239
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,660
Welcome to SP.

240
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,540
That’s enough.

241
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,420
Go training.

242
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,060
I’m leaving now, Boss.

243
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,020
See you, senior.

244
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,020
Bye-bye.

245
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,340
Solo is waiting for us.

246
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,300
I will take you there.

247
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,220
Let’s go.

248
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,060
This is the leisure area.

249
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,820
OK, I will contact you.

250
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,860
Please.

251
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,220
Excuse me.

252
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,460
I just had a phone call

253
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,980
so I couldn’t pick you up.

254
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,100
Boss.

255
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,020
You cut your hair.

256
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,500
Please sit down. I’ll take the contract.

257
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,460
OK.

258
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,820
Well, take a seat.

259
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,220
Sit down please.

260
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,700
It’s been ten years.

261
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,900
Many things happened.

262
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,020
Finally we become comrades in team.

263
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,180
It’s my honor.

264
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,460
Actually,

265
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,420
I’ve always thought

266
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,060
the name Baona is a girl’s name

267
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,420
before I know you.

268
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,860
Not strange.

269
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,380
Everyone said so.

270
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,980
Then why did you come up with this name?

271
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,140
When I

272
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,660
first worked in the industry,

273
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,180
I always made mistakes in the rush

274
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,180
and couldn’t find my toolkit.

275
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,300
So I shouted at the competition site

276
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,260
that “Where is my toolkit?”

277
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,300
In that case,

278
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,260
people gave me that name.

279
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,020
After some time,

280
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,220
I got used to it.

281
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,540
You used to be a player, too?

282
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,900
You don’t remember?

283
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,180
You can’t figure out who I am

284
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,020
even if you rack your brain.

285
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,860
I entered the circle in 2006

286
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,620
and retired in 2008.

287
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,820
China wasn’t developed

288
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,740
in robot fighting at that time.

289
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,060
I chose to take a back seat.

290
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,340
Your team appeared one year later.

291
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,380
So

292
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,140
you attracted capital to form SP Club,

293
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,060
and Solo was the first on your mind.

294
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,740
In the year

295
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,820
when Solo Team was dissolved,

296
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,060
I intended to sign a contract

297
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,540
with you, Solo

298
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,180
and Han Shangyan.

299
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,060
But it didn’t come true

300
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,580
at that time.

301
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,060
What are you talking about?

302
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,500
Please read the contract first.

303
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,860
(Ai Qing)

304
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,260
It’s OK.

305
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,500
You can start working today.

306
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,140
About the social security…

307
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,100
Wait a moment.

308
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,100
Why do you become silly

309
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,380
once you see Doggie?

310
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,500
The HR will be in charge
of social security.

311
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,220
OK. Let’s talk about working .

312
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,420
OK.

313
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,620
Please assign the work, Boss.

314
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,900
Don’t call me like that.

315
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,420
I can’t get used to it.

316
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,460
Maybe you have to get used to it.

317
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,420
We will work together for a long time.

318
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,580
Guys,

319
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,420
please continue your talk.

320
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,020
I have to go to the HR department.

321
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,260
Ai Qing.

322
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,660
I’m very pleased

323
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,940
you can join us.

324
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,660
It’s my pleasure

325
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,020
to join SP, too.

326
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,220
OK. See you.

327
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,820
I will leave.

328
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,820
OK.

329
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Can

330
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,980
I take a look?

331
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,220
Of course.

332
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,020
Thank you, Solo.

333
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,020
Thank you for giving me the chance.

334
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,260
Not at all.

335
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,980
It’s because you have the ability.

336
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,940
All leaders agreed with that.

337
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,460
The hero has just woken up.

338
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,780
You’ll create a glorious future with us.

339
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,420
When did you become so literate?

340
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,460
I’m the boss now.

341
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,460
So I should learn some phatic talk.

342
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,660
Your short hair

343
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,860
reminds me of the time

344
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,380
when we competed together.

345
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,380
I cut it on purpose

346
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,100
to get back the feelings

347
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,020
of playing games before.

348
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,020
Boss, I’m leaving now

349
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,820
if it’s OK.

350
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,020
Ai Qing, there is one thing.

351
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,860
What is it?

352
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,220
What’s wrong?

353
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,460
I’d like you to do me a favor.

354
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,900
The coach of Team II
will be on maternity leave next month.

355
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,220
Do you mind training

356
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,620
both Team I and Team II together?

357
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,580
OK.

358
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,380
No problem.

359
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,060
Then that’s a deal.

360
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,340
I will take you around.

361
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,700
There is a big surprise

362
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,180
for you.

363
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,900
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

364
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,700
This is our robot developing area.

365
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,980
-Hi, Boss.
-Hi, Boss.

366
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,300
Take a look.

367
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,500
All these devices

368
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,100
are the top in the world.

369
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:26,860
Come on.

370
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,820
This way please.

371
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,700
The 3D printer

372
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,580
is the best model as well.

373
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,100
We will print 3D models

374
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,300
according to the drawings.

375
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,780
It’s more convenient than that
in those days.

376
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,740
-Hello.
-Hello.

377
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,820
This is our working area.

378
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,540
Really good conditions.

379
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,220
It’s really much better

380
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,340
than that of our time.

381
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,580
Yes.

382
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,820
I will take you to the R&D Department.

383
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,300
OK.

384
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,260
This way.

385
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,060
Hi, Boss.

386
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,460
-Morning.
-Hello, Boss.

387
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,420
This is

388
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,220
the R&D area for our robots.

389
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,940
Now it’s more subdivided.

390
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,780
For example, this is responsible

391
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,140
for R&D and upgrade of mecha.

392
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,820
That is for upgrading

393
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,060
remote control and drive.

394
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,460
Come on.

395
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,820
I’ll take you to our training hall.

396
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,660
OK.

397
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,300
We always have our basic training

398
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,420
and practice game here.

399
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,420
You upgraded it well.

400
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,740
You played well.

401
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,500
Actually I think

402
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
we can be faster.

403
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,900
It’s already very good.

404
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,300
I’d introduce you our team members.

405
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,580
Goddess?

406
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,020
-It’s you.
-It’s you.

407
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,220
You are the new coach of SP?

408
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,660
You’re Wu Bai’s girlfriend.

409
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,420
Yes, I’m the new coach.

410
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,820
But...

411
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,380
I’m not Wu Bai’s girlfriend.

412
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,420
Is that so?

413
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,940
What a pity.

414
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,620
It seems Wu Bai really likes you anyway.

415
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,460
You knew each other before?

416
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,100
Lin Yin is Wu Bai’s friend.

417
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
We met before in Suzhou.

418
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,300
I see.

419
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,620
Actually Wu Bai is also my idol.

420
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,540
I’d introduce myself formally.

421
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,540
Lin Yin just joined us.

422
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,460
He’s the youngest member of the team.

423
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,060
I’m already 18 years old.

424
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,420
We are all adults.

425
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,700
All are the same.

426
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,540
I’d introduce again.

427
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,180
Coach, I’m Lin Yin.

428
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,540
The operator of SP Team.

429
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,220
Nice to see you.

430
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,620
You have no idea

431
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,940
how many clubs

432
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,820
want this young genius.

433
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
Many people say

434
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,340
he’ll probably become the next Wu Bai.

435
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,180
I also think so.

436
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,860
What do you think, Coach?

437
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,340
I think…

438
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,580
Wu Bai is taller than you.

439
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,460
I’m still a kid.

440
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,060
I will keep

441
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,460
growing taller.

442
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,820
You just said

443
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,300
you are an adult.

444
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,500
I…

445
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,580
Well, let’s stop joking on him.

446
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,580
He may feel embarrassed.

447
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,820
Doggie.

448
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,980
There’s no need to introduce, right?

449
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,900
I’m back.

450
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,060
I knew you would come back.

451
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,420
You belong to this place.

452
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,820
I have to especially explain

453
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,460
that Ou Qiang is not an operator

454
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,420
but our software engineer now.

455
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,340
But a team

456
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,060
usually has two operators.

457
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,900
Who is the other one?

458
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,180
You may guess.

459
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,660
It’s been a while, Doggie.

460
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,900
Xiaomi.

461
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,180
When did you return?

462
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,060
When did you join in SP?

463
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,300
Why didn’t you tell me early?

464
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,820
There is no surprise in that case.

465
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,740
Ou Qiang.

466
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,180
You knew it earlier, right?

467
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,580
That’s his idea.

468
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,980
Boss.

469
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,300
Coach.

470
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,300
Thank you.

471
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,940
What’s wrong? Silly girl.

472
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,060
I promised you, so I surely will come.

473
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,140
Thank you all.

474
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,220
Thank you for coming back.

475
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,900
These are all the members

476
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,180
of SP Team I.

477
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,180
Welcome

478
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,820
back.

479
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,020
Welcome back.

♪A nobody Who am I♪

♪Don’t mind if you forget her♪

482
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,860
Wish all the new members

483
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,780
can overcome all obstacles

484
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,140
and be invincible

485
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,820
in the future games.

486
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,980
♪Maybe he’s tired and miserable♪

00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:36,060
♪Maybe he could never be anybody♪

489
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,140
I feel like I’m back to Solo Team.

490
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,140
♪A nobody♪

491
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,340
Guys.

492
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,380
SP! Go for it!

493
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,060
Bibo, bibo. Wu Liao detected you’re

494
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,300
seriously lacks of happiness index.

495
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,580
Tell me if anything makes you unhappy.

496
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,140
That can make me happy.

497
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,340
Are you bored?

498
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,460
I’m not.

499
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,940
Alright.

500
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,260
I made the wrong estimation

501
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,140
of my emotional endurance.

502
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,420
I’m pleased she returned

503
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,220
to the armor circle.

504
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,260
But accordingly,

505
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,820
she has more time to be with Solo.

506
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,700
Searching the list of sad love songs.

507
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,100
Playing soon.

508
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,340
No, I’ve been in peace now.

509
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,460
Alright.

510
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,500
I admit

511
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,020
that I want to see her.

512
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,060
As you see,

513
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,180
SP’s hardware level

514
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,020
is second to none.

515
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,540
How about software?

516
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,540
Software?

517
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,300
Almost unbeatable.

518
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,860
Almost?

519
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,220
Is K&K comparable?

520
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,660
Do you know K&K very well?

521
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,020
Not much.

522
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,860
Then

523
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,060
you know Wu Bai very well?

524
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,020
Why do you ask so suddenly?

525
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,220
I found

526
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,020
that you think highly of Wu Bai.

527
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,020
I just feel time flies

528
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,660
suddenly.

529
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,420
When Han brought him
to watch the game for the first time

530
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,980
he was just a little boy.

531
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,660
Now he actually becomes

532
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,380
captain of the top team.

533
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,900
Yes.

534
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,380
We are getting old.

535
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,060
It’s their time now.

536
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,140
How about

537
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,580
inviting the members

538
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,820
to have dinner together tonight?

539
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,140
I’m afraid not.

540
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,820
Someone is picking you up.

541
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,500
Hi.

542
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,420
Short hair

543
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,220
fits you well.

544
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,420
Thank you.

545
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,860
How did you know I’m here?

546
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,300
Your ex-colleague told me that.

547
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,580
What are you doing here

548
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,860
today?

549
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,500
Ai Qing.

550
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,020
I wonder

551
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,420
if you came back for Solo.

552
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
No.

553
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,940
I want to take you to a place.

554
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,900
OK.

555
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,420
Where are we going?

556
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,220
Get on the car.

why would I feel

574
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,140
so reluctant at the moment?

575
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,500
But I know better

576
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,220
he’s Han Shangyan’s cousin.

577
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,220
He’s the captain of K&K.

578
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,260
These two points

579
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,820
together mean only one thing

580
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,500
for me,

581
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,620
same mistake.

582
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,500
Ai Qing.

583
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,180
I’d like to talk to you.

584
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,140
Wu Bai.

585
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,500
Can you listen to me first?

586
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,780
OK.

587
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,700
Do you remember you asked me a question

588
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,700
three years ago in Singapore?

589
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,340
Why did

590
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,700
Solo Team dismiss?

591
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,220
Yes.

592
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,500
Why did you mention that suddenly?

593
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,380
Now I’m telling you the reason

594
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,700
why it dismissed.

595
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,900
The real reason

596
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,340
was because of me.

597
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,500
I made

598
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,740
an impulsive decision

599
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,860
which caused the dismission
of Solo Team.

600
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,100
Meanwhile,

601
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,860
it caused an eternal regret

602
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,780
of Han Shangyan,

603
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,300
Ou Qiang and Xiaomi.

604
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,460
I want to find them back.

605
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,100
I want to rebuild the team.

606
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,700
Or

607
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,500
at least I can give them

608
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,820
the competition prize.

609
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,500
It’s like before.

610
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,500
We shared the prize together.

611
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,660
Even if it’s only one penny,

612
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,660
we would divide it into five.

613
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,140
So I kept playing competitions

614
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,100
until the Asian Championships.

615
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,700
Getting everyone back

616
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,100
is my greatest wish all the time.

617
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,980
I hope everyone of them

618
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,660
can live a very good life.

619
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,380
But

620
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,900
when I got SP’s contract,

621
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,060
I hesitated.

622
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,100
I almost refused their invitation.

623
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,500
But when I saw Slide later,

624
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,820
he said something to me.

625
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,220
He told me

626
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,900
he’s dying to return to the circle.

627
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,860
I was thinking

628
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,300
that must be the dream

629
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,300
of Ou Qiang and others as well.

630
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,380
So I have to spare no pains.

631
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,460
I must do that.

632
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,940
K&K and SP are competitors.

633
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,340
You are the captain of K&K.

634
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,460
If I become the coach of SP,

635
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,420
we two

636
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,620
will be the biggest rivals.

637
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,500
We take on our own team

638
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,700
and club.

639
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
We are no longer an individual.

640
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,340
So Wu Bai,

641
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,060
comparing to love,

642
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,660
something is more important

643
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,940
