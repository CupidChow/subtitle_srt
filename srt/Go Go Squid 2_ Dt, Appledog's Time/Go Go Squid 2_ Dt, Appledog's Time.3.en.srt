(FMB Teen Camp)

21
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,740
Everyone!

22
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,740
Today, let’s welcome a new member

23
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,460
to join our camp.

24
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,340
Shall we ask her to give us

25
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,300
a self-introduction?

26
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,580
I’m Luo Hui.

27
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,860
Luo, sounds like “Robert”
in Robert Downey Jr.

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,540
Hui, represents wisdom.

29
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,180
I’m eleven years old.

30
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,900
Who’s Robert Downey Jr.?

31
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,740
He played Iron Man!

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,660
Awesome!

33
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,940
Are you one of Iron Man’s fans?

34
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,900
Yes. What about you?

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,540
I…

36
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,140
I think I prefer Spiderman.

37
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,300
Why?

38
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,900
Because

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,860
he’s handsome.

40
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,260
I like Spiderman, too!

41
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,700
I also think he’s handsome!

42
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,700
My Iron Man is handsome, too!

43
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,060
Your Iron Man?

44
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,660
Yes. Because of him,

45
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,660
robot combat grows on me.

46
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,020
Then, would you mind

47
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,340
sharing your story with us?

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,620
I don’t mind at all!

49
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,460
Once I went to the hospital
for eye treatment,

50
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,060
I met a big brother.

51
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,580
The big brother said

52
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,340
he had an idol in robot combat industry,

53
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,380
who was like Frigg to him.

54
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,580
Who’s Frigg?

55
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,420
Yeah. Who is she?

56
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,420
She’s the idol of Luo Hui’s idol!

57
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,820
It sounds like a long story.

58
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,180
Frigg is a goddess in Norse mythology,

59
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,060
and also the Goddess of sky and earth.

60
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,100
I know her!

61
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,020
She’s a character from Marvel!

62
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,580
She’s the Queen of Asgard.

63
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,940
Yes, she is Thor and Loki’s mother.

64
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,140
Yes! Is she a raving beauty?

65
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,540
Yeah! Is she beautiful?

66
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,460
Hello.

67
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,980
Hello, Ai Qing!

68
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,180
Hello.

69
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,940
Na!

70
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,500
Welcome back!

71
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,460
I’m telling you,

72
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,220
today, in the camp,

73
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,740
a new girl came among us.

74
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,460
Now the children are so funny.

75
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,980
They are unusually smart.

76
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,820
You must tell me about it.

77
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,900
I’m bored with my work.

78
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,860
I’d love to listen to your stories.

79
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,060
Come on. I’m listening!

80
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,740
Have you ever heard of...

81
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,140
Frigg?

82
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,540
Do you know what Frigg is?

83
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:39,940
No.

84
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,900
I bet you don’t know.

85
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,780
I don’t know either.

86
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,100
-But they know.
-How is today’s promotion meeting?

87
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,100
It went well!

88
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,900
These are resumes.

89
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,820
The personnel department said
if there’s any suitable applicant,

90
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,460
-we could…
-Why are they so picky?

91
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,180
Just recruit somebody to
go on errands for me!

92
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,540
I only stayed at home
for 7 days in a month

93
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,460
and I’ve been travelling
for over 20 days!

94
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,300
I’m exhausted!

95
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,380
Well, you should write down.

96
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,100
Recruit a person to make PPT.

97
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,300
I’m fed up with so many PPTs!

98
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,740
Recruit another person to write
press releases,

99
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,140
who must have writing skills.

100
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,260
And...

101
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,700
It has just occurred to me that

102
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,420
I have done all the work!

103
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,060
What’s my work actually?
And what’s your work?

104
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,060
Can’t the company run without me?

105
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,740
Don’t just stare at me!

106
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,980
Do your work!

107
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,260
Write down my instructions.

108
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,900
Ai Qing.

109
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,860
Come on.

110
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,100
Help me to check

111
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,980
if my eyes are rolling back
into my head.

112
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,300
What do you say?

113
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,300
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Look. This is it.

114
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,580
Tell you what,

115
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,380
I’ve made all the PPTs.

116
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,060
And the press releases were written by
a kid of PR Department.

117
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,340
Why does he act that he is hard-working?

118
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,780
The boss won’t see it.

119
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,380
All of it must be redone.

120
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,500
Maybe he is eager to impress you.

121
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Give it to me as quickly as possible!

122
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,420
Yes.

123
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,020
Ai Qing.

124
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,860
Mr. Lin.

125
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,900
Well...

126
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,420
Na, just do your work.

127
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,460
Do you have time this weekend?

128
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,820
Maybe.

129
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,940
Do I have to work?

130
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,180
I’m not willing to make you work. Well.

131
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,420
I’m in the middle of the publicity

132
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,100
of FMB Championship.

133
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,420
At Shanghai Station,

134
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,700
we’ve invited many stars
to do a mixed concert.

135
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,100
I have tickets.

136
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,460
VIP!

137
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,620
You and me!

138
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,060
Me and you?

139
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,700
Let’s go together.

140
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,380
Mr. Lin, I forgot!

141
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,460
I... I’m sorry! A relative of mine
would visit me this weekend!

142
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,380
It’s... It’s my uncle-in-law,

143
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,900
who comes from my old home.

144
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,500
It’s a pity.

145
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,700
Why don’t you invite Zhao?

146
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,860
Nonsense!

147
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,620
Everybody! You must work this weekend!

148
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,060
After picking up your
so called uncle-in-law,

149
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,420
you must come to work, too!

150
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,540
Mr. Lin.

151
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,060
We haven’t got the overtime pay
for last month!

152
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,500
Put it aside until next month!

153
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,780
Crumbs!

154
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,020
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

155
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,020
Wait for us! Wait for us!

156
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,460
Excuse us! Excuse us!

157
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,860
Did you ask Ai Qing out?

158
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,700
What did she say?

159
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,180
Tell you what,

160
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,620
pretty as she is,

161
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,860
this girl

162
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,100
doesn’t know anything

163
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,060
about robots.

164
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,980
I kept explaining it to her,

165
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,780
but she still doesn’t know
what combat robots are!

166
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,300
So I’d better drop it.

167
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,380
She’s not suitable for me.

168
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,940
And tell you what?

169
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,820
I’m used to bringing some drinks

170
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,780
to the office

171
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,220
because I want to give everyone treats
for their hard work.

172
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,620
But this girl

173
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,740
always sneaks around.

174
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,020
She likes to drink in corners.

175
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,460
I’ve never scolded her,

176
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,020
but I know what she did.

177
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,740
She’s not suitable.

178
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,900
Come.

179
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,300
I put some imported chocolate

180
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,420
on my desk.

181
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,140
But they just vanished!

182
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,180
Crumbs! Isn’t he ridiculous?

183
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,900
He has a bottle of drink

184
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,540
in the fridge.

185
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,020
Every time he sees a pretty girl,

186
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,300
he’d pour a cup for her.
How could he say that?

187
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,220
How dare he say
you don’t know robots!

188
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,020
Good lord!

189
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,500
He doesn’t even know you

190
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,580
and he dares to say he loves robots?

191
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,460
He is just a manager of a sponsor company.

192
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,780
I bet he can’t even recognize a robot!

193
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,620
And if you actually

194
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,020
give him a robot,

195
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,500
I bet he can’t activate it.

196
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,820
He doesn’t even know
where the switch is!

197
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,980
Don’t mind him.

198
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,340
By the way, I need to go out.

199
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,740
I can’t have lunch with you.

200
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,620
Sure.

201
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,620
Got to go! Bye!

202
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,020
Bye!

203
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,580
Sister!

204
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,140
Come on!

205
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,300
Why are you in such a hurry?

206
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,180
Of course I’m in a hurry! Come on!

207
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,140
Take it easy!

208
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,460
What do we come here for?

209
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,820
-Do you know who the owner is?
-Got it!

210
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,460
Got it.

211
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,300
That one! That one!

212
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,860
Take care!

213
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,700
Mr. Zhou.

214
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,740
Mr. Zhou.

215
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,060
You two are getting more beautiful.

216
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,620
What brought you here?

217
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,460
I was wondering
why it is so lively today.

218
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,060
Here come the important guests!

219
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,500
Important guests!

220
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,540
Didn’t you go to Germany?

221
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,300
Yes. Then I came back.

222
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,740
Well... When did you come back?

223
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,020
Why do you come back?

224
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,340
Why do you have so many questions?

225
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,300
I’m just retired.

226
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,740
You’re retired, why shouldn’t I?

227
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,220
He’s retired because his…

228
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,420
Dad!

229
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,860
Help me to put this in the new warehouse.

230
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,060
Let me entertain our guests.

231
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,460
Sure. Of course.

232
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,060
Invite them to dinner later.

233
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,380
Don’t go to the little
roadside restaurants.

234
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,260
Find a fancy and expensive place!

235
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,580
What do you think?

236
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,140
Have you got money?

237
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,620
Dad! Dad!

238
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,420
Don’t fuss!

239
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,980
I’ve got enough money!

240
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,540
Shall we have a formal banquet?

241
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,060
Get back to work, Dad!

242
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,580
You little cheat!

243
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,580
Mr. Zhou, let me give you a hand!

244
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,500
No, thanks.
The warehouse is filthy and chaotic.

245
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,860
I don’t mind. Come on!

246
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,860
Ai Qing,

247
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,500
have a good talk with Slide.

248
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,540
Let me know when we’re leaving.

249
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,420
Go ahead.

250
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,620
What’s wrong with your hand?

251
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,740
I...

252
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,420
What’s wrong with your hair?

253
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,260
It’s getting so long!

254
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
Wanna play a ghost with it?

255
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
You have to spend 30 minutes
on washing it, don’t you?

256
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,300
40 minutes.

257
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,260
Anyway, I don’t have to spend

258
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,420
over ten hours a day on practicing now.

259
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,460
I’m very free.

260
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,820
So, have you married someone?

261
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,180
And you?

262
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,420
Have you married someone?

263
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,420
Don’t play tricks! Answer me first!

264
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,980
I’m still single.

265
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,860
You are really a good buddy!

266
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,740
I’m single, too!

267
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,060
Come on! High five!

268
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,940
You are still a nuisance!

269
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,180
Are you all right?

270
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,300
It’s nothing.

271
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,980
What’s wrong with your hand?

272
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,300
I...

273
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,660
I fell after getting drunk in Germany.

274
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,540
You know managing a business
is not easy now.

275
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,740
I must take care of customers’ feelings.

276
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,300
It’s cool to wear a glove.

277
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,500
-So your hand...
-Sir,

278

(New Model)
could you help me with this?

279
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,820
Okay, just a second.

280
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,300
Help yourself.

281
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,500
Consider here as your home.

282
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,860
Just go to work.

283
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,740
This?

284
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,740
Let me see.

285
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,420
You didn’t put the battery in.

286
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,260
It also needs a driver.

287
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,820
Follow the instruction.

Look. This year’s competition
is approaching.

290
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,260
Yeah.

291
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,660
Our era has

292
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,100
long passed.

293
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,860
Was there a moment when you

294
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,420
suddenly missed the past?

295
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,540
Sometimes I feel

296
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,420
my old life was like a dream.

297
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,260
I had no pressure at all.

298
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,620
You know,

299
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,060
we had to train for

300
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,660
over ten hours every day.

301
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,420
We cried if we lost.
We laughed if we won.

302
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,180
It made our hot blood boil.

To tell you the truth,

304
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,940
when I was just retired,

305
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,300
I almost wasn’t able to
adapt to the society.

306
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,420
How about now?

307
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,380
I’m still trying hard.

308
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,060

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,540
Who painted it?

343
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,180
Here’s a sentence. Look!

344
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,620
“Follow your dream.

345
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,860
You’ll never be alone.”

346
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,940
It’s interesting!

347
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,780
How I envy it!

348
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,940
(Follow your dream)

349
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,340
(You’ll never be alone.)

350
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,380
Congratulations on your graduation!

351
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,300
An outstanding student of a first-class
polytechnic university.

352
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,980
One of the shareholders

353
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,340
of K&K Club.

354
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,620
Well informed!

355
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,220
Since when were you interested
in shooting?

356
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,620
Shooting is good for concentration

357
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,860
and maintaining stable mentality
in combat.

358
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,740
It’s a good place.

359
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,940
You can shoot and play games.

360
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,500
It’s light-hearted.

361
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,180
Why must you return to China?

362
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,860
You can’t give her up, can you?

363
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,020
You’ve lost contact with her for long.

364
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,260
You are so stubborn.

365
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,820
No kidding,

366
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,060
I thought you’d return home

367
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,860
as soon as your eyes were cured.

368
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,060
I was surprised that

369
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,020
you’d stay for another two years
to study.

370
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,940
I agreed with my grandpa

371
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,340
that I’d finish school first.

372
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,260
I don’t want to disappoint him.

373
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,300
Why don’t you contact her first?

374
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,060
I think I’m not good enough.

375
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,780
You are not good enough?

376
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,500
What’s the standard you strive for?

377
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,420
300 competitions.

378
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,580
I must win 300 competitions

379
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,300
before I ask her to date me again.

380
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,620
Okay. I got it.

381
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,900
See you.

382
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,820
Ai Qing.

383
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,340
You should go to supervise
the robot competition in Guangzhou.

384
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,700
But Tian Na’s been in charge of that!

385
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,460
No wonder women are
said to be troublesome!

386
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,500
She asked for leave this morning.

387
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,020
She has to return home
to get the marriage license.

388
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,620
But I...

389
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,820
Don’t say your uncle-in-law
is coming again!

390
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,700
He just left!

391
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,100
I remember it clearly.

392
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,580
Don’t make trouble!
We’re short-staffed!

393
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,540
It’s a deal.

394
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,060
Go find the secretary

395
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,980
to book your hotels and flights.

396
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,780
Tell you what,

397
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,340
our clients put great value
on this competition!

398
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,340
Many professional teams
will take part in it.

399
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,820
In addition,

400
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,460
speaking of

401
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,820
the robot competition,

402
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,500
about the teams,

403
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,700
professionals and robot models,

404
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,660
I know them all.

405
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,540
You can seek my help at any time!

406
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,260
Remember!

407
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,700
(International Arrivals)

408
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,660
What are you thinking about?

409
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,860
You’ll be away on business?

410
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,500
Where’s the destination?

411
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,060
Guangzhou.

412
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,340
Is Solo going, too?

413
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,260
Do you have a date with your ex?

414
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,740
You’re talking nonsense.

415
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,980
Good.

416
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,180
You seem like you’ve forgotten him.

417
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,700
He could seldom start over.

418
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,660
Guangzhou is a nice city, though.

419
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,060
There’re lots of delicacies.

420
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,380
Rice noodle roll, barbecued pork bun,
shrimp dumpling, water chestnut cake,

421
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,260
stir-fried rice noodles with beef,
clay pot rice, wonton noodles…

422
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,420
Sister,

423
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,300
do you want to come with me?

424
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,260
Why don’t we go together?

425
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,540
I’m going to pack up!

426
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,420
I’m in a good mood with my Appledog!

427
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,620
Excuse me, your dog needs to

428
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,180
apply for a quarantine permit.

429
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,580
We have no dog to check in.

430
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,860
Just two suitcases.

431
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,820
Okay.

432
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:20,980
Well,

433
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,500
will people still know you

434
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,060
when you show up there?

435
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,380
Think of the athletes.

436
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,140
People seldom know them after
a few years of their retirement.

437
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,300
I’m the same as them.

438
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,420
It doesn’t matter.

439
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,620
Even if you are not popular,

440
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,540
you are still my younger sister.

441
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,820
I’ll love you as always!

442
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,020
All done.

443
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:37,860
-Thank you!
-Thanks!

444
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,940
There is the departure gate.

445
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,580
(Wu Bai)

446
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,860
Didn’t the plane land already?

447
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,380
Why doesn’t Captain show up?

448
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,060
Why is it so hot?

449
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,460
I’ve booked a special car.

450
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,620
97?

451
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,220
Are you here to pick us up
or to hang out?

452
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,980
Why don’t you hold up the board?

453
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,140
Are you stupid?

454
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,700
Do you have to hold it up
when I’m standing in front of you?

455
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,980
Where’s the captain?

456
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,500
Over there.

457
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,940
Captain!

458
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,980
It’s been a long time!
I miss you so much!

459
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,340
Let’s not catch up here.

460
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,340
We need to rush to the hotel
and take a bath.

461
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,420
The weather is too hot!

462
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,540
Yeah! The car is outside!

463
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,420
You can see it when we get out.
Come on.

464
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,940
What’s wrong?
Why don’t you get on?

465
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,740
I think I just saw an acquaintance.

466
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,820
Who is it?

467
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,420
Let’s go, sir.

468
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,780
♪I trust you♪

469
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,300

♪Will you say yes tomorrow♪

475
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,220
Captain, are you suffering from
gastroenteritis again?

476
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,580
Shall we go to the hospital?

477
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,420
It’s nothing.

478
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,460
It’s seasonal.

479
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,420
I just need to take some medicine.

480
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,220
Take a break first.

481
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,980
Feel free to tell me
if you can’t stand it.

482
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,340
Captain,

483
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,900
if you want to grab a bite,
tell me, too.

484
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,780
Here we are.

485
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,940
It’s so hot!

486
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,380
I’m dying of thirst.

487
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,180
Thanks, sir!

488
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,780
What would you like to drink?
I’ll buy it for you.

489
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,740
I think there’s water in the room.

490
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,180
I can’t wait!

491
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,020
I’ll go buy some drinks!

492
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,220
I’ll wait for you at the reception.

493
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,460
Excuse me.

494
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,140
I’m too thirsty.

495
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,180
Do you like this flavor?

496
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,420
Move a little.

497
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
The same flavor.

498
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,900
I don’t owe you now.

499
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:44,860
Ai Qing! Ai Qing!

500
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,260
Then, our room...

501
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,100
You know what happened

502
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,820
when I bought drinks just now?

503
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,660
I encountered a cool man...

504
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,860
Shen Zhe! I like you so much!

505
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,300
You are so cool!

506
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,140
Well, I like you very much!

507
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,260
I really like you!

508
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,980
Thanks! Thanks!

509
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,820
I’m always right behind you!

510
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,420
I want, too! I want, too!

511
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,740
Sister, what did you say just now?

512
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,540
I’ve got to go.

513
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,460
Who is he?

514
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,620
Him?

515
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,460
He is the man who
came to the press conference.

516
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,140
Didn’t Solo just retire?

517
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,300
They said he went

518
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,140
to Solo’s last game

519
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,540
right before he retired.

520
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,780
He’s said to be
Solo’s die-hard fan!

521
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,980
We all think they seem good together!

522
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
Solo is a familiar name.

523
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,420
Maybe I know his ex.

524
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,340
Do you?

525
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,980
Is his ex pretty?

526
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,740
We only saw his daughter’s photo.

527
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,180
She’s so adorable!

528
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,260
He’s said to have her when he was young.

529
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,180
After he got divorced,

530
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,580
he became a single dad,

531
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,140
who takes care of his daughter
on his own.

532
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,300
Is the girl his ex?

533
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,180
No.

534
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,540
She is much more beautiful!

535
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,020
I’ve told you again and again.

536
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,180
Don’t make fun of Solo
and me again!

537
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,180
What’s his name?

538
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,060
Shen Zhe.

539
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,980
(Unstoppable Fighter Promising Future)
I love you, too!

540
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,700
Shen Zhe, I’m a huge fan of yours!

541
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,780
Who is he saying hello to?

542
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,660
-Could you sign this for me?
-I want it, too! I want it, too!

543
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,980
-Do you know each other?
-Please sign this for me, too!

544
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,420
Not really.

545
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,860
Don’t leave! Stay for a little while!

546
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,740
I like you so much!

547
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,420
Shen Zhe! Shen Zhe!

548
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,900
My sister is so beautiful. He must

549
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,180
fall in love with her at first sight.

550
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,660
Don’t be ridiculous!

551
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,180
Are you not thirsty now?

552
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,580
No.

553
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,260
This way, please.

554
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,140
The lounge is in front of us.

555
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,580
Please take a rest inside.

556
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,420
Thanks.

557
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,220
Please.

558
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,740
Take care!

559
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,340
Are you okay?

560
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,820
It’s no big deal.

561
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,380
Where can I change?

562
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,660
The bathroom on the first floor
is broken.

563
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,980
You can use the dressing room inside.

564
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,580
-Please go change inside.
-Go ahead and change.

565
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,420
I’m so sorry!

566
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,380
Never mind.

567
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,900
I’m really sorry!

568
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,420
I’m going to change.

569
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,540
Just go.

570
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,660
Sister.

571
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,660
Take your time.

572
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,780
I’m going to buy some food.

573
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,540
OK.

574
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,060
I’ll be back soon!

575
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,580
There’s no one here.

576
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,300
Let’s begin.

577
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,220
Of course.

578
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,700
You don’t have to record.

579
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,580
Just ask anything you want.

580
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,700
The press conference will begin soon.

581
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,660
Yeah.

582
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,020
You’re said to be contracted to
a professional club soon.

583
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,780
Yes.

584
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,180
Could you tell me

585
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,780
which team will you choose?

586
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,220
I haven’t made my decision.

587
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,300
There’re several clubs

588
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,700
which have contacted you recently.

589
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,820
But you haven’t chosen any of them.

590
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,580
Do you have other opinions?

591
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,260
I don’t think so.

592
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,420
I’m just irresolute and hesitant.

593
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,780
I just haven’t decided it.

594
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,780
Grunt, you are funny.

595
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,420
What’s your opinion about

596
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,340
Solo’s retirement?

597
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,100
As everyone knows, Solo has been

598
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,140
a legend in robot fighting.

599
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,460
He is involved in many fields,

600
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,220
and he does well in everything.

601
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:35,940
Surely,

602
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,300
people like to compare you two.

603
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,300
You’re said to join

604
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,540
a professional club to defeat him.

605
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,940
Solo

606
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,900
is like a legend.

607
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,180
But a legend will end finally.

608
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,460
In my opinion, after a player

609
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,940
served a first-class club

610
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
and left it,

611
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,580
if he couldn’t talk himself into
join a second-team,

612
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,220
he has no other choice but to retire.

613
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,420
Sure, we can’t deny that

614
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,820
over the first 10 years
when he played in China,

615
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,900
he was indeed incomparable.

616
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,460
You should write that down.

617
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,820
If I were him,

618
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,940
I would also make up my mind

619
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,180
to quit at my peak moments,

620
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,940
in order not to ruin my name.

621
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,180
Grunt, you have a harsh tongue
to yourself

622
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,180
as well as to the veterans.

623
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,060
I just told the truth.

624
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,020
Then, Grunt, over the next a few days...

625
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,220
Let’s stop here for today.

626
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,860
If you have more questions,

627
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,100
send me e-mails.

628
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,380
I’ll reply to you as soon as possible.

629
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,820
OK.

630
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,940
Thank you for your time!

631
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,780
Thank you!

632
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,100
Now, are you OK?

633
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,420
Could I

634
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,860
turn around?

635
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,820
Thank you.

636
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,980
You are a girl.

637
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,180
Why don’t you go to a lady’s room
to change?

638
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,420
The bathroom on the first floor
is broken.

639
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,780
I can’t go out in wet clothes.

640
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,660
Ai Jing!

641
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,340
Shen Zhe.

642
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,420
Sister.

643
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,940
It’s so hot outside!

644
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,340
OK.

645
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,300
I’ll talk to you later.

646
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,860
Why is he here?

647
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,900
Did he get in the wrong room?

648
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,580
Would you like to go to KTV
after the event?

649
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,300
Well,

650
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,140
it’s a leisure activity for the staff.

651
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,260
Don’t take it too seriously.

652
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,180
I don’t think we can go.

653
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,660
We need to...

654
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,220
Yes! We’d like to go!

655
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,100
It’s a long day anyway.

656
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,300
Why don’t we have some fun?

657
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,300
Good.

658
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,700
I’ll see you soon.

659
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,660
Wait for you...

660
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,460
both.

661
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,820
When did you get to know each other?

662
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,780
Just now.

663
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,820
I just left for five minutes
to go shopping.

664
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,620
Five seconds!

665
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,660
In such a short moment...

666
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,060
You guys already fell for each other?

667
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,300
We came very close.

668
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,460
Great.

669
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,020
Captain.

670
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,260
Do you feel better?

671
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,700
Yes.

672
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,340
Captain.

673
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,700
You didn’t eat anything.

674
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,580
Are you hungry?

675
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,540
Zhou Yi is so considerate.

676
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,020
He knows about your gastroenteritis.

677
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,540
He specially cooked congee for you.

678
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,220
Eat some.

679
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,700
You must eat something.

680
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,940
Thanks.

681
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,860
Captain.

682
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,460
There’re eggs, too?

683
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,020
Put them here.

684
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,180
Have you got pickles?

685
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,460
Yes. In my room.

686
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,540
But Captain doesn’t feel well.

687
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
He shouldn’t eat spicy food.

688
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,060
He shouldn’t eat it.

689
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,700
We can always eat it, can’t we?

690
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,740
Hurry. Go get it.

691
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,140
Let’s have dinner here.

692
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,820
OK.

693
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,100
I’ll get it.

694
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,020
Captain,

695
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,740
Zhou Yi is so funny!

696
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,900
We just come to play a game,

697
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,140
yet he packed all his belongings,

698
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,900
including an electric cooker!

699
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,100
Yeah.

700
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,900
He is quite considerate.

701
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,820
Captain.

702
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,460
Our team is still short of a player.

703
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,940
There is one who hasn’t signed the contract yet.

704
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,340
I’ll see him alone tonight.

705
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,540
Is it Shen Zhe?

706
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,780
People say he decides to sign with K&K.

707
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
Isn’t he back yet?

708
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,540
He should be back now.

709
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,860
The activity ended in the afternoon.

710
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,460
He must be having fun outside.

711
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,300
Captain,

712
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,820

713
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,940
Why is it still so serious?

714
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,420
My stomach hurts.

715
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,900
Even drinking water makes me throw up.

716
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,060
I’ll call a taxi

717
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,820
to send you to the hospital.

718
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,820
Go to find Shen Zhe.

719
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,340
I can go to the hospital.

720
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,020
Can you go on your own?

721
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,700
Ai Qing, why don’t you change?

722

You should go. I don’t want to go.

723
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,220
I have to work later.

724
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,020
I have to reply to an E-mail.

725
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,940

726

What?

728
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,220
You’ll get old if you go on like this.

729

852
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,700
when I mention the girl I love?

853
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,580
I’ve stayed too long

854
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,500
in my position,

855
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,580
looking at her from a distance.

856
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,940
Walk up to her, Wu Bai.

857
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,700
Walk up to her.

858
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,260
With your cured eyes,

859
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,740
take a close look at the girl you love!

860
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,980
It’s been three years.

861
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,820
I need a decent description that I’ll never

862
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,460
regret about for a change.
