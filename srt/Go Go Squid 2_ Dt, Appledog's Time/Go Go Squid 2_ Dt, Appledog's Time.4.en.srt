00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,420
Drink some water.

175
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,660
Be careful not to choke.

176
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,580
What happened to you?

177
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,620
Did you just come back
from the hospital？

178
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,620
I’m fine.

179
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,660
Hurry up.

180
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,420
It won’t be tasty when it’s cold.

181
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,620
But you...?

182
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,180
What’s wrong with you?

183
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,380
Are you feeling sick?

184
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,820
I’m fine.

185
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,980
Eat your food.

186
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,300
You don’t want to tell me?

187
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,220
Then I’ll have to guess.

188
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,340
You have

189
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,860
ARDS?

190
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,300
No.

191
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,660
Well...

192
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,340
Herpetic laryngitis?

193
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,380
Sciatica?

194
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,020
But you don’t have those symptoms.

195
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,900
Thalassemia?

196
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,260
Lupus erythematosus?

197
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,540
Aren’t you…

198
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,060
I just had gastroenteritis.

199
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,940
But it’s seasonal.

200
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,580
I’ll be fine in a few days.

201
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,820
So you got gastroenteritis.

202
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,780
But how could you blurt out

203
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,700
so many strange diseases?

204
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,980
I read them one by one from that board.

205
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,500
But luckily you told me.

206
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,820
If you still don’t tell me,

207
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,340
I was going to read tinea pedis.

208
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,660
You won.

209
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,060
It is nothing.

210
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,860
I have another trick up my sleeve.

211
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,700
What tricks are you playing?

212
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,820
Wait for me.

213
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,260
Taste it.

214
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,540
What did you add into the porridge?

215
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,180
Have a try.

216
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,020
Will I have food poisoning?

217
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,940
You’ll know when you taste it.

218
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
How’s the porridge?

219
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,260
It’s so sweet.

220
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,980
I was asking about your feelings.

221
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,460
It tastes good.

222
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,300
Well, if so, have more.

223
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,540
Are you still feeling sick?

224
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,380
I feel like throwing up when I eat.

225
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,940
Wipe it.

226
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,740
Thank you.

Bye-bye.

Are you all right?

242
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,020
I’m done with drinking.

243
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,820
I’ll go back to sleep.

244

246
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,060
that you’re okay now?

247
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,500
I’m fine. I’m amazing.

248

Do you still want to know the answer to

249

the question you asked me earlier?

250
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,820
I’ll only say this once.

251
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,340
Listen carefully.

Ai Jing.

260
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,460
Are you feeling better?

261
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,420
How do you like it?

262
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,380
The pink porridge I made
was not bad, right?

263
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,860
You’re so quiet.

264
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,300
You always say “uh” to me.

265
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,820
Do you know how many times

266
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,500
you’ve said “uh” today?

267
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,060
Twenty-three times.

268
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,420
You deliberately counted it?

269
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,340
Of course not. I’m just kidding.

270
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,860
Fine.

271
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,620
You’ve said “fine”
at least a dozen times.

272
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,860
You’re really funny.

273
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,940
Have you always been so quiet
since you were a child?

274
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,180
It depends on who I’m with.

275
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,780
Actually, I have a lot I want to say.

276
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,540
Let’s check it out.

277
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,660
I tried this candy
when I was a kid.

278
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,860
Have you had it before?

279
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,540
It has a wish note inside.

280
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,980
A wish note?

281
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,540
Here, choose one.

282
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,420
Let’s see what your wish is.

283
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,620
I see all living things are vegetation,

284
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,940
but you are the green hill.

285
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,780
What’s yours?

286
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,580
(I see all living beings without intention,
but I only fall in love with you.)

287
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,060
I see all living beings without intention,

288
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,420
but I only fall in love with you.

289
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,500
This is what’s written on the note.

290
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,620
I saw it.

291
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,100
You bought me a meal.

292
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,740
I’ll buy you candies.

293
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,620
Captain.

294
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,260
Captain. Captain. Captain.

295
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,020
Shen Zhe told me

296
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,780
that you saw Ai Qing?

297
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,220
You came back late

298
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,540
because you hung out with her?

299
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,380
Were you excited?

300
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,500
Was your blood boiling?

301
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,900
Let me listen to your heartbeat.

302
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,300
Be serious.

303
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,020
I am being serious.

304
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,060
You mean this is not serious enough?

305
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,620
I got it.

306
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,060
You want me to ask
in a more serious way?

307
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,020
Fine.

308
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,060
Where did you go on your date?

309
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,260
What did you talk about?

310
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,540
Did you enjoy the happiness of reunion?

311
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,100
How far did your relationship go?

312
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,660
Did you confess your love to her?

313
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,900
I’m talking about the Team.

314
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,020
Where is Shen Zhe?

315
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,140
He?

316
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,780
He is lying in my room.

317
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,380
He collapsed into bed
the moment he came back.

318
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,620
Now he is sleeping like a pig.

319
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,140
I’m afraid that we can’t talk tonight.

320
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,020
Have a good rest.

321
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,220
The opening ceremony
will be held tomorrow.

322
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,660
You and Ai Qing...?

323
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,780
I’m sleepy. I’m so sleepy.

324
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,260
Good night.

325
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,140
Well.

326
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,140
Wish you see her in your dream.

327
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,620
I’m back.

328
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,900
Sister.

329
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,500
Cheers.

330
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,460
(I see all living things are vegetation,
but you are the green hill.)

331
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,100
I see all living beings without intention,

332
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,020
but I only fall in love with you.

333
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,580
(I see all living beings without intention,
but I only fall in love with you.)

334
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,860
We’ll have to sleep together tonight.

335
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,380
Don’t kick me at night.

336
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,420
Go sleep on the couch.

337
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,260
This is my bed.

338
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,420
Sleep on your own bed, okay?

339
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,900
-You’re so unreasonable.
-Quiet!

340
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,540
Fine.

341
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,660
You can have it.

342
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,380
Okay.

343
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,340
Zhou Yi,

344
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,660
my bro.

345
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,380
Let’s

346
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,780
sleep together?

347
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,140
I’m still hungry.

348
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,140
Let me have more.

349
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,020
I want braised pork elbow.

350
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:21,780
Come on.

351
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,980
Are you my good bro or not?

352
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,140
I’ll go to Captain.

353
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,660
Captain.

354
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,780
You haven’t slept yet?

355
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,820
How can I sleep?

356
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,660
They took all the beds.

357
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,460
You can sleep on my bed.

358
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,900
I’ll sleep on the couch later.

359
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,060
Captain, you treat me better
than the others.

360
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,660
So much better than Shen Zhe.

361
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,260
But, today he

362
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,580
did a great thing,

363
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,260
right?

364
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,380
Again?

365
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,860
Tell me.

366
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,780
You finally met her again

367
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,300
after three years.

368
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,700
How did you feel?

369
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,380
Tell me your feelings.

370
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,140
I’m more excited than you’re.

371
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,620
It’s amazing.

372
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,900
Why?

373
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,780
Meeting her again

374
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,900
is amazing.

375
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,380
I won’t leave her this time.

376
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,660
It’s a bit cold.

377
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,220
I’ll go to bed first.

378
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,020
When did you come back last night?

379
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,140
You were so drunk.

380
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,900
Tell me first.

381
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,140
You also came back late.

382
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,620
You were so wasted,

383
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,180
(Promotion for the Opening Ceremony)
but you knew that I came back late?

384
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,500
(of Chinese Robot Fighting League)
I lost control of my body.

385
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,260
But my mind was still sober.

386
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,900
This is your home field, my Appledog.

387
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,260
But to be honest,

388
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,220
I finally understand

389
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,860
why you like robot combat so much.

390
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,740
Players are like celebrities.

391
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,500
They have millions of fans.

392
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,140
And they are technical.

393
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,300
When a familiar scene occurred again,

394
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,020
I was suddenly held back by my emotions.

395
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,940
Maybe

396
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,940
I’ve been running away from

397
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,660
my team, teammates,

398
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,380
and even my dream

399
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,540
for the past three years.

400
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,300
Wu Bai. Wu Bai. Wu Bai.

401
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,780
Wu Bai. Wu Bai. Wu Bai.

402
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,940
Good morning.

403
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,140
Good morning.

404
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,460
Hello. Hello.

405
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,860
Morning, hello.

406
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,380
Hi, are you Wu Bai from K&K Club?

407
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,580
Come with me to the lounge.

408
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,620
Please.

409
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,620
Go ahead with your work.

410
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,900
See you later.

411
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,180
See you later.

412
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,940
Hello, Mr. Lin,

413
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,780
have you arrived yet?

414
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:08,980
Come in.

415
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,500
I’m already inside.

416
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,940
You can see me
when you come to the first row.

417
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,140
-I’m at the first row right now.
-I’m here.

418
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,180
Mr. Lin.

419
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,380
Come here.

420
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,460
Mr. Lin.

421
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,060
Let me tell you.

422
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,620
This is my sister.

423
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,780
Nice to meet you.

424
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,860
In this field today,

425
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,300
we’ll see many professional players.

426
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,180
The host attaches
great importance to them.

427
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,300
You... you must concentrate.

428
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,060
Do you understand?

429
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,900
And

430
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
this row

431
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,300
sits SP Team.

432
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,140
It’s the leading team

433
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,020
in the league of professional players.

434
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,820
Ai Qing, Ai Qing.

435
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,540
Did you see what’s behind me?

436
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,500
That row is for

437
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,020
K&K Team

438
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,220
They came back from abroad.

439
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,380
Their value is extremely high.

440
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,700
I heard they opened a branch
in China this year.

441
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
Have you gathered information

442
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,180
of these professional players?

443
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,140
Answer me.

444
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,660
I knew about them.

445
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,900
Focus on it.

446
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,420
Focus... This is such a big event.

447
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,220
I understand that it’s your first time.

448
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,300
Look at this grand sight,

449
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,420
the staff,

450
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,940
and these cameras.

451
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,780
If I hadn’t given up

452
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,740
years ago,

453
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,620
I would be one of
the professional players

454
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,620
standing on the stage later.

455
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,820
See. She agrees with me.

456
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,140
I... I... I know I have the temperament.

457
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,980
Right, let’s get down to business.

458
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,140
Well... Our company...

459
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,900
uh… has spent so much effort

460
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,460
to acquire a VIP seat,

461
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,700
which will represent our company.

462
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,260
So,

463
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,940
since I am the manager

464
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,940
of our company.

465
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,540
And you...

466
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,700
You can sit here.

467
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,620
I’ll go to the back row with my sister.

468
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,700
Back row? Okay.

469
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,420
Have some drink.

470
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,140
Walk in the side lanes.

471
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,260
Don’t block the camera stand.

472
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,500
Yes, that’s right.

473
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,300
Stay calm and take a deep breath.

474
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,740
Don’t be nervous.

475
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,020
What was your colleague

476
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,700
flexing about?

477
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,700
He’s just like that.

478
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,700
I think that the way
he looks at you is strange.

479
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,020
He’s jealous of you.

480
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,460
He’s so mean.

481
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,820
He’s constantly suggesting that

482
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,740
"I’m the manager.

483
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,260
Only I’m qualified to use the VIP seat."

484
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,300
His psychological age is only ten.

485
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,820
Solo is here.

486
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,260
Nice to meet you.

487
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,300
Lin. Lin.

488
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,300
Nice to meet you, too.

489
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,020
Wu Bai.

490
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,580
When did you come back?

491
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,100
Not long ago.

492
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,700
You lead the team this time.

493
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,980
Come on.

494
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,900
You are really on time.

495
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Mr. Xiang.

496
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,900
I must come here on time for you.

497
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,660
Thanks.

498
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:06,980
Take a seat first, please.

499
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,420
Go ahead.

500
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,220
We can talk later.

501
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,220
Mr. Xiang.

502
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,540
Wu Bai, thank you for

503
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,860
coming all the way here.

504
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,940
I heard that you got gastroenteritis.

505
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,140
I feel better now.

506
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,900
That’s a relief.

507
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,660
Nice to meet you, Mr. Xiang.

508
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,020
Lin.

509
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,100
Nice to meet you, too.

510
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,060
Let me introduce.

511
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,260
This is the brand manager of

512
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,380
our host’s advertising company,

513
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,260
Lin Shan.

514
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,460
Hi, Master.

515
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,460
It’s my honor to meet you.

516
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,260
Lin.

517
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,700
They are the leaders of SP.

518
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,620
We’ve just met.

519
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,420
Why is your ex-boyfriend

520
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,860
dressed so maturely?

521
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,020
He is a boss now.

522
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,620
It seems that he’s earned a lot.

523
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,060
How do you know that?

524
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,940
I can tell from his style.

525
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,340
But looking at them,
I have to admit that

526
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,860
Wu Bai is so handsome

527
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,900
and young.

528
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,220
I feel life is good

529
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,100
when I see him.

530
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,300
You are not

531
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,860
Solo’s fan anymore?

532
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,540
You had separated for many years.

533
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Why should I like him anymore?

534
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,220
I should like my new brother-in-law.

535
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,420
New brother-in-law?

536
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,300
Who is that?

537
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,420
Ask yourself.

538
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,740
This is a difficult question.

539
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,380
I don’t know, either.

540
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,740
What a long period
without a brother-in-law!

541
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,500
Welcome to this season’s
the opening ceremony

542
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,900
of Chinese Robot Fighting League.

543
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,780
Welcome.

544
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,500
This opening ceremony

545
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,060
initiates this season.

546
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,060
It also marks the official start of

547
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,540
this season’s competitions.

548
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,300
Next, let me introduce to you the teams

549
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,340
of this season one by one.

550
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,940
In this opening ceremony,

551
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,140
we are honored to have invited

552
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,220
the leaders of two clubs.

553
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,140
Let me introduce them to you.

554
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,580
First, Bao Na, who is

555
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,740
in charge of SP Club’s
Asian-Pacific region.

556
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,220
Welcome.

557
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,300
Solo, who is in charge of
the SP Club, China.

558
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,300
Although Solo
has retired years ago,

559
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,500
the enthusiasm of his fans
hasn’t died down.

560
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,420
No wonder he has been a dominant player
in this field for ten years.

561
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,100
Next, let me introduce

562
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,580
the captain of
the newly established K&K Team,

563
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,020
DT Wu Bai.

564
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:49,700
Wu Bai, Wu Bai, Wu Bai.

565
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,860
Four years ago,

566
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,340
Wu Bai led his team

567
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,260
to the championship of China district.

568
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,220
Then,

569
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,620
they represented China and won AMC.

570
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,460
In the same year,

571
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,540
because of their amazing performance,

572
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,620
his team had the highest overall score

573
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,420
at AMC.

574
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,500
Wu Bai hit record highs
of Chinese robots

575
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,900
in combating arena

576
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,220
because of his
overwhelmingly exquisite operation.

577
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,020
Welcome back, Wu Bai.

578
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,740
It was said that SP wanted
to sign up with Wu Bai

579
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,060
three years ago
during the match in Singapore.

580
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,820
But it was dropped

581
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,340
for some reason.

582
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,660
Solo is here today.

583
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,780
Mr. Solo, can we ask you

584
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,820
what really happened back then?

585
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,820
Okay, thanks.

586
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,660
In the match in Singapore,

587
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,380
Wu Bai was the winner

588
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,260
and the best player in that season.

589
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,020
Besides SP,

590
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,300
many clubs wanted to sign him up.

591
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,700
But Wu Bai had a unique vision

592
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,100
for his future.

593
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,340
So SP respected his choice

594
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,620
and we hope Wu Bai can continue to

595
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,860
improve himself and overcome himself

596
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,020
in the future.

597
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,020
We’re rooting for you.

598
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,740
Thanks, Mr. Solo.

599
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,780
So Wu Bai is here today, too.

600
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,100
Can we invite Wu Bai to the stage

601
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,620
and answer two questions?

602
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,060
Welcome, Wu Bai, please.

603
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,380
Welcome.

604
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,220
I heard you just came back
from abroad yesterday, right?

605
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,300
Yes.

606
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,460
Before you came back,

607
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,380
many top-level clubs,

608
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,740
including Northern Europe-Giant,

609
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,180
have sent invitations to you,

610
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,980
wishing to sign you up
as their club’s captain.

611
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,420
But why did you choose to

612
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,300
stay in K&K Club, China,
which was not founded at that time?

613
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,620
Because

614
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,780
I want to establish a team
that belongs to me.

615
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,620
A team that doesn’t have a past.

616
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,620
This team’s journey
starts from the very beginning

617
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,620
and ends

618
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,060
at world championship.

637
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,980
Well, thank you, Wu Bai.

638
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,380
And we hope Wu Bai can

639
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,980
lead K&K Team

640
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,180
to win the world championship
one day.

641
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,300
Thank you, Wu Bai.

642
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,820
Appledog,

643
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,380
do you remember me?

644
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,260
I’m...

645
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:28,980
We played the match before.

646
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,260
The captain of TM Team.

647
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,340
Right, that’s me.

648
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,940
Hello.

649
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,020
Long time no see.

650
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,780
It’s been three years, right?

651
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,620
It has been a long time.

652
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,020
I haven’t heard about you
in this circle.

653
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,940
How time flies.

654
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,980
You came out, too.

655
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,900
Wu Bai.

656
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,060
The speech you gave on the stage

657
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,860
is fantastic.

658
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,540
It seems that you’ve upgraded

659
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,020
from being a nobody

660
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,860
to a respectable captain, right?

661
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,900
It’s still an armour
with catapult-launching gears?

662
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,700
Did you increase
the strength of catapult

663
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,140
or enhance the agility
of the weapons?

664
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,020
Wu Bai is always cool.

665
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,180
He doesn’t talk too much.

666
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,700
When we won the
championship in Singapore,

667
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,660
many media came

668
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,140
and asked many questions.

669
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,540
They asked what he thought about

670
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,180
the host, the match,

671
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,540
and the competitors.

672
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,460
He answered them only with two words.

673
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,100
Not bad.

674
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,020
I can understand him.

675
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,300
He is a master.
Most masters are loners.

676
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,420
Take your time.

677
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,220
I’ll host the lucky draw first.

678
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,500
See you later.

679
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,100
How about this?

680
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,540
Your preference hasn’t changed, right?

681
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,860
Thanks.

682
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,380
I wanted to treat you to a drink

683
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,700
when we were in Singapore.

684
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,220
It’s a pity that
I hadn’t had a chance.

685
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,180
Last time, when we were in Singapore,

686
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,700
I...

687
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,620
Wu Bai, the ceremony begins.

688
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,220
Ladies and gentlemen, let’s come back.

689
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,380
Go back.

690
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,020
You’re the center of attention today.

691
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,820
You came back right on time.

692
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,700
Help with the questions.

693
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,900
What questions?

694
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,740
This kid is so pitiful.

695
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,380
He answered incorrectly twice.

696
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,700
I want to help him,
but I don’t know the answers.

697
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,820
You can help him.

698
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,020
Kid.

699
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,780
You must hold a chance
to answer the next question.

700
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,180
I’ll tell you the answer.

701
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,140
Really?

702
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,260
Yes.

703
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,740
Trust me.

704
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,700
These questions are a piece of cake.

705
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,340
Can I have your autograph?

706
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,860
I don’t know you,

707
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,380
but you must be a master.

708
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,660
Next question is basic.

709
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,820
It’s a question
where you can score easily.

710
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,020
I know the answer.

711
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,380
This kid

712
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,420
had held the chance twice.

713
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,340
But he got the wrong answers twice.

714
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,660
Are you eager to get
Solo’s autograph?

715
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,620
Yes.

716
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,940
His autograph is the first prize.

717
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,780
So, to win this prize,

718
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,540
you have to answer the hardest questions.

719
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,060
You can get his autograph

720
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,220
if you answer the following questions

721
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,980
correctly.

722
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,540
Yes.

723
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,620
Please, answer.

724
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,060
How many times did Solo
win the championship?

725
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,460
Three tournament championships.

726
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,340
Two Asian invitational
tournament championships.

727
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,860
Right, you’re correct.

728
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,620
Bravo.

729
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,740
The second question.

730
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,180
It’s harder.

731
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,540
Please listen to it carefully.

732
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,380
Until now,
which player has got

733
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,820
the most wins in his career?

734
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,180
And how many times has he won?

735
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,140
Solo is the one
with the most wins.

736
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,220
How many times...?

737
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,060
How many times did he win?

738
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,460
You’ll be disqualified
if you can’t answer it.

739
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,700
Two hundred and ninety-nine wins.

740
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,940
Two hundred and ninety-nine.

741
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,500
You’re right again.

742
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,700
It seems Solo’s attraction

743
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,820
hasn’t faded after these years.

744
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,940
The third question.

745
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,220
If you’re right again,

746
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,420
you’ll get our first prize.

747
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,580
Solo once played a match
against a long-term enemy.

748
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,420
So,

749
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,980
when did he play that match?

750
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,500
Who was his enemy?

751
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,900
This question was asked on purpose.

752
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,020
No one knew it except Solo himself.

753
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,020
And this match

754
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,660
wasn’t even a formal one.

755
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,980
Sister.

756
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,380
The match against
a long-term enemy was in 2008.

757
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,460
His enemy was Nerney from Sweden.

758
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,340
The match against
a long-term enemy was in 2008.

759
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,820
His enemy was Nerney from Sweden.

760
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,540
Well,

761
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,100
I’m not sure.

762
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,620
Solo is here right now.

763
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,620
How about asking him to

764
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,060
tell us

765
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,820
if this kid’s answer is right or not?

766
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,940
To be honest,

767
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,620
I wouldn’t remember it myself,

768
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,460
if I hadn’t prepared it in advance.

769
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,260
But, congratulations!

770
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,620
You’re right.

771
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,100
Let’s congratulate this child.

772
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,980
Please claim the prize on stage.

773
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,180
Please.

774
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,500
Check out the woman sitting behind him.

775
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,020
She looks familiar.

776
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,780
Appledog.

777
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,460

why he disappeared for three years.

789
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,700
But when I see him,

790
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,940
