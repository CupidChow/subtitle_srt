Let’s have a game.

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,300
You’re going to lose badly.

21
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,740
Good.

22
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,380
Well done.

23
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,860
Come on, Lin Yin.

24
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,020
This is the person

25
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,660
that Ai Qing wants to
sign a contract with.

26
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,060
What do you think?

27
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,620
Is he good enough?

28
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,500
I trust Ai Qing’s decision.

29
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,820
You played well, Lin Yin.

30
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,740
Good.

31
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,340
You played well, too.

32
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,860
I still lost.

33
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,780
Thank you

34
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,020
for giving me this chance.

35
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,740
Tao Qitao.

36
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,540
You’ve changed.

37
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,540
Can I have a word with you?

38
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,420
You should give more attention to this.

39
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,820
Where is Ai Qing taking him to?

40
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,780
Actually,

41
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,980
Wu Bai called me.

42
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,700
We talked about where

43
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,580
Tao Qitao should go.

44
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,420
He wants SP Team II

45
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,940
to take over Taotao Team.

46
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,980
I agreed.

47
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,860
K&K just

48
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,100
gave Tao Qitao to us?

49
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,620
Well, actually,

50
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,140
Wu Bai wants to

51
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,020
help Tao Qitao fulfill his wish.

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,540
He doesn’t want his team to fall apart.

53
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,100
And

54
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,700
he can still stay in this business.

55
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,900
I hope that when Tao Qitao
joins SP Team I,

56
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,060
his teammates can have a chance

57
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,740
to get into the training camp
of SP Team II.

58
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,020
What’s the reason?

59
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,700
Tao Qitao is a very good operator.

60
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,380
Give him some time,

61
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,660
I believe he can be one of

62
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,540
the top five operators in the league.

63
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,500
Although

64
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,220
his teammates are not strong enough now,

65
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,020
I still think

66
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,260
they have the ability

67
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,540
to join the training camp of SP Team II.

68
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,060
But I heard that

69
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,300
Tao Qitao is receiving a tryout at K&K.

70
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,580
Why are you sure

71
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,940
that he will come to us?

72
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,740
K&K is growing fast.

73
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,260
But it doesn’t have the strength

74
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,420
to run two teams at the same time.

75
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,300
That’s why I believe

76
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,740
Tao Qitao will choose SP Team.

77
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,340
What’s wrong?

78
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,380
Before you knocked on the door,

79
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,540
Wu Bai just called me

80
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,220
and said the same thing as you.

81
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,460
Since Wu Bai wants us to have him,

82
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,620
then why did he

83
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,140
offer Tao Qitao a tryout at K&K?

84
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,660
He appreciates such a talent.

85
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Besides,

86
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,180
if Tao Qitao didn’t go through this,

87
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,260
I guess

88
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,180
it’s hard for him
to understand something.

89
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,580
Welcome to SP.

90
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,420
You mean...

91
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,860
This is yours.

92
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,460
You will join SP Team I.

93
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,060
The other three members

94
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,980
will join the two-month

95
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,780
training camp of SP.

96
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,100
You are saying

97
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,820
we can reunite at SP?

98
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,700
Yes.

99
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,380
But only if

100
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,340
they can stand out.

101
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,780
They can.

102
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,300
I believe they can.

103
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,500
Because they have a captain like you.

104
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,500
Hold on.

105
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,740
Most of the terms

106
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,180
of the contract are common.

107
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,300
But there are three points
that I want to mention.

108
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,100
-The terms are onerous.
-Okay.

109
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,260
Go ahead.

110
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,340
First,

111
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,380
you have to be in the top five

112
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,820
in the next five years.

113
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,100
No problem.

114
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,940
Second,

115
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,620
this is a ten-year contract.

116
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,340
A ten-year contract?

117
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,660
I’m 19 now.

118
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,300
You are saying

119
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,220
I need to stay here until I’m 29?

120
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,100
Yes.

121
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,740
What if SP goes out of business?

122
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,780
If it closes down,

123
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,580
the contract will be invalid.

124
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,100
Okay, I can do it.

125
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,460
Third,

126
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,100
the first half of the year is a tryout.

127
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,220
You are not a regular player.

128
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,540
Six-month tryout? Well...

129
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,820
Hear me out first.

130
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,100
I’ve seen a lot of amateurs

131
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,500
who didn’t perform as well as before

132
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,380
after they joined a formal team.

133
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,060
I know you’ve led a team.

134
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,700
You have some experience.

135
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,660
But your team

136
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,660
is not mature.

137
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,940
I think

138
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,860
in every game you played,

139
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,900
all the players revolved around you.

140
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,340
In the end,

141
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,100
it became your solo.

142
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,340
However,

143
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,740
I noticed that you have changed a lot

144
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,820
during these weeks
receiving training at K&K.

145
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,900
Wu Bai taught me a lot.

146
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,940
There is no solo in SP.

147
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,620
We value teamwork more.

148
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,380
These contracts

149
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,420
are decided by the managers of SP.

150
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,540
I need to be more careful.

151
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,060
I hope you can understand.

152
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,300
I understand.

153
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,140
Thank you for your understanding.

154
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,180
I want you in SP

155
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,980
because I need to
prepare captains for SP.

156
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,420
For a team,

157
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,500
the captain is its core.

158
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,020
I hope that Slide

159
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,060
can have a qualified successor.

160
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,660
Next,

161
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,940
please learn as much
as you can from Slide

162
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,580
with the attitude as a captain.

163
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,540
He has been a captain for many years.

164
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,060
He also led the Chinese team at the AMC.

165
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,740
You can learn a lot

166
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,220
from him.

167
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,420
Sign it.

168
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,220
The captain to-be.

169
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,660
Do you have any questions?

170
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,220
I have one more request.

171
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,380
Go ahead.

172
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,020
I want to be

173
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,660
bound to you in the next ten years.

174
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,620
If you leave, I will automatically
end the contract.

175
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,180
Okay.

176
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,220
Deal.

177
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,140
All right.

178
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,660
Here’s the indenture to sell myself.

179
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,460
Welcome to SP.

180
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,980
(Training Plan)

181
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,660
(Frigg)

182
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,260
You knew...?

183
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,620
You knew that I’ll keep

184
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,940
the members of Taotao Team
in SP Team II?

185
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,540
You also knew

186
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,260
that I would send Tao Qitao to SP.

187
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,220
Well?

188
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,940
I won the bet?

189
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,460
Then I’ll have a surprise for you.

190
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,180
Good.

191
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,020
I’m waiting for your surprise.

192
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,380
By the way,

193
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,380
thanks to K&K for your help.

194
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,580
It is the hallmark of K&K
to help others.

195
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,260
Okay.

196
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,500
Bye-bye.

197
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,660
Captain.

198
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,660
Tao Qitao said that he
made a successful challenge today

199
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,980
and signed a contract with SP.

200
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,020
Wu Bai.

201
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,900
You hid your true intention well.

202
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,660
What does it have to do with Captain?

203
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,500
If Tao Qitao is not here,

204
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,380
then no one would challenge Shen Zhe.

205
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,300
It’s boring if you think about it.

206
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,700
Boring?

207
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,540
The finals are coming
and you are still boring?

208
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,660
You seem to have nothing to do.

209
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,100
I’m just kidding.

210
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,940
Captain.

211
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,460
The finals are coming.

212
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,220
We don’t have a coach yet.

213
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,660
I got one. He will come tomorrow.

214
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,180
Who is it?

215
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,260
You’ll find out tomorrow.

216
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,300
I’ll go for a run.

217
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,700
Why is he keeping us in suspense?

218
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,940
Who is it?

219
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,700
This is the latest status evaluation
of the players.

220
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,860
Most of the players are making progress.

221
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,860
It’s good.

222
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,820
This is the new training plan

223
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,420
I made for them.

224
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:17,980
Slide, you are also here.

225
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,820
Sign this.

226
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,380
I mean,

227
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,380
haven’t we won the games?

228
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,340
How come you are still not happy?

229
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,580
The national finals are about to start.

230
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,460
There are too many things to do.

231
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,980
Cut it out.

232
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,140
I think you just can’t accept

233
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,540
the fact that Xiao’ai was
taken away from you.

234
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,780
Did you stay up all night again?

235
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,540
I don’t want to go home too early.

236
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,180
When I go back,

237
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,700
it feels empty.

238
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,420
I just don’t understand.

239
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,420
You and Ai Qing

240
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,780
are both unmarried.

241
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,860
Now your daughter
is living with her mother.

242
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,460
What’s standing between you two?

243
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,700
Don’t mention it again.

244
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,980
No way.

245
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,260
You can’t deprive me

246
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
of my few pleasures of gossiping.

247
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,780
Look,

248
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,460
I rarely gossip.

249
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,420
Have you finished
the training plan for SP Team II?

250
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
Have you reviewed the development plan
of the training camp?

251
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,460
When you are at work,
just focus on your work.

252
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,340
I’ll go to SP team II.

253
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,460
I’m not in a hurry. What’s his hurry?

254
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,580
Let me tell you the truth,

255
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,180
Ai Qing likes someone else now.

256
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,260
No one is better for Ai Qing
than Solo.

257
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,900
Come here. Come here.

258
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,380
Listen...

259
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,260
Can it work?

260
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,900
No problem. Just listen to me.

261
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,380
Fine.

262
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,300
Sir, here is your water.

263
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,740
What are you thinking about?

264
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,060
Do you think

265
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,980
Solo is very lonely?

266
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,460
Xiao’ai left?

267
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,820
Yes.

268
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,260
No one knows

269
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,180
when he can see his daughter again.

270
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,140
In fact, Solo

271
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,300
has been lonely these days.

272
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,060
The team and Xiao’ai

273
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,180
used to be all he had.

274
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,780
Now Xiao’ai left,

275
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,780
I think he becomes desolate.

276
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
It’s okay.

277
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,860
He still got us. We are his buddies.

278
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,300
Xiaomi retired.

279
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,700
Solo Team is dissolved in the end.

280
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,860
He didn’t say it.

281
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,540
But I know

282
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,860
it must be very hard for him.

283
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,820
Yeah.

284
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,380
I also miss the days when we

285
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,580
fought together in Solo Team.

286
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,740
We were young, foolish

287
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,940
and fearless at that time.

288
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,100
It was ten years ago.

289
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,500
Do you still remember

290
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,100
the training base of Solo Team?

291
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,020
That old house?

292
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,980
Yeah.

293
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,860
Solo bought it.

294
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,060
He bought it?

295
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,380
Is it for the new training base?

296
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,980
Perhaps.

297
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,300
Maybe he has other plans.

298
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,980
Why don’t we

299
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,820
get together tonight

300
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,100
with the former members of Solo

301
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,700
and Slide?

302
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,620
Let’s go to that old house.

303
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,540
We were planning to have
a drink together when Xiaomi retired.

304
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,420
But we haven’t done it yet.

305
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,900
Okay.

306
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,740
I also want to know

307
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,500
how Xiaomi has been doing.

308
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,540
That’s a deal.

309
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,500
I’ll arrange it.

310
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,860
Make sure you will be there on time.

311
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,140
Okay.

312
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,340
I’ll

313
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,660
go to see him.

314
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,180
Ai Qing!

315
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,620
Did Baona

316
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,740
just ask you to get together tonight?

317
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,380
Yeah.

318
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,180
Aren’t we going there together?

319
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,900
I don’t think you should go.

320
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,300
Why?

321
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,620
It’s a newly decorated house.

322
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,860
There is too much formaldehyde.

323
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,300
It’s bad for your health.

324
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,500
It’s a second-hand house.

325
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
It was decorated ten years ago.

326
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,620
It’s fine. I’ll see you later.

327
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,940
I got to go to work.

328
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,300
Your lunch is too easy.

329
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,260
I don’t need a fancy meal by myself.

330
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,460
By the way,

331
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,780
we have the wind at our back

332
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,500
to have Tao Qitao in SP.

333
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,420
It’s a good thing.

334
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,060
Maybe we should get together.

335
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,060
Since Xiaomi retired,

336
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,060
we haven’t had a drink together yet.

337
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,860
It’s true, we haven’t.

338
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,740
Why don’t we

339
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,140
find a place tonight

340
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,660
to have a good drink?

341
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,420
All right, you decide.

342
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,620
Didn’t you buy the old house

343
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,740
where Solo Team had been training at?

344
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,860
I really want to take a look there.

345
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,980
All right, let’s go there.

346
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,500
But I have a meeting this afternoon.

347
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,540
I’ll be there late.

348
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,860
I also have something to do
this afternoon.

349
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,420
Well, you can give me the key.

350
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,260
I’ll go straight there
after I finish my work.

351
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,780
You don’t need to hurry.

352
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,500
Okay, here.

353
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,540
I gotta go.

354
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,540
How did you get it?

355
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,780
A little trick,

356
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,900
and Solo offered it to me.

357
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,420
Listen,

358
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,860
remember carefully what I told you.

359
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,420
Don’t screw it up.

360
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,540
No problem. Leave it to me.

361
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,500
(Super Team)

362
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
Doggie.

363
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,980
Are you all ready? Let’s go.

364
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,740
You go ahead first.

365
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,660
What about them?

366
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,300
We are going to buy some good wine

367
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,020
and a few dishes.

368
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,780
We’ll go there later.

369
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,780
I’ll go with you.

370
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,780
No need.

371
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,020
I also ordered takeout.

372
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,900
We need someone in the house

373
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,260
or they might not know
where to deliver the food.

374
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,660
All right. Have you told Xiaomi?

375
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,540
He knew it. He will go there by himself.

376
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,140
All right, give me the keys.

377
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,020
Hurry up.

378
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,380
Okay.

379
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,260
I’ll wait for you there. I’m leaving.

380
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,500
Yes.

381
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,020
I think it needs to be changed.

382
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,420
Captain, you are back.

383
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,740
Captain.

384
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,660
You went for a run without your phone.

385
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,900
Thank you.

386
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,460
Xiaomi called you many times

387
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,620
and you missed it.

388
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,780
Then he called me.

389
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,420
What did he say?

390
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,180
He said they are going to
get drunk tonight

391
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,020
and he won’t be able to
get up early tomorrow.

392
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,780
What he promised you

393
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,020
has to wait until
the day after tomorrow.

394
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,260
Get drunk?

395
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,260
He said they are going to

396
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,020
have a party at
the former training base of Solo.

397
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,140
Ai Qing

398
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,500
and Solo will both be there.

399
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,220
This base is dangerous.

400
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,380
Is Solo making a move?

401
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,020
What?

402
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,300
Ask for the address for me.

403
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,620
What address?

404
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,540
Call Xiaomi

405
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,260
and ask him for
the address of the party.

406
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,700
Didn’t you just get back?

407
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,900
Why are you going out again?

408
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,380
Address. Address.

409
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,540
Ask for the address.

410
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,380
Solo told me the other day

411
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,620
he bought the old house where

412
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,980
Solo Team trained at ten years ago.

413
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,380
I just think

414
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,500
that a ten-year relationship

415
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,660
won’t be broken just like that.

416
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,220
Because I want to

417
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,180
give myself one more chance,

418
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,500
a chance to

419
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,580
have a fair competition with you.

420
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,500
Hello, here is your takeout.

421
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,620
It’s mine.

422
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,500
Okay, thank you.

423
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,580
You’re welcome.

424
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,900
Mission accomplished.

425
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,060
Solo.

426
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,740
I didn’t expect you to come first.

427
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,620
Baona said he wanted to
get together with our bros.

428
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,180
I didn’t know you would be here.

429
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,380
I’m also your bro.

430
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,540
Ou Qiang asked me to pick the takeout.

431
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,900
They will be here later.

432
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,940
By the way, I still have your keys.

433
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,820
Ai Qing.

434
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,180
Ai Qing!

435
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,580
Bai?

436
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,540
What are you doing here?

437
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,620
Come with me.

438
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,340
Bai.

439
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,300
Listen to me.

440
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,900
This is just

441
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,180
a reunion of the former Solo members.

442
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,660
Why can’t you just listen to me?

443
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,340
Get in the car. Come with me.

444
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,700
I told you I can’t leave now.

445
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,940
Why not?

446
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,260
Why can’t you leave today?

447
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,220
They haven’t arrived.

448
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,420
I need to wait for everyone to get here

449
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,140
and explain to them before I leave!

450
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,300
Get in the car.

451
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,220
You’re hurting me, Wu Bai!

452
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,420
Where is it?

453
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,100
Do you see the keys?

454
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,500
Stop looking for it.

455
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,420
No, it’s not mine.

456
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,180
I need to find it.

457
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,500
Get in the car.

458
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,020
Wu Bai, what’s the matter
with you today?

459
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,500
I told you it’s not mine.

460
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
I have to find it first!

461
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,140
Wu Bai!

462
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,740
You...!

463
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,420
Stop tugging me, Wu Bai.

464
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,060
You’re hurting me!

465
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,380
Are you crazy today?

466
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,420
Yeah, I’m crazy.

467
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,980
Buckle up.

468
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,060
I won’t.

469
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,820
Fine.

470
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,100
I’ll do it for you.

471
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,060
I told you I won’t.

472
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
Buckle up.

473
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,940
Do you know what that set of keys means?

474
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,500
Tell me

475
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,620
what it means.

476
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,740
In the end,

477
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,820
you just don’t trust me.

478
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,540
Wu Bai.

479
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,700
Let’s calm down.

480
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,020
You don’t need to take me home.

481
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,620
I’ll go back by myself.

482
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,420
Why are there so many hearts on it?

483
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,340
I set you as the administrator

484
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,060
for all my locks.

485
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,460
Apart from the secrets of the club,

486
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,940

00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,180
How can I get drunk

517
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,140
with the wine?

518
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,820
Ask Shen Zhe. He is professional.

519
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,620
It’s easy to get drunk.

520
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,460
One glass of this and one glass of this.

521
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,580
Mix them together.

522
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,060
You will get drunk immediately.

523
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,940
Don’t.

524
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,820
You’re going to be in danger
if you drink in this way.

525
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,420
Come on, put it down.

526
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,020
Have a glass of this first.

527
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,100
We will drink with you.

528
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,980
I... I can’t drink.

529
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,900
Drop the act.

530
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,860
Come on, cheers!

531
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,260
Why are you drinking today?

532
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,660
Yeah. Why?

533
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,340
For...

534
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,020
For our friendship.

535
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,460
Then we have to drink! Come on.

536
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,980
Cheers!

537
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,300
The second glass, drink this.

538
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,940
Come on.

539
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,540
That’s how you get drunk.

540
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,580
Will I get poisoned to have

541
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,100
these two different drinks together?

542
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,860
Are you stupid? They are alcohol.

543
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,260
I... just a little bit for me.

544
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,900
It’s enough. Enough.

545
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,980
No hurry.

546
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,780
Fine.

547
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,420
That’s all you can drink.

548
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,500
Captain can have more.

549
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,860
Drink more, Captain.

550
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,420
Have more.

551
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,940
More of it. More of it.

552
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,780
More of it. All right.

553
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,580
You are good today, Wu Bai.

554
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
The second glass.

555
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,140
Also for our friendship!

556
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,980
Cheers!

557
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,780
Cheers!

558
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,380
It’s a little spicy.

559
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,460
But it tastes good.

560
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,820
How is it?

561
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,900
Try this.

562
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,740
What’s this?

563
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,700
Captain, have some.

564
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,140
Let’s celebrate

565
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,100
the weekend in advance?

566
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,980
Okay.

567
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,300
We lost the game, but...

568
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,580
Don’t mention it.

569
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,620
But it doesn’t matter.

570
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,260
Being happy matters the most, right?

571
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,380
You have a point.

572
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,900
For happiness!

573
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,580
Happiness!

574
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,300
Have a good time!

575
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,140
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

576
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,900
It’s all in the wine.

577
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,940
It’s all in the wine.

578
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,900
Cheers.

579
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,420
I mean, why?

580
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,380
Nothing’s been going well lately.

581
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,620
It’s fine.

582
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,460
I lost the game.

583
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,780
And my relationship is not going well.

584
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,420
Ai Jing quarrels with me all the time.

585
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,380
You know?

586
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,620
A little quarrel in three days,
a big fight in five days.

587
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,340
It’s eating me alive!

588
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,820
Has the place of K&K

589
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,740
been cursed?

590
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,620
I mean, you all have fights.

591
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,100
What do you mean
that we all have fights?

592
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,780
Isn’t it just me?

593
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,220
When did they have a fight?

594
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,300
Yeah.

595
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,380
They flirt in front of me all the time.

596
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,100
They are like this, and like this.

597
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,140
I don’t understand anyway.

598
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,980
I don’t have a girlfriend.

599
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,260
I can’t understand.

600
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,460
97.

601
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,060
You’re the best.

602
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,900
Best brothers for life!

603
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,300
Cheers!

604
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,780
Aren’t you supposed to drink with me?

605
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,460
Don’t talk. Hold on.

606
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,460
Empty it.

607
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,780
Empty it, all right?

608
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,700
Listen, I’ve had

609
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,460
a new product recently.

610
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,460
Spaceship

611
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,700
97.

612
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,220
I invite you to

613
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,460
explore Pluto together.

614
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,100
Okay?

615
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,060
No problem.

616
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,660
Let’s go!

617
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,380
Hold on.

618
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,900
Let me adjust the seat back for you.

619
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,860
Okay.

620
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,140
-Come on.
-Let’s go.

621
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,700
We are inside.

622
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,660
Buckle up.

623
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,940
Buckle up.

624
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,340
Get ready.

625
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,860
Come on, 1, 2, 3.

626
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,620
Let’s go!

627
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,820
Wait a minute!

628
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,060
I think at such a time,

629
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,260
we can’t forget

630
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,460
our good friend, Wu Bai.

631
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,300
Wu Bai.

632
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,900
I think I need to take you with me.

633
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,060
If you don’t come with me...

634
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,660
Over here. Over here.

635
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,340
Come on, Captain.

636
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,900
Best brothers for life.

637
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,300
Wait a minute.

638
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,100
It’s two-seat.

639
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,620
Yeah.

640
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,500
It’s two-seat.

641
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,380
Next time.

642
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,580
Captain, we...

643
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,700
We’ll go first.

644
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,900
I’ll pick you up later.

645
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,180
We’ll go first, okay?

646
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,100
Be safe.

647
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,540
Get ready!

648
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,740
1, 2, 3.

649
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,580
Let’s go!

650
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,700
Slow down, 97.

651
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,860
It’s the slowest speed.

652
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,340
The slowest... why am I so dizzy?

653
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,860
Don’t vomit on my spaceship.

654
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,100
Full speed ahead!

655
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,180
(Ai Qing)

656
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,340
Ai Qing, I’m leaving!

657
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,180
I’m going out for a tour today.

658
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,060
I’m not coming back tonight.

659
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,460
Did you eat all of it?

660
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,340
It was expired two months ago!

661
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,980
I have a stomachache, Jing.

662
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,180
My God. What happened?

663
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,300
What’s wrong?

664
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,740
You are causing trouble for me.

665
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,780
Why did you eat expired food?

666
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,460
Why did you put

667
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,940
expired food in the fridge?

668
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,460
I don’t have time to care about it.

669
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,380
How are you now?

670
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,700
My stomach hurts.

671
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,620
I’ll get a car to the hospital now.

672
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,900
I’ll call Wu Bai.

673
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,340
Jing.

674
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,900
Don’t call him.

675
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,660
Don’t call him.

676
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,740
All right, boss.

677
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,540
I’ll take you there.

678
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,180
Can you get up?

679
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,060
I can’t.

680
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,140
Come on.

681
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,580
See it by yourself.

682
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,100
Captain.

683
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,060
I washed these yesterday.

684
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,900
These haven’t been washed today.

685
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,660
Is there a problem?

686
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,300
But these are not used.

687
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,580
These are not used for a whole day.

688
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,380
If someone ignores you for a day,

689
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,740
will you be lonely?

690
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,420
I just want to wash it, so what?

691
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,420
How long

692
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,940
has he been sick?

693
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,420
Since this morning.

694
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,380
He cleaned the whole upstairs.

695
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,620
You didn’t see it.

696
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,940
Even the shower drain is shiny.

697
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,300
That’s good.

698
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,700
Hush.

699
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,620
Bai.

700
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,540
Could you wash this for me?

701
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,060
I’ll do it.

702
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,020
Let me do it.

703
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,580
Captain.

704
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,100
There are also socks upstairs.

705
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,380
I mean, you had a fight.

706
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,380
You didn’t do anything
to your boyfriend,

707
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,940
but you got yourself on a drip.

708
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,020
Jing, stop nagging me.

709
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,140
My stomach still hurts.

710
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,660
You are too miserable now.

711
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,380
Why don’t you just surrender?

712
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,460
He started it out of nowhere.

713
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,140
What should I surrender?

714
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,460
No way, you’re like this now.

715
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,300
How can he still enjoy his time?

716
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,020
Jing, where are you going?

717
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,420
I’ll go out. Don’t care about me.

718
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,380
Coming.

719
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,780
You just left.

720
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,380
What did you forget...?

721
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,180
Slide?

722
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,220
Why are you here?

723
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,380
I heard that you are off sick.

724
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,620
I came to take a look.

725
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,900
Come in.

726
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,820
It’s nothing.

727
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,180
I ate some expired food.

728
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,740
I got food poisoning.

729
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,380
Have a seat.

730
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,460
Well, are you feeling better now?

731
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,460
I was put on a drip.

732
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,660
I’m better.

733
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,380
When we got to the old house yesterday,

734
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,940
Solo said you left earlier.

735
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,460
What happened?

736
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,780
Wu Bai showed up suddenly.

737
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,060
In fact, Baona

738
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,340
wanted to fix you up with Solo.

739
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,780
What are you saying?

740
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,700
The truth is...

741
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,060
I got to go. See you later.

742
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,220
I’m leaving.

743
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,020
Actually, it was arranged by Baona.

744
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,700
The purpose is to...

745
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,620
Why didn’t you tell me?

746
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,780
I know you too well,

747
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,020
how should I tell you?

748
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,660
You would die of embarrassment.

749
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,180
You should tell me if you know me!

750
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,580
If you tell me, I wouldn’t go.

751
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,940
Fine, it’s my fault.

752
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,460
All right?

753
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,580
You seem to be fine now.

754
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,940
I’ll go back to SP.

755
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,180
Don’t worry about the team. I got it.

756
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,380
Have a good rest.

757
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,300
Have some good rest.

758
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,060
I’m leaving. Bye.

759
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,420
Take care.

760
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,380
Goodbye.

761
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,420
It turns out that jealousy
is combustible.

762
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,820
It can burn sanity out in an instant.

763
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,540
It made me become a different person

764
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,620
that I can’t recognize.

765
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,460
It’s the first time I’ve seen

766
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,820
such an anxious and impulsive Wu Bai.

767
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,580
He put his emotion out there.

768
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,340
But after the amazement and confusion,

769
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,460
I suddenly want to give him a hug.

770
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,380
Maybe I should say thanks to him.

771
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,300
Because he showed me his most real side.

772
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,860
There is no more courtesy

773
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,300
and act between us.

774
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,500
So it brought us the harm
that only happens

775
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,700
between loved ones.

776
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,780
Compared to the image of
a Prince Charming,

777
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,220
perhaps

778
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,620
this pouty young man

779
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,300
is closer to me.
