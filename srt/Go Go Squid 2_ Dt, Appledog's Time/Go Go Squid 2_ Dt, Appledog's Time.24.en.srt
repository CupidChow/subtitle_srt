19
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,300
Hey, sister.

20
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,820
I won’t be home for dinner tonight.

21
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,580
On a date?

22
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,300
Well, it’s the All-star Game tomorrow,

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,940
I want to go to cheer for him.

24
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,980
No public or private,

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,620
you’re still thinking
about your boyfriend, right?

26
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,220
All Right, skip the jokes.

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,500
I’m hanging up.

28
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,460
Bye-bye.

29
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,780
Why are you alone today?

30
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,620
Where are they?

31
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,700
They’re out.

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,620
The game is coming up.

33
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,820
How are you and Shen Zhe prepared?

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,220
I’m okay.

35
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,580
I don’t know about him.

36
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,700
I heard from my sister.

37
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,780
He’s on fire.

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,380
Anyway,

39
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,940
go for it!

40
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,540
The game is coming up.

41
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,740
Who do you want to win,

42
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,900
me or Solo?

43
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,580
I...

44
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,700
I forgot.

45
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,540
We said no work talk.

46
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,500
Now,

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,820
Ai Qing, the leader of SP, is off duty.

48
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,540
Sitting in front of you

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,380
is your girlfriend.

50
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,420
I want you to win.

51
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,540

(All-star Game)

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,380
Later,

56
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,820
I will attack at the beginning.

57
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,700
Good tactics!

58
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,940
Solo and I both need time

59
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,140
to get our mecha fully operational.

60
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,140
I’m not targeting you.

61
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,100
No matter what,

62
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,740
I will target you anyway.

63
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,300
There are no teammates in the melee.

64
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,140
Besides,

65
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,940
I had waited so long for this day.

66
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,420
I must compete with him

67
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,620
face-to-face.

68
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,580
Don’t be too careless.

69
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,420
He’s no picnic to deal with either.

70
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,900
Don’t worry.

71
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,540
Trust me.

72
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,540
The game is about to begin.

73
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,780
Please get ready.

74
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,260
I need to use the toilet.

75
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,260
(Mecha)
Wow, it’s amazing!

76
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,580
I never thought

77
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,740
I’d see Solo playing

78
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,500
(Robot Fighting All-star Game)
after all these years.

79
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,220
(Commentary)
He’s really going to make a comeback?

80
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,940
In fact,

81
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,900
if he really can successfully defeat

82
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,420
Wu Bai and Shen Zhe today.

83
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,700
Then what he will do next

84
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,340
is a matter of course.

85
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,660
Yeah, that makes sense.

86
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,580
I need to use the toilet.

87
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,060
Seven.

88
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,740
You’ve used the toilet for seven times.

89
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,540
I will wash my hands again.

90
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,420
I didn’t think you’d make it.

91
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,940
Because I want to

92
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,660
give myself another chance.

93
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,020
A chance for what?

94
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,780
A chance to

95
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,780
compete fairly with you.

96
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,220
The game starts!

97
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,820
Let’s bring in our three players.

98
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,100
He looks so handsome today.

99
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,060
(Robot Fighting All-star Game)

100
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,900
After so many years,

101
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,620
it’s really touching

102
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,500
to see Blade Point again.

103
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,580
And we can see that

104
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,980
Solo is back in

105
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,660
the uniform of Solo Team again.

106
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,180
Yeah, that’s Blade Point,

107
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,660
(Commentary)
the one that used to

108
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,300
fight its way out.

109
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,420
Indeed, it’s also the Blade Point

110
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,580
that gives other teams nightmares.

111
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,860
Blade Point is the originator of the

112
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,100
offset transversely rotating robot
in our country.

113
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,820
Up to now in the domestic big forums,

114
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,500
(Blade Point Offset transversely rotating mecha)
its some internal designs

115
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,020
(Owner: Solo)
are the hot spots.

116
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,940
But it’s also

117
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,500
something that worries me a lot.

118
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,340
First, its whole design

119
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,260
is clear.

120
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,300
Second,

121
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,860
Solo hasn’t played for so many years,

122
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,060
could he handle the game?

123
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,300
Personally,

124
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,140
I can’t be sure.

125
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,260
We can see these

126
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,300
in the game later.

127
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,380
97.

128
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:48,860
Come on, come on.

129
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,980
It’s starting.

130
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,020
I’m coming, I’m coming, I’m coming.

131
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,580
Come on, pick them up.

132
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,180
That’s too much.

133
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,820
That’s too much even for a movie.

134
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,660
It’s more interesting than a movie.

135
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,820
It’s such an Arena.

136
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,060
Everyone, welcome to

137
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,540

(Commentary)
Blade Point, stand by.

140
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,140
Blade Point is ready.

141
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,660
Trash Can, stand by.

142
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,540
(Trash Can)

143
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,380
Trash Can is ready.

144
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,860
The Nobody, stand by.

145
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,140
The Nobody is ready.

146
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,900
The game is about to begin.

147
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,140
Three.

148
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,220
Two.

149
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,220
One.

150
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,860
Game on.

151
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,940
We see The Nobody

152
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,300
rushing towards the Blade Point.

153
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,260
It’s trying to get a head start

154
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,420
before the Blade Point
reaches full rotation.

155
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,820
Wait a minute.

156
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,780
Why is it the Trash Can?

157
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,620
Well, a fan, I guess.

158
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,540
Shen Zhe is said to be

159
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,420
a fan of Solo.

160
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,020
Why does he seem to turn his gun?

161
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,860
Solo gives no chance.

162
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,380
Shen Zhe doesn’t give up.

163
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,100
He’s desperately chasing
the Blade Point,

164
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,220
as if shouting,

165
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,540
“Don’t go! I’m your fans!”

166
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,140
What’s Shen Zhe doing?

167
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,260
It’s gone from two armies

168
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,180
to Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

169
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,620
Why did he hit Captain?

170
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,740
He wants a one-on-one with Solo.

171
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,780
Shen Zhe is so fierce today.

172
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,300
Is our boss okay?

173
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,180
Don’t worry.

174
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,580
When Solo was in the melee,

175
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,180
he was playing with bumper cars.

176
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,020
Yeah.

177
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,060
Besides,

178
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,900
fighting robots

179
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,860
can’t win by only being fierce.

180
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,580
With the way he’s playing today,

181
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,820
he’ll get his ass kicked.

182
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,820
Shen Zhe’s tactics...

183
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,180
But,

184
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,980
it’s really a fantastic show.

185
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,700
Wei Quan, look.

186
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,060
Trash Can is all over the place.

187
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,620
But in this case,

188
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,220
it also brings a lot of trouble

189
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,500
to The Nobody who needs to

190
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,900
grasp the time and angle to attack.

191
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,500
No, it shouldn’t be like this.

192
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,300
No one can benefit from it.

193
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,220
Then,

194
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,420
they have to rely on attack intention
to fight for points.

195
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,700
Shen Zhe fights too hard today.

196
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,980
(Trash Can)

197
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,580
-Trash Can hits the trap.
-Wu Bai, hide!

198
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,660
It bounces off into The Nobody.

199
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,860
The Nobody is blown away.

200
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,180
Solo, amazing block out!

201
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,180
He caught Shen Zhe’s fault

202
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,860
and once again knocked Trash Can into
The Nobody.

203
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,180
Yeah.

204
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,940
The Nobody gets into trouble

205
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,820
with Trash Can.

206
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,100
Trash Can hurt The Nobody so bad.

207
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,260
Its ejection board can’t be withdrawn.

208
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,620
Killed two birds with one stone.

209
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,540
Solo, good job!

210
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,660
(Trash Can)

211
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,380
K.O.!

212
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,540
It’s a K.O.

213
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,020
Trash Can is out.

214
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,620
Remember what I told you?

215
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,420
This guy’s too rampant.

216
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,060
Give him a lesson today.

217
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,700
Now

218
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,740
it’s a game between Boss and Idol.

219
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,980
How to fight now?

220
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,300
Boss will be fine.

221
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,620
Wu Bai isn’t as reckless as Shen Zhe.

222
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,620
Next,

223
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,740
It depends on how Boss handles it.

224
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,660
In this game, Shen Zhe

225
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,740
played too impatiently.

226
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,060
And he disrupted

227
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,820
Wu Bai’s attack rhythm.

228
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,820
Yeah.

229
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,980
Please! No!

230
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,260
It’s not just on the field now,

231
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,540
our base will also be in a bloody war.

232
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,380
It’s okay.

233
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,180
All-star Game.

234
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,580
It’s just for fun.

235
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,300
Yeah, right.

236
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,420
This time it’s personal.

237
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,300
We can see that

238
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,460
Shen Zhe’s friendly fire

239
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,860
did a lot of damage to The Nobody.

240
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,940
It hasn’t recovered yet.

241
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,060
The Nobody without catapult

242
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,540
is like a fighter without a weapon.

243
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,180
The Nobody used the field facility

244
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,740
to reset the weapon.

245
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,260
Nice!

246
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,180
Blade Point’s weapon stopped spinning.

247
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,620
Blade Point rushed towards the mechanism

248
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,980
on the other side of the field.

249
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,060
What is he doing?

250
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,580
Was he stunned?

251
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,060
Am I reading too little into this game?

252
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,820
I don’t understand.

253
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,660
What is this?

254
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,300
Boss, it’s dangerous.

255
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,140
It’s suicide!

256
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,660
He’s using inertia

257
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,340
to get the weapon back online.

258
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,740
Can this work?

259
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,820
There should be a 70% chance.

260
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,060
He can pull it off.

261
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,460
Blade Point is now using the trap

262
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,860
to restore the rotation of the weapon.

263
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,420
Yes.

264
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,060
That’s Solo’s strength.

265
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,500
He’s still got it.

266
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,420
Yes!

267
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,740
Now it’s up to Solo or Wu Bai

268
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,420
to win the night.

269
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,820
They are still putting out feelers.

270
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,620
But both sides

271
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,420
are now scarred.

272
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,860
Wu Bai’s strategy can be said to be

273
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,180
very clear.

274
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,300
He wants to use impact

275
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,860
to force the weapons of Blade Point

276
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,260
to slow down.

277
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,740
Wu Bai’s strategy worked.

278
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Blade Point’s weapons were
once again paralyzed.

279
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,980
The Nobody took the chance

280
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,060
and rushed towards Blade Point.

281
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,980
(The Nobody)

282
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,100
Oh, my God.

283
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,180
What is this?

284
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,500
The Nobody and Blade Point.

285
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,060
You’re going to die together?

286
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,300
Please show the mobility.

287
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,100
Ten.

288
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,740
Nine.

289
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,780
Eight.

290
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,860
Seven.

291
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,860
Six.

292
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,060
Five.

293
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,580
Four.

294
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,300
Three.

295
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,300
Two.

296
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,500
One.

297
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,540
Game over.

298
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,500
Can our captain win?

299
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,660
I don’t think so.

300
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,540
The Nobody got hurt too bad.

301
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,180
I think Solo wins.

302
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,700
The Nobody was damaged too badly.

303
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,140
But finding that trap
also brought a lot.

304
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,420
Based on the damage alone,

305
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,300
our boss should have won.

306
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,660
From the result,

307
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,700
we can see that

308
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,780
they are

309
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,140
really neck and neck

310
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,300
in strength.

311
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,420
What’s the result?

312
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,900
Let’s take a look at the big screen.

313
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,260
In terms of attack intent,

314
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,740
(Scores)
Wu Bai, three points.

315
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,300
Solo, two points.

316
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,460
In terms of control,

317
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,500
Wu Bai, three points.

318
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,260
Solo, two points.

319
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,620
In terms of damage,

320
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,180
Wu Bai, one point.

321
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,980
Solo, four points.

322
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,140
Final score.

323
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,020
Wu Bai, seven points

324
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,580
Solo, eight points.

325
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,940
Solo wins by a nose.

326
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,780
Yes!

327
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,900
I told you our boss could win.

328
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,740
Blade Point is back in business.

329
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,940
Let’s once again witness
Solo’s demeanor.

330
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,140
I told you our boss could win.

331
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,820
Hooray, Boss!

332
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,780
One point, only one point.

333
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,020
We won the All-star Game.

334
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,180
Yes!

335
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,420
Wu Bai.

336
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,860
I’m sorry.

337
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,980
I didn’t mean to affect you.

338
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,580
Guys.

339
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,660
Great game.

340
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,140
(Frigg)

341
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,460
Hey, where are you?

342
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,500
Ai Qing.

343
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,220
Why didn’t you answer my phone?

344
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,700
Will you leave me?

345
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,740
What are you talking about?

346
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,620
Of course I wouldn’t.

347
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,820
Don’t worry.

348
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,140
No matter what happens,

349
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,420
I won’t leave you.

350
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,060
My bravery is always late.

351
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,340
Killed two birds with one stone.

352
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,980
Solo, good job!

353
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,740
In this game, Shen Zhe

354
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,860
played too impatiently.

355
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,260
And he disrupted

356
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,460
Wu Bai’s attack rhythm.

357
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,180
It’s a K.O.!

358
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,620
(Trash Can)
Trash Can is out!

359
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,500
Shen Zhe is a useless piece of shit.

360
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,140
Shen Zhe has nothing but a face.

361
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,300
The K&K Club

362
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
is supported by Wu Bai alone.

363
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,060
Shen Zhe’s has brought
Wu Bai into trouble.

364
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,900
(Solo won the comeback,
defeated the K&K twins easily.)

365
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,820
Why are you here?

366
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,660
I didn’t know you would

367
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,060
hide here alone like a little kid.

368
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,420
I’m not a little kid.

369
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,460
I’m just a loser.

370
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,860
I’m not in the mecha circle.

371
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,540
I don’t know what

372
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,620
a loser or a winner is.

373
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,900
All I know is that in my heart,

374
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,460
you’re the best.

375
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,820
Don’t you think I messed it up today?

376
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,660
You know what I like about you?

377
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,380
What?

378
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,420
You’re really cute with your low EQ.

379
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,820
Are you discouraging me,

380
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,620
or encouraging me?

381
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,380
So it’s really cute

382
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,540
how you chase your dreams

383
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,220
at all costs.

384
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,220
Don’t care about the comments.

385
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,660
Those comments made me angry.

386
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,780
They know nothing about you.

387
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,660
No matter what,

388
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,140
I will be by your side.

389
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,540
Shen Zhe hasn’t come back yet.

390
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,180
Will something happen at this late hour?

391
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,260
I don’t think so.

392
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,980
He is not a kid.

393
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,220
But it’s all over the Internet.

394
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,700
What if

395
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,300
he takes things too hard?

396
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,300
How about giving him a call?

397
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,620
Okay.

398
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,020
Shen Zhe, where were you?

399
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,900
What took you so long?

400
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,980
Are you all right?

401
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,660
Are you hungry?

402
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,740
I made you braised pork.

403
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,580
Your favorite.

404
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,940
Give you some?

405
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,740
Braised pork.

406
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,140
Where’s the pork?

407
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,900
Here. Your favorite braised pork.

408
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,060
Try it.

409
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,500
Slow down.

410
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,340
No hurry.

411
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,780
Would you like some water?

412
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,740
Well...

413
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,380
It’s no big deal.

414
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,340
Don’t pay too much attention
to online comments.

415
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

416
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,340
It doesn’t matter.

417
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,980
They’re right.

418
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,500
You don’t have a fever, do you?

419
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,300
Slow down. There’s plenty.

420
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,860
You’re full?

421
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,380
Where are you going?

422
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,740
Go to review.

423
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,940
So fast.

424
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,340
Bai, talk to Shen Zhe to guide him.

425
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,340
Okay.

426
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,260
Have some fruit.

427
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,740
You’re not in K&K?

428
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,940
It’s none of your business.

429
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,540
Look at you.

430
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,700
Anything else?

431
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,740
It’s getting late in China.

432
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,220
Go to bed early.

433
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,300
Aren’t you going to scold me?

434
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,980
About what?

435
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,580
Being weak or hot-headed?

436
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,780
I told you.

437
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,980
We guys

438
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,100
are not easy to deal with,

439
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,500
let alone Solo.

440
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,860
He’s a lion.

441
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,740
If you provoke him,

442
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,500
he’ll gnaw you and
there are no bones left.

443
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,980
And remember.

444
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,740
If there is any conflict within K&K,

445
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,100
resolve it as soon as possible.

446
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,060
If you can’t handle this little thing,

447
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,300
you’re done.

448
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,980
Okay.

449
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
I’m done. You’re back as captain.

450
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,380
Solo was back.

451
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,460
Why don’t you come back, too?

452
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,660
Han?

453
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,180
He’s not mad at you for dissing him?

454
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,300
He’s used to it.

455
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,660
The All-star Game will not count

456
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,900
in the official points of the League.

457
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,020
Losing

458
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,180
is an accumulation of experience.

459
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,420
And you see,

460
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,860
through this game,

461
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,300
Shen Zhe realized his weakness.

462
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,180
For K&K,

463
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,940
this is also a good thing.

464
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,940
I’m sure

465
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,100
K&K will do better next time.

466
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,260
I know.

467
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,500
You know?

468
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,460
You’ve figured all this out already,
right?

469
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,620
I still comfort you all the time.

470
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,340
You...

471
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,060
What’s the matter with you?

472
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,540
Are your eyes bothering you again?

473
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,140
No.

474
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,980
Maybe because of low blood pressure,

475
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,580
I lost my footing.

476
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,020
Are you sure you’re all right?

477
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,740
Don’t lie to me.

478
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,100
Yeah.

479
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,540
Look at me.

480
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,220
I’m fine.

481
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,660
That’s good.

482
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:23,740
(Trash Can)

483
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,660
Look, it meant that

484
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,420
you could play like this.

485
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,940
Not necessarily in this way.

486
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,540
At this time, the speed was
obviously too fast,

487
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,020
and then the chassis is unstable.

488
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,060
Always be there for you.

489
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,460
The conspiracy theorists,
come out to apologize!

490
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,820
Not afraid of opponents like gods,

491
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,180
but teammates like pigs.

492
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,500
Wu Bai.

493
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,620
How can you still take responsibility

494
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,300
for Shen Zhe at such a time?

495
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,460
This is obviously his fault.

496
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,620
It was a one-way street,

497
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,380
but this is how it ended.

498
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,700
(Phase 2)

499
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,340
Wake up and eat.

500
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,820
Qitao, have some food.

501
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,580
I saw your game with Solo.

502
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,180
Don’t rub it in.

503
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,300
Qitao, try this.

504
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,580
Golden shrimp dumplings.

505
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,660
These dumplings are very fresh,

506
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,340
with one shrimp in each.

507
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,460
Yeah, come on.

508
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,060
We can’t talk about it after dinner?

509
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,660
Yeah.

510
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,180
My mom always told me that

511
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:01,700
eating

512
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,300
is the most important thing in life.

513
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,580
Solo’s obviously
done some research on you.

514
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,220
But you underestimated Blade Point

515
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,340
because he’s retired for many years.

516
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,220
Everyone can make an afterthought.

517
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,300
Why not propose solutions?

518
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,940
If you trust me,

519
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,060
I can turn my Sea Breeze into
composite aircraft.

520
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,580
Master attacks and
submachine interferes.

521
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,860
Then you can catch your opponent

522
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,420
by surprise.

523
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,420
You’re taking your mecha apart?

524
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,780
As long as the team wins,

525
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,300
it’s secondary.

526
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,580
You want me

527
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,820
to be your vice operator?

528
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,700
I can be yours.

529
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,820
Eat, eat.

530
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,660
You have energy when you’re full.

531
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,460
Captain’s so bossy. Look.

532
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,180
What?

533
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,220
Shen Zhe was only implementing my
pre-game strategy,

534
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,420
and there is no so-called
conspiracy theory.

535
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,860
It’s all because of me.

536
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,540
Thank you for your concern.

537
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,220
What does this mean?

538
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,460
Wu Bai took the initiative
to take responsibility

539
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,060
to help Shen Zhe relieve the pressure
of public opinion.

540
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,220
Wow, Wu Bai.

541
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,220
Come on.

542
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,140
Get our great captain

543
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,100
down here for dumplings.

544
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,820
Okay.

545
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,820
I’ll go.

546
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,580
Come in.

547
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,940
Captain, time to eat.

548
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,620
Wasn’t the selection finished yesterday?

549
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,860
Why not stay for two more days?

550
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,660
I came back overnight.

551
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,620
I still want to train here.

552
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,820
How’d it go?

553
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,540
There’s still no team to take them in.

554
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,820
I watched the All-star Game.

555
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,340
I just mentioned to Shen Zhe that

556
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,180
I would like to change my Sea Breeze

557
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,380
into composite aircraft to enhance
combat effectiveness.

558
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,780
If he controls the Master,

559
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,660
I can be his vice operator.

560
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,940
Shen Zhe agreed?

561
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,380
No.

562
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,580
I know what you’re thinking.

563
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,500
It is easier to modify the mecha

564
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,940
than to change the play.

565
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,300
But this involves

566
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
the cooperation of two people after all.

567
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,780
Well,

568
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,980
I’ll have 97 and Zhou Yi

569
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,740
to estimate the difficulty.

570
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,580
If possible,

571
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,140
I’ll arrange for you to do
the drill with Shen Zhe.

572
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,860
If it’s too hard,

573
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,660
I don’t recommend you
sacrifice your mecha.

574
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,780
You’ve got a three-week trial training.

575
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,540
Any ideas?

576
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,620
During my three weeks at K&K,

577
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,060
I really learned a lot.

578
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,820
In the past,

579
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,620
I thought that if I was strong enough,

580
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,020
I could take my brothers to fight on.

581
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,900
But I ignored that

582
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,380
if I didn’t help them grow up together,

583
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,860
we’d just end up apart.

584
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,340
You found the problem.

585
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,620
Yes.

586
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,820
But I can’t

587
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,340
part with my brothers

588
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,020
now.

589
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,180
Here is a suggestion.

590
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,420
What?

591
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,780
Go to SP.

592
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,020
But the head of SP

593
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,660
has already rejected me once.

594
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,580
She turned you down three weeks ago,

595
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,060
but she may not turn you down now.

596
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,780
Qitao.

597
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,860
Thank you for your willingness to

598
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,180
sacrifice your mecha for K&K’s victory.

599
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,140
I’m also touched by your dedication
to your team,

600
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,140
which reminds me of the Solo Team.

601
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,620
But we must believe that

602
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,820
no cohesive team

603
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,780
should be disbanded.

604
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,540
Anyone who loves mecha

605
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,540
has the right to chase the dream.

606
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,580
Thank you.

607
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,220
Okay, let’s go eat.

608
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,220
You’re not here

609
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,620
as a lobbyist for Tao Qitao, are you?

610
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,300
97 and Zhou Yi

611
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,860
just saw the upgrade project
of Sea Breeze.

612
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,580
It’s difficult.

613
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,420
So I said.

614
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,620
Tao Qitao’s idea

615
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,780
is obviously whimsical.

616
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,020
Besides, I’ll not take his mecha apart

617
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,980
just to win.

618
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,300
I hate owing favors.

619
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,180
You know what?

620
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,900
Tao Qitao didn’t submit resumes
for himself.

621
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,940
That’s for the old teammates to find
a new home.

622
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,820
He also accompanied them
to the interviews,

623
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,100
but failed.

624
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,860
Then why didn’t he tell me?

625
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,580
I... I know so many giants.

626
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,660
It’s not a problem

627
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,220
to just take in one or two players.

628
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,860
He didn’t tell me.

629
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,780
I’m asking for him now.

630
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,060
I have plans.

631
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,980
You want him to go to SP, right?

632
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,380
Every year, SP will take in

633
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,460
many second-team players
as a talent reserve.

634
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,620
And they have the most
comprehensive training system.

635
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,100
Taotao Team’s members are very young.

636
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,300
In two years, they have the opportunity

637
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,740
to promote to the top team.

638
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,580
Yeah, that’s right.

639
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,860
But the key is

640
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,380
Tao Qitao’s strength is so strong.

641
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,980
If he goes to SP,

642
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,260
SP’s strength will be even stronger.

643
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,300
Then it will be a lot harder for us

644
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,100
to beat SP.

645
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,940
You finally admit that
Tao Qitao is strong.

646
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,460
Anyway, he is a lot worse than me.

647
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,260
I... I think

648
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,180
he is a nice guy, so I want to help him.

649
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,900
I want to keep him, too.

650
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,780
But as far as K&K’s current situation
is concerned,

651
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,980
it’s not a good fit for his entire team.

652
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,940
Besides,

653
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,020
we still have you.

654
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,020
Did you send Tao Qitao
for a trial training

655
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,860
to stimulate me?

656
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,100
I just tried to get you

657
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,460
to learn from each other.

658
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,300
You schemed against me!

659
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,100
Thank you.

660
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,500
And,

661
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,780
I’m sorry.

662
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,340
Yesterday, you lost because of me.

663
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,260
It’s okay.

664
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,220
Let’s all pull together.

665
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,620
Okay.

666
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,060
Let’s all pull together.

667
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,380
By the way.

668
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,860
If Tao Qitao goes to SP,

669
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,660
you will meet him in the game.

670
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,460
It’s okay.

671
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,220
Next time I see him,

672
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,460
I’ll make him cry.

673
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,540
Okay.

674
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,100
Remember what you said.

675
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,460
Don’t lose at that time.

676
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,740
Don’t worry.

677
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,380
If I lose, I’ll, I’ll...

678
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,860
I’ll call you brother-in-law instead.

679
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,340
Okay?

680
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,260
But speaking of which,

681
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,380
you’ve never called me brother-in-law.

682
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:36,820
Don’t be stubborn.

683
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,340
Let’s have a game first.
We can talk about it if you win.

684
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,060
No.

685
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,660
Call me.

686
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,220
You said...

687
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,740
Game on.

688
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,220
You said...

689
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,260
You said you had a brother-in-law.

690
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,340
You will die if you don’t move.

691
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,140
Call me. It paused.

692
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,300
Hello.

693
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,580
Ai Qing.

694
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,420
There’s a Mr. Tao here to see you.

695
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,860
Okay.

696
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,060
Let him wait for me
in the conference room.

697
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,100
Okay.

698
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,100
Thank you.

699
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,180
How’d it go?

700
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,300
Have you decided to join SP?

701
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,940
Not yet.

702
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,020
Then why are you here?

703
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,700
I want you to give us a chance

704
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,340
and fight with our team,

705
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,420
letting me show you our strength.

706
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,860
If we win,

707
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,060
I want you to take us in.

708
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,580
You mean

709
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,460
you want to play in private?

710
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,220
Yes.

711
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,180
Please give me a chance.

712
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,540
Okay.

713
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,220
It’s all yours.

714
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,060
Then we’ll have a game,

715
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,820
and you’ll lose.
