19

Wu Bai.

20
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,380
What about your proposal?

21
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,780
She planned your time by hours.

22
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,860
You can’t sneak out at all.

23
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,780
It’s a little troublesome.

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,260
Actually, it’s not difficult.

25
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,460
Zhou Yi and I can sneak out

26
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,740
and get it for you.

27
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,220
Can you do it?

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,940
Just leave it to me. Rest assured.

29
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,780
Okay.

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,780
You and Zhou Yi pick it up for me.

31
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,940
Ai Qing is here.

32
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,220
Well, I think...

33
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,020
Just now...

34
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,260
Guys, come and have some fruit.

35
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,420
Ai Qing, there you are!

36
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,100
Ai Qing, there you are.

37
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,700
These fruits are good for your eyes.

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,940
-Here, there are the forks.
-For us?

39
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,700
Of course.

40
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,780
Thank you. Thank you.

41
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,340
Have one.

42
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,060
The Goddess

43
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,860
also makes our lives better.

44
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,500
The days are getting more rough

45
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,260
to be single.

46
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,380
Right?

47
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,860
Are you asking me?

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,940
I don’t know it.

49
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,860
Have one more.

50
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,980
The lighting here is too dim.

51
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,580
Wait a minute.

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,460
What?

53
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,380
Just as we said,

54
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,900
you and Zhou Yi go to pick it up.

55
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,820
Just leave it to us.

56
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,660
I got this for you.

57
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,420
Here.

58
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,740
The dim lighting is bad for your eyes.

59
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,260
You can adjust the brightness
according to the environment.

60
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,220
Here is the button.

61
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,780
A gold miner.

62
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,580
That’s sweet.

63
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,740
Okay, go to the meeting now.

64
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,700
Hold on!

65
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,060
Ten minutes later,

66
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,100
remind him for me.

67
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,260
Make sure

68
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,300
he uses the eye drops.

69
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,820
Rest assured.

70
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,860
-Keep it in mind.
-Don’t worry.

71
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,500
Don’t forget about it.

72
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,660
The league just released news

73
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,260
that RoboCup

74
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,580
will adopt a new competition system.

75
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,220
Players of both teams

76
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,300
can set up obstacles in the game.

77
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,940
Therefore, we need

78
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,740
two players in the game.

79
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,260
One controls the mecha.

80
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,660
The other controls the mechanism.

81
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,660
There are different kinds of mechanism

82
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,380
including fire, gear, smoke, groove,

83
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,500
columnar obstacles and ejection boards.

84
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,060
Fire and smoke

85
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,100
are at most visual interference.

86
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,540
We can’t use them

87
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,940
to control or destruct anything.

88
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,340
The groove is

89
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,940
high-risk with high return.

90
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,420
But it takes too long to activate.

91
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,900
If the players react fast enough,

92
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,860
they can avoid it.

93
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,180
As for the ejection board,

94
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,220
it’s not very powerful,

95
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,380
but it can keep the opponent in check.

96
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,460
The gear can cause huge damage,

97
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,820
but once you make
any mistake about the blocking,

98
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
it’s easy to damage the mecha.

99
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,300
If the chassis is attacked,

100
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,460
it may lead to a lack of power.

101
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,340
As for the columnar obstacle,

102
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,180
it’s certainly not as powerful

103
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,500
as gears in terms of attacking.

104
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,260
But if you use it flexibly,

105
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,700
it can restrict the movement
of other mechas.

106
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,980
This competition

107
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,380
is not just about how familiar
you are with the mechanism,

108
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,420
but also the ability
to respond with flexibility.

109
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,700
More importantly,

110
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,980
the ability to cooperate
with your teammate.

111
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,460
We need more training from tomorrow.

112
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,940
Is there any problem?

113
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,020
No problem.

114
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,860
Go it. No problem.

115
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,700
Can you turn off the lights?

116
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,220
Turn off the lights, Captain.

117
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,980
Sorry.

118
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,860
This box of chocolates
is very important to Wu Bai.

119
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,140
We can’t make any mistake.

120
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,140
Welcome.

121
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,380
This is our newly launched

122
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,060
milk candy made by Hokkaido milk.

123
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,220
The taste is mellow.

124
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,900
There are also biscuits
in hazelnut latte flavor.

125
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,820
And this Belgium...

126
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,940
We are here to get

127
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,100
the chocolate ordered by Mr. Wu.

128
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,820
Yeah.

129
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,220
You can have a taste.

130
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,620
It’s really delicious.

131
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,540
No need.

132
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,620
We’ll leave after we get it.

133
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,460
Thank you.

134
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,980
Okay. Please wait a moment.

135
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,940
Their Hokkaido milk

136
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,780
is different indeed.

137
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,220
Really?

138
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,540
The biscuits are super delicious.

139
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,140
Let me try one.

140
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,460
Is it handmade?

141
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,900
Have one.

142
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,380
Sir.

143
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,140
I’ll put your chocolate here.

144
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,020
Okay.

145
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,060
Waitress, hello.

146
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,660
Hurry up and eat.

147
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
Finish it and we should leave.

148
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,780
Let’s go.

149
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,060
Waitress, we’re taking this.

150
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,460
Okay.

151
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,540
Thank you.

152
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,260
How is it? Is it going well?

153
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,140
You can totally

154
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,300
count on me.

155
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,380
Captain, when are you going to do it?

156
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,060
Right now.

157
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,300
Bravo.

158
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,340
Efficiency plays a decisive role.

159
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,020
Let’s witness

160
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,620
this wonderful moment.

161
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,700
Why do I feel a little nervous?

162
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,780
-What are you nervous about, you are..!
-Hush.

163
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,980
Let’s on.

164
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,860
Come on! Go get her.

165
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,180
She is right there.

166
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,740
97 went out

167
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
and bought

168
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,260
your favorite chocolate by the way.

169
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,980
My favorite chocolate?

170
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,620
It is indeed.

171
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,740
97, how do you know I like it?

172
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,260
Captain told me.

173
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,620
I knew it.

174
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,180
Has the packaging changed?

175
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,220
It looks different.

176
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,020
Why are you looking at me?

177
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,020
Go ahead and eat.

178
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,060
No need. We won’t eat.

179
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,180
You know,

180
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,900
I can’t eat sweet food.

181
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,340
You know,

182
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,860
Ai Jing wants me to keep my abs,

183
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,940
or she won’t talk to me.

184
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,860
Captain knows

185
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,220
that I have wisdom tooth growing.

186
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,700
I can’t eat sweet food.

187
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,100
97 knows,

188
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
I...

189
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,860
I’m trying to lose weight.

190
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,100
What?

191
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,620
Lose weight?

192
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Zhou Yi, your legs are as thin as mine.

193
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,900
Why are you losing weight?

194
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,300
He... that’s not what he means.

195
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,940
He means he is trying to
lose fat and gain muscle.

196
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,220
A healthy diet is required.

197
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,340
He can’t eat sweets recently.

198
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,780
Exactly.

199
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,260
Go ahead.

200
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,740
What?

201
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,580
Nothing.

202
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,620
Nothing, nothing.

203
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,180
Have more.

204
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,900
Keep eating.

205
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,420
This is really delicious.

206
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,100
Have more.

207
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,780
Have more if it’s delicious.

208
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,860
Eye exercises.

209
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,900
Eye drops.

210
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,020
Did you miss the capsule?

211
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,300
I ate it.

212
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,380
Remember to have a massage.

213
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,940
Are you finished?

214
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,060
Have one more.

215
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,580
No. I’ll eat it tomorrow.

216
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,860
No!

217
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,820
They mean

218
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,980
the shelf life of this chocolate
is particularly short.

219
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,780
Only one day.

220
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,420
Yes, only one day.

221
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,420
Exactly.

222
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,380
I can’t, Bai.

223
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,420
I have gained weight recently.

224
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,100
I really can’t eat so much chocolate.

225
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,260
Not at all, Ai Qing!

226
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,620
You are not fat at all!

227
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,620
You are so weird today.

228
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,540
You bought a lot and you don’t eat.

229
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,860
I’m gaining weight alone.

230
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,820
Don’t buy chocolate

231
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,540
with such a short shelf life again.

232
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,220
Got it. I’ve kept it in mind.

233
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,820
Come on.

234
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,900
Here, eat this one.

235
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,540
I don’t want to eat. It’s too sweet.

236
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,860
It’s the last one. You have to eat it!

237
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,620
It’s the last one.

238
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,980
No hurry.

239
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,500
Here, eat it.

240
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,460
Alright.

241
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,300
Don’t waste it.

242
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,180
The chocolate is too sweet.

243
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,660
It really hurt my tooth.

244
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,540
I have finished a box of it.

245
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,500
I’ll go to rinse my mouth.

246
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,620
It’s too sweet.

247
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,260
What’s going on?

248
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,740
It is this box.

249
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,180
It is this bag.

250
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,500
It is this bag and this box.

251
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,540
This is the chocolate.

252
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,620
Well done.

253
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,260
You can even pick up the wrong one.

254
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,620
Don’t add fuel to the fire.

255
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,940
It’s not the good time.

256
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,740
Did she swallow it?

257
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,980
No way.

258
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,180
Did we take the wrong bag by mistake?

259
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,860
Call the shop right now.

260
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,060
Hurry up.

261
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,500
Hello.

262
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,260
Hello, Mr. Wu Bai.

263
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,180
I’m really sorry.

264
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,740
Your friend took the wrong chocolate

265
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,500
this afternoon.

266
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,460
Where is the right one?

267
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,540
Our clerk will deliver it
to your place tomorrow

268
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,060
with your diamond ring.

269
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,620
Please don’t worry.

270
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,940
All right.

271
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,060
Oh no, no, no.

272
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,620
I’m doomed.

273
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,660
He has been preparing the proposal
for a long time and you just ruined it.

274
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,100
I’d punch you if I were him.

275
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,660
Should we

276
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,420
kneel down in front of him?

277
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,540
I think he can forgive us.

278
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,740
Don’t you know him?

279
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,620
Although he doesn’t

280
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,300
add fuel to the fire like Shen Zhe,

281
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,260
he cares about

282
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,060
everything concerning Goddess.

283
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,060
He will stay angry

284
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,540
for a really long time this time.

285
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,300
Maybe he will put us

286
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,860
in the maintenance room tomorrow

287
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,180
and never let us out.

288
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,940
What to do then?

289
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,860
Well,

290
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,620
here is my idea.

291
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,620
Wu Bai’s purpose is
to propose to Ai Qing.

292
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,060
You can make up for your mistake

293
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,620
by helping him

294
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,060
pull off the proposal.

295
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,100
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

296
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,940
Sorry. Sorry.

297
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,100
Captain.

298
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,940
I know

299
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,540
you don’t want to see us now.

300
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,980
But can you hear me out?

301
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,860
Please hear him out.

302
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,740
Look,

303
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,660
the most important thing now

304
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,740
is to help you pull off the proposal,

305
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,740
right?

306
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,700
Speaking of the proposal,

307
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,980
I happen to have some ideas.

308
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,060
In fact, no matter what kind of
a proposal it is,

309
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,260
it’s mainly about two things.

310
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,980
Romance and surprise.

311
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,380
Right?

312
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,980
Go on.

313
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,740
Let’s talk about romance first.

314
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,180
Actually, there is a solution

315
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,500
right in front of us.

316
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,260
K&K

317
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,860
is a very romantic place.

318
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,060
K&K?

319
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,500
We are in the middle of nowhere.

320
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,740
Do you want him to
propose in the fields?

321
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,540
You really don’t

322
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,940
observe life, dude.

323
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,740
What’s wrong with the fields?

324
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,580
In a metropolis,

325
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,980
the pastoral scenery

326
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,820
is the rarest.

327
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,380
What will show up at night

328
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,900
in this season?

329
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
What?

330
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,380
Fireflies!

331
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,060
This is the surprise.

332
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,500
Yeah.

333
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,180
I really saw some fireflies
when I helped my mother

334
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,300
unload the goods.

335
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,220
They were really beautiful.

336
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,020
So, think about it.

337
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,180
Ai Qing is really familiar with K&K.

338
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,940
She is completely unprepared.

339
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,900
Then in a starry night,

340
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,900
you look at her affectionately.

341
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,780
And we will release the fireflies.

342
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,980
What a scene! What an atmosphere!

343
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,860
What a mood!

344
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,620
There are both romance and surprise.

345
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,420
How can she not say yes?

346
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,740
That’s it?

347
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,620
This is just plan A.

348
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,700
There is also... also...

349
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,020
Shen Zhe!

350
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,420
I mean,

351
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,740
you really don’t understand girls.

352
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,980
What can touch a girl most easily?

353
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,980
A pet.

354
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,500
I think

355
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,820
we should do a pet proposal.

356
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,660
A pet proposal?

357
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,540
Let’s go to the farm nearby

358
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,060
and borrow some white geese.

359
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,900
Hang a card of “Will You Marry Me”

360
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,140
around their necks

361
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,220
and let them walk out in a line.

362
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,540
Then you can propose to Ai Qing.

363
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,300
How romantic it is.

364
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,980
What if the white geese fly away?

365
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,300
It’s hard to control.

366
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,660
Yeah.

367
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,500
Exactly.

368
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,100
If it can’t work,

369
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,020
we can still

370
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,620
do a treasure hunt proposal.

371
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,100
What do you mean?

372
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,980
Explain it.

373
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,180
Just like the game we used to play.

374
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,180
You only need to

375
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,100
replace the treasure

376
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,620
with the ring.

377
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,500
What if Ai Qing

378
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,220
can’t find it?

379
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,340
Yeah.

380
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,260
Good question.

381
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,340
If it still can’t work,

382
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,340
we can also

383
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,700
do a package proposal.

384
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,260
A package proposal?

385
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,700
We can pack Wu Bai in a box

386
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,980
and deliver it to Ai Qing’s home.

387
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,380
When Ai Qing opens it,

388
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,780
Wu Bai will kneel down
on one knee and propose to her,

389
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,780
asking her to sign for

390
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,620
your love and your life, how is it?

391
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,460
But,

392
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,460
Captain is almost 1.9 meters tall.

393
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,740
How to pack him in a box?

394
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,620
Why do you have to undercut my idea?

395
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,140
I’m not undercutting your idea.

396
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,020
I’m trying to help him.

397
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,380
He is too big to be packed in a box.

398
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,940
And the white geese can fly.

399
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,100
Besides, I didn’t find

400
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,140
the treasure last time.

401
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,420
So what if the white geese fly?

402
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,340
You can hold them down.

403
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,100
You guys, don’t fight...

404
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
All right.

405
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,900
Thank you for your kindness.

406
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,500
I’ll figure something out by myself.

407
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,660
Captain!

408
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,100
Captain.

409
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,780
Let me think of something else for you.

410
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,580
I...

411
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,260
Is he

412
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,780
still angry?

413
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,500
I hope not.

414
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,020
The mecha upgrade this time

415
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,660
is mainly about being flexible.

416
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,140
-Yes, let’s do it.
-Yeah.

417
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,740
Yeah.

418
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,820
Bai.

419
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,700
You go ahead and study it.

420
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,300
Again.

421
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,300
It’s time for medicine.

422
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,500
Open your mouth.

423
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,860
It’s too bitter.

424
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,820
Not bitter.

425
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,580
You took it before.

426
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,020
Drop the act. Come on.

427
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,740
You have to take it.

428
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,260
Next

429
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,460
you are going to look into the distance

430
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,900
for five minutes.

431
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,660
Five minutes later, you can work.

432
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,140
Understand?

433
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,940
Got it.

434
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
Be good.

435
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,380
I will get some fruit for you.

436
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,220
Look into the distance

437
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,820
for five minutes.

438
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,860
What is he looking at?

439
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,220
I guess he took the wrong medicine.

440
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,820
Let’s take a look there.

441
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,180
Captain.

442
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,900
What are you looking at?

443
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,580
Look into the distance.

444
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,140
There are all walls here.

445
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,860
How can you look into the distance?

446
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
Distance?

447
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,300
It’s really “distance”.

448
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,780
I didn’t expect Ai Qing
to have a dry sense of humor.

449
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:38,940
Alright.

450
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,540
The time is up. Let’s go to train.

451
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,100
Look at this mecha.

452
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,980
What’s the difference between

453
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,300
this gear structure and our mecha?

454
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,740
And here.

455
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,140
Here.

456
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,820
Keep studying it.

457
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,060
I need to do something.

458
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,980
Sit here.

459
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,900
It’s time to put the drops in your eyes.

460
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,140
Is it uncomfortable?

461
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,220
Look up.

462
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,700
Does it hurt?

463
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,500
Roll your eyes.

464
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,420
I’m not feeling well suddenly.

465
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,460
Come on, use some eye drops.

466
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,340
Do it for me. Do it for me.

467
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,940
I can’t see things clearly, either.

468
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,340
Let me blow into your eyes.

469
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,700
Are you feeling better?

470
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,580
I’m much better now.

471
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,860
One more time.

472
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,420
Let’s do it

473
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,660
back in the room.

474
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,140
Okay.

475
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,100
Let’s go.

476
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,980
Are you leaving?

477
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,340
We are having a meeting, Captain.

478
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,300
You are not attending the meeting?

479
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,980
The RoboCup is coming soon.

480
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,820
Are you ready?

481
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,500
The most threatening opponents

482
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,140
we might meet in the game

483
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,420
are Anvil Team and Naya Team.

484
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,860
SP played a simulation game
with Anvil Team before.

485
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,460
They are really strong.

486
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,220
However,

487
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,700
I think Naya Team

488
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,260
is more threatening.

489
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,700
Naya is also an old opponent.

490
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,700
Their greatest strength
is not their onslaught,

491
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,060
but that they can

492
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,300
upgrade their mecha in advance

493
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,140
based on the characteristics
of their opponent.

494
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,540
If my guess is right,

495
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,420
they should have

496
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,420
made a corresponding upgrade this year

497
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,940
for the Nobody.

498
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,620
Will you renovate your mecha

499
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,980
according to their upgrade?

500
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,180
That would put us in a passive position.

501
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,740
I only need to do my best.

502
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,820
There is always a solution to a problem.

503
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
I’m thinking

504
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,340
if SP meets Naya

505
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,060
in RoboCup,

506
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,340
I will send Qitao out first.

507
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,500
Because,

508
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,420
Qitao’s defense

509
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,020
is almost unbreakable.

510
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,700
He can be archenemy of Naya.

511
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,060
By the way,

512
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,100
if Qitao is the first to fight,

513
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,180
I also came up with some ideas

514
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,380
to upgrade his mecha.

515
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,900
For example.

516
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,420
What’s wrong?

517
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Nothing.

518
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,460
I’m just wondering

519
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,900
how are Lin Yin and Qitao
doing with their training?

520
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,900
But they got Slide.

521
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,540
There should be no problem.

522
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,660
Are you really okay?

523
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,980
I’m fine.

524
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,100
I’m trapped in a fixed mindset.

525
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,580
I still need some adjustment.

526
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,460
All right.

527
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,460
Close your eyes

528
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,700
and have some rest.

529
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,420
Open Sesame.

530
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
Open Sesame.

531
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,220
How did you change
it to verbal password?

532
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,420
Yeah.

533
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,300
Or it would open automatically

534
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,820
every time I come close to it.

535
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,260
Then I need to close it.

536
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,660
It’s too troublesome.

537
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,660
Yeah.

538
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,700
But keep the password to yourself.

539
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,900
Never let 97 and others know it.

540
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,860
Otherwise they would

541
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,540
rummage through my treasure.

542
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,100
But I mean,

543
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,100
I really don’t know

544
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,180
what treasure you have in it.

545
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,620
Can I take a look?

546
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,300
Ai Qing won again and defeated

547
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,820
the Chicago team in 2015.

548
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,620
Keep trying. Come on.

549
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,540
You even have this picture.

550
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,140
On August 2, 2014,

551
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,380
Ai Qing stood on the stage

552
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,300
and there was
a long-lost smile on her face.

553
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,580
2013,

554
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,020
Ai Qing defeated the Japanese team

555
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,780
and got the highest score.

556
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,460
I’m so happy for you.

557
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,060
Ai Qing modified

558
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,700
her own robot again.

559
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,220
We’re looking forward to it.

560
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,140
Hello, here is your package.

561
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,340
Please sign here.

562
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,180
Okay.

563
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,540
Thank you.

564
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,500
Okay, goodbye.

565
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,580
-Goodbye.
-Finally.

566
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,620
We got the new toy, bro.

567
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,820
Ask Captain and Ai Qing
to play together.

568
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,980
Okay.

569
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,780
Captain! Ai Qing!

570
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,820
Come down to play with the new toy!

571
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,900
Let’s go down.

572
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,660
Okay.

573
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,540
This one is interesting.

574
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,460
Where did you buy it?

575
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,580
I want to buy some for

576
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,380
the children in the FMB Teen Camp.

577
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,460
They will like it.

578
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,100
Ai Qing, you don’t need to buy it.

579
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,660
Why?

580
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,580
I guess

581
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,060
the children in the FMB
Teen Camp all have it.

582
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,740
This is developed by
your former company.

583
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,580
You mean Jiayi?

584
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,420
This product is really good.

585
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,220
This kind of robot

586
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,980
can improve their

587
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,580
understanding of robots.

588
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,420
There are also simple
programming modules

589
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,300
which can improve
their programming skills.

590
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,060
That’s the Appledog indeed.

591
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,980
You only take a look

592
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,580
and you can tell the core of it.

593
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,580
The problem is

594
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,580
that the FMB Teen Camp

595
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,580
is only for gifted children.

596
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,580
There are also many children

597
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,300
who can’t reach them.

598
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,580
With these robots,

599
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,980
we will be able to popularize it

600
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,620
among the kids in a faster way.

601
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,060
It’s really flexible.

602
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,940
Wu Bai.

603
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:03,940
How is it?

604
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,700
Is the new robot I bought interesting?

605
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,260
Does your Goddess have fun?

606
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,540
Yeah.

607
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,340
Great.

608
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,540
Well,

609
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,060
should you pay the money

610
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
I spent on the robot?

611
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,220
It’s one thousand in total...

612
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,340
Do you think Ai Qing

613
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,900
is a little weird today?

614
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Don’t change the subject.

615
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,140
I mean you should

616
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,300
pay me the money.

617
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,660
Well, what do you think

618
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,860
I can do for her?

619
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,580
I think

620
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,580
there are so many things
you can do for her.

621
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,700
For example.

622
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,060
Pay the money first.

623
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,020
Remember to pay the money by phone.

624
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,180
I’ll wait for your news.

625
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,100
Bai.

626
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,420
What are you thinking about?

627
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,820
Why don’t you go to sleep?

628
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
Nothing.

629
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,420
Why don’t you dry your hair?

630
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,420
My hair is short. It will be dry soon.

631
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,300
No.

632
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,820
Let me do it for you.

633
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,420
It’s nothing.

634
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,460
I’m trapped in a fixed mindset.

635
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,060
I still need some adjustment.

636
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,020
The FMB Teen Camp

637
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,980
is only for gifted children now.

638
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,060
There are also many children

639
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,020
who can’t reach them.

640
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,180
With these robots,

641
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,540
we will be able to popularize it

642
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,300
among the kids in a faster way.

643
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,340
Alright.

644
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
It’s almost dry.

645
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,580
Thank you, Bai.

646
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,340
I’m really tired.

647
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,300
Thank you for taking
care of me these days.

648
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,900
Let me give you a massage.

649
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,340
Okay.

650
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,820
Ai Qing.

651
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,780
Do you regret that you can’t be

652
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,580
the leader of SP anymore?

653
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,700
A little bit.

654
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,820
But,

655
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,820
being a commentator is also meaningful.

656
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,820
Look.

657
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,100
I can explain the game to the audience

658
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,020
and make the audience like this sport.

659
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,900
It’s also very important to me.

660
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Yeah.

661
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,700
This is also a kind of promotion

662
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,420
of robotic fighting.

663
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,420
By the way,

664
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,980
are you interested in

665
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,820
the robotic fighting promotion
aimed at teenagers

666
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,660
that Lin Shan is working on?

667
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,340
Of course I’m.

668
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,860
But,

669
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,940
I think I should focus on

670
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,340
being a good commentator now.

671
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,900
Alright.

672
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,460
It’s getting late.

673
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,700
Go to bed early.

674
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,900
Remember

675
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,300
to use eye drops later.

676
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,620
I’ll go to sleep.

677
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,700
Goodbye.

678
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,580
Rest early.

679
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,540
Remember

680
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,380
to use eye drops.

681
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,500
Don’t forget.

682
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,740
Bye, good night.

683
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,860
(Lin Shan)

684
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,220
Hello.

685
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,260
Hello.

686
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,260
This is Wu Bai.

687
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,900
Didn’t I ask you to have some rest?

688
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,220
You are out there again.

689
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,940
I’ll take you to meet someone.

690
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,020
Last time you said you would
take me to meet someone,

691
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,180
then Xiaomi retired from SP

692
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,980
and went to K&K.

693
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,220
Are you going to

694
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,380
poach someone from SP again?

695
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,140
No.

696
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,620
So who is it?

697
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,460
You’ll find it out later.

698
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,060
Master. Goddess.

699
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,340
Come on, please sit down.

700
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,500
Director Lin?

701
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,860
Sit down.

702
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,980
I ordered some food for you.

703
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,500
I don’t know if it would
suit your taste.

704
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,700
Let me make an introduction.

705
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,860
This is my assistant,

706
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,980
Li Xueqian.

707
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,740
Nice to meet you.

708
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,180
Hello.

709
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,180
Hello.

710
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,580
Goddess.

711
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,340
I heard from Master Wu Bai

712
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,980
that you’ve been playing
the educational robot.

713
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,980
This is the latest one.

714
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,180
Take it and have fun.

715
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,620
There are more if you need.

716
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,020
Come on.

717
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,940
Are you the head of the project?

718
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,940
Yeah.

719
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,100
You know

720
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,780
that the greater the ability,
the greater the responsibility.

721
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,820
My boss

722
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,340
thinks highly of me now.

723
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,020
Although I’m still doing publicity,

724
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,940
right now I mainly focus on

725
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,460
educational robots
and the FMB Teen Camp.

726
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,860
To popularize, to make connections
and to promote the project.

727
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,860
How is it working now?

728
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,180
To be honest,

729
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,060
it’s really good.

730
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,860
The product was a hit
when we launched it.

731
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,380
I mean it.

732
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,060
There are too many orders
to finish every day.

733
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,460
Exactly.

734
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,180
You know, I also do live stream.

735
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,100
Buy it, buy it!

736
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,460
It’s... it’s in short supply.

737
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,740
It is sold out every day.

738
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,820
I’ve been working overtime
and studying every day.

739
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,580
In the first month,

740
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,660
we mainly count on
the professional players to sell it.

741
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,180
Yeah.

742
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,580
Although we didn’t sell much this month,

743
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,740
I believe with Lin...

744
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,700
Didn’t sell much?

745
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,020
There are...

746
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,980
There are

747
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,500
still three days left in this month.

748
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,540
The sales will rocket up

749
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,140
in the last three days.

750
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,060
He knows nothing.

751
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,100
You were way much better
than him back that time.

752
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,420
Go ahead, Director Lin.

753
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,660
Why do you want to see me?

754
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,460
Let’s get into the business.

755
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,260
Xueqian.

756
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,420
Take Master Wu Bai
to buy a cup of coffee.

757
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,580
We haven’t finished it.

758
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,740
You haven’t...

759
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,460
It’s empty now.

760
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,620
Go ahead.

761
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,660
You work really hard.

762
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,300
No big deal.

763
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,460
Well, Ai Qing.

764
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,540
Are you willing to help me

765
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,700
with the linked project
of educational robots

766
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,100
and FMB Teen Camp.

767
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,180
Don’t reject me now.

768
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,380
To be honest,

769
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,900
in terms of the abilities,
qualifications,

770
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,540
and the passion for children,

771
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,500
no one is better than you.

772
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,860
Therefore,

773
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,340
I hope

774
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,580
you can think about it.

775
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,260
This is my dream.

776
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,020
But,

777
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,020
I still have my job

778
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,660
to do.

779
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,140
It’s not contradicted.

780
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,660
It will only take you some spare time

781
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,740
and a little bit of energy

782
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,620
to give counsel and advices to children.

783
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,140
They will be very happy about it.

784
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,100
Ai Qing.

785
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,980
I sincerely invite you

786
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,980
to join this project.

787
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,940
Don’t be like this, Director Lin.

788
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,820
Please.

789
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,940
Master Wu Bai took a look at the menu

790
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,460
and said there is nothing
he wants to drink.

791
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,420
It’s hard to find a toilet
if he drinks too much.

792
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,780
All right, I’ve drunk the coffee.

793
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,140
I know what this is about.

794
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,020
We should leave now.

795
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,180
Good.

796
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,260
Pack it for Goddess.

797
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,660
Ai Qing.

798
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,260
Think about it after you go back.

799
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,420
Thank you for your gift.

800
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,380
You are welcome.

801
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,380
Goodbye.

802
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,900
Goodbye.

803
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,740
Bai.

804
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,660
How come you

805
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,140
bring me to see Lin Shan?

806
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,540
Ten years ago,

807
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,860
I started to like fighting robots

808
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,740
because of you.

809
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,420
I think you can guide

810
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,700
more potential players

811
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,580
to this industry.

812
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,300
Bai.

813
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,500
Nothing.

814
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,100
Let’s go.

815
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,100
Some people are like strangers
after all these years,

816
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,820
some people hit it off
at the first time.

817
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,300
I met a man who can understand me

818
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,060
even I don’t say anything.

819
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,340
Suddenly I feel

820
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,060
a lifetime

821
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,100
doesn’t sound lengthy and scary anymore.

822
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,740
Bai.

823
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,460
It’s nice to be with you.

824
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,380
(Proposal)

825
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,340
(Proposal on the beach)

826
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,860
Are you awake, Captain?

827
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:04,980
Come in.

828
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,740
Is Ai Qing awake?

829
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,060
She left.

830
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,140
But she asked me to give this to you.

831
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,260
(Precautions for using eye drops)

832
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,940
(Eye drops C: Use it every day
before going to bed to relieve fatigue)

833
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,260
(Vitamin: Take one pill a day.
It’s good for your eyes)

834
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,780
(Eye drops)

835
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,860
(Precautions for using eye drops)

836
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,900
(Vitamin B2: Take one pill a day,
it’s good for your eyes)

837
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,660
(Vitamin B2: Take one pill a day,
it’s good for your eyes)

838
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,460
Ai Qing is really thoughtful, Captain.

839
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,300
(Ai Qing)

840
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,780
(Ai Qing)
Did you get the pillbox?

841
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,300
Remember to take it with you.

842
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,220
I’m going back.

843
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,500
(Okay.)
Keep training and take care.

844
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,580
Thank you, Tong Nian.

845
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,700
Be careful.

846
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,020
These two are for you.

847
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,540
Thank you.

848
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,540
Be careful, it’s hot.

849
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,940
Thank you, Tong Nian.

850
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,540
This is the second time
I drink the coffee made by Tong Nian.

851
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,740
It’s still delicious.

852
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,060
Tong Nian.

853
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,940
The coffee is too beautiful.

854
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,300
I can’t bear to drink it.

855
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,500
It smells so good.

856
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,060
Tong Nian, you are really
good at making coffee.

857
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,100
Thank you, Tong Nian.

858
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,980
Thank you, Tong Nian.

859
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,700
You’re welcome.

860
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,820
If you like it,

861
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,260
I’ll make it for you more often.

862
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,860
Great.

863
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,660
Is this one for the boss?

864
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,820
