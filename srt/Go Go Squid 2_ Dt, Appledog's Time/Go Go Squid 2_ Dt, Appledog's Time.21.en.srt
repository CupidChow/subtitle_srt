I forgot.

00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,780
I’m sorry,

22
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,260
Solo.

23
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,060
I’m going out to make a phone call.

24
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,540
OK.

25
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,580
Please.

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,860
This is not the right thing for me
to operate…

27
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,700
Hi, Bai.

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,700
Sorry, sorry.

29
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,900
Something urgent just came up for
my team.

30
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,900
I forgot everything when I got busy.

31
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,420
And I set my phone to silent mode
just now.

32
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,820
Bai,

33
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,700
it’s you indeed.

34
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,980
When did you get here?

35
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,580
Wait for me there.

36
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,380
I’ll come down right away.

37
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,340
Wait for me.

38
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,820
Sorry, Bai.

39
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,900
I set my phone to silent mode.

40
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,340
I really didn’t see your messages.

41
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,180
It’s OK.

42
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,860
Work is more important.

43
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,380
I read Solo’s WeChat Moments

44
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,900
and got to know
you are working overtime,

45
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,820
so I’ve specially brought you something
to eat.

46
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,700
Ai Qing,

47
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,860
let’s go on with the meeting.

48
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,100
Ou Qiang said…

49
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,300
Leader.

50
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,220
You are here, Bai.

51
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,580
I bought some food for you guys.

52
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,860
Thanks.

53
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,820
I thank you on behalf of members of
the SP Team.

54
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,620
Thank Ai Qing instead.

55
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,700
Ai Qing,

56
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,540
go upstairs to have the meeting first.

57
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,780
Everybody is waiting for you.

58
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,540
Bai…

59
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,820
I know.

60
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,100
Go on with your work.

61
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,940
Remember to eat some more.

62
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,580
I’ll call you when I’m done.

63
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,220
OK.

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,620
Let’s go, Leader.

65
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,580
Let’s go.

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,260
Here.

67
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,380
Here’s another bucket of
Shen Zhe’s dirty clothes.

68
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,260
Keep it up.

69
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,140
Oh no!

70
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,780
We’ve only embroidered a flower

71
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,660
on his suit,

72
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,540
do we have to

73
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,940
wash all his dirty clothes for him?

74
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,020
It tires me out!

75
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,620
Is it that tiring?

76
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,740
I think it’s all right.

77
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,860
I do the laundry often.

78
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,740
I have nothing to say

79
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,900
to a housework freak like you.

80
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,500
Captain,

81
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,580
come back quickly to tame

82
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,020
the peacock Shen Zhe.

83
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,220
Speaking of Captain,

84
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,860
is he in a bad mood these days?

85
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,020
How can he be in a good mood?

86
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,060
Goddess gives him the cold shoulder.

87
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,820
Goddess?

88
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,700
Who?

89
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,900
You wouldn’t know even if I tell you.

90
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,180
I’ll go and see if Captain is back.

91
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,340
I’ll leave all these clothes to you.

92
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,460
97.

93
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
97!

94
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,300
Leader,

95
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,580
I’d like to get a vice operator
for Xiaomi

96
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,420
to pair up with him.

97
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,980
Yes.

98
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,300
That’s a good idea.

99
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,060
Do you have anyone in mind?

100
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,900
OK.

101
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,380
(Frigg)

102
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,660
Hello.

103
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,580
Hello, Bai.

104
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,820
I’ve just finished work.

105
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,220
Sorry,

106
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
I kept you waiting for so long today.

107
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,580
It’s OK.

108
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,340
I know.

109
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,820
You are worried about Xiaomi.

110
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,180
Thank you, Bai.

111
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,980
It’s a pity that

112
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,380
I didn’t get to eat

113
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,100
the ice cream you bought me today.

114
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,380
Well,

115
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,860
do you still want it?

116
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,380
Now?

117
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,620
Bai.

118
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,380
Why haven’t you gone home yet?

119
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,260
If I go,

120
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,900
how are you gonna get to eat
this ice cream?

121
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,100
Thankfully, it hasn’t melted away yet.

122
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,340
The last one of limited flavor
for spring.

123
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,620

Is there any progress in Xiaomi’s
extra training?

135
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,060
We’ve found him a matched machine type

136
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,420
and made a targeted training plan.

137
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,900
Bai, do you know?

138
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,820
When I first got to know Xiaomi,

139
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,780
he was full of vim and vigor,

140
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,660
and his reaction and accuracy
of operation

141
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,860
both ranked among top of the industry.

142
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,780
But now

143
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,020
time is really ruthless.

144
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,740
Don’t be afraid.

145
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,980
This is the cruelty
of competitive games.

146
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,700
Bai,

147
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,580
actually I’ve been thinking a lot lately.

148
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,900
I’m worried that

149
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,980
our relationship

150
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,900
will take up too much of your energy

151
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,020
and get in the way of your development.

152
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,180
After all, every player has only
a few years

153
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,940
of golden period in their career.

154
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,180
What makes you think that way?

155
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,300
You’ve always brought me

156
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,860
positive influences.

157
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,180
Three years ago,

158
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,380
being able to compete with you as your
opponent

159
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,540
made my blood boil.

160
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,980
It’s the same now.

161
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,860
As long as I come to think you and I

162
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,980
are in the same profession,

163
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,860
I’ll never lose my motivation.

164
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,580
But…

165
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,180
Do you still remember

166
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,860
what I wrote to you

167
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,620
before the Frigg Trophy?

168
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,740
We are opponents as well as friends.

169
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,300
I believe we can be

170
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,660
the strongest opponents of each other.

171
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,980
Let’s slug it out
in the national contest.

172
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,500
Would you like to swing higher?

173
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,180

We thought our team

00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,740
had improved enough,

196
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,420
while they are also working hard.

197
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
The league is about to begin.

198
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,540
Both teams are showing what they’ve got.

199
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,860
If so,

200
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,380
given Xiaomi’s condition,

201
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,860
I doubt if he’ll enter the final.

202
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,140
By the way,

203
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,380
I suggested Leader get

204
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,740
a vice operator for Xiaomi
the other day.

205
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,180
A vice operator?

206
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,700
Do you have anybody in mind?

207
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,660
This year’s King of Rookies.

208
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,100
Tao Qitao.

209
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Have a look.

210
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,180
(Tao Qitao)

211
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,860
This year’s King of Rookies as Xiaomi’s
vice operator?

212
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,500
Is he willing to do that?

213
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,660
If he’s good enough,

214
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,420
Xiaomi can also be his vice operator.

215
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,860
But…

216
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,940
I need to think it over.

217
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,100
Come in please.

218
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,100
Ai Qing, you have a visitor.

219
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,820
Let him in please.

220
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,820
Speak of the devil and he appears.

221
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,060
Hello, Tao Qitao.

222
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,380
Do you know me?

223
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
I think there’s nobody who doesn’t know

224
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,980
this year’s King of Rookies.

225
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Glad to meet you, Pianist Ai Qing.

226
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,540
Hello, Slide.

227
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,420
Hello.

228
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,180
Please take a seat.

229
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,900
I’d like to

230
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,100
have a word with you in private.

231
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,980
About business.

232
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,060
If it’s about business,

233
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,060
you can talk straight.

234
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,780
Take a seat.

235
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,860
I want you to be my coach.

236
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,500
Me?

237
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,340
Yes.

238
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,140
You.

239
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,780
But I am SP’s coach.

240
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,420
There were three great commanders

241
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,820
in the Solo Team back then.

242
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,940
Solo, you and Han Shangyan.

243
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,540
Now Solo leads SP

244
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,060
and Han Shangyan leads K&K.

245
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,020
Don’t you

246
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,620
want to have a team of your own?

247
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,500
Why should I accept your invitation?

248
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,740
You have to give me a reason.

249
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,300
I’m the player with the fastest growth
of points this year.

250
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,820
As long as I’m given time,

251
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,940
I can quickly enter Top 5 in the ranking
of points.

252
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,860
A team has many different members.

253
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,980
Your individual excellence

254
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,540
doesn’t mean everybody’s excellence.

255
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,140
Then I can mobilize them.

256
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,500
Not necessarily.

257
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,580
I can.

258
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,420
But as far as I can see,

259
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,660
up to now,

260
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,100
your team’s performance

261
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,980
is far below your individual performance.

262
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,260
If you want to work together,

263
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,420
there is a way for that.

264
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,540
What is it?

265
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,820
Join SP.

266
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,940
Do you mean SP takes us in?

267
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,180
Not all of you,

268
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,220
but you alone.

269
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,540
No way.

270
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,820
I won’t leave our team.

271
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,940
They are all my bros.

272
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,900
I’ll never abandon my bros.

273
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,740
But as far as I know,

274
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,180
your team doesn’t have

275
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,780
a stable sponsor,

276
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,620
and it goes no further in this year’s
league.

277
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,580
Whether it can survive this season

278
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,780
still remains a question.

279
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,300
Our team will not disband.

280
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,340
Then you guys must speak with your
performance.

281
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,180
Performance.

282
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,220
I think SP’s performance is also average
in recent games.

283
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,460
But we are SP.

284
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,140
The reserves and foundations of
a champion team

285
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,300
cannot be wiped off

286
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,980
by just a few failures.

287
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,700
And I believe

288
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,380
our SP Team

289
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,340
will definitely be the winner

290
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,140
of this season.

291
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,060
All right.

292
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,140
I wish you win.

293
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,300
Let’s talk about it later.

294
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,460
So arrogant.

295
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,100
Are you really going to take them in?

296
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,380
Tao Qitao is quite talented indeed.

297
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,260
But his teammates

298
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,660
are also way below

299
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,140
our SP’s standards indeed.

300
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,860
So cold-blooded?

301
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,460
I’m not being cold-blooded.

302
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,620
Business is business.

303
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,100
OK, sensible girl.

304
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,380
You are the boss, OK?

305
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,140
Let’s go.

306
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,340
Let’s go and see how other members

307
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,620
are getting on with the preparation.

308
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,700
The semifinal is just around the corner.

309
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,860
(Chinese Robot Fighting League
National Finals)

310
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,740
Are you zoning out again?

311
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,180
How did you know I’m here?

312
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,100
It’s been so many years,

313
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,940
and this habit of yours
hasn’t been changed.

314
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,900
When I competed in my first game,

315
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,460
I was so nervous that I didn’t know
what to do,

316
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,540
so I had to stop thinking.

317
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,660
Over time, it grew into a habit.

318
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,540
I clear my mind

319
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,860
before games.

320
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,860
I remember this was the venue

321
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,340
of our first game, wasn’t it?

322
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,980
Yes.

323
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,900
Now is the semi-final,

324
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,780
next will be the final.

325
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,020
I’m sure you can do it.

326
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,380
Ai Qing,

327
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,540
I can’t drop the ball this time.

328
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,900
SP must win.

329
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,140
I believe in you,

330
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,220
as I always have.

331
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,780
All right, go.

332
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,820
It’s time to enter the arena.

333
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,260
Ai Qing.

334
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,580
I’m sure I’ll finish this game
beautifully.

335
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,260
I believe in you.

336
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:30,980
Go.

337
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,500
(Chinese Robot Fighting League)

338
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,060
Why are you putting your collar so high?

339
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,220
I’m having an allergy.

340
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,220
Again?

341
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,900
It turns out

342
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,380
you have it at this time every year.

343
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,180
As it happens,

344
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,140
you can use this as an excuse

345
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,180
to play coquetry with Ai Qing tomorrow.

346
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,380
What coquetry?

347
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,420
Why are you so unromantic?

348
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,340
You see,

349
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,700
I were you

350
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,740
and you were Ai Qing.

351
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,660
I say

352
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,860
“Ai Qing, I’m having an allergy.”

353
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,580
How would she respond?

354
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,340
Drink more hot water.

355
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,380
She would ask

356
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,980
why you are having an allergy.

357
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,700
In that case, you should say

358
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,100
“I feel very itchy from head to foot.

359
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,420
I can only get better if you rub some
ointment on me.”

360
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,940
Do you get it?

361
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,660
But I can rub it myself.

362
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,700
Brilliant.

363
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,500
Forget about it.

364
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,580
Why aren’t you watching the game?

365
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,980
Is there anything particularly worth
watching about the game?

366
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,900
Xiaomi

367
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,500
is a veteran player in the circle.

368
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,020
He has very rich experience,

369
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,540
especially in blocking,

370
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,900
which saves him from

371
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,780
a lot of unnecessary attacks.

372
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,140
Blocking?

373
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,620
I know how to do it in the first place.

374
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,420
And he’s pairing up with Slide
this time.

375
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,660
They have good automatic understanding,

376
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,900
and their strength will advance to
the next level.

377
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,380
I tell you what,

378
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,420
no amount of automatic understanding
between two people

379
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,980
can equal a single

380
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,260
invincible individual.

381
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,060
All right.

382
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,300
Stop worrying.

383
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Play this game

384
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,460
to chill out.

385
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,660
There are 150 levels.

386
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,780
It’s really got me.

387
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,780
-So hard.
-As we can see,

388
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,620
SP Team

389
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,980
has started to use double operators
for the first time.

390
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,340
Will Xiaomi and Slide

391
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,860
play in unison?

392
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,180
Let’s see what happens.

393
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,700
Well done!

394
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,380
You are relieved, aren’t you?

395
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,220
Now you can go home
and have a good sleep.

396
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,340
I start to feel my ability falls short
of my wishes.

397
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,220
I’ve reached that age after all.

398
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,860
Are you kidding?

399
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,620
You are Solo the Creator.

400
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,220
To tell you the truth,

401
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,140
this is my happiest day

402
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,100
during this period of time.

403
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,060
Today

404
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,940
is the day of the last professional game

405
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,500
in my life.

406
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,180
What did he say?

407
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,620
I’ve decided to retire.

408
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,380
Thank you.

409
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,660
Captain, have you watched the game?

410
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,060
My goodness.

411
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,460
Xiaomi has announced his retirement.

412
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,060
When he was taking an interview

413
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,780
right after the game,

414
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,980
he suddenly announced it.

415
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,220
What’s going on?

416
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,700
He must have decided

417
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,180
what he was going to say
before the game.

418
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,900
Ai Qing is feeling the most pain

419
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,940
when such a thing happens.

420
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,220
Captain, are you going out?

421
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,740
What do you mean?

422
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,860
I’m sorry.

423
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,580
Is that all with a sorry?

424
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,700
Let go of your hold.

425
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,180
Let go of your hold!

426
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,260
Xiaomi,

427
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,220
why do you suddenly want to retire?

428
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,300
I’ll only be a drag on the team
if I go on.

429
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,180
A drag?

430
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,620
What do you mean by drag?

431
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,940
We’ve just won.

432
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:48,820
At this pace,

433
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,620
we can enter the final.

434
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,740
We can win, Xiaomi!

435
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
Do you remember how many times

436
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,500
you’ve trained with me before?

437
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,740
Almost everybody in the SP team

438
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,900
was doing extra training with me
day and night!

439
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,860
Do I have to do this

440
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,820
for every game afterwards?

441
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,100
SP can’t afford the drain!

442
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,100
What did we train with you for?

443
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,340
What did we train with you for?

444
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,820
Xiaomi,

445
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,700
even so, you don’t have to retire.

446
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,660
Yes.

447
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,260
All of us will be with you.

448
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,180
Have you thought it through?

449
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,420
I’m retiring with honor.

450
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,580
You guys should be happy for me.

451
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,620
Why?

452
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,700
You won’t have to be so tired once I go.

453
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,180
You work overtime every day

454
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,620
to drain your time with me at SP.

455
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,700
You’ll drain yourself into a crone
sooner or later.

456
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,540
Sorry, Xiaomi.

457
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,100
I didn’t do well enough.

458
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,900
Well, what are all you guys doing?

459
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,940
Xiaomi, listen to me.

460
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,540
Give me a chance to talk sense into you.

461
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,620
-Leader.
-Xiaomi.

462
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,220
Can’t you give me a free and easy time?

463
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,980
We’ve agreed not to disband.

464
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,300
Let’s have a drink tomorrow.

465
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,340
To celebrate my glorious retirement.

466
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,020
That’s it for now.

467
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,540
How’s it going?

468
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,060
Do you remember how many times

469
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,580
you’ve trained with me before?

470
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,700
Almost everybody in the SP team

471
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,820
was doing extra training with me
day and night!

472
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:01,940
Do I have to do this

473
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,700
for every game afterwards?

474
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,060
SP can’t afford the drain!

475
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,060
What did we train with you for?

476
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,180
What did we train with you for?

477
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,700
You won’t have to be so tired once I go.

478
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,300
You work overtime every day

479
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,900
to drain your time with me at SP.

480
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,420
You’ll drain yourself into a crone
sooner or later.

481
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,460
(Ai Jing)
I’ll go and have dinner with Dad.

482
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,820
We used to

483
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,060
have unlimited imaginations
of the future.

484
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,420
Even till yesterday,

485
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,900
I still held a glimmer of fantasy,

486
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,100
only to find

487
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,620
I have no bros

488
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,300
dreaming together with me by my side.

489
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,220
I want to see you.

490
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,020
Thankfully, he’s there for me
all the time.

491
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,300
That

492
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,860
boy who belongs only to me.

493
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,540
What brings you here?

494
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,820
Didn’t you say you want to see me?

495
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,580
I want to see you indeed.

496
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,940
But I didn’t expect

497
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,380
you’d come so soon.

498
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,100
Nobody really wants to leave.

499
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,180
They are compelled by circumstances.

500
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,700
Such a day will come to all players,

501
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
including me.

502
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,820
Including everybody.

503
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,660
All right.

504
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180
No more crying.

505
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,300
Let’s go home.

506
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,300
Come in.

507
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,300
My sister has gone to see my father.

508
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,860
Let me pour a glass of water for you.

509
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,700
OK.

510
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,460
By the way,

511
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,900
have you had dinner?

512
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,980
We gave Xiaomi a send-off
in the evening.

513
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,180
Everybody was upset.

514
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,820
We didn’t eat much.

515
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,980
Let me cook something for you.

516
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,380
Can you cook?

517
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,060
I’ll try.

518
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,500
You…

519
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,820
You can really cook?

520
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,460
A bowl of noodles

521
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,260
can’t beat me.

522
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,700
Why don’t you wait for me outside?

523
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,740
There are a lot of cooking fumes.

524
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,820
I’ll let you know when it’s ready later.

525
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,620
I’ll go and change my clothes first.

526
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,660
(Wu Bai)

527
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,220
Hi, bro.

528
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,460
What’s up?

529
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,620
Hi, Shen Zhe.

530
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,820
Can you cook noodles?

531
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,420
Are you nuts?

532
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,340
Just tell me whether you can or not.

533
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,820
No.

534
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,260
Go on sleeping then.

535
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
Sleep to death!

536
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,180
Zhou Yi.

537
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,900
Hi, Zhou Yi.

538
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,980
Hi, Captain, what’s up?

539
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,500
I have a small question

540
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,820
on which I’d like to ask for your
advice.

541
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,420
How do you

542
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,060
cook noodles?

543
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,020
Come out for the noodles.

544
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,060
I’m coming.

545
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,180
The smell is so good.

546
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,580
Let me try.

547
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,180
Tasty.

548
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,300
You must be really hungry.

549
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,140
Hurry up to eat.

550
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,540
They are really tasty.

551
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,380
Actually

552
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,540
this is my first time to cook noodles.

553
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,420
Why did you cook so well?

554
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,180
Because I put in

555
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,820
something special.

556
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,300
Something special?

557
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,580
What is it?

558
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,860
Zhou Yi’s experience.

559
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,380
I specially called him for advice.

560
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,380
He imparted all his 20-plus years’

561
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,180
experience of cooking noodles to me.

562
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Hurry up to eat.

563
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,580
What’s wrong with you?

564
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,660
I’m OK.

565
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,980
But I see your neck is red.

566
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,420
Are you having an allergy?

567
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,980
It’s an old ailment.

568
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,860
It’s OK.

569
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,660
Go on eating.

570
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,020
Just a moment.

571
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,860
I’ll go get the ointment.

572
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,780
I’ve found it.

573
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,020
Come and sit here.

574
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,300
What’s this?

575
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,540
This is the anti-allergic ointment.

576
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,660
Remain seated.

577
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,780
I...

578
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,580
I’d better go back to the club

579
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,100
and ask 97 to rub it on me.

580
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,860
Now you are having such serious allergy.

581
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,460
I’m your girlfriend, you don’t let me
do it,

582
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,020
but insist on having 97 do it when you
are back?

583
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,300
I’m gonna rub it.

584
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,140
Does it itch?

585
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,380
It feels all right.

586
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,740
Is this a seasonal allergy

587
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,020
or allergy caused by food?

588
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,500
It’s seasonal.

589
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,540
It comes up at this time of year.

590
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,580
Well,

591
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,220
is it very serious?

592
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,100
Not really.

593
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,020
It’s all right this year.

594
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,220
The next time you have an allergy,

595
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,620
make sure you don’t scratch.

596
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,180
It becomes worse with scratches.

597
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,020
All over there behind your neck.

598
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,020
I can only rest easy
after having a look.

599
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,580
Dad!

600
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,020
This… This… This…

601
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,780
You… You guys are…

602
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,540
This… This… This…

603
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,700
Dad, Wu Bai is having an allergy.

604
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,180
I was rubbing some ointment on him.

605
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,580
Rubbing ointment.

606
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,580
Hello, sir.

607
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,140
Hello.

608
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,500
Why didn’t you

609
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,780
tell me you were coming?

610
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:47,860
You…

611
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,820
Come here.

612
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,140
What’s going on?

613
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,460
I was really rubbing ointment on him.

614
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,980
Speak properly.

615
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,300
How long has it been?

616
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,740
For some time.

617
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,060
You rock.

618
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,980
You get it from me.

619
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,100
Well done.

620
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,820
Wu Bai.

621
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,780
Can you tell me

622
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,660
what was going on just now?

623
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,100
No… Nothing was going on.

624
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,220
I’m having an allergy.

625
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,700
She was rubbing ointment on me.

626
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,860
Yes, Dad.

627
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,740
Didn’t I tell you just now?

628
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,660
-Shut up.
-I was…

629
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,100
Are you really having an allergy?

630
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,260
Look!

631
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,580
OK.

632
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,100
Let’s talk.

633
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,300
Please take a seat, sir.

634
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,340
This is my daughter’s home.

635
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,020
You take a seat.

636
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,140
You should have sent me a WeChat message

637
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,700
so that I could cover you up.

638
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,780
How could I know

639
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,700
you and Dad would suddenly come back?

640
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,980
Well, Wu Bai,

641
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,100
do you have anything to do later?

642
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,660
Dad,

643
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,060
Wu Bai has something to do when
he’s back in a while.

644
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,260
He’s in a rush to go.

645
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Aren’t you, Wu Bai?

646
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,140
Just say you’ve got things to do.

647
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,980
Go home quickly.

648
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,420
Are you in a rush to go?

649
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,100
No.

650
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,220
No.

651
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,780
OK.

652
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,100
Let’s have a little drink.

653
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,820
Jing, bring me the wine
from the kitchen.

654
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,980
Yellow rice wine, Dad.

655
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,900
Are you sure it’s OK for him?

656
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,220
Dad, Wu Bai is having an allergy.

657
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,660
He can’t drink.

658
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,940
You can’t drink while having an allergy?

659
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,420
You can’t, you are having an allergy.

660
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,380
You can’t drink.

661
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,060
I’m OK with it.

662
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,340
OK with it.

663
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,540
Bring it!

664
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,460
OK.

665
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,780
He’s really having an allergy.

666
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,620
He can’t drink.

667
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,700
Wu Bai,

668
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,660
shall I rub some more on you?

669
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,460
I…

670
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,620
I suddenly feel much better.

671
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,340
I’m well.

672
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,420
Much better.

673
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,500
Much better.

674
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,980
He can drink.

675
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,500
Let’s have dinner first.

676
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,100
Dad, try this.

677
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,660
This is a dish my father cooked himself.

678
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,020
My father is very good at cooking.

679
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,900
Be quick to try it.

680
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,580
This, this, this

681
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,980
Scrambled Eggs with Tomatoes is his best
dish.

682
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,740
Help yourself.

683
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,460
Well, Dad.

684
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,380
Drink.

685
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,740
Here, Wu Bai.

686
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,980
Come on, Wu Bai,

687
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:11,980
let’s drink a cup.

688
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,820
Go easy on the wine.

689
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,620
Eat the dishes.

690
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,140
Eat the dishes.

691
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,860
How many people are there
in your family?

692
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,420
In China,

693
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,180
my older cousin is the owner
of my club.

694
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,460
My grandpa is also in China.

695
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,900
But he’s here for a family visit.

696
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,420
He’ll go back next month.

697
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,660
What about your parents?

698
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,700
They live in Norway most of the time.

699
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,740
Help yourself, help yourself.

700
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,180
What do your parents think of
a relationship

701
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,980
in which a woman is older than a man?

702
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,620
Dad, we are having dinner.

703
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,380
You ask so many questions.

704
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,140
Are you a census taker?

705
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,340
Be quick to eat, eat, eat.

706
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,980
Do you know what happened

707
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,180
to my daughter Jing?

708
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,860
Yes.

709
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,420
I was worrying

710
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,940
there would be a problem

711
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,820
on the side of the man’s parents.

712
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,580
It turned out

713
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,500
I got it right.

714
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,740
My sister

715
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,660
and I are different.

716
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,940
Yes, Dad.

717
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,740
Thing are different
for me and my sister.

718
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,140
You two stay out of this.

719
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,660
I was asking Wu Bai.

720
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,660
My parents are open-minded.

721
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,620
They respect my choice.

722
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,900
What do you think of your relationship

723
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,220
with my daughter Qing?

724
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,900
What is your plan?

725
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,740
Sir,

726
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,180
I’m not a glib talker.

727
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,220
But I’m serious.

728
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,380
Bai!

729
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,580
Let’s drink a toast!

730
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,900
You start to call him Bai right away.

731
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,220
OK, straightforward.

732
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,340
Here, wine bottle.

733
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,820
Come on, eat the dishes.

734
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,860
That’s right, Bai.

735
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,860
That’s cool, isn’t it?

736
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,180
Let’s drink another cup.

737
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,700
Go easy on the wine.

738
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,620
Go easy, go easy, go easy. OK.

739
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,140
Well done. You are a good brat.

740
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,660
Come on, eat some more.

741
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,260
I like eggs.

742
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,900
You are too thin. That won’t do.

743
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,420
You must eat some more.

744
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,420
Help yourself too, sir.

745
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,420
Yes.

746
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,700
Come on, come on, come on.

747
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,220
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

748
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,380
Let me tell you a secret.

749
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,140
When she was a child,

750
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,660
Qing liked running around naked
after a bath.

751
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,180
Dad, why are you telling him that?

752
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,260
When she was a child,

753
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,860
all other children

754
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,660
liked dolls and little skirts.

755
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,260
What did she like?

756
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,220
She liked Transformers and robots.

757
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,900
It worried me,

758
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,980
was she a boy or a girl?

759
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,260
Here, sir.

760
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,940
Here’s to you.

761
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,500
What sir?

762
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,540
Call me buddy.

763
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,660
I’m only a few years older than you.

764
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,660
From now on,

765
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,860
we are like brothers.

766
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,860
Brothers.

767
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,820
Here, drink it off.

768
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,820
OK, buddy.

769
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,580
Go easy, go easy on the wine.

770
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,180
I tell you what,

771
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,740
when you guys have an argument later on,

772
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,740
just tell me, your buddy.

773
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,100
I’ll give you advice.

774
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,900
Wu Bai calls Dad buddy.

775
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,060
Won’t he be your uncle?

776
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,220
Don’t be gloating.

777
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,380
Shen Zhe will be the next one.

778
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,380
Dad,

779
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,900
after a drink with him,

780
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,900
You’ve become sworn brothers?

781
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,220
You just don’t know.

782
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,980
When I firstly met Bai,

783
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,300
I knew

784
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,900
he’s a very dependable and honest child.

785
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,060
What child?

786
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,700
We are buddies, aren’t we?

787
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,540
For the sake of what my buddy says,

788
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,540
I’m gonna drink it off, drink it off.

789
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,340
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up.

790
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,740
Awesome, awesome.

791
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,860
You are awesome!

792
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,260
-Buddy, buddy, I must toast to you today.
-Enough.

793
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,140
Come on, come on, come on.

794
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:40,700
OK.

795
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,380
Don’t just drink.

796
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,180
Awesome, awesome.

797
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,140
No more drinking, no more drinking.

798
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,740
