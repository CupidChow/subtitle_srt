(Asian Robot Combat Expo 2021)

20
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,620
Welcome to

21
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,060
Asian Robot Combat Expo.

22
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,500
I’m Rachel, the host.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,940
Today, we’re having

24
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,380
Wu Bai from K&K Team

25
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,500
and Ai Qing from SP Team here.

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,780
Welcome.

27
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,220
(Asian Robot Combat Expo 2021)

28
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,220
From the presentations of this morning,

29
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,180
we found that

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,820
all the major teams
have made some changes.

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,500
May I ask you two

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,340
which team

33
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,940
impressed you the most?

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,780
In terms of impact power,

35
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,860
it should be AEO Team.

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,340
They have overturned
the former buildings of the masters.

37
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,220
Starting from zero. Such courage

38
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,100
deserves respects.

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,420
What about K&K Team?

40
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,980
I still kept my eyes on our old foe,
SP Team.

41
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,180
How to say it?

42
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,780
The upgrading of Sea Breeze in the final

43
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,940
floored us badly.

44
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,940
So, I’m quite curious about

45
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,900
what its upgrading target will be like.

46
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,900
Upgrading target?

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,340
Ai Qing,
could you introduce it for us?

48
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,260
Regarding the upgrading target
of Sea Breeze,

49
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,780
I’d like to thank K&K Team

50
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,740
for their help.

51
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,860
Shen Zhe has made an upgrading plan

52
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,660
targeting the weakness of Sea Breeze.

53
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,300
Basing on the plan,

54
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,100
we’ve made a further upgrade.

55
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,660
That’s why we won the competition.

56
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,500
What?

57
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,700
What’s the big deal?

58
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,020
OK. OK. As long as you like it.

59
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,740
Anyway, the loser is you, instead of me.

60
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,300
Don’t you dare to say that again!

61
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,980
But judged from the presentations
this morning,

62
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,340
Sea Breeze is still in upgrading.

63
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,980
Right.

64
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,060
We’re gonna upgrade

65
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,060
the whole operational program system
of it.

66
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,660
We’ve finished some parts of it.

67
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,540
What about K&K?

68
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,820
We just have improved

69
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,060
the master control chip

70
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,220
to make it

71
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,780
easier to operate.

72
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,460
In terms of the technical upgrading,

73
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,340
we’re not as good as SP yet.

74
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,380
No. In terms of Software Upgrading,

75
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,100
K&K has more says.

76
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,740
After all,
we’ve all seen their performances

77
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,380
in the presentations today.

78
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,740
We’re flattered.

79
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,020
Hearing you guys’ sharing,

80
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,460
I look forward to

81
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,220
the AMC very much now.

82
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,460
Due to the limited time,

83
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,860
this is all for the summit this time.

84
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,900
Thank you for your coming.

85
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,060
Thank our friends in the media industry

86
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,740
and everyone here for coming today.

87
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,820
Thank you, everyone.

88
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,140
See you next time.

89
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,460
Did you upgrade the Master Control
Chip with Captain?

90
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,580
No.

91
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,980
I thought you guys did it

92
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,380
in the training class.

93
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,540
Nope.

94
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,820
He’s been occupied in
training Shen Zhe lately.

95
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,500
How is that possible
he’d spend time with me?

96
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,780
The Expo really made me confused.

97
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,460
The two of them were
beating around the bush.

98
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,900
It’d be strange if you understand.

99
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,460
-Captain.
-Wu Bai.

100
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,340
Is what you and Ai Qing just said true?

101
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,540
Not exactly.

102
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,100
But Ai Qing said like she was serious.

103
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,820
What did he mean?

104
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,940
Shen Zhe operates the robots
aggressively,

105
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,660
but it doesn’t mean
he’s not capable enough.

106
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,340
So,

107
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,300
the upgrading of Master control chip
he just mentioned

108
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,460
is not their top priority.

109
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,620
So, you two were

110
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,420
deliberately mystifying the public.

111
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,500
Smart.

112
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,660
SP attacks with the way of defense.

113
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,220
Tao Qitao is prudent.

114
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,500
I guess their ultimate target

115
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,620
is to improve the defense capability
of Sea Breeze.

116
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,100
So now, the most important thing is

117
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
to find the right material.

118
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,380
At least we now know that

119
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,420
K&K is gonna upgrade their mechas.

120
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,180
As they are always aggressive,

121
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,420
the part they want to optimize the most

122
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,140
should be the weapon system.

123
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,460
Like

124
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,780
aerospace materials.

125
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,460
Aerospace materials?

126
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,900
We got the same target.

127
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,300
You mean Artificial Intelligence?

128
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,100
Does that mean the system
they’re gonna upgrade

129
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,140
is the same as ours?

130
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,900
Will they go to meet

131
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,060
Professor Zhang Yiming too,

132
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,100
the giant in the AI industry

133
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,340
who we want to work with all the time?

134
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,540
Make an appointment with Professor Zhang

135
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,580
tomorrow.

136
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,980
If so,

137
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,340
we gotta meet Professor Chen
immediately.

138
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,500
I’m on it.

139
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,540
At 10 AM tomorrow.

140
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,460
Professor Chen will be waiting for us

141
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,100
in his office at Material Department.

142
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,140
We can’t let SP go ahead of us twice.

143
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,500
Yes.

144
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,980
Captain,

145
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,980
don’t they want my autograph?

146
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,340
Enough with that.

147
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,220
Professor Chen is waiting. I know.

148
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,140
Ai Qing.

149
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,100
What a small world!

150
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,900
Captain, what’s our next move?

151
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,820
Shh…

152
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,700
What’s going on? Wait.

153
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,980
I saw Bai.

154
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,220
Who?

155
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,180
-Wu Bai.
-What brought him here?

156
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,340
Same target as ours,

157
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,620
he came for the professor definitely.

158
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,500
You, go that way.

159
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,100
Don’t let Ai Qing see you.

160
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,460
I’m going to see the professor.

161
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,980
You stall him for a while. Clear?

162
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,780
How?

163
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,420
Use your advantage, your strengths.

164
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,380
Aren’t you his girlfriend?
Just act cute.

165
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,780
I’ll stall her.

166
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,740
OK.

167
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,940
OK. Go.

168
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,740
I can handle it.

169
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,660
Act cute.

170
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,060
Act cute? How to act cute?

171
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,020
Bai.

172
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,500
What a small world!
What’re you doing here?

173
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,860
What a small world!

174
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,580
You

175
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,140
look decent in the suits.

176
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,860
Are you coming to meet
some important person?

177
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,020
Are you

178
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,700
coming to meet some pretty girl

179
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,420
behind my back?

180
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,380
No.

181
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,740
No way.

182
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,580
Seriously?

183
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,500
No.

184
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,500
I’m coming to see a teacher.

185
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,580
What about you?

186
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,180
Me?

187
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,900
I

188
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,940
come with my old friend

189
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,740
to meet his teacher.

190
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,340
I’m waiting for him here.

191
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,380
Use your advantage, your strengths.

192
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,860
Aren’t you his girlfriend?
Just act cute.

193
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,820
Bai,

194
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,900
I’m so hungry. What shall we do?

195
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,420
I’m really hungry.

196
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,060
By the way,

197
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,380
I heard that

198
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,420
the canteen of the college is awesome.

199
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,180
Shall we have a try?

200
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,340
I’m even having a stomachache.

201
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,180
Would you come with me, please?

202
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,660
Okay.

203
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,420
The teacher is in a meeting right now.

204
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,940
Let’s go to have some delicious food.

205
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,180
OK.

206
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,180
Let’s go.

207
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,060
What do you like to eat?

208
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,660
There’re too many delicious food
I wanna taste.

209
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,500
I can’t make the choice, Bai.

210
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,340
Every time when I see
so many yummy food,

211
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,260
I’m twisted to make choices.

212
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,980
I got allodoxaphobia.

213
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,260
Which one would you like to eat?

214
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,460
Anything will do.

215
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,500
You’re the boss.

216
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,700
I’m the boss?

217
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,180
Let me see.

218
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,860
What about Noodles with Pork Chop?

219
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,620
Good. I love that.

220
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,980
Noodles with Pork Chop.

221
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,180
Auntie,

222
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,260
how long will it take to make
Noodles with Pork Chop?

223
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,180
About 5 minutes.

224
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,580
5 minutes.

225
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,060
That soon?

226
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,660
I don’t want it.

227
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,700
It looks too oily.

228
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,780
It can’t be delicious.

229
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,820
Yeah.

230
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,060
Spicy Chicken.

231
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,980
Sounds good.

232
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,660
What about Spicy Chicken?

233
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,700
OK.

234
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,220
Auntie, how long will it take to
make Spicy Chicken?

235
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,940
Around 10 minutes.

236
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,020
Bai, for the sake of your stomach,

237
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,180
we’d better not eat spicy food
like that.

238
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,460
Let’s have some light food.

239
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,740
You like Cross Bridge Rice Noodles?

240
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,180
It works for me.

241
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,980
Auntie,

242
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,940
how long will it take to make
Cross Bridge Rice Noodles?

243
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,740
Around 10 minutes.

244
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,300
No. I don’t want it.

245
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,820
It’s tasteless. It won’t be good.

246
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,060
Auntie, do you have Chicken Hot Pot?

247
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,980
Yes, we do.

248
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,060
That’s great.

249
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,100
How long will it take to make
Chicken Hot Pot?

250
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,180
Approximately 15 minutes or so.

251
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,220
15 minutes? Terrific.

252
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,620
Yeah.

253
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,980
Then, we’ll have the Chicken Hot Pot.

254
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,140
Two, please.

255
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,980
-OK.
-Please boil the potatoes longer.

256
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,660
So does the chicken.

257
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,060
I’d like them to be soft.

258
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
OK.

259
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,540
Let’s have Chicken Hot Pot.

260
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,020
Ai Qing,

261
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,300
you can go find us the seats first.

262
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
I’ll wait for the food here.

263
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,180
OK.

264
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,660
By the way, Auntie,

265
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,180
remember to tell the cook
about my request.

266
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,180
Boil the food longer.

267
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,620
No problem.

268
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,260
Thank you.

269
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,300
It’s nothing. Don’t worry.

270
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,420
I’ll wait for you there.

271
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,980
What’s going on?

272
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,260
Don’t worry. I got it.

273
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,820
Auntie,

274
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,340
those dishes

275
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,540
we mentioned just now,

276
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,620
I want them all.

277
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,980
Please make sure
the meat is soft enough.

278
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,500
OK. I see. Don’t worry.

279
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,380
OK.

280
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,340
Wu Bai is occupied now.

281
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,340
Have you met Professor Zhang?

282
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,300
Chatting. Don’t worry.

283
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,580
Waiting for my good news.

284
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,740
What are you looking at?

285
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,420
Nothing.

286
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,180
Finished ordering?

287
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,060
Steam Buns.

288
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,380
You ordered Steam Buns?

289
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,660
Noodles with Pork Chop.

290
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,540
Thank you.

291
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,620
Upon your request.

292
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,300
Thank you, Auntie.

293
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,660
Enjoy.

294
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,060
I didn’t order noodles.

295
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,860
You…

296
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,820
I did. We’ve got more to be served.

297
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,740
Wooden bucket meal.

298
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,860
That’s too much for us.

299
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,980
Not done yet.

300
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,180
Cross Bridge Rice Noodles.

301
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,020
That’s all?

302
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,740
Chicken Hot Pot is the last one.

303
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,620
All your dishes are served.

304
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,740
Enjoy.

305
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,260
Bon appetite.

306
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,700
You…

307
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,540
Why did you order so much food?

308
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,300
You said you got allodoxaphobia.

309
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,060
So, I ordered them all.

310
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,300
How can I save time

311
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,860
for 97 if I didn’t order so much food?

312
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,980
What if we can’t eat them out?

313
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
It doesn’t matter.

314
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,980
We have enough time.

315
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,500
Take your time.

316
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,660
Right.

317
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,980
Thus, I can stall him longer.

318
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,060
Don’t rush.

319
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,820
You are right.

320
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,500
We have enough time

321
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,740
to finish these.

322
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,220
Then let’s take our time to eat.

323
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,620
If we can’t finish,
we can take them out.

324
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,300
-Enjoy your meal.
-You too.

325
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,380
Chopsticks.

326
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,860
Eat some potatoes.

327
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,620
Thank you. You too.

328
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,060
Try the chicken.

329
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,620
It tastes better
when you boil it longer.

330
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,100
Good?

331
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,420
Yeah.

332
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,300
Have some more.

333
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:19,860
Have some more.

334
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,380
Take your time. Don’t rush.

335
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,300
Are you satisfied?

336
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,100
If not, we can get back and eat more.

337
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,380
No, I’m good.

338
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,420
Actually, I’m full now.

339
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
I can’t have more.

340
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,860
I’m full, too.

341
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,860
Then,

342
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,980
do you want some drinks?

343
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,060
Sounds good.

344
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,860
(Slide)
We’ve reached a preliminary agreement.

345
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,260
Mission accomplished.

346
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,260
Professor Chen is glad
with our proposal.

347
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,260
Are you thirsty?

348
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,980
Let’s go get some drinks out there.

349
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,060
Bai.

350
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,300
I…

351
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,060
I won over you in the final

352
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,820
with some tricks.

353
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,100
Will you get mad at me?

354
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,500
I won’t.

355
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,860
That’s on the battlefield.

356
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,980
What if it’s outside the battlefield?

357
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,100
Same answer.

358
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,420
Why?

359
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,740
Because it is you.

360
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,580
Ai Qing,

361
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,260
if it was me who won you with tricks,

362
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,980
would you get mad at me?

363
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,980
Nope.

364
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,020
No way.

365
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,740
Does it mean

366
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,100
you’d get mad or not?

367
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,980
It’ll be great if you wouldn’t get mad

368
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,860
at me in today’s situation.

369
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:22,980
What’s wrong?

370
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,020
Nothing.

371
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,220
Just wanna hug you at this moment.

372
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,020
What’s wrong, Bai?

373
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,740
Just wanna hug you longer.

374
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,580
-I gotta go.
-I gotta go.

375
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,980
-Go ahead, then.
-Go ahead.

376
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,060
My friend said he’s done.

377
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,700
I’m going to meet him.

378
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,020
Call me.

379
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,220
OK.

380
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,660
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

381
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,220
Did you meet the professor?

382
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,980
Don’t worry. I got it.

383
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,180
OK. Let’s go back to the club.

384
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,220
Your acting skill is improved.

385
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,740
Of course. Unlike you,

386
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,260
you won’t hide even after seeing us.

387
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,100
I thought I would be

388
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,060
the top meritorious man of this meeting.

389
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,940
Never expect that

390
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,180
you got a honey trap for him.
Good for you.

391
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,460
Stop it. Let’s go.

392
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,180
Boss,

393
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,660
you wanna see us?

394
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,860
Did you just meet Professor Zhang?

395
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,500
Yeah.

396
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,380
We even went ahead of K&K.

397
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,460
Not really.

398
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,260
What’s this?

399
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,220
Take a look.

400
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,860
K&K Club and Jiaodong University

401
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,820
have reached a strategic agreement?

402
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,500
(K&K Club and Jiaodong University)
Let me see.

403
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,540
(Aerospace Materials May Become the
New Trend of Mecha in the Future.)

404
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,100
(The Future of Aerospace Technology
Relies on the Aerospace Materials.)

405
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,860
Didn’t Wu Bai go for Professor Zhang

406
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,260
of AI department?

407
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,380
Apparently,

408
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,580
Professor Chen majoring
in Aerospace Material

409
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,980
was his real target.

410
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,300
Both Wu Bai and I

411
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,420
had thought we were gonna meet

412
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,940
the same professor.

413
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,140
So we deliberately stalled each other.

414
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,100
You two are a perfect match.

415
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,540
Now, both SP and K&K had finished

416
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,740
the upgrading of devices
to some degrees.

417
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,940
Next,

418
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,780
win or lose shall be
up to you guys’ abilities.

419
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,340
(SP Club and Jiaodong University
have reached a strategic agreement.)

420
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,700
(Can AI change the future
of Combat Robots?)

421
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,100
Captain. It’s awkward.

422
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,980
Their target is not Aerospace Material,

423
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,500
but AI.

424
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,460
I just saw it.

425
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,620
She had used the art of war,

426
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,340
and now she sets you a honey trap.

427
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,020
Are you gonna play all the tricks

428
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,580
with Ai Qing?

429
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,060
Don’t mention it.

430
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,220
Call Zhou Yi and Xiaomi,

431
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,100
to set up a meeting with Professor Chen.

432
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,460
Got it.

433
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,140
Zhou Yi.

434
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,900
It’s a burden
when you got too many fans.

435
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,580
They are looking at Captain.

436
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,140
Talk less if you don’t know what to say.

437
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,020
Damn it.

438
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,940
Why would I always come across

439
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,100
these little rug rats?

440
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,420
Hi uncles, are you coming to pick up
your children from school?

441
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,700
How dare you call us uncles?

442
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,940
We’re still young,

443
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,740
right?

444
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,420
Yeah.

445
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,140
Our average age might be

446
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,180
younger than yours.

447
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,100
No way.

448
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,460
Anything is possible.

449
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,220
Where’s Shen Zhe?

450
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,660
He went to get the present.

451
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,420
He’ll join us in a few minutes.

452
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,300
Shen Zhe has a word for you.

453
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,140
The competition last time

454
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,860
was the present he gave you.

455
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,820
This time in AMC,
he won’t be that kind.

456
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,260
Me too.

457
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,220
Enough.

458
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,660
We’re going to see
Professor Zhang later.

459
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,620
What about you?

460
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,340
We made an appointment
with Professor Chen.

461
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,220
Good.

462
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,140
Don’t let the professors wait.

463
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,060
Let’s go.

464
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,860
-Enough.
-Let’s go.

465
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,460
Coach Ai Qing,

466
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,460
you have foresight.

467
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,540
Captain Wu Bai,

468
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,140
you’re too humble.

469
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,540
Call you later.

470
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,820
OK.

471
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,620
Just in time.

472
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,140
I got it.

473
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,260
Here?

474
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,220
Yeah.

475
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,340
Here you are.

476
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,940
-Nian.
-Mrs. Han.

477
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Hello, Mrs. Han.

478
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,940
You look more beautiful today, Mrs. Han.

479
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,380
You’re really impressive, Mrs. Han.

480
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,020
We can now work with the
Materials Science Department.

481
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,780
Thank you for your introduction.

482
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,900
You’re very welcome.

483
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,900
I’m so glad that I can help.

484
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,140
You’re helping us for Boss’s sake.

485
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,780
We’re families, right?

486
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,380
Yeah.

487
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,300
You got a honey mouth.

488
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,780
Let me show you our lab.

489
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,420
-OK.
-OK.

490
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,620
This way.

491
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,460
Your campus looks great.

492
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,380
Yeah.

493
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,220
I even want to go back to schooltime.

494
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,020
There you go. This is the lab.

495
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,860
OK.

496
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,860
Wu Bai.

497
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,140
Can I have a small talk with you?

498
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,900
Wait for me inside.

499
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,540
We’re going in then.

500
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,180
What’s the matter?

501
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,740
It’s just that

502
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,380
Han Shangyan proposed to me.

503
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,300
Propose?

504
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,780
But I was not ready for that,

505
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,340
so, I refused him.

506
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,820
Will he…?

507
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,500
It doesn’t matter.

508
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
He won’t mind that.

509
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,300
Will he get hurt

510
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,140
so that he won’t marry me?

511
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,220
Don’t get me wrong.

512
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,660
I’m not in a rush to get married.

513
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,580
I just worry that…

514
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,420
From what I know about him,

515
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,540
except for you,

516
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,820
nobody can stand him
with his bad temper.

517
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,860
If you still worry,

518
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,100
you can always meet him at our club.

519
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,460
I feel relieved now.

520
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,140
By the way, I’ve learned how
to make Latte Art.

521
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,780
I can make you coffee then.

522
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,740
Great.

523
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,660
Let’s go inside.

524
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,980
No, thanks. I still got classes.

525
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,060
You may go now.

526
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,780
See you, Bai.

527
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,660
See you.

528
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,340
What Professor’s pet student

529
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,700
would be like?

530
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,700
Isn’t Professor Zhang teaching us today?

531
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,860
He’s got some emergencies today.

532
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,940
So, he asked his pet student
to give the lesson.

533
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,260
How awesome should the student be?

534
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,220
Will he be a typical coder

535
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,580
wearing a plaid shirt

536
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,220
and a pair of black-framed glasses?

537
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,460
That’s your stereotype.

538
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,220
Not all the science geeks
dress like that.

539
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,580
We’re kind of coders.

540
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,260
-Right.
-Look at what we’re wearing, right?

541
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,700
What is he supposed to look like?

542
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,500
At least, he should look like me.

543
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,180
Stop it.

544
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,700
The teacher is coming.

545
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,660
He will definitely not look like you.

546
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,020
Are you sure?

547
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,460
That’ll be a disaster
if he looks like you.

548
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,220
How come she…?

549
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,660
Who…

550
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,540
Who is she?

551
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,620
Hello, everyone.

552
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,860
I’m Tong Nian,

553
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,900
your substitute teacher.

554
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,060
The one who gave us lesson

555
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,740
is Han Shangyan’s girlfriend.

556
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,260
I heard that Han Shangyan,
the boss of K&K

557
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,340
has a girlfriend
who is still studying in school.

558
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,580
That should be her.

559
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,700
That pretty girl who taught us

560
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,340
just now?

561
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,380
Yeah.

562
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,820
Never expect that

563
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,660
you’re the pet student
of Professor Zhang.

564
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,780
We’ve detoured.

565
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,220
I just get to know that

566
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,740
my teacher is working with you.

567
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,460
Wu Bai amazed me.

568
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,940
I never know this iceberg

569
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,460
could be melt someday.

570
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,460
Iceberg?

571
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,660
Seriously?

572
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,860
Of course.

573
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,020
He became more talkative at least.

574
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,580
That’s true.

575
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,780
Actually…

576
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,620
What?

577
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,260
Your man is here.

578
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,100
I gotta go.

579
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,780
OK.

580
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,500
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

581
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
Are you

582
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,180
worried that I would steal away

583
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,260
the secrets of K&K?

584
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,700
Is that necessary
to watch me this tight?

585
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,820
No.

586
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,820
I just want to see you.

587
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,780
I heard you used to
have a blind date Tong Nian.

588
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,820
That was a mistake.

589
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,780
Tell me more.

590
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,780
She’s a family friend.

591
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,300
So, my grandfather wanted to

592
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
introduce me to her.

593
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,380
Then?

594
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,380
I told him

595
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,500
Tong Nian is Han Shangyan’s girlfriend,

596
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
the boys in our club call her Mrs. Han.

597
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,300
Do you always feed Han with humble pie?

598
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,780
So,

599
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,860
deep down in your heart,

600
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,980
you’re naughty.

601
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,780
Just a little.

602
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,580
Bai,

603
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,020
can you share with me

604
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,860
what you feel like during a blind date?

605
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,300
I’m not the main role of the blind date.

606
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,980
What can I feel?

607
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,100
Bai.

608
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,700
Just tell me.

609
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,860
By the way,

610
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,020
didn’t you have a blind date with someone

611
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,740
during Spring Festival?

612
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,940
Tell me about it.

613
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,140
What did you feel?

614
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,860
My blind date

615
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,940
is different to

616
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,780
yours.

617
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,580
Different?

618
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,900
Yeah.

619
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,780
Seriously?

620
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,860
Yeah.

621
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,820
What’s the difference?

622
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,100
-What’s the difference?
-It’s different.

623
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,900
What’s the difference?

624
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,660
-It’s different. Just different.
-Tell me about it.

625
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,500
Come on.

626
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,340
Tell me what the difference is. OK.

627
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,500
Same. OK?

628
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,300
My mistake. My mistake.

629
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,740
My fault.

630
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,380
I give in.

631
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,300
Same or not?

632
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:41,900
Same.

633
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,420
Then tell me about it.

634
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,700
Accelerate. Come on.

635
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,340
It feels good to be young.

636
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
You wanna be like that?

637
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,700
Come on.

638
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
Come on.

639
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,780
Isn’t that inappropriate?

640
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,620
I’m too old to do that.

641
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
Come on.

642

Where’re Captain and Shen Zhe?

649
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,620
Why haven’t they arrived?

650
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,180
Shen Zhe is taking a call.

651
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,900
As for Captain,

652
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,820
just don’t bother him.

653
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,540
The campus is really vigorous.

654
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,060
You bet.

655
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,420
I’m telling you.

656
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,300
If I pay more effort into relationships,

657
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:01,980
I would have had

658
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,860
plenty of girls who wait in line

659
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,420
from Shanghai to Suzhou
to be my girlfriend.

660
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,060
Stop bragging.

661
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,340
It’s true. Trust me.

662
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,180
-OK. OK.
-It’s true.

663
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,580
Excuse me,

664
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,740
can you do me a favor?

665
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,300
Yeah, it’s you I’m talking to,
handsome.

666
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,220
What can I help?

667
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,500
We’re having a basketball game

668
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,780
with Civil Engineering Department.

669
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,060
We need your help.

670
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,700
Basketball game?

671
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,980
I…

672
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,060
Help us, please.

673
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,580
Come on, you handsome.

674
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,500
OK.

675
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,340
No problem. You have my words.

676
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,060
I

677
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,540
will definitely slay them all.

678
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,420
Great.

679
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,060
Besides, I got a buddy who can help too.

680
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,100
Don’t worry about that.

681
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,820
Fantastic. We have two uniforms here.

682
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,700
-Uniforms?
-Uniforms?

683
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,580
Basketball game.
We need to wear the uniform.

684
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,260
-Yeah. OK.
-Where’s the fitting room?

685
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,300
This way.

686
00:27:50,620 --> 00:28:09,060
-Come on, Material Department.
-Come on, Civil Engineering Department.

687
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,340
I can’t take it anymore.

688
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:23,420
-Come on, Material Department.
-Come on, Civil Engineering Department.

689
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,340
I can’t take it anymore.

690
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,380
What’s up?

691
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,940
The emergency you said

692
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,780
that you need my help

693
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,300
is to be a mascot?

694
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:38,700
-Come on, Material Department.
-Come on, Civil Engineering Department.

695
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,020
Come on. Put it on.

696
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,820
But…

697
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,260
Come on. Put it on.

698
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:48,700
-Come on, Material Department.
-Come on, Civil Engineering Department.

699
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,220
Come on. Put it on.

700
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
Aren’t we supposed to play basketball?

701
00:28:51,220 --> 00:29:08,100
-Come on, Material Department.
-Come on, Civil Engineering Department.

702
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,060
Listen,

703
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,820
you look from here.

704
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,420
What are you laughing about?

705
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,820
-Wu Bai.
-Come here, Wu Bai.

706
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,340
97 and Zhou Yi are popular now.

707
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,460
Look.

708
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,780
That’s so funny.

709
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,580
Here they come.

710
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,220
What’s wrong?

711
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,900
I’ve uploaded your photos to the forum,

712
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,660
you are famous now.

713
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,700
Why would you have the account
of Jiaodong University’s forum?

714
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,020
I borrowed it from

715
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,700
the girl who asked you for help.

716
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,420
She’s quite happy with that

717
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,020
and said thus, the popularity

718
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,900
of their cheering squad would be raised.

719
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
I knew the more beautiful a girl is,

720
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,180
the craftier she is.

721
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,300
Why do I always meet such damn things?

722
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,060
Yeah.

723
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,900
You’re out of luck

724
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,940
and you implicated me.

725
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,300
That because you want
to draw her attention.

726
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,580
I…

727
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,540
What’re you doing?

728
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,580
I’m drafting a Weibo
with Coach’s account.

729
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,020
How dare you post it on Weibo? Stop.

730
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,580
Give me that.

731
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,020
I clicked “post” already.

732
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,300
-Posted.
-Delete it.

733
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,860
Both SP and K&K have finished

734
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,500
the upgrading of their robots.

735
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,460
The training of the teams
before the AMC

736
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,020
also starts gradually.

737
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,420
Both the two teams

738
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,340
(15 days Countdown to the League 2021)
are fighting for the world champion.

739
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
Come in.

740
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,700
Doggie.

741
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,020
Your guests arrived.

742
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,220
Take them in.

743
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,900
OK.

744
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,220
Hi. I’m Ai Qing, the coach of SP.

745
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,540
Welcome.
It must be a long journey from Beijing.

746
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,100
It’s our honor to

747
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,660
participate in the training classes
with SP.

748
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,700
Please be seated.

749
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,220
OK.

750
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,580
Let me play a video for you guys.

751
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,820
(Trash Can)

752
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,980
I don’t want to blame you,

753
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
but don’t waste food.

754
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,420
When will Captain give me

755
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,380
special training?

756
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,460
He paid all his efforts
to train Shen Zhe.

757
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,780
Will he start to train me

758
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,420
when he is free?

759
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,180
That’ll be too late.

760
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,860
Did he give up on me?

761
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,500
No way will he do that.

762
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,780
No one comes for interview recently.

763
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,460
Although I’m not that

764
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,340
capable right now,

765
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,580
but I still got space to make progress,

766
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,580
right?

767
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,340
Stop guessing.

768
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,780
Don’t be alarmed.

769
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,540
You’ll be the next after Shen Zhe.

770
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,460
-Really?
-Come on. Eat a chicken feet.

771
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,700
That should be given to Shen Zhe.

772
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,420
What do you want me to eat?

773
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,140
Zhou Yi.

774
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,780
Buy 97 some pig heads tomorrow.

775
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,780
Why would we need pig heads?

776
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,660
What we need are

777
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,180
Golden Metal Shrimp Dumplings.

778
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,380
They bring good luck.

779
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,580
The more dumplings you eat,
the more golden metals you can get.

780
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,580
The dumplings taste really good.

781
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,020
Captain.

782
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,820
Come on.

783
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,300
This is your favorite shrimp stuffing.

784
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,580
Eat as much as you want.

785
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,820
When do you plan to train me?

786
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,780
Have you finished

787
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,100
your welding speed practice?

788
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,620
Let me test.

789
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,580
Let’s go.

790
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,860
Are you testing right now?

791
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,620
You can do it later.

792
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,260
I can’t wait.

793
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,780
You’re so active.

794
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,780
Remember to buy some pig heads for him.

795
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
Give me one.

796
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,220
It’s so delicious.

797
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,860
I’ve spent half of the day

798
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,180
to communicate with the Anvil Team.

799
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,420
I’m exhausted and don’t wanna move now.

800
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,500
Did you feel your life
has been enriched?

801
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,620
Yes, I did.

802
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,100
Where’s Qitao?

803
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,020
I can learn a lot from

804
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,700
the communications with Anvil Team.

805
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,180
Pay more effort and study hard.

806
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,140
Guys,

807
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,980
finished?

808
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,380
Coach,

809
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,660
we’re good.

810
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,780
Shall we take a break in the afternoon?

811
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,780
No.

812
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,860
No?

813
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,180
Shall we play the basketball

814
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,020
to stretch ourselves?

815
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,260
Basketball?

816
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,460
Hooray!

817
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,620
I like your slogan.

818
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,140
Let’s see how many scores you can get.

819
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,700
Come on. We have Qitao,

820
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,460
right?

821
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,420
Yeah.

822
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,460
You don’t have to worry.

823
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,460
I asked SP Team II

824
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,140
to be your rivals.

825
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,180
Don’t lose to them.

826
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,620
Don’t lose my face.

827
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,100
If you lose,

828
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,500
I gotta stand in for Team II’s coach.

829
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,580
Don’t worry.

830
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,980
We won’t.

831
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,660
Yeah.

832
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,380
You got me.

833
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,380
They…

834
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,580
I’ll see.

835
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,580
Go get prepared.

836
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,460
-OK.
-Put on your clothes and go.

837
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,980
-Let’s go get changed.
-Go. Go. Go.

838
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,300
The plate!

839
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,700
Withdraw it for me.

840
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,580
-Here you are, Captain.
-Thank you, Captain.

00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,180
we can balance between work and leisure.

858
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,180
You can have two days off.

859
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
Where are we going?

860
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,380
You’ll see.

861
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,100
Captain.

862
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,500
Captain.

863
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,900
Didn’t you say that
we can have two days off?

864
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,420
Then, why do you still
take us for training?

865
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,500
Combat Robots

866
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,860
have strict requirements

867
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,900
in the responsiveness
and concentration of athletes.

868
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,020
Basketball game can promote
your capacity of reaction

869
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,060
and train your muscles.

870
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,100
So that is training.

871
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,500
I worry that you’d get bored

872
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,700
and become silly in the room.

873
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,540
I’m not silly.

874
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,620
You’ve worked hard

875
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,420
these days.

876
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,580
Work out

877
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,060
and stretch yourself.

878
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,220
OK.

879
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,700
Come on.

880
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,660
Do you think

881
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,580
our basketball playing is just like

882
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,460
our operating?

883
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,740
You mean we’re defense-oriented

884
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,820
and water-tight?

885
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,660
Right.

886
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,140
But not exactly.

887
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,820
Our teammates

888
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,780
are elites

889
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,980
who slay their enemies quietly.

890
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
Pervasive,

891
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,060
and invisible.

892
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,420
In Solo’s words, we’re dark

893
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,860
and dangerous.

894
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,380
If we have to use a sentence
to describe SP, that will be

895
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,420
“SP

896
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,380
is like a dark sea

897
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,900
which can get all the enemies
drowned quietly.”

898
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,340
What about K&K?

899
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,180
K&K?

900
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,860
If SP

901
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,140
is like a dark sea

902
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,020
which can get all the enemies
drowned quietly,

903
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,300
then, K&K

904
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,060
would be like a glorious sword.

905
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,780
Nice. Shen Zhe.

906
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,780
K&K used to

907
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,300
operate like a storm.

908
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,580
Thus, they can put the competition
to an end quickly.

909
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,580
But it’s a double-edged sword.

910
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,340
If they can’t drag their enemy into

911
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,500
their own pace in the beginning,

912
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,740
then it’s quite possible their own pace

913
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,900
would be disordered.

914
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,900
But

915
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,900
that will be our chance.

916
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,940
Pass it to me.

917
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
Xiaomi.

918
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,540
-Keep an eye for him.
-I…

919
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,940
-Perfect.
-Perfect.

920
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,860
The training class works, Captain.

921
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,740
I knew what 97 was gonna do

922
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,220
before he made his next move.

923
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,300
If the old K&K

924
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,620
was known to be a lonely wolf,

925
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,780
then, the current K&K
who knows its weakness

926
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,900
and learns how to do team work

927
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,580
will never be defeated.

928
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,340
Good job.

929
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,100
Come on, SP.

930
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,380
Come on.

931
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,060
Slide,

932
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,020
you stay here and keep an eye on them.

933
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,300
I gotta get back to my office.

934
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,260
OK.

935
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,980
Come on.

936
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,940
Defend him!

937
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,940
You called this relax?

938
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,420
I feel more tired
than running for ten miles.

939
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,580
When did you run for ten miles?

940
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,580
Your highest record is 3 miles.

941
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,380
Can’t you live

942
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,700
without satirizing me?

943
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,940
I’m just being honest.

944
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,540
Stop moaning.

945
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,460
Work-out is good for your health

946
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,580
and enables you to extend your career.

947
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,100
I’m afraid I’ll be dead

948
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,140
before my career life being extended.

949
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,460
I never expect that

950
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,540
my career life is not ended up in Botts,

951
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,740
but here.

952
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,900
You wanna be on Botts?

953
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,020
Yeah.

954
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,260
I got to know Combat Robots in Botts

955
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,820
when I was a child.

956
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,980
And I swore when I grow up,

957
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,540
I’d be on that stage.

958
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,500
I watched Botts when I was in school.

959
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,940
In school?

960
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,180
How did you get to know Combat Robots?

961
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,420
From TV shows when I was young.

962
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,700
There was a robot combat contest.

963
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,300
Robot combat contest?

964
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,420
The TV station rebroadcasted

965
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,380
the UK Robot Combat Contest.

966
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,660
None of you watched that?

967
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,380
That might be our gap in age.

968
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,180
No worries.

969
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,660
Anyway, we all got to know robots

970
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,860
through TV shows.

971
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,940
Yeah.

972
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,620
Something like that.

973
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,620
I didn’t.

974
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,540
I was picked because I was doing great

975
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,620
in the Science
and Technology Training Camp.

976
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,780
Captain, what about you?

977
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,660
I attained such knowledge

978
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,700
when I studied in Norway,

979
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,460
our school organized us
to watch the match.

980
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,380
See?

981
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,420
Here we go, the man on top

982
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,460
of K&K’s food chain.

983
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,580
Captain, have you started to like robots

984
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,940
since then?

985
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,260
Not really.

986
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,900
I got interested in robots

987
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,580
when I came back to China

988
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,100
and my brother took me
to see their competition.

989
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,300
Hi.

990
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,380
Uncle.

991
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,540
Is that our father-in-law?

992
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,420
Yes.

993
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,940
I’m available.

994
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,220
So is Shen Zhe. He’s available too.

995
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,820
Then, you can take Ai Qing back home

996
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,660
and we can have dinner together.

997
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,260
-I’m available too.
-OK.

998
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,020
See you tonight, Uncle.

999
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,300
Shen Zhe?

1000
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,220
What about Shen Zhe?

1001
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,220
He’s available too.

1002
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,860
Are you gonna see our father-in-law?

1003
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,500
You promised to take me to see him,

1004
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
so that the three of us
can be sworn brothers.

1005
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,740
When did I promise you?

1006
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,740
Come on. Last time,

1007
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,020
you two got drunk

1008
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,180
and when you got out,
you said you’re gonna take me to…

1009
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,020
-Hey.
-Shut up.

1010
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,500
I was so drunk.

1011
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,660
Next time, I promise.

1012
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,140
You guys have a good rest. I gotta go.

1013
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,540
OK. See you.

1014
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,500
Wu Bai. Hey.

1015
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,380
♪Missing you♪

1016
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,340
♪Missing you♪

1017
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,220
♪You come to my dream♪

1018
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,140
♪Missing you♪

1019
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,540
♪Missing you♪

1020
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,500
People always describe the girl in love

1021
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,380
as a princess.

1022
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,820
But this time,

1023
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,500
I’ll take off with my knight

1024
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,900
together.

1025
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,020
In the past,

1026
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,500
it was him
who blocked the huge rock for me.

1027
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,940
Now, it’s time for me

1028
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,460
to stop the monster for him.

1029
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,620
We’ll walk through the grassland
with flowers bloomed,

1030
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,260
and the dark valleys.

1031
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,820
It doesn’t matter

1032
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,180
if the devil dragon still exists.

1033
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,700
The most important thing is,

1034
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,300
every single star along the way knows

1035
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,780
there’s the same glittering

1036
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,340
in our eyes as well.
