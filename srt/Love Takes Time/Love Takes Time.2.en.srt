1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,033
(This drama is based on a true story.)

2
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:02,033
(The plot was adjusted for entertainment purposes only.)

3
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:03,033
(We have no intention to offend any careers, )

4
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:04,033
(encourage immoral sexual values, )

5
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:05,033
(or create a pessimistic disposition of a gender or a group of people.)

6
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:07,866
(We would like to apologize in advance for any misunderstandings.)

7
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,333
(Presents)

8
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:26,333
(Theory of Love)

9
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,333
Do you really not like guys?

10
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:29,533
I don’t like guys.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,166
Then prove it.

12
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,100
You’re expressing that you’re in love with someone.

13
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,333
Like this?

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,700
She kissed you

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,933
and flirted with you.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,666
You slept with her, didn’t you?

17
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:44,400
Sandy, don’t be ridiculous.

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,500
That woman is of no use in your life at all.

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,333
She doesn’t even love you that much.

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,266
Almost ten years... what was all of that?

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Tell me.

22
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,266
What am I to you?

23
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,566
Where are you going?

24
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,166
It’s late.

25
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,766
How long was I asleep?

26
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:48,000
You were probably tired, so you fell asleep.

27
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,800
If you’re still sleepy,

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,266
you can keep resting.

29
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:52,866
You can even sleep over.

30
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:56,633
Wait.

31
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:58,566
April.

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,633
About what happened tonight...

33
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:06,866
I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to.

34
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,400
Where are you going?

35
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:11,566
Are you going to see Sandy?

36
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,100
So what are you two then?

37
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,433
She’s my best friend.

38
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:18,900
Please excuse me. I’m sorry.

39
00:03:55,366 --> 00:04:00,066
Happy birthday to you

40
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:07,933
Make a wish.

41
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,933
The only wish I have

42
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,633
is to always have Tan in my life, Aoy and Chod.

43
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:20,533
I hope we always have each other.

44
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:37,933
Happy birthday.

45
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,900
Thank you.

46
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Here.

47
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
Happy birthday.

48
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,166
I wish you lots of happiness.

49
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
And here,

50
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:15,566
this is your present.

51
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,433
You told me not to get anything expensive,

52
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,400
so I got you these.

53
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,733
Here.

54
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:38,300
This one is mine,

55
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,633
and this one is yours.

56
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,833
They’re so adorable.

57
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Thank you.

58
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
I thought you wouldn’t come this year.

59
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:02,366
Of course I would.

60
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:03,833
I have to come.

61
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,700
Sandy.

62
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:16,233
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,300
I was a little stressed out.

64
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:22,666
I went out for a drink and fell asleep.

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,733
When I woke up, I came here right away.

66
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:30,733
I'm really sorry.

67
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
It's okay.

68
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:34,633
I understand.

69
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,333
No wonder you reeked of alcohol the moment you walked in.

70
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,266
Invite me next time.

71
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,166
Eat some more.

72
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,133
No.

73
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Sandy.

74
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,500
About April

75
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,000
and our fight at lunch...

76
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:26,866
when I didn’t ask you to join our work discussion,

77
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:28,533
I’m sorry.

78
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,200
I’m also sorry

79
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,366
for being rude to you.

80
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,333
If you were still mad at me

81
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,866
and didn’t come see me like you used to every year,

82
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:43,833
I would have understood.

83
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:49,800
Like I said,

84
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,800
I have to come.

85
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,266
I wasn’t mad at you.

86
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Then,

87
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,500
can I ask you for something?

88
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,500
If anything comes up with April,

89
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:10,200
I want you to be honest with me.

90
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,400
If you have to discuss work,

91
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,400
I want to join you.

92
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,133
I honestly don’t trust this woman.

93
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Well...

94
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,366
you should go to bed. I’ll get going.

95
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,333
Tan.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,433
It’s really late,

97
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,033
and you’ve been drinking.

98
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,633
You should stay over.

99
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:47,933
I wouldn’t be comfortable

100
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,600
if you were to drive home now.

101
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,533
- I... - Tan.

102
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,700
Happy birthday.

103
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:20,466
Happy birthday.

104
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,766
I wish you lots of happiness.

105
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:32,966
Tan.

106
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:35,766
Sandy.

107
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:37,900
I brought you some clothes.

108
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:44,233
Thank you.

109
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:46,533
Tan.

110
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:49,766
We’ve known each other for ten years now,

111
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,266
and you’ve always treated me

112
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,500
like I’m more than a friend or a sister.

113
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:57,700
But we’ve never defined

114
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:00,833
our relationship.

115
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:07,466
I don’t just want cards expressing your good feelings toward me.

116
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,166
The present I want most from you

117
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,233
is a clear definition of our relationship.

118
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:43,566
Sandy.

119
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:45,466
Sandy.

120
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
What is it?

121
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,000
I brought you some clothes.

122
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:58,866
Thank you.

123
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,266
Sandy.

124
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,566
Why couldn’t I reach you?

125
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:29,966
Are you all right?

126
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,666
Sandy!

127
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,900
- Tan. - Sandy.

128
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:43,600
What's wrong?

129
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,533
Sandy, what's wrong?

130
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,200
You’re burning up.

131
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,900
Why didn’t you call me? I couldn’t reach you.

132
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,233
I'm sorry, I...

133
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:03,233
I passed out and didn’t know my phone died.

134
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,033
How about this?

135
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,900
From now on, you need to give me a spare key,

136
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:09,733
so I can help if something happens.

137
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,366
Okay, Tan.

138
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:15,733
Take some medicine.

139
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:17,133
Here's your water.

140
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
Thank you.

141
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,333
You're burning up.

142
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,266
You had the medicine, so you’ll be fine.

143
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:45,666
Thank you, Tan.

144
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Get some rest.

145
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:49,366
I'll help you.

146
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:01,466
I’ll sleep outside.

147
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,666
Call me if you need anything.

148
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:07,433
Okay.

149
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,833
I'm sorry, Sandy.

150
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Are you cold?

151
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Come here.

152
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,900
Are you feeling better?

153
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,033
When I was young and had a fever,

154
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,166
my mom would hold me like this.

155
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:52,433
I’ll keep you company tonight,

156
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,433
so I can help if you need me to.

157
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,233
Thank you, Tan.

158
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,800
There were many times we had the chance to take things further,

159
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,900
but it never happened, Aoy and Chod.

160
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,666
The nicer he is to me,

161
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:38,800
the more willing I am to stay stuck in this label-less relationship.

162
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,800
- Tan. - Yes?

163
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,766
Get home safely.

164
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:54,266
Okay.

165
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
Sandy.

166
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:14,733
I have something to tell you.

167
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,933
I told you that I went drinking and passed out last night,

168
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
but actually...

169
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:25,066
I...

170
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,566
I was at a party at April’s.

171
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,466
I had to go because of work.

172
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,832
I thought it'd be beneficial since there were people from the industry.

173
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,833
And I...

174
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,533
couldn’t say no to her.

175
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,066
I was going to tell you and invite you,

176
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,700
but you were still mad at me. I didn’t know what to say.

177
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,999
So I thought I’d go briefly,

178
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,233
but it was really late when I left.

179
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54,766
I'm really sorry, Sandy.

180
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,733
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

181
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:06,833
I understand.

182
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:14,300
About April’s photoshoot,

183
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,700
I think it’s a good opportunity for us.

184
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,799
But if you disagree, I’ll tell her that I refuse...

185
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,866
I’m fine with it.

186
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,833
If you say

187
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,066
this gig is good for our future,

188
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:29,833
I’ll help you.

189
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,966
I’ll help you the best I can.

190
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Thank you.

191
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,700
Thank you for understanding.

192
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:47,466
I'll get going.

193
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Bye.

194
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,000
(April)

195
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,400
(April)

196
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,633
The person you should be paying attention to

197
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,100
is me.

198
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,200
Look at the guests here.

199
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,866
That’s the future waiting for you.

200
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,633
Don’t waste your time.

201
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:49,800
A talented photographer like you

202
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:52,900
belongs with a well‑connected model

203
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:54,033
like me.

204
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,800
Why wait for someone who doesn’t deserve you?

205
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,600
(April)

206
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,333
Good morning.

207
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,933
Yes, April.

208
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:20,500
I saw your missed call.

209
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,500
I was worried and wanted to make sure you got home fine.

210
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,500
But you probably went to bed, so you turned your phone off.

211
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
I didn’t want to bother you.

212
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:32,000
You would’ve called me once you woke up.

213
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900
I...

214
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,633
April, I want to talk to you about last night.

215
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
It's fine.

216
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:43,233
Don’t overthink it. It’s nothing.

217
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:47,800
I understand if you’re not ready to commit.

218
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,100
If you were, you'd be in a relationship by now.

219
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,566
I’m fine with you not being in a rush.

220
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,666
Let me remind you.

221
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,666
I’m making it clear that I like you.

222
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,566
I...

223
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,733
I’ll wait for you to confirm the date for the photoshoot.

224
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,666
Okay.

225
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,100
I want to see you as early as possible too.

226
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
See you soon.

227
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,066
Okay.

228
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:31,000
Good.

229
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Keep going, April.

230
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,300
Beautiful.

231
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:37,466
Great, keep that pose.

232
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,966
Okay, that's beautiful. Keep that pose.

233
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,832
Do I look beautiful, Tanwa?

234
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,233
Yes.

235
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Good.

236
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,033
Just like that.

237
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,333
Let me get a close-up.

238
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:52,033
Don't move.

239
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,766
Beautiful. Look down.

240
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:55,366
That's it.

241
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,633
Two more shots.

242
00:21:58,266 --> 00:21:59,266
One.

243
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:00,966
Okay.

244
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:03,233
One.

245
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,433
- I'm sorry. - Be careful.

246
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Are you all right?

247
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:09,700
I'm fine, but that was close. Thank you.

248
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,933
You should move back a little.

249
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,033
- Okay. - It's dangerous.

250
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,933
- I think we got it. - Okay.

251
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,266
- Should we check the photos? - Sure.

252
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,933
Could you please help me?

253
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,700
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

254
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,200
- Please. - Thank you.

255
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,900
But don't bother.

256
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:47,433
I already discussed the details with the other client.

257
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,500
Since you wanted more details,

258
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,000
I asked them to recheck everything one more time.

259
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,800
I’ll finalize with them and see you at the other set.

260
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:59,500
Thank you. I’ll head there now.

261
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:01,033
Sure.

262
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:02,966
Let’s move to the other set, everyone.

263
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,633
Here.

264
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,333
- Give the thumb drive to Tan. - Sure.

265
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Okay.

266
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,166
Don’t you want to check the photos, April?

267
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
Sure.

268
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:18,000
Please wait outside for this set.

269
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Okay.

270
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:36,433
Are we ready?

271
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:40,033
Yes.

272
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,300
I’ve asked everyone to wait outside.

273
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:45,200
When you’re ready,

274
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:47,500
get into the tub and then take off the robe.

275
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:14,633
April.

276
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
What are you doing?

277
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Tan.

278
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:24,666
Sandy.

279
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I...

280
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I thought you might need help.

281
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,733
April would probably feel more comfortable

282
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:34,833
with another woman in the room.

283
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,700
Shall we start?

284
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:43,100
- Let's start. - Okay.

285
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:44,966
One, two.

286
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:46,633
Good.

287
00:24:48,366 --> 00:24:49,366
Great.

288
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:51,000
You can lift your leg up.

289
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:55,833
You seem

290
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
to know Tanwa really well.

291
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,400
Have you known each other for decades?

292
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:00,866
That's right.

293
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,400
I thought you two were a couple,

294
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,200
but Tanwa denied it.

295
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:08,300
The longer a woman waits, the fewer chances she gets.

296
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:09,766
The older she is,

297
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,533
the harder it is to find a man.

298
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:13,266
Good.

299
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,300
I'm sorry. Let me fix this.

300
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:31,433
Tan.

301
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,233
April.

302
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,466
What was that for?

303
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,500
I didn’t mean to. It was an accident.

304
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,733
I’m sorry I got you wet.

305
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,466
It’s okay.

306
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:44,300
You can take a shower in my bathroom.

307
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:47,100
I can ask my housekeeper to do your laundry.

308
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,200
Your clothes are in the car.

309
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,466
Why don’t you get them and go change?

310
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
It's fine. I'll do it.

311
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,366
Hey, April!

312
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
April.

313
00:27:04,433 --> 00:27:05,433
What are you doing?

314
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Why are you surprised?

315
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:09,500
I just wanted to help, so you’d finish showering faster.

316
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,600
That’s enough, April. Don’t do this.

317
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,066
I’m begging you. Please don’t do this. Let me go.

318
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:23,066
Please.

319
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
Are you sure?

320
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,533
That’s enough. Stop it.

321
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,300
Are you all right, Tan?

322
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,500
- What is it? - Nothing.

323
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:40,433
I came to get the clothes from you.

324
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,033
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

325
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:47,166
Tan, you can tell she did that on purpose, right?

326
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,233
It doesn’t matter what her intentions are.

327
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
I’m asking you.

328
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:55,766
After we’re done with this, can you not work with her anymore?

329
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,466
If not, I’ll no longer work with you.

330
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,533
You should go change.

331
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,700
I was just joking around. It wasn't a big deal.

332
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,066
Pack everything, Mod. Don't forget to send me the files.

333
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:02,533
Excuse me.

334
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:05,533
Are you leaving?

335
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:08,266
I wanted to thank you.

336
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,666
I really liked the photos from today.

337
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,600
Thank you. I’ll send you the photos for you to select.

338
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
Okay.

339
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,600
Stay and have dinner.

340
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:20,733
You too, Sandy.

341
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,800
It’s okay. I have plans. I’ll get going then.

342
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:26,433
Let's go.

343
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Tanwa.

344
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,266
Stay and have dinner with me.

345
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,566
I wanted to thank you

346
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:39,366
for today’s photoshoot

347
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:42,066
and apologize for the inconvenience.

348
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,800
Sandy.

349
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Tanwa.

350
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:48,500
I just wanted to ask you

351
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:52,533
if you really see a future with her.

352
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:54,333
She seems so young.

353
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:57,900
She doesn’t understand what love means to adults.

354
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
I don’t want you to waste your time.

355
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,900
The longer you wait,

356
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:04,900
the more time you waste.

357
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,500
I'm sorry, but I have to go. Thank you.

358
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
(Tan)

359
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,200
What’s wrong? Why didn’t you answer my calls?

360
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,500
Please give me my key back.

361
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,266
From now on, you no longer have the right to come here whenever.

362
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:42,766
What's going on?

363
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,233
Why are you mad at me? I don’t get it.

364
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,100
We’ve known each other for so long, yet you still don’t understand me?

365
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,333
What's the matter?

366
00:30:52,466 --> 00:30:54,933
Wait, what's going on?

367
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:06,900
We shouldn’t see each other anymore.

368
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,200
I don’t want to waste any more time.

369
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:14,666
What’s going on? What’s the matter with you?

370
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:15,866
Good question.

371
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:18,066
What am I to you?

372
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:21,700
For almost ten years, who am I to you?

373
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:23,833
Why...

374
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:27,466
Why did you let some woman you’ve just met

375
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:29,433
do whatever she wants to you?

376
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:31,533
I warned you, but you wouldn’t listen.

377
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,233
Do you like her?

378
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:38,866
Is that why you made me wait on my birthday?

379
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:42,366
You wouldn’t tell me where you were or what you were doing.

380
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:47,166
Is there more that I don’t know?

381
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:51,700
Have you ever cared about my feelings?

382
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:53,500
Of course I have.

383
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:57,366
Then when are you going to tell me what I am to you?

384
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:00,266
Everything I’ve done is obvious.

385
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,100
That’s not enough.

386
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:04,700
What do you want me to do?

387
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,732
What do you want me to say? You’ve never said anything.

388
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:09,733
I also don’t know how you feel.

389
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,733
Why don’t you say it?

390
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:15,700
Why don’t you just say it? Just say it!

391
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:25,433
You’re an important person to me.

392
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:29,766
That’s all?

393
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,800
No other words besides what you’ve written in your birthday cards,

394
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:42,066
New Year's or Valentine’s cards that you’ve given me?

395
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:47,900
Is there anything more than the beautiful words on these cards?

396
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:55,633
Ten years is far too long.

397
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,800
I can’t wait any longer.

398
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Sandy.

399
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,700
I’ve always wanted to do that,

400
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,900
and I know you wanted it too.

401
00:33:25,866 --> 00:33:28,266
I know that

402
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:32,033
we’re more than just friends.

403
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,300
You feel the same way, don’t you?

404
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,000
It took us a long time

405
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:13,833
to get here.

406
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:31,933
And...

407
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:34,366
right now...

408
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:38,100
what are we?

409
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:47,866
I’ll get it for you.

410
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,733
(April)

411
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,266
Hello, Tanwa.

412
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:01,633
What are you doing?

413
00:36:02,766 --> 00:36:04,266
He’s at my place.

414
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,433
We’re doing something personal.

415
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,866
Why are you answering his phone?

416
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,533
I asked Sandy to answer.

417
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,766
What is it, April?

418
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:24,633
I just wanted to let you know that my birthday’s coming up

419
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:26,500
once the photo book is done.

420
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,200
I wanted to throw a party at home to launch the photo book

421
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:33,200
and invite you as the photographer.

422
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,966
Would that be okay for you?

423
00:36:55,433 --> 00:36:59,700
Happy birthday to you

424
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:02,533
Happy birthday!

425
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:03,900
Happy birthday.

426
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,900
You're fabulous.

427
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,100
Bottoms up. Come on.

428
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,166
Hurry up.

429
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:12,866
Make a wish.

430
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,533
Nice.

431
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,399
Woo!

432
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,532
I wish you happiness.

433
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:21,866
Enjoy, I'll be right back.

434
00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:31,233
Tan.

435
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,833
Are you having fun?

436
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,333
I'm okay.

437
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,166
Happy birthday.

438
00:37:51,633 --> 00:37:52,633
Is everything okay?

439
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:55,033
- Yes. - What?

440
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:56,600
Yes.

441
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:13,633
Tan.

442
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:17,733
I keep hearing people compliment you.

443
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:22,066
They say your work is fabulous.

444
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,500
- Are you happy? - Really?

445
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:26,500
- Of course. - I'm happy.

446
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,300
I'm so proud of you.

447
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,666
I’ve always known you’re talented.

448
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:34,300
I saw your potential back in school.

449
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:36,866
I believe

450
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,633
that you will be very successful,

451
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,066
just like you’ve always hoped to be.

452
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,466
Thank you.

453
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Sandy.

454
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:53,733
Excuse me.

455
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,100
Tanwa, do you have some time?

456
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,600
Yes.

457
00:38:58,133 --> 00:39:02,000
Berm from Vogue Magazine wants to talk to you.

458
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Really?

459
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,665
Let’s go, Sandy.

460
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:10,333
I wanted to ask you something, Sandy.

461
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:12,600
It’ll take less than two minutes.

462
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,233
- Follow me then. - Sure.

463
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,100
Thank you.

464
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Hello.

465
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,166
Sandy, I want the polaroid.

466
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,700
It’s in my bedroom. Can you get it for me?

467
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,466
I’m sure others are free too.

468
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:35,533
They’re all wasted. I don’t want them in my room.

469
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:37,533
Could you please help me?

470
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,366
I don’t just let anyone in.

471
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:41,566
Only people I trust,

472
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:44,100
or those who’ve already been in.

473
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Please.

474
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,300
I don’t just let anyone in.

475
00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:31,333
Only people I trust,

476
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:34,033
or those who’ve already been in.

477
00:40:54,633 --> 00:40:55,700
Please take care of Tanwa.

478
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:58,133
He’s a professional.

479
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:03,333
Thank you so much.

480
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:07,566
What are these?

481
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:48,100
Don’t hold someone back when you don’t love them that much,

482
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,966
because everyone wants clarity.

483
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,266
We’re close.

484
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,666
I just borrowed something from you.

485
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,733
Do you like

486
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
the new toy I sent you?

487
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,566
Thank you for inviting me, April.

488
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,533
Tanwa is my toy.

489
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:08,000
I don’t mind sharing him with others.

490
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,866
How could you do this to me?

491
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,900
The only one who can build a future for you is me.

492
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,300
Why are you being so unprofessional?

493
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:17,833
Unprofessional?

494
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,700
We’re not a couple, Sandy.

495
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,300
If you walk away, then we'll no longer see each other.

496
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,500
Cut.

497
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,933
That's it.

498
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:29,933
- Thank you. - Thank you.

499
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
All right.

500
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,933
It's so cold.

501
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,866
What did you say?

502
00:42:36,966 --> 00:42:38,066
Cut.

503
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:39,566
See?

504
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
It's like this.

505
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,300
Have dinner with me.

506
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,200
You would make headlines.
