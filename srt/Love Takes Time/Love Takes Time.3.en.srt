1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,033
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

2
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:02,033
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

3
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:03,033
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

4
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:04,033
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

5
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:05,033
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

6
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:07,866
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

7
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,500
(Presents)

8
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:26,333
(Theory of Love)

9
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:28,066
About what happened tonight...

10
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:30,300
I’m so sorry.

11
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:31,700
I didn’t mean to.

12
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,033
Are you going to see Sandy?

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,166
Hey!

14
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:36,733
April.

15
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:39,133
I honestly don’t trust this woman.

16
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:43,100
Is there anything more than
the beautiful words on these cards?

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,800
I wanted to ask you something,
Sandy.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,400
I don’t just let anyone in.

19
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,433
Only people I trust,

20
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,100
or those who’ve already been in.

21
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:03,100
Please take care of Tanwa.
He’s a professional.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,433
I told you that I went drinking
and passed out last night,

23
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:22,566
but actually...

24
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:24,700
I was at a party at April’s.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,433
Do you like her?

26
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,366
Is that why you made me wait
on my birthday?

27
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,700
You wouldn’t tell me where you were
or what you were doing.

28
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:35,266
Is there more that I don’t know?

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,033
Where did you get these photos?

30
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:52,733
I should be asking you

31
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,133
how you ended up in these photos.

32
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,200
How would I get them

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,933
if the owner didn’t tell me
where they were?

34
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,933
Sandy, I asked you
to get the polaroid,

35
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:06,000
not mess with my personal photos.

36
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,700
You’re embarrassing him.

37
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,000
Stop it.

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Stay out of it.

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
You said it was nothing.

40
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,066
You told me
there was nothing going on.

41
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,066
- Let's talk at home.
- You told me it was nothing.

42
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:26,033
You said nothing was going on.

43
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,100
Stop it. Why are you upset?

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,000
You and Tanwa are not a couple.

45
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,600
You’re not going
to say anything, huh?

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,133
Nothing at all?

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Sandy.

48
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,866
I’m stupid.

49
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,600
I’m stupid for trusting you
and a woman like her.

50
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:00,133
- Sandy.
- Don't.

51
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,466
You’ll only cause more trouble
if you follow her now.

52
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:10,000
She’s furious.

53
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,000
I don’t want people
to misunderstand you.

54
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:16,466
You’ll look bad if you leave now.

55
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,866
Don’t humiliate yourself.

56
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:33,033
Thank you for coming.
See you next time. Bye.

57
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,700
Tanwa.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,233
I’m sorry for taking photos of you
while you were sleeping.

59
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,633
I like looking at you
when you sleep.

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,366
I didn’t mean to cause any trouble.

61
00:03:58,966 --> 00:03:59,966
Never mind.

62
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,266
I apologize on Sandy’s behalf

63
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,000
for causing a scene at your party.

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,100
I don’t understand

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,800
why she was so mad
when you two are just friends.

66
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:16,900
So what are you two?

67
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,033
We’re talking.

68
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,433
Is that so?

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,700
You probably saw a whole new side
of Sandy today.

70
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:33,900
If it were me,

71
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,766
I wouldn’t humiliate someone I like
at a big party.

72
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,666
If we had a problem,

73
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,833
we would discuss it later.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,233
Sandy.

75
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,533
When did you sleep with her?

76
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,233
The night you went
to her party, right?

77
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,966
The night of my birthday.

78
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,666
Yes.

79
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,866
I’m sorry, Sandy. I didn’t mean it.

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,033
When were you going to tell me?

81
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:39,733
If I hadn’t found out,
when were you going to tell me?

82
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:42,966
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn’t know how.

83
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,700
- Get out.
- Sandy.

84
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,833
You should go, Tan.

85
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,566
Don’t ever come back.

86
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:50,833
What do you mean?

87
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:52,900
We should stop seeing each other.

88
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:56,833
I don’t want to keep doubting
whether you’re lying to me again.

89
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,133
Sandy.

90
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,733
April and I

91
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,533
are no longer sleeping together.

92
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,166
Trust me, Sandy.

93
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,266
I’ve always warned you about her,

94
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,733
but you kept telling me
it was nothing.

95
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,866
You lied to me.

96
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,200
How could I trust you again?

97
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:22,066
Get out!

98
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Sandy.

99
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,433
I understand that you’re mad at me.

100
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,866
I didn’t want it
to turn out this way.

101
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,733
How about this?

102
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,100
I’ll wait for you to calm down,

103
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,100
and then we’ll talk.

104
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:19,400
From that day on, I wasn’t
on the phone with him anymore.

105
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,133
We didn’t see each other every day
like we used to.

106
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,200
His relationship with that woman
made me feel like

107
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,533
I had never really known him.

108
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,833
Thank you.

109
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:54,500
Sure, let’s meet
to discuss the details.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Thank you for thinking of me.

111
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,933
The photographer?

112
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,166
Well...

113
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,300
Let me confirm
if Tanwa’s available for the job.

114
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:10,500
I’ll recommend
other photographers as well.

115
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:14,400
Okay.

116
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Thank you.

117
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,800
(Tan)

118
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,066
Why didn’t you answer my calls?

119
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,033
Sandy.

120
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,866
Are we really going to stop
seeing each other?

121
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,233
I still want to see you
and work with you.

122
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:50,066
If you don’t want to talk to me,

123
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,666
we...

124
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,100
we can just talk about work.

125
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,700
All I’m asking

126
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,900
is that we continue
to see each other like we used to.

127
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:06,733
No, Sandy.

128
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Sandy.

129
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,300
I miss you.

130
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:15,566
I miss you all the time.

131
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,833
Don't cry.

132
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,800
Don't cry.

134
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:23,366
Are the photos ready?

135
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,433
Is the model ready?

136
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,200
- Go get the model.
- Okay.

137
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,833
- Is everyone ready?
- Hurry up.

138
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,900
Thank you for coming back.

139
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,100
If you hadn’t,

140
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,300
I wouldn’t know who else
could do this job.

141
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,400
I’m glad that I can help you.

142
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
Hey.

143
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,433
So...

144
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,033
are we back to normal?

145
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,200
What does it mean to be normal?

146
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:02,366
If you’re still unsure about me,

147
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:04,800
at least

148
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,033
we can go back to being friends

149
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,533
and take it from there.

150
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,666
Okay.

151
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,533
Let's go get some food.

152
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,033
What do you want?

153
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,333
Up to you.

154
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:39,300
Are you done? Are you leaving?

155
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:40,633
I wanted to surprise you.

156
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,866
How did you know I was here?

157
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:56,433
How could I not know?

158
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,633
I was the one who recommended Sandy.

159
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,700
You’re so good at this,

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,400
so I recommended you to the client.
No need to thank me.

161
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:13,900
Are you still mad at me?

162
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,933
I’m having a party
at my place tonight.

163
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,533
If you want to come,

164
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
feel free to do so.

165
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,733
We’re close.

166
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,533
You can come whenever you want.

167
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,766
You can also invite Sandy,

168
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,600
as your assistant.

169
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:40,366
If you don't have any clothes,

170
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,333
you can borrow mine.

171
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,033
We’re pretty close, we can share.

172
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,066
You never go to social parties,
probably don’t have nice clothes.

173
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,033
I'll get going.

174
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:58,933
Sandy.

175
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:00,166
She’s probably not free.

176
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,666
April, please excuse me.

177
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Where are you going?

178
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,233
If you’re uncomfortable,
you don’t have to go.

179
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,666
But I think you should.

180
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:35,000
So people don’t think you’re mixing
work and personal life.

181
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:36,566
Hey.

182
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,900
Even though April knows
you dislike her,

183
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,033
she still recommended you.

184
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Come on.

185
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,833
April is well known
in this industry,

186
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,033
and this industry is small.

187
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,166
Don’t get into trouble with anyone.
Trust me.

188
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,866
We still need her. She can help us.

189
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:58,300
Can you honestly not tell

190
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,233
that she keeps getting between us?

191
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,833
If you really want to go,

192
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:06,100
feel free to go.

193
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,966
Don't be like this.

194
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:16,233
I still think you should go,

195
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:19,266
so you can be sure there’s nothing
going on between me and her.

196
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,633
Fine. Let me know
if you’re going.

197
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,233
I have to go.

198
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
You can also invite Sandy.

199
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,166
If you don't have any clothes,
you can borrow mine.

200
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,000
We’re pretty close, we can share.

201
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,333
I'll be right back.

202
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,666
Is the party boring?

203
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,266
Is that why
you’re sitting alone here?

204
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,433
No.

205
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,200
I was just thinking
about some things.

206
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,666
Work.

207
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Is your best friend not coming?

208
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Sandy?

209
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:55,733
She's probably tired

210
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,133
and wants to rest.

211
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
Maybe

212
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,666
this industry doesn’t suit her.

213
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,933
Do you want my help
finding a new assistant?

214
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:21,866
Were you waiting long?

215
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:44,533
Were you having fun?

216
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:46,933
How's the party?

217
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,500
Thank you for inviting me.

218
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,633
The party looks super fun.

219
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,033
It really is.

220
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:01,233
Let's have some fun then.

221
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:08,366
Cheers.

222
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Tanwa.

223
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Cheers.

224
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:31,766
Wow.

225
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:35,100
So refreshing.

226
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:41,900
Tan, I want to dance.

227
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,166
- What?
- Come dance with me.

228
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:45,833
- Please.
- I don't dance.

229
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,366
You’re at a party.
You can’t just stand there.

230
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Isn’t that right?

231
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,366
Please. Come on.

232
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,400
Let’s have fun like we used to.

233
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,433
Okay.

234
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Let's go.

235
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:04,800
Please excuse us.

236
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Have fun.

237
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Sandy.

238
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:41,633
Sandy.

239
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,566
Why are you in this room?

240
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:47,233
You’re drunk, aren’t you?

241
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,100
Come on, let’s get out of here.

242
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:51,900
Did you sleep with her in this room?

243
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,266
We should leave.

244
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,200
Come on, Sandy.

245
00:19:58,366 --> 00:19:59,366
No.

246
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:02,700
How could you sleep with someone
who came into your life after me?

247
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Why?

248
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:06,133
How could you do it?

249
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:08,733
How could you sleep with her
on my birthday?

250
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,333
How am I not good enough?

251
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:14,333
Am I not pretty enough?

252
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,066
When I dress like this

253
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,266
and act like this, do you like it?

254
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:22,600
Look at me.

255
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,333
Am I pretty?

256
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,533
Do you like it
when I dress this way?

257
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,233
Come on, Sandy.

258
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,466
Why?

259
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,200
Why?

260
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,533
How could you do this to me?

261
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,033
How could you sleep with her here
and not with me?

262
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
No, Sandy.

263
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Stop it.

264
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,333
Tanwa.

265
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,233
Tanwa.

266
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:00,333
How could you do this to me?

267
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:04,200
How could you sleep with her here
and not with me?

268
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,400
Why not?

269
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,300
- Stop it, Sandy.
- Why not?

270
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:10,866
Not here.

271
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:12,266
Not here.

272
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Get it together.

273
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,633
You’re wasted.
What’s gotten into you?

274
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,200
You’ve never acted this way before.

275
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,800
You’re no longer
the guy I used to know either.

276
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,700
Let's go home.

277
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,466
You're drunk, Sandy.

278
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:26,500
How could you do that?

279
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,700
Come on.

280
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:29,166
Let's go home, Sandy.

281
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:30,766
- Let's go. Please.
- No.

282
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,766
- Answer me.
- Sandy!

283
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:34,433
Listen to me.

284
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:37,400
Get it together.
What's the matter with you?

285
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:43,966
Are you really going to do this?

286
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:47,433
Fine, up to you.

287
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:19,100
Don’t tell me Tanwa is dating Sandy.

288
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:22,066
She’s so boring.

289
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,233
Don’t talk about her like that.
It’s not nice.

290
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:31,266
Is Tanwa dating you or Sandy?

291
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,666
He told me he’s not dating her.

292
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:35,600
Really?

293
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,166
He’s not into her.

294
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,133
To me,

295
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,033
Tanwa is my toy.

296
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,233
I don’t mind sharing him
with others.

297
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:45,666
Wow.

298
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
Nice.

299
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,533
Does anyone want him?

300
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,000
Are you sure?

301
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Let's go home.

302
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,233
- What's going on?
- Let's go home.

303
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,300
Wait, I'm discussing work.

304
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:01,733
- Let's go home.
- Is the party boring you?

305
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:03,800
Are you leaving already?

306
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,033
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

307
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:07,833
Let's go home.

308
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:09,233
What's going on?

309
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:11,900
I’ll introduce you to everyone,

310
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,400
so they can contact you for work.

311
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Sure.

312
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,800
If you want to reach Tanwa
about work,

313
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,266
you can contact me directly.

314
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,266
We’re always by each other’s side.

315
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,866
Besides, I take care of everything
for Tanwa.

316
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,466
I was discussing work.

317
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Let's go home.

318
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
Sandy.

319
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,266
When I told her
to contact me directly,

320
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,466
I meant it.

321
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,500
I’m asking you
to stop contacting her.

322
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:02,433
What’s gotten into you?

323
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:04,133
Why are you doing this?

324
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,833
Don’t you trust me at all?

325
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,333
Like I said,

326
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:10,700
the one I don’t trust is her,
not you.

327
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,900
Do you know
what she said about you?

328
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:14,933
What did she say?

329
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,566
She said you’re her toy.

330
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:21,866
Hey.

331
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,666
Do you not trust me?

332
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
No.

333
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,500
There’s really nothing going on
between me and her.

334
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:35,633
How about this?

335
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,800
If she contacts me,
I’ll ask her to talk to you.

336
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,700
Is that okay with you?

337
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,800
- Okay.
- I'll get going.

338
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:48,300
Tan.

339
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,533
I don’t want to fight with you
because of someone else.

340
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,500
I’m just worried about you.

341
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,766
I know you are.

342
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Thank you.

343
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,966
I don’t want to lose you

344
00:25:05,566 --> 00:25:07,566
because someone else
got in between us.

345
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:10,766
Am I still important to you?

346
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,400
Yes, you are.

347
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,133
How could you not be?

348
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Right?

349
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:29,133
What are you wearing?

350
00:25:31,766 --> 00:25:33,000
Do you like it?

351
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Well...

352
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
I'm not used to it,

353
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
but you look good.

354
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:44,933
You look like a woman.

355
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,066
But don’t wear revealing clothes.

356
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,900
Okay?

357
00:25:57,466 --> 00:26:01,100
From now on,
I’ll dress up every day.

358
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,800
We’re done. You can pack up.
The client has canceled.

359
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,400
Hurry up.

360
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,733
What’s going on? Why are you telling
my people to pack up?

361
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:35,633
What time is it?

362
00:26:35,966 --> 00:26:37,566
Why weren’t you on time?

363
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,166
I’m on time.

364
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,200
I already told you

365
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,733
the client wanted to start
a few hours earlier.

366
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:46,066
The client is furious
and has canceled the gig.

367
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:48,066
What?

368
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,266
You didn’t tell me.

369
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,866
I called you.

370
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,066
The client has been waiting
for hours.

371
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,900
They’re furious
and hired someone else.

372
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,966
You didn’t call me at all.

373
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,233
If you had,
I would’ve seen it.

374
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,700
I never make mistakes.

375
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,066
Hold on.

376
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:08,733
Sandy.

377
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:10,733
I'll talk to her.

378
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:14,700
Why didn’t you call me?
I would’ve come right away.

379
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,766
Tanwa, you told me

380
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,166
to contact your assistant
about work.

381
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:25,033
She wasn’t being professional.
You left me no choice.

382
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,933
You did this on purpose, didn’t you?

383
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,500
- You’re crazy.
- Stop it.

384
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,766
No one jokes around
about something like this.

385
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,033
Stop blaming other people
and start blaming yourself.

386
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,833
You're unprofessional.

387
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,033
Unprofessional, huh?

388
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:40,566
Unprofessional?

389
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,200
Sandy!

390
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:44,133
- That's enough.
- Tan.

391
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:45,366
- Let go.
- No.

392
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,366
- Let go of me.
- Stop.

393
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,500
Don’t you see
that she did this on purpose?

394
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:52,066
Sandy.

395
00:27:52,866 --> 00:27:54,033
Do you see now

396
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:57,000
that she’s unprofessional at work
and has anger management issues?

397
00:27:58,266 --> 00:28:00,866
Tanwa, get it together.

398
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,333
I won’t tell anyone about this.

399
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,600
If other people find out,
your career is over.

400
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:08,533
Get out!

401
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,500
Who do you think you are?

402
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,266
- No, Sandy.
- You think you can do anything?

403
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:14,333
- Please, Sandy.
- Let go.

404
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,400
- Let go of me.
- Come here.

405
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,700
- Let go. Who do you think you are?
- Come on.

406
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,433
- Stop it!
- Let go of me.

407
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:25,766
Let go!

408
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Sandy!

409
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Why did you do that?

410
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,000
She jeopardized my work.

411
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,333
Why would she do that?

412
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:36,700
If she did,
she would lose her credibility too.

413
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I know she did it on purpose.

414
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,666
But you had no right to hurt her.

415
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:43,533
Do you know that you’ve changed?

416
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,066
Do you know

417
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:47,466
how much you’ve changed
since you met her?

418
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:49,100
Why are you only criticizing me?

419
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,933
Why aren’t you defending me?

420
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:55,366
Are you afraid to do anything

421
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,433
because you’re afraid
she won’t give you more work?

422
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:01,933
Or have you fallen for her?

423
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:03,533
This has nothing to do with her.

424
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,433
I don’t like how you behaved.

425
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,633
You’re no longer the person I knew.

426
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:12,633
What you did made me feel like
you’ve changed.

427
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,400
The way you act
makes me feel like you’re immature.

428
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,766
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

429
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:25,266
I should have let you go
live your life,

430
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:26,800
so you would have grown up.

431
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:31,066
What do you mean?

432
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,600
Are you breaking up with me?

433
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:38,300
What? We’re not even a couple.

434
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:50,666
Do you realize what you just said?

435
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,700
Do you realize what you just said?

436
00:29:55,866 --> 00:29:56,866
I'm sorry.

437
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
But if you continue to act this way,

438
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,466
we should go our separate ways.

439
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,300
Tan.

440
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,000
If you walk away,

441
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:17,533
then we'll no longer see each other.

442
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,333
I...

443
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,266
I'm sorry about today.

444
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,466
You made the right decision

445
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,600
to come back to me.

446
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:03,900
Being with an immature woman

447
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,800
will only cause you trouble.

448
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,966
The only one who can create a future
for you

449
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:16,766
is me.

450
00:32:32,866 --> 00:32:34,200
You just came to apologize, right?

451
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,066
If you’re done,

452
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,100
you can leave.

453
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:11,633
(Happy Birthday)

454
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,266
(Happy Birthday)

455
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:45,400
(Happy Birthday.
Wishing you all the happiness.)

456
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,666
(Another birthday with no gift,
just this card and wishes. Tanwa)

457
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,433
We never met again after that day,
Aoy and Chod.

458
00:34:57,366 --> 00:35:01,200
(December, 2024)

459
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
Tan entered a new social circle.

460
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,866
Maybe that was what he had
always wanted, but I didn’t know.

461
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:12,166
The longer we stayed apart,
the more of a stranger he became.

462
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
Happy birthday.

463
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,000
(Tan)

464
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,466
(Happy birthday.)

465
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:21,166
Hello?

466
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:25,766
You want to change the photographer?

467
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:33,800
You have chosen a new one?

468
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,566
Who’s the photographer?

469
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:40,033
Is the new photographer here yet?

470
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,933
I got here a while ago.

471
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,000
Everything is ready.

472
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,266
I was on the phone earlier.

473
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,466
Hello, Miss Sandy. I'm Sun.

474
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:51,866
Hello, Sun.

475
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:54,933
You can just call me Sandy.

476
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,066
Sure.

477
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,300
Do you mind being my model?

478
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:01,733
I want to test the lighting.

479
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:04,966
Me?

480
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,633
I just want to make sure

481
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,866
that the lighting works
on a beautiful model.

482
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,800
Fine, I'll do it.

483
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Well...

484
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,466
What should I do?

485
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:22,133
Please stand here.

486
00:37:22,966 --> 00:37:24,266
- Give me the camera.
- Sure.

487
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,366
Just stand still.
Let me test the lighting.

488
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:34,066
Please turn 45 degrees to the side.

489
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,333
Okay.

490
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:37,433
Excuse me.

491
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:52,233
I don't want your hair
to block your face.

492
00:37:57,766 --> 00:37:58,766
Beautiful.

493
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:08,666
Sandy.

494
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,300
Sandy.

495
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:13,533
Sandy.

496
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:17,400
- I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

497
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,266
I'm fine.

498
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:21,633
Is the photo okay?

499
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,800
It's beautiful. Have a look.

500
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,200
This one's nice too.

501
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,266
The lighting's great.

502
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,700
And you are

503
00:38:35,633 --> 00:38:36,633
beautiful.

504
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,433
I'll take a few more photos of you,

505
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:47,900
so you can have some nice photos.

506
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
Sure.

507
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,433
Why don't you sit down?

508
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,866
Sun and I had known each other
for only a short time,

509
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:10,800
but we were compatible
and worked together on a few gigs.

510
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,733
We got close quickly, Aoy and Chod.

511
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:33,433
I need to use the restroom.

512
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Sure.

513
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:04,500
Santa's almost here.

514
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:07,800
- Santa?
- Yes.

515
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,300
- Sister.
- Tandy.

516
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,400
Yes.

517
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Tandy?

518
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:29,433
(Tan)

519
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,933
(Tan)

520
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,100
Sandy.

521
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:54,766
What's wrong?

522
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:16,033
Come in.

523
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,233
Thank you for taking me home.

524
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,733
I'm fine now.

525
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:27,833
Okay, I'll get going.

526
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:29,366
Sun.

527
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:32,233
I...

528
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
Sun.

529
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,700
Aoy and Chod,

530
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:53,233
maybe I shouldn’t take too long
to get to know someone.

531
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:55,733
If he were the one,

532
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,100
I wouldn’t be wasting time.

533
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:19,800
Do you like the new toy I sent you?

534
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,333
I do.

535
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,700
Thank you.

536
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:29,666
Sandy.

537
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,833
They say they don’t want to commit,

538
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:52,133
but in reality,
they just don’t like you.

539
00:42:55,766 --> 00:42:57,066
I’m here for my reward.

540
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
What are you waiting for?

541
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:01,900
I can explain.

542
00:43:02,266 --> 00:43:03,533
Don’t explain anything.

543
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,100
If you leave my place now,

544
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,933
just know

545
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,100
your career in the entertainment
industry is over.

546
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:13,366
Marry me.

547
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:15,066
We should go our separate ways.

548
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,466
Please don't go, Tan.

549
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,333
My groom is so handsome.

550
00:43:33,966 --> 00:43:34,966
Who is he?

551
00:43:35,033 --> 00:43:36,900
Come on.

552
00:43:37,566 --> 00:43:38,600
Go.

553
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,466
Turn this way
