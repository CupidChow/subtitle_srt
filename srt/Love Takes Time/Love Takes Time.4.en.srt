1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,033
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

2
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:02,033
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

3
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:03,033
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

4
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:04,033
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

5
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:05,033
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

6
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:07,866
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,333
(Presents)

8
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:26,333
(Theory of Love)

9
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,166
Are we back to normal?

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,633
What does it mean to be normal?

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,500
If you’re still unsure about me,

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,266
at least we can go back
to being friends

13
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:35,766
and take it from there.

14
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:38,166
- You're unprofessional.
- Unprofessional, huh?

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,533
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

16
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:42,400
I should have let you go
live your life.

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,933
Are you breaking up with me?

18
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:46,633
What? We’re not even a couple.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
The only one who can
create a future for you

20
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:50,933
is me.

21
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,266
Do you like the new toy

22
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,900
I sent you?

23
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,633
I have to go.

24
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,766
I have to send the photos
to the client.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Okay.

26
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,800
(Tan)

27
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,533
Sandy.

28
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,700
How have you been?

29
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:20,566
I'm fine.

30
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:22,566
Nothing much going on.

31
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,233
How about you? How have you been?

32
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:31,066
Same here. I'm fine.

33
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,133
So...

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,300
why did you call?

35
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:41,233
I wanted to know...

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,266
if you still have my work files.

37
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,400
I can’t find them.

38
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,166
Could you please

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,966
check for me?

40
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Sure.

41
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,933
Thank you.

42
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,700
You're welcome.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hi.

44
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,333
Yes?

45
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,633
Sandy asked me
to give this hard drive to you.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,600
She’s busy talking to a client.

47
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:57,200
That’s fine. I can wait for her.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She’s not available.

49
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,800
The files you asked her for
are in here.

50
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,866
She said you can keep the drive.

51
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,300
Okay.

52
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:13,833
Excuse me, and you are...

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,866
I'm Sun.

54
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:17,866
I'm her boyfriend.

55
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,633
I see. Please thank her for me.

56
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
Sure.

57
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:49,533
What?

58
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,600
Tanwa went to see Sandy,

59
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,700
but she wouldn’t see him?
So they still like each other.

60
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,066
Sun.

61
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:00,700
You must do everything to make her
fall head over heels for you.

62
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,733
Got it?

63
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,800
Okay, I understand.

64
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
And...

65
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,600
for the New Year’s Eve
countdown party,

66
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,233
do you want me to come see you?

67
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
No.

68
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,533
I’ll be alone with Tanwa.

69
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,433
You should go with Sandy.

70
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:21,500
Okay, I’ll take care of it.
Don’t worry.

71
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:23,566
And...

72
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,000
I’ll be waiting for my reward.

73
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,900
(December 31, 2024)

74
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,900
I just want to stay in.

75
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:49,833
Don’t worry about me.

76
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,200
Go and party with your friends, Sun.

77
00:05:58,633 --> 00:05:59,633
Okay.

78
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:02,433
Talk to you next year.

79
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,700
Okay.

80
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:24,566
Even though I like to party,

81
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,566
I didn’t want to go out
on New Year’s Eve.

82
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,100
I’d been working
with people all year,

83
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,866
so I wanted to take the day
for myself.

84
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,733
He...

85
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,333
he also liked being alone
on New Year’s Eve.

86
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,566
Ever since he came into my life,

87
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,566
we always spent
this special night together.

88
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:50,700
Hey, this piece is mine.

89
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,266
- Why did you eat mine?
- I wanted this piece.

90
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,500
- It's so spicy.
- You want this?

91
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Are you okay?

92
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:33,800
Do you not like Italian food?

93
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:39,900
I specifically hired an Italian chef
to cook this special meal for you.

94
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
I...

95
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,433
Oh.

96
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,900
Of course I like it.

97
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,400
It looks delicious.

98
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,600
I usually host a party
at home every year,

99
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,333
but all my friends are abroad
this year.

100
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,066
I’m still lucky

101
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,366
to have you to end the year with.

102
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,300
Thank you.

103
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,366
You're welcome.

104
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Thank you.

105
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,333
Wait.

106
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:26,233
It’s almost time.

107
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:28,900
Let’s count down together.

108
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,066
Ten.

109
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,866
- Nine.
- Eight.

110
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Seven.

111
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Six.

112
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,233
- Five, four, three.
- Five, four, three.

113
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,900
- Two.
- One.

114
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:45,700
Happy New Year!

115
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,366
Happy New Year, Tan.

116
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,766
Are the fireworks nice, Tanwa?

117
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
I'm Sun.

118
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:56,766
I'm her boyfriend.

119
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,000
(Tan)

120
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,666
Sandy, am I bothering you?

121
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,600
What is it?

122
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:33,300
Can I ask you something?

123
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:47,666
I’m here for my reward.

124
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
April.

125
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:55,033
What are you waiting for?

126
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:57,033
Come closer.

127
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:00,900
You can’t wait for your reward,
can you?

128
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,833
I said you can’t come today.

129
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:57,566
Didn't you do it last night?

130
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:01,566
Your job is to make her
fall head over heels for you.

131
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:04,400
Then you can dump her
whenever you want.

132
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:10,100
Fine. Come see me tomorrow.

133
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:11,766
I have to go.

134
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Wait, Sandy.

135
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,366
Don't.

136
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,100
Don't stop me, Tan.

137
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
Sandy.

138
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:39,966
Hey.

139
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,700
How did you get into my house?

140
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:43,866
How could you do this, Sun?

141
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,700
It seems like everyone you like
is into me.

142
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:57,200
Both Tanwa

143
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
and Sun.

144
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:00,833
I feel so sorry for you.

145
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Tanwa.

146
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:38,700
It’s not what you think.

147
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:43,366
Sandy.

148
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,166
I can explain.

149
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,900
Don’t explain anything.

150
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I understand everything.

151
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
Tanwa.

152
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:58,200
If you leave my place now,

153
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,033
just know

154
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,233
your career in the entertainment
industry is over.

155
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,566
I mean it.

156
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Tanwa.

157
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:13,833
Tanwa!

158
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,433
Why?

159
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,700
Why did he lie to me?

160
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,233
Why did he do that?

161
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:19,300
- Why would he do that?
- Sandy.

162
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,566
- Sandy.
- Why?

163
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,333
This is all my fault.

164
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,833
I'm sorry.

165
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm sorry.

166
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:35,533
Sandy.

167
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Sandy.

168
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:47,566
It's all right.

169
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,000
You still have me.

170
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,800
I’m sorry about what happened.

171
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Okay?

172
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:05,633
I will come back to you.

173
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,066
Aoy and Chod.

174
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:15,666
From that day on, Tan came back
and took care of me.

175
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,633
Everything he used to do for me...

176
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,700
he did it all again.

177
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,700
You will always be special to me.

178
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,900
Happy Valentine’s Day.
From Tan.

179
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,500
(February 14, 2025)

180
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,866
Thank you.

181
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:40,233
You will always
be special to me too.

182
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,233
That’s not all for this year.

183
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:46,800
I have something for you.

184
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
What is it?

185
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Actually,

186
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,733
I should have done this
a long time ago,

187
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:10,200
but I never had the courage.

188
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,566
I’m sorry

189
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,600
for making you wait for so long.

190
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:42,600
Will you be my girlfriend?

191
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,200
I never thought
I’d hear this from you.

192
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:00,366
Are we a couple now?

193
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Yes.

194
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
I love you, Sandy.

195
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:31,700
Are you all right?

196
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:33,533
So much stuff.

197
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:38,033
Is this okay?

198
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:39,466
Yes.

199
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,000
Just choose any space you like.

200
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,433
I’ll bring your things to the room.

201
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,666
Okay.

202
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Come on.

203
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:09,600
- Hey.
- Come here.

204
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,866
Did you bring that here?

205
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,733
It’s the first gift
you ever gave me.

206
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,766
Could you tell me why the client
canceled at the last minute?

207
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:04,300
April’s probably behind this.

208
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Tan.

209
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,333
Don't worry.

210
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,300
I can find more gigs.

211
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:30,800
Good. I want a closer shot
of the logo.

212
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:32,066
Sure.

213
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,900
Nice.

214
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,766
- Does that work?
- Yes, it does.

215
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,133
Hey.

216
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,900
Are you okay?

217
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:47,566
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

218
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:48,900
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

219
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:51,200
I think

220
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:54,166
doing photoshoots for these products
is a good idea.

221
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:56,600
We can do multiple shoots
in one day.

222
00:21:56,933 --> 00:22:01,133
Many celebrities are doing
livestreams to sell products online.

223
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,433
If your work gets out,

224
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,166
other brands
will definitely contact us.

225
00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:08,566
We’ll make so much money.

226
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:10,500
I hope that’s true.

227
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,033
Sure.

228
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,000
I still have backup files,
so don’t worry about that.

229
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:18,700
I’ll send them to you.

230
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,600
For your birthday this year,

231
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:06,900
I’ll take you out
to a nice restaurant

232
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,800
as a way to thank you.

233
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,700
Sandy!

234
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:27,200
Are you done?

235
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,600
Yes, I am.

236
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:34,366
What were you doing?

237
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:38,533
The client called
asking for some files,

238
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:40,600
so I was looking for the drive.

239
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,900
So are you done?

240
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Yes.

241
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,800
Okay, wait for me in the car.
I’ll be right there.

242
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,500
Okay.

243
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,800
Come quickly.

244
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Okay.

245
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,566
What's the matter with you?

246
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,700
Wait in the car.

247
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,466
Happy birthday to you

248
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,500
Happy birthday to you

249
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:58,433
Happy birthday, happy birthday

250
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:05,566
Happy birthday to you

251
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,233
Thank you.

252
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:20,066
Yes!

253
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:21,266
Happy birthday.

254
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,933
Thank you, Tan.

255
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,100
This is so cute.

256
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:30,766
Here's your card.

257
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Thank you.

258
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:38,466
I have one more card from you
to add to my collection.

259
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,233
You really went all out this year.

260
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,233
You even surprised me
in front of everyone.

261
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:49,866
And...

262
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:52,800
Is there another surprise?

263
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,333
No.

264
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,766
What are you talking about?

265
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,733
But you seem a bit odd today.

266
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,433
You took me out to eat

267
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:09,233
and told me to dress up nicely.

268
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,500
Is there anything else?

269
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:18,333
- What?
- What are you talking about?

270
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:21,400
Why? What do you want?

271
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,133
You told me not to get you anything
this year,

272
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:28,600
so I only got you a cake and a card.

273
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:32,633
I just wanted you to dress up nicely

274
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,900
to shake things up.

275
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:38,166
Why?

276
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,633
What's wrong?

277
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:46,033
No, I was just joking.

278
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
Actually,

279
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,800
having you with me this year

280
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:55,733
makes me so happy.

281
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,766
I hope we’re together

282
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,266
every year.

283
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:04,566
Okay.

284
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,700
Happy birthday.

285
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:20,500
Happy birthday to you

286
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:33,533
Everything was still the same,
even after many months had passed.

287
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:36,766
I knew he wanted to buy a house,

288
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,233
possibly our house.

289
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,733
But he never told me.

290
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,400
The ring,
what was probably a wedding ring,

291
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,533
was still in the same place.

292
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,033
He went back to how he was.

293
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:53,066
A man who was afraid to move
the relationship forward,

294
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:57,066
with no clarity about our future.

295
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,200
I had to do something

296
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,800
to keep our relationship going.

297
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,966
I think that's enough
for this brand.

298
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,300
After this,
we have three more brands to go,

299
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,766
and that will be all for today.

300
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,400
Could you tell me why the client
canceled at the last minute?

301
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:24,866
April's probably behind this.

302
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:26,733
If you leave my place now,

303
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:30,700
just know your career in
the entertainment industry is over.

304
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:46,366
Tan.

305
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,466
I didn’t expect this.

306
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,233
I worked so hard chasing awards

307
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,500
and doing good work

308
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,400
to build my portfolio.

309
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,966
But in the end,
I’m doing product shoots for online.

310
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:31,733
Tan.

311
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,800
I can’t do this anymore, Sandy.

312
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,866
Our expenses are the same.

313
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:41,866
Tan.

314
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:44,566
I understand.

315
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:56,333
Everything will get better.

316
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:04,133
We have a fashion photoshoot
next week.

317
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:08,366
Even though it’s not as big
and the budget is smaller,

318
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:10,400
I still believe

319
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:14,733
many clients will see it
and come to us.

320
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,400
We can do this, Tan.

321
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:23,833
I'm sorry.

322
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:26,733
Tan.

323
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,500
We’re free that afternoon,

324
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,300
so I accepted
another pre-wedding gig

325
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,500
at the same studio.

326
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,900
Great, isn't it?

327
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,166
We’ll be working all day.

328
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:53,600
Don’t cry, or I’ll cry with you.

329
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,966
We can do this.

330
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,800
Thank you.

331
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,000
I love you.

332
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:16,066
I'm so sorry.

333
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:24,400
Are we ready?

334
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,400
Move this light closer.

335
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,666
- I want the light to be softer.
- Okay.

336
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:34,000
Can somebody check on
the bride and groom?

337
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,733
We’ve wasted too much time.
We can't use the studio overtime.

338
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:41,766
The bride-to-be is here.

339
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,600
Is the groom-to-be ready?

340
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:55,600
What's this?

341
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:01,700
Don’t joke with me. Go and change.

342
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:05,566
I'm not joking.

343
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,333
Well...

344
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,300
I saw that you’ve kept
this ring for a while.

345
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:26,500
I know

346
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,800
you want to buy a new house.

347
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,933
I saw the brochure
and the ring kept together.

348
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:38,700
I’ve heard you calling the bank
many times about buying the house.

349
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:40,733
But...

350
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:44,900
you’ve never discussed
or planned any of this with me.

351
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,733
I thought you would surprise me
on my birthday,

352
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:55,900
and I waited.

353
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,400
I kept waiting,
and now it’s almost been a year.

354
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,000
You still keep everything
in the same place.

355
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:09,100
I’m not here to criticize you.

356
00:33:09,566 --> 00:33:11,200
I just want you to know

357
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:15,166
that you don’t need to wait
for everything to be ready,

358
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,500
for everything to be stable.

359
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,666
You don’t need to wait at all.

360
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,033
I don’t want a new house.

361
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,266
I don’t want anything at all.

362
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:30,133
I just want you.

363
00:33:33,466 --> 00:33:35,100
That's more than enough.

364
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,066
I know

365
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:45,300
that you worry about our future.

366
00:33:45,766 --> 00:33:49,133
But I want you to know
that there’s no need to worry.

367
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,933
As long as we’re together,
we’ll be able to get through it.

368
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,900
There are many good gigs out there.

369
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:02,500
During the ten years
we’ve known each other,

370
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:07,833
you’ve always

371
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:09,666
taken such good care of me.

372
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:12,166
That’s why I’m sure

373
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,733
that I’ll never leave you.

374
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:20,500
I will always be with you.

375
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:26,500
Even if you don’t say it,

376
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,000
it’s fine.

377
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:32,066
I will say it.

378
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,666
Marry me.

379
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Sandy.

380
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,400
I'm sorry.

381
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:13,966
I don't want to marry you.

382
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Why not?

383
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:27,733
Be realistic, Sandy.

384
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:30,700
We probably won’t make it.

385
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:35,766
I want you to meet someone
better than me.

386
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,433
But I don’t want anyone else.

387
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,300
- I...
- I don’t feel the same way.

388
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:47,400
But I want you.

389
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:52,666
Tan, I love you.

390
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:55,800
Don’t joke with me like this.

391
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,800
I'm sorry, Sandy.

392
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,933
Let's break up.

393
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
No.

394
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:11,966
You're just joking, right?

395
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:16,733
You can keep

396
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:19,833
this ring.

397
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:25,733
Think of it
as the last gift from me.

398
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,500
Let me know
once you’ve packed your things.

399
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:36,400
I’ll move out for a while.

400
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:39,133
Tan.

401
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,466
I'm so sorry.

402
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:45,266
Don't apologize to me.

403
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:48,766
Tan, please don't leave me.

404
00:36:52,566 --> 00:36:53,566
Why?

405
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,600
Ten years wasn’t
a short period of time.

406
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:06,666
Did it mean nothing to you?

407
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,433
Tan.

408
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,333
Please don’t leave me.
I’m begging you.

409
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:12,433
I'm sorry.

410
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,933
- Please don't leave.
- I'm sorry.

411
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:17,233
I'm sorry.

412
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:19,000
Tan, what did I do wrong?

413
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,600
Tan.

414
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,433
Please come back to me.

415
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:34,300
Tan, how could you leave me?

416
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,833
Please come back to me.

417
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:58,433
Tan and I never spoke again
after that.

418
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:03,200
I didn’t know how he was doing

419
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
until...

420
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:36,433
Our relationship ended,

421
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:38,633
but time never stopped moving.

422
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,400
People’s hearts change with it.

423
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,400
My groom is so handsome.

424
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,900
You’ll be so busy after the wedding.

425
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:36,400
You must go to Paris Fashion Week
with me this year.

426
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,233
I know lots of agencies.

427
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,333
I’ll introduce you to everyone.

428
00:39:47,066 --> 00:39:49,133
What’s wrong?
Why don’t you look happy?

429
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,033
No.

430
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Of course I'm happy.

431
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:57,133
Thank you.

432
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,966
Let me put on my watch.

433
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,400
Tanwa.

434
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:15,866
You made the right decision
coming back to me.

435
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,466
I’m sorry for what happened.

436
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:25,133
I love you.

437
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:31,966
I'll be right there.

438
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,900
Tanwa.

439
00:40:58,433 --> 00:41:00,066
Someone sent this to you.

440
00:41:01,966 --> 00:41:02,966
Thanks.

441
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,033
Sandy.

442
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
Sandy.

443
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:40,366
Sandy.

444
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,900
Sandy.

445
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:51,666
Sandy.

446
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:00,933
Sandy.

447
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Tanwa.

448
00:42:28,933 --> 00:42:30,133
What are you doing here?

449
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,533
The ceremony’s about to start.
Let’s go back in.

450
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:36,733
Okay.

451
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:47,733
Do you want to go in?

452
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Yes.

453
00:42:56,733 --> 00:42:59,366
Tan probably decided to marry her

454
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:02,600
because of the stable future
she could provide for him.

455
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,666
But I don’t really know

456
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,800
his true reason.

457
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:10,400
I feel like after ten years,

458
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:13,833
I never really knew him at all.

459
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,800
The only thing I could do for him,
for the very last time,

460
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:20,533
was to give each other
our time back.

461
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:28,600
There’s a saying that it takes time
to get to know someone.

462
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,533
But sometimes if you wait too long,

463
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,533
feelings can fade.

464
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,566
And if you’ve known someone
for long enough,

465
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,600
you might realize

466
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,900
that time doesn’t
mean you truly know each other.

467
00:43:45,433 --> 00:43:48,400
In the end,
time might not be the reason.

468
00:43:48,866 --> 00:43:52,900
The reason could be a lack of love.

469
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:27,100
I still believe

470
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,600
that the good feelings we shared

471
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,800
were real at some point.

472
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:37,100
Good memories

473
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,866
that linger

474
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:41,866
forever.

475
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,066
Don’t use the excuse
that love takes time

476
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:24,100
to ignore the suffering
of the one who’s waiting.

477
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,633
Love belongs to every generation.

478
00:45:28,766 --> 00:45:33,033
As times change, new definitions
of love keep emerging in society.

479
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:35,166
Next year, Club Friday The Series

480
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:39,100
brings together 12 love stories,
12 love statuses of people now.

481
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,000
This becomes Club Friday The Series
2026: Love Status.

482
00:45:43,066 --> 00:45:46,200
Share your story on the page
"Aoy and Chod, Tua Tor Tua."

483
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,933
Selected stories

484
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:52,933
will be developed into scripts
for Club Friday The Series 2026,

485
00:45:53,266 --> 00:45:56,066
and brought to life
by well-known actors.

486
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,700
Happy birthday.

487
00:46:00,766 --> 00:46:01,933
Cut.

488
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:06,766
Cut.

489
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,100
Cut.

490
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,500
Oh dear.

491
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:10,633
Ready.

492
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:11,666
Come on.

493
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,533
- This is all right.
- I should have done this.

494
00:46:14,866 --> 00:46:16,600
We should have done that.

495
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:18,200
Do it again.

496
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:23,233
Please hold on.

497
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,300
Are we ready?
