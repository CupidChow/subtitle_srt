1
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,680
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 21)

3
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,719
All right. I get it.

4
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,560
Leave the case to us.

5
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,639
We'll follow up anytime.

6
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,039
I had always assumed
that you would stay in Hong Kong.

7
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,919
After all,
you've worked so hard to get here.

8
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,919
The benefits of staying
in Hong Kong are obvious.

9
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
However, after thinking it over,

10
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,520
in our line of work,

11
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,879
sticking with a reliable leader
helps one progress faster...

12
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,680
and benefits long-term growth.

13
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:35,039
So if you decide
to go back to Jiangzhou,

14
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,919
I hope you can take me with you.

15
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,520
Going back to Jiangzhou won't affect
the business side of things,

16
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,599
but the pay will be reduced.

17
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,840
Since the cost of living
is also much cheaper,

18
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,919
it evens out.

19
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,240
Actually,

20
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,280
I mentioned it when I first arrived.

21
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,520
I came to Hong Kong mostly...

22
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,240
because I wanted to join your team.

23
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,639
After all, meeting
an amazing leader like you...

24
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,000
is a rare stroke of luck...

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,759
and I doubt I'll ever find
another opportunity like this.

26
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,479
Since when did you get
so good with words?

27
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,280
All right.

28
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,840
For those flattering remarks alone,

29
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,759
I'll bring you back to Jiangzhou.

30
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,039
I'm telling the truth.

31
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,919
Thank you.

32
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,759
Thank you.

33
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,730
Han Su.

34
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,720
(Wing Wah)

35
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,079
Zeng Cheng, you didn't have
to pick me up in person.

36
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,839
I could've just called a taxi.

37
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,120
I'm in a hurry to see you.

38
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,399
I have something to tell you.

39
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,399
Listen to me first.

40
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,560
So you came to me
because I'm young...

41
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,839
and can have children for you.

42
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,319
Don't think of me as so superficial.

43
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,680
So when do you
plan to get a divorce?

44
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,319
I have it all arranged.

45
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,639
At most, it will take a year.

46
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,160
If things go well,
it could be as soon as six months.

47
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,839
Is this ring...

48
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,759
a token of your promise?

49
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,879
Yes.

50
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,720
Can you imagine...

51
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,959
what it feels like...

52
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,920
to have a bucket of cold water
poured over you...

53
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,720
from head to toe
in the dead of winter?

54
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,040
Every time I hear it,

55
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,360
I feel like I truly understand...

56
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,800
what it means
to be chilled to the bone.

57
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,439
What a jerk.

58
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,560
What do you plan to do now?

59
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,839
Divorce.

60
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,160
It's not just about the divorce.

61
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,480
I want him to lose everything.

62
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,279
So are you planning...

63
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,480
to help Sun Han Han?

64
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,839
Why should I?

65
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
What gives her the right
to come to me?

66
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,680
Does she think
I'm some kind of saint?

67
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,480
Zhou Bin is texting her every day...

68
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,040
and she forwards
those messages to me.

69
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,360
She just wants to pile this filth
in front of me to provoke me.

70
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,160
However, she's quite smart.

71
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
She knows my personality well.

72
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,000
If she gives me evidence,

73
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
I'll surely return the favour.

74
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,560
So you and Sun Han Han
are now working together?

75
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,879
I really didn't see that coming.

76
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,839
I can't believe
you two became allies.

77
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,160
What allies?

78
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,800
We're just using each other...

79
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,120
for our own gain.

80
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,399
(Boyfriend and Bestie)

81
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,639
Hey, Han Su.

82
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,159
Zhi Nan, I'm in Jiangzhou.

83
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,039
- I'm home.
- Really?

84
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,480
Where are you?
I'll come by to visit you.

85
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,240
This is awesome.

86
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,120
We're neighbours from now on.

87
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,120
Before I went to Hong Kong,
I lived in this neighbourhood.

88
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,120
I got close with the agent
and handled everything online.

89
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
It's very reliable.

90
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,399
Which building did you live in?

91
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,919
Building 2.

92
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,399
Me too.

93
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,600
Mine is unit 2304.

94
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,960
I was in unit 2303.

95
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,450
We lived across from each other.

96
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,330
No wonder you look familiar.

97
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,000
Maybe I've seen you before.

98
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,879
Did Qu Yi Peng
also live here before?

99
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,360
After you went to Hong Kong,

100
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,639
he still lived here?

101
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,039
We should've met a long time ago.

102
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,799
Forget it. It's bothersome.

103
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,210
It's really good.

104
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,120
I've lived around here for so long,

105
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,840
but I didn't know
there was such a good eatery.

106
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,039
You can order anything at this place
with your eyes closed...

107
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,240
and you won't go wrong.

108
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,039
If you love street food this much,

109
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,879
I know a few more hidden treasures.

110
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,159
Let's go together.

111
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,330
Sure.

112
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,720
If I want to eat good food,
I'll just hang out with you.

113
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,210
Not to brag,

114
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,039
but I'm an expert
in finding good food.

115
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,360
Have you seen...

116
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,759
Gao Peng lately?

117
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,559
When I left Hong Kong,

118
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,879
he and his friends
threw me a farewell party.

119
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,480
Is he doing good?

120
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,559
He's fine.

121
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,679
It's just that the work
during the printing phase...

122
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,720
is really tiring...

123
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,279
and tough.

124
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,679
He has lost some weight
because of it.

125
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,840
Is he seeing someone?

126
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,960
I don't know.

127
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,039
Since I came back,

128
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,080
he hasn't approached me.

129
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,360
I think he must be seeing someone.

130
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,159
Otherwise, he wouldn't be
so cold toward me.

131
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,440
Gao Peng is a good person.

132
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,720
He's gentle...

133
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,559
and comes from a good family.

134
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm just curious.

135
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,080
I'm curious what kind of girl...

136
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,559
he fell in love with.

137
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,679
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

138
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,519
Let me introduce you.

139
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,559
This is our new intern, Luo Ma.

140
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,240
Sophie, come out for a second.

141
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,799
Let me introduce you.

142
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,960
Our new intern, Luo Ma.

143
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,759
This is Ms. Han and Mr. Ai.

144
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,120
He'll be assigned to your team.

145
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,919
Hello, Ms. Han and Ms. Ai.

146
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

147
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,559
If you have any questions,
you can ask us.

148
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,159
Your workstation will be right here.

149
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,759
If you have any questions,

150
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,000
you can ask Mr. Chen and Ms. Cai.

151
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,080
They'll help you.

152
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,320
Okay. Carry on with your work.

153
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,039
He's so handsome.

154
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,120
Doesn't he look like a celebrity?

155
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,320
He's all right,

156
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,600
but he looks a bit familiar.

157
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,360
"Young man."

158
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,200
"I think you look familiar."

159
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,320
You may use this
as your opening line later.

160
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,000
Hello, I'm Luo Ma.

161
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,799
Can we...

162
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,320
add each other on WeChat?

163
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,279
Sure.

164
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,360
Hey.

165
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,639
Why did you delete me?

166
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,039
Are you messing with me?

167
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,279
Ms. Han.

168
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,240
I was wondering if you want
to add me back on WeChat.

169
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,399
To be honest,

170
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,600
last time,

171
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:14,159
I was playing Truth or Dare
with my friends.

172
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,039
So...

173
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,399
I'm sorry.

174
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,960
Don't take it to heart.

175
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,559
I'll be honest with you too.

176
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,919
I saw your badge that day.

177
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,639
Sorry.

178
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,519
I looked you up
on the law firm's website.

179
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,759
I went through so much trouble,

180
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,960
overcoming countless obstacles,

181
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,200
to secure an internship
at your firm.

182
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,399
It's all because of you.

183
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,200
Han Su.

184
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,679
Ms. Han.

185
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,679
Han Su, I like you.

186
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,559
You look just like one of those...

187
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,960
passionate middle-school boys
from a manga right now.

188
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,559
All you need
is some background music.

189
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,720
So can I pursue you?

190
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,679
First of all,
I want to make it clear to you.

191
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,159
I don't need love.

192
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,799
That's how it is for me
at this stage.

193
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,320
Second of all,

194
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,840
as long as
it doesn't affect my work,

195
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,279
theoretically,

196
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,759
you're free to do whatever you want.

197
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,240
You really are
a professional lawyer.

198
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,960
You outline the risks...

199
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,399
and give a disclaimer.

200
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,879
Any consequences are on me.

201
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,879
Yes.

202
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,360
Can I pursue you then?

203
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,170
Sir, you're back
from grocery shopping.

204
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,559
That's a lot of groceries.

205
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:16,680
(Core values of socialism)

206
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,759
Sir.

207
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,960
Hi, could you tell me
how to get to Building 2?

208
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,559
From here,

209
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,000
go straight...

210
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,559
and then turn left.

211
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,559
- That's it, right?
- Yes.

212
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,119
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

213
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,519
Here.

214
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,359
Come out, Da Huang.

215
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,240
Come out.

216
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,319
What's wrong?

217
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,720
Are you in a bad mood?

218
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:43,359
There's your favourite
dried fish in here.

219
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,440
Da Huang.

220
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Da Huang.

221
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,759
What's wrong?

222
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,240
Why are you here?

223
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,240
You didn't answer my calls,
so I came to your house.

224
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,440
How did you know where I live?

225
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,440
- Are you stalking me?
- Who's stalking you?

226
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,799
You filled in your home address
on the hospital admission form.

227
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,359
- What do you want?
- To settle the bill.

228
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,410
The ambulance costs,
hospital fees, and the bar bill.

229
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,890
The total is 5,679 yuan. Look.

230
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,440
You pay half. It's 2,840 yuan.

231
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,650
Why should I?

232
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,920
What do you mean by that?

233
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,359
You used my ID to verify
while I was drunk...

234
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,519
and paid with my phone.

235
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,240
This is theft. Do you know that?

236
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,039
I won't report you,
but you need to hurry up and pay.

237
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,119
It serves you right for bragging.

238
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,890
I sent you to the hospital
out of kindness.

239
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,960
It's fine if you don't thank me.

240
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,279
Why are you asking me for money?

241
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,319
I don't have any.

242
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,079
I didn't say I'd buy you a drink.

243
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,480
Of course,
you have to split the bill.

244
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,480
Plus, you didn't play fair
and forced me to drink fast,

245
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,519
which is why I ended up
in the hospital.

246
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,480
So you need to cover
half of the treatment fees.

247
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,799
Asking me for money?

248
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,839
You're so shameless.

249
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
What do you mean?

250
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,410
I don't like you
and I'm not trying to please you.

251
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,410
Right?

252
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,650
Girls like you...

253
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,279
expecting men to pay
for everything all the time...

254
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,759
is a form of gender discrimination.

255
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,200
- Besides...
- It's so annoying!

256
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,599
Payment QR code.

257
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,039
- What?
- Payment QR code.

258
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,000
- How much is it?
- It's 2,840 yuan.

259
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,890
Hold on.

260
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,559
I'm so unlucky.

261
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,079
What a piece of trash.

262
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,599
He's as bad as Leviathan.

263
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,890
No, he's worse than Leviathan.

264
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,440
I won't be able to sleep tonight...

265
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,079
until I figure out who that brat is.

266
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,200
Don't be impulsive.

267
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,650
Wang Zi Lu is like that.

268
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,119
He is always stubborn.

269
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,839
Don't take it to heart.

270
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,079
Actually,

271
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,920
he's not a bad person.

272
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:52,039
Have you known him for a long time?

273
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,170
Yes.

274
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,200
We were in the same
art exam class back in the day.

275
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,599
I gave up after a year.

276
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:00,119
He took the art exam
for three consecutive years,

277
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,200
but didn't make it.

278
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,410
He has a tough life.

279
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,920
An art student?

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,240
Was he active on Adou Forum?

281
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Yes.

282
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,200
Back in the day,

283
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,559
he was considered
a niche opinion leader...

284
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,650
on Adou Forum.

285
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,890
He was into
giving one-star ratings...

286
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,279
and writing negative reviews...

287
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
for those highly-rated
popular movies.

288
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,839
He had quite a few fans.

289
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,240
What's his username?

290
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,920
I don't know that.

291
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,519
Why are you asking about him?

292
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,890
What does he do now?

293
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,410
He's currently employed...

294
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,759
while also running a toy studio
with someone else.

295
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,079
A toy studio?

296
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,119
It's located near
Jianghan Entrepreneurship Market.

297
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,119
He has a shop called Toys Universe.

298
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,839
He usually spends
his spare time there.

299
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,240
I'm not done yet.

300
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,920
An art student.

301
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,720
A niche opinion leader.

302
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,559
Loves to give one-star ratings
to popular movies.

303
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,799
These are all parts
of Leviathan's character.

304
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,960
What are you going to do now?

305
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,720
Get close to him...

306
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,039
and figure out his username
on Adou Forum.

307
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:10,599
Feel free to look around.

308
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,759
These are all our new products.

309
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,279
It's you.

310
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,519
Why are you here?

311
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,559
Are you following me?

312
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,640
I was meeting with a friend nearby.

313
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,440
As I was walking around,

314
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,960
I was attracted to this shop.

315
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,559
I was rude this morning.

316
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,640
It doesn't matter
as long as you paid.

317
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,680
These toys...

318
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,039
These toys are so pretty.

319
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,200
Did you design them all?

320
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,759
Lately, I've been
discussing collaborations...

321
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,359
with several public accounts focused
on relationships and lifestyle.

322
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,319
I think the trendy toys you design
match their style really well.

323
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,519
Would you be interested
in talking about a partnership?

324
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,200
How would that work?

325
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,559
We could use images
of your trendy toys...

326
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,960
as illustrations,

327
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,480
which would also
help promote your products.

328
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Don't tell them.

329
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,200
What? I paid for the noodles.

330
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,200
It's just five yuan.

331
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,480
Do I need you to pay
if I have money?

332
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,920
Five yuan is money too.

333
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,079
Let's go upstairs.

334
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,759
The characters we design...

335
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,200
will be sold
both online and offline.

336
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
We will also design
some stories for them.

337
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,920
This will be useful...

338
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,279
since we plan to make some games...

339
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,519
and animated shorts later.

340
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,160
Did you draw all of these?

341
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
What do you want to drink?

342
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,599
Coffee?

343
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
Thank you.

344
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,799
(Leviathan)

345
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,640
Aren't you going to ask him
to confirm everything?

346
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,440
What's there to ask?
He is Leviathan.

347
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,480
So many years have passed.

348
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,920
What's the point of finding him?

349
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,519
Then I must...

350
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,480
get back at him.

351
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,759
How?

352
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
Back then,

353
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,839
he broke my heart for three months.

354
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,920
Now,

355
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,839
I'm going to make him
unlucky for three months.

356
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,079
You can tell her anything.

357
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,319
Ms. Zeng.

358
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,799
Have a seat.

359
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,599
Let me introduce you.

360
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,279
This is Ms. Wang.

361
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,839
She's my divorce lawyer.

362
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,359
Hello, Ms. Wang.

363
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,519
Hello, Ms. Sun.

364
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
How about this, Ms. Sun?

365
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,759
Allow me to explain it briefly.

366
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,559
My client hopes that in the future,

367
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,599
everything you do...

368
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,880
I know that.

369
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,839
Okay.

370
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,880
Ms. Wang can represent me.

371
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,319
You can talk to her.

372
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,680
I'll get going.

373
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,880
Ms. Zeng.

374
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,160
Thank you.

375
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,319
Ms. Sun, please wait.

376
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,480
Okay.

377
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,000
Today's mission is finally over.

378
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,160
I bought something...

379
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,319
and asked Zhou Bin
to wire me the money.

380
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,359
What mission?

381
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,799
They need evidence for the divorce.

382
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,400
Zeng Cheng's lawyer
asked me to do it.

383
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:49,279
But you firmly rejected Zhou Bin.

384
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,799
If you have a change of heart now,

385
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,279
will he believe you?

386
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,440
Because he's too confident.

387
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,640
When I went to see him,

388
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,640
I simply mentioned that
life was too difficult...

389
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,839
and I couldn't go on.

390
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,160
He immediately gave me
that he-knew-it-all look.

391
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,160
He took me to a fancy restaurant
and bought me a new bag.

392
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,960
He even said
he would take me on a vacation.

393
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,799
He said he would spoil me...

394
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,200
to smooth out any issues between us.

395
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,079
Now he's trying to manipulate me.

396
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,519
Ms. Sun, this is yours.

397
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,519
Thank you.

398
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,440
Here we have Zeng Cheng
and Zhou Bin being in conflict.

399
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,359
Just make sure you don't end up
getting hurt in the end.

400
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,880
After talking
to that lawyer for a while,

401
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,759
I suddenly discovered...

402
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:38,359
how vague the boundary
between love and hate is.

403
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,400
Two people who were once like one...

404
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,640
have been torn apart.

405
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Let's go.

406
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:13,000
(Rucheng Group)

407
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
Zeng Cheng.

408
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,119
Why did the CFO
of my law firm suddenly resign?

409
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,319
Get back to work.

410
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:33,000
How do you explain this?

411
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
The CFO of your law firm resigned.

412
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,039
Why are you looking for me?

413
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,119
You recommended
the new CFO, didn't you?

414
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
It was decided...

415
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,359
by your firm's
decision-making committee.

416
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,000
If you have any issues,
bring them up in the meeting.

417
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,519
You're going too far this time.

418
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
You even arranged
for your people to be in my firm.

419
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,160
What do you mean by that?

420
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,319
Zhou Bin.

421
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,039
This is just
a normal personnel transfer.

422
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,960
You're overthinking it.

423
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,599
I don't care
how many grand reasons you have.

424
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,759
At this critical moment,
you pull something like this.

425
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,839
Do you think I'm a fool?

426
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,039
I have a meeting to attend.

427
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,079
It's not a big deal.

428
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,200
We can talk about it at home later.

429
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,960
Why did you let your cousin hold
most of your shares in the company?

430
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,359
Because I'm expanding my business.

431
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,440
It's just a routine operation.

432
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,799
You're afraid that if I divorce you,

433
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,519
I'll split your assets, right?

434
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,839
Why do you have to speculate
about me so maliciously?

435
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,880
I didn't.

436
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,759
It's your actions...

437
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,160
that have made me think
about protecting myself.

438
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,480
I trust that
you also have no malice.

439
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,839
You're just trying
to protect yourself.

440
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,440
Right?

441
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:59,079
Our project team
is ordering dinner for overtime.

442
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,319
We'll work until midnight today.

443
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,519
Why don't you have dinner with us?

444
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,440
Ms. Han is busy.

445
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,519
Her client from Hong Kong
came all the way to Jiangzhou.

446
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,000
He has been waiting for Ms. Han
to go on a date after work.

447
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,920
Ms. Ai, please take a look at this.

448
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Okay.

449
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,960
Mr. Gao, you...

450
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,079
You're off work, Ms. Han.

451
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,279
What brings you to Jiangzhou?

452
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,480
I'm here to pursue you.

453
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,079
Let's go. I've been waiting for you.

454
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,079
Let's have a meal together.

455
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,480
Well...

456
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:45,039
Our IPO project
has only been completed in stages.

457
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,519
I just met with Hu Mu Ning.

458
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,160
We still have upcoming projects
to carry on with,

459
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,559
don't we?

460
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,680
Well, I guess
I'll just have to comply...

461
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,480
and go out to dinner with you.

462
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,799
Let's go.

463
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,720
Li.

464
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,519
Who was that just now?

465
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,920
He's Gao Peng,
the president of Hengliyan.

466
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,880
Mr. Gao, didn't you drive?

467
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,720
Can you ride a bike?

468
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,720
Of course.

469
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,079
Let's go.

470
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,680
The real Jiangzhou cuisine...

471
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,720
is all hidden
in these narrow alleys...

472
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,559
where cars can't even enter.

473
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,960
Only someone like me,
a Jiangzhou local, would know.

474
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,400
(Yangzi Noodle House)

475
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,279
All right.

476
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
Thank you.

477
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,319
This bowl of noodles...

478
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,640
is the most authentic...

479
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,440
caviar noodles in Jiangzhou.

480
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,880
The essence of this bowl of noodles
lies in the caviar not being fishy.

481
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,279
The sauce enhances
the caviar's freshness.

482
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,599
It has to be mixed...

483
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,160
so that every noodle
has caviar on it...

484
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,559
to taste good.

485
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,759
Try it.

486
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,680
Thank you.

487
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,240
How is it?

488
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,279
It's good.

489
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,680
- It's good, right?
- It's really good.

490
00:33:58,759 --> 00:33:59,839
Right?

491
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,079
There are two more dishes.

492
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,480
Xing.

493
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:03,839
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

494
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:04,880
- Enjoy.
- All right.

495
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,360
Their chili oil is amazing too.

496
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:11,599
It's very fragrant.

497
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,039
Sprinkle it on the buns.

498
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,719
By the way,

499
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,840
did you go back to Jiangzhou
to see Zhi Nan?

500
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,679
No.

501
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,079
You didn't see her
or you didn't tell her?

502
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
I didn't tell her.

503
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,480
Are you still friends?

504
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,920
Of course.

505
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,639
Actually, it's kind of silly.

506
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm worried that after I see her,
I won't have the courage to see you.

507
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:34,880
(House for rent)

508
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,400
You can have all the fun you want,
but don't send it out for real.

509
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:42,599
That's illegal.

510
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,289
If you're really mad,

511
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,119
just get some friends to call him...

512
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,519
for a little punishment.

513
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,239
A full-service nanny.

514
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
On standby 24 hours a day.

515
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:57,239
Mr. Wang.

516
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,000
(Mr. Wang, Professional...)

517
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,329
Are you satisfied now?

518
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,159
Not really.

519
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,360
It's too bad that I can't see...

520
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,289
how pathetic he is.

521
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,039
That's not right.

522
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:44,809
I should think of a way
to get close to him.

523
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,920
That way, I can enjoy
the pleasure of revenge.

524
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,599
Hello?

525
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:07,360
Is this Wang Zi Lu?

526
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,769
Who is it?

527
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,559
This is He Zhi Nan.

528
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:13,639
I'm sorry about last time.

529
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,639
Something urgent came up
and I had to take care of it.

530
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,289
That's why I didn't have time
to say goodbye.

531
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,679
Well, it's okay.

532
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:25,769
I saw on your website
that you're looking for a writer...

533
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,480
to write about a cutie.

534
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,559
I'd like to recommend myself.

535
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
Sure.

536
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,639
If you're free,
come over in a couple of days.

537
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,289
How much is this?

538
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:45,289
This one?

539
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,960
This one is 129 yuan.

540
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,199
For two, it's 20 percent off.

541
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,289
Do you think it's expensive?

542
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,639
It's 20 percent off.

543
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,920
I think you haven't really seen
the value in it.

544
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,239
Don't you think our creation
has a special sense of healing?

545
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,289
Well...

546
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,679
This is the second generation
of my cutie design.

547
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,769
She's a city girl...

548
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:08,679
who desperately wants to grow up
but just can't.

549
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,519
She longs for love,

550
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:12,360
but at the same time,
she doesn't really believe in love.

551
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,079
She's materialistic,

552
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:15,719
but sometimes, she's quite genuine.

553
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:18,039
Often, she's overly confident,

554
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,960
but sometimes,
she feels inferior for no reason.

555
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,199
Isn't she
just a half-baked city girl?

556
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,039
Half-baked.

557
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,719
I like that term.

558
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:33,809
Hello?

559
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,840
I don't fix air conditioners.
You have the wrong number.

560
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,599
I'm about to create
an animated short film...

561
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,239
for my cutie.

562
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,840
Do you have any...

563
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:49,840
Hello?

564
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,079
You have the wrong number.

565
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,289
What's wrong?

566
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:04,079
I have been getting calls
since this morning.

567
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,719
They want me
to fix the air conditioner,

568
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,480
fix the sewer, and change the locks.

569
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,599
It's a mess.

570
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,519
Did you offend someone?

571
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,960
No. Who would I offend?

572
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,400
If nothing works,

573
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,679
why don't you change your number?

574
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:22,159
I can't change my phone number.

575
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:25,920
What if my hard-earned clients
can't reach me?

576
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,329
And my boss.

577
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,599
If he calls and I don't pick up,
he'll deduct my salary.

578
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,329
You're still working a regular job
and getting a salary?

579
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:40,159
I work as a modeller
for a gaming company.

580
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:43,289
This studio is just something
we do in our spare time.

581
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,000
It doesn't make money.

582
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,679
It's entirely sustained by the wages
of me and two other friends.

583
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:50,960
So why keep the studio open
if it's not profitable?

584
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,480
It's for fun.

585
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,360
I've loved playing with toys
ever since I was a kid,

586
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,880
but as I grew up,

587
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,679
I realized I couldn't find
the right toys anymore.

588
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,289
I was wondering,

589
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:02,769
why can't adults
have their own toys?

590
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,769
After I graduated from college,

591
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,880
I had this idea,

592
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,000
so I started a business.

593
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,440
Was it just for fun?

594
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,599
Not exactly.

595
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:16,840
I figured there must be
a lot of people in the world...

596
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,159
who think the same way I do.

597
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,289
I wanted to find them.

598
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,679
So what if you find them?

599
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,289
Well, if I find
enough like-minded people,

600
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:32,440
I can make a fortune, right?

601
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,519
Hello?

602
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,679
You have the wrong number.

603
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:52,480
What kind of trashy thoughts
do you all have in your heads?

604
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,679
Late-night secret talks
or something?

605
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,880
Mr. Dong, I'm sorry.

606
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,480
I wasn't talking to you just now.

607
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,000
Well, I received a spam call.

608
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,199
Yes.

609
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,599
I'm sorry. Please hold on.

610
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:07,679
Let me ask.

611
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,289
Has Mr. Dong's stock been posted?

612
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:10,880
- Yes.
- When did you post it?

613
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:12,639
- He did.
- He did.

614
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,119
Answer my question.

615
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,289
Yesterday.

616
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,239
I packed it yesterday
and you posted it.

617
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:20,000
Mr. Dong, your stock
was shipped out yesterday.

618
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,079
Yes, it'll be there soon.

619
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,079
Are you happy now?

620
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,559
It's all right.

621
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:26,639
I need to think of another way...

622
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,480
to prank him.

623
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,199
I think he's...

624
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,769
quite nice.

625
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:36,440
The story of cutie
is quite interesting.

626
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,289
It just so happens...

627
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,000
to align with
the story of that little girl...

628
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,119
you want to write.

629
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,679
I'll revise the story
when I get back.

630
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:54,840
What are you doing?

631
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:00,480
Who are you talking to?

632
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,440
I see.

633
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:08,329
You're the kind of person...

634
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:09,400
who would have a chat
with your inner self.

635
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,440
Right?

636
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
Nonsense.

637
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
What do you know?

638
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,039
All right. Stop pretending.

639
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,480
I won't make fun of you.

640
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,000
I was like that
when I was little too.

641
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,679
To put it bluntly,

642
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,440
we're kind of alike, aren't we?

643
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,599
Well, are you hungry?

644
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:26,769
I'm going to eat crayfish.

645
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:28,289
Do you want some?

646
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,440
He thinks the same as I do.

647
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,289
I'm also craving it.

648
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,119
(Sticking is Prohibited)

649
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,769
(Female driver,
Girls are just bad at gaming)

650
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:50,239
(Lazy, Greedy,
Muffin top, Thunder thighs)

651
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,960
(Pretentious, Scheming)

652
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:17,039
I think she's suffocating.

653
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,289
Let's help her.

654
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:21,329
It's neither a man nor a woman.

655
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:22,440
"Thunder thighs."

656
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,679
"Lazy."

657
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,329
Why are there so many labels?

658
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:26,840
It's her.

659
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:30,719
Do you know her?

660
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:33,119
She has a gentle voice.

661
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:34,639
Men love her.

662
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,840
She's very famous.

663
00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:38,329
A conniving shrew.

664
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,329
(Conniving)

665
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,719
Look at her skirt. It's so short.

666
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,440
She even dyed her hair.

667
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,880
She looks indecent.

668
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,000
Which decent girl
would dye her hair?

669
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:55,880
She's an Internet celebrity.

670
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,440
The fact that
she wants to gain fame...

671
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,360
shows she must be
quite materialistic.

672
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:10,360
(Materialistic)

673
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:16,000
(Jealous, Narrow-minded)

674
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,400
Let's go.
