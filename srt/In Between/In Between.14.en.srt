00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 14)

3
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,599
Is this what they call love?

4
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,359
It's really beautiful.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,079
However,

6
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,959
it costs 999 yuan.

7
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,519
It's really expensive.

8
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,879
Let's build up our fate a bit more.

9
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
True love, after all,

10
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,598
is not something that comes easily.

11
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,599
(Love Trade)

12
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,680
Ladies.

13
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,159
Can I have a word with you?

14
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,319
Ladies.

15
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,960
Do you want love?

16
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,090
I guarantee it's authentic.

17
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,000
In-store inspections are welcomed.

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,370
Plus, it's on sale now.

19
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,400
It's only 9.90 yuan.

20
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,199
- Love is cheap too.
- Love is cheap too.

21
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,439
High quality at a bargain price.

22
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,400
No deception.

23
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,159
Most importantly, it's authentic.

24
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,840
Then give me 50 of them.

25
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,919
WeChat Pay or Alipay?

26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
Anything is fine.

27
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,400
Okay.

28
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,400
Here you go.

29
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,439
Hey, pretty lady.

30
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,240
Do you want one?

31
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,000
It's okay.

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,560
I don't want to settle.

33
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,680
I'll wait a bit more.

34
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,319
I just arrived two days ago...

35
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,520
and I've been hearing Gao Peng
talk about you nonstop.

36
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,280
He says you're a hard worker.

37
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,639
The meeting ended
in the afternoon...

38
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,919
and a complete draft...

39
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,199
will be in his inbox...

40
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,879
by the next morning.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
I'm really curious
about what he said.

42
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,239
That's why
I want to get to know you.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,280
Thank you.

44
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,520
Working in Hong Kong...

45
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,560
is really tough.

46
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,758
In our line of work,

47
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,840
it's the same
no matter where we work.

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
That's true.

49
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Ms. He.

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Sorry.

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,120
I only have a short lunch break.

52
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,318
What do you want to say?

53
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,319
Just get to the point.

54
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,280
Have you seen this before?

55
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,680
I found it on Gao Peng's bed.

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,920
I'd like to hear your opinion.

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
Me?

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,680
What opinion could I possibly have?

59
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,078
My relationship with Mr. Gao
is purely work-related.

60
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,170
That Emily...

61
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,839
sent Gao Peng bikini photos
in the middle of the night.

62
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,879
What does she mean by that?

63
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,399
She wants to win Gao Peng over.

64
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,398
Everyone can see it.

65
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,480
It's so obvious.

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,800
You saw it too, right?

67
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,079
Besides Emily,

68
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,240
Gao Peng's friends...

69
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,480
and the ladies on my team...

70
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,050
are all interested in him.

71
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,279
Have you only just realized...

72
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,730
how much attention
your boyfriend gets?

73
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes, I came...

74
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,639
I came too late.

75
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,639
We've been together...

76
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,170
for seven years.

77
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,279
Even though we were
in different places,

78
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,839
but we trusted each other.

79
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,519
It wasn't
until I came to Hong Kong...

80
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
that I realized...

81
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,800
I couldn't leave him.

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,199
We've been together
since before college.

83
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,639
She's the kindest...

84
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,839
and most ethical girl...

85
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,079
I've ever met.

86
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,959
Don't be sad.

87
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,120
Those were the good old days.

88
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,879
We're all adults.

89
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,560
Face the problem and solve it.

90
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,879
Being sad won't solve anything.

91
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,359
Can you help me?

92
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,680
How am I supposed to help you?

93
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,639
If...

94
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,319
If you find out...

95
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,959
that they're in contact,

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
can you tell me?

97
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Don't worry.

98
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,519
If you help me,

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,079
I'll definitely put in a good word
for you with Gao Peng.

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,838
I'll make him your real client.

101
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,680
Ms. He, you're putting me
in a difficult position.

102
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,040
I really hope
Mr. Gao becomes my client,

103
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,399
but whatever is going on
between him and Emily...

104
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,519
is their personal business.

105
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,079
Those are two different things.

106
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,360
It's very unwise of me...

107
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,078
to interfere.

108
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,079
But...

109
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,879
But I love him.

110
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,000
If you love him so much,

111
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,040
why don't you just ask him?

112
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,399
Don't you trust him?

113
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,079
Because I can't...

114
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,040
Because I can't lose him.

115
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,480
Gao Peng...

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,279
has always been slow to open up...

117
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
and it's not easy for him
to trust new friends.

118
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,240
However, I think...

119
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,119
I think he trusts you a lot.

120
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,199
That's why...

121
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,879
I think I can trust you too.

122
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,160
So for the sake of your trust,

123
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,199
should I betray his trust?

124
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,000
That's not what I meant.

125
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,919
I know you.

126
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
Su Su.

127
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,639
I can't disclose that to you.

128
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,278
To be honest,

129
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,439
I don't even consider
He Zhi Nan as a threat.

130
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,639
Han Su,

131
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,999
if you want to compete with me,

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,079
you're still a worthy opponent.

133
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,720
Han Su.

134
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,000
Can I borrow these earrings
for a couple of days?

135
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Okay.

136
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,360
You guys might not have...

137
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,959
more experience
in relationships than I do.

138
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,480
In this game of love,

139
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,319
you might not play better than I do.

140
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,240
Qu Yi Peng is part of your past.

141
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,398
You don't need to be upset
because of him.

142
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,759
Your main goal now...

143
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,480
is to get Gao Peng as a client.

144
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,319
Don't let your emotions
get in the way.

145
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,199
Honestly, I don't think you need
to be so anxious about Emily.

146
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,360
From an economic point of view,

147
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,199
a man's value for a woman...

148
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,920
depends on how rare
or hard-to-get she is.

149
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,079
The harder she is to get,
the more he'll cherish her.

150
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,519
Think about it.

151
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,318
She sent that kind
of photo to Gao Peng...

152
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,360
in the middle of the night.

153
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,959
Does that look like something
a couple would do?

154
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,450
What about the earring?

155
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,240
It's possible
that she purposely left it there.

156
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,519
Her goal is probably
for you to find it,

157
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,720
start a fight with him,

158
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,879
and create more distance
between you two...

159
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,039
which would only give her
more opportunities.

160
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,638
My colleague is looking for me.

161
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,679
I have to go now.

162
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,210
Han Su.

163
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,210
Thank you.

164
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,840
(Café)

165
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,638
(Someone Who Loves Me)

166
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,279
(Day One)

167
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,210
Let's go shopping together, okay?

168
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,329
Did you drink the milk tea
I bought for you last time?

169
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,359
It was quite good.

170
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,399
Let me tell you.

171
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,558
Previously...

172
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,209
(Someone Who Loves Me)

173
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,279
No.

174
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,639
I just want to ask...

175
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,919
why you didn't reply
to the message I sent you.

176
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,090
Also, did you eat the breakfast
I bought for you yesterday?

177
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,519
What do you want to eat?

178
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,279
You're so annoying.

179
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,039
How annoying.

180
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,039
(Day Two)

181
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,360
Can...

182
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,480
Can you not follow me?

183
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,359
I've said it a million times.

184
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,450
I don't want to be
in a relationship.

185
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,090
No.

186
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,799
If you really don't like me at all,

187
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,090
just tell me.

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,158
I won't pester you anymore.

189
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,639
- I don't like you.
- I don't believe it.

190
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,279
Happy birthday to you

191
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,000
Happy birthday to you

192
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,279
Happy birthday to you

193
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,360
Happy birthday to you

194
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Happy birthday.

195
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,799
What's your wish?
I can make it come true.

196
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,999
I only have one wish.

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Please leave.

198
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,450
(Day Three)

199
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,450
Happy birthday.

200
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,000
I finally got rid of him.

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
There's one less person...

202
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,919
who loves me in this world.

203
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,159
- Gumina.
- Mr. Gao, you're back.

204
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,840
What are you doing?

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,279
I'm watching a theatre show.

206
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,039
Back when I was in Jiangzhou,
I used to go all the time.

207
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
It's really interesting.

208
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Do you want to join me?

209
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,360
- Do you have a cold?
- I'm fine.

210
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
I'll make you some medicine.

211
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,480
There's no need. I'm fine.

212
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,799
What are we having for dinner?

213
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,159
I had my dinner.

214
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,960
I have been here for days,

215
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,840
but I haven't had the chance
to eat with you alone.

216
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,919
I've been waiting at home for you.

217
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
How about this?

218
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,600
Give me a moment.
I need to finish some work.

219
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,399
I'll take you out
for supper later, okay?

220
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Go ahead with your work.

221
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,638
I'll take care of it myself.

222
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,720
Good girl.

223
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,840
Dad.

224
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,159
I just met the sponsor.

225
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,879
I've spoken with the people
from the new law firm.

226
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,759
I don't think
they're as good as Ms. Han.

227
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,960
Did you check out...

228
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,279
the equity incentive memorandum...

229
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,360
from her?

230
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,000
I understand.

231
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Compare different options. I know.

232
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,919
All right.

233
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,759
Mr. Gao, you've worked hard.

234
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,600
You look charming...

235
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,000
when you're discussing business.

236
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,159
Didn't you already promise Han Su...

237
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,159
to let her handle the project?

238
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,960
Why are you meeting other lawyers?

239
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,440
This is business.

240
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,759
It's not like getting a wife.

241
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,240
That's how it is in the industry.

242
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,080
Come with me.

243
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Come downstairs with me.

244
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,639
What for?

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,279
I'll show you something good.

246
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,919
What is it?

247
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,519
It's on the couch.

248
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,679
Did you buy something for me?

249
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,720
Look for it.

250
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,200
Where is it?

251
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,399
What did you buy?

252
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,559
Here it is.

253
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,519
Do you remember?

254
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,039
Of course.

255
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
Nan Nan.

256
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,879
I've never heard you sing.

257
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,758
I'm not a good singer.

258
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,799
It's okay.

259
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,200
If it's not nice, I...

260
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,279
I promise I won't tell anyone.

261
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,039
Don't laugh at me then.

262
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,360
Okay, I swear.

263
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll miss you day and night

264
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,399
I'm going to go all out

265
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,960
The fireworks in the distance
grow increasingly poignant

266
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,840
Before...

267
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Why are you looking at me?

268
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Your eyes are sparkling.

269
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,519
They're hurting my eyes.

270
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,080
They're brighter
than the stars in the sky.

271
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,600
I'll miss you day and night

272
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm going to go all out

273
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:59,279
The fireworks in the distance
grow increasingly poignant

274
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,679
Gazing at the distance
before and behind me

275
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,410
I'll...

276
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,119
Are you asleep?

277
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:13,799
No.

278
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,599
I'm not asleep.

279
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,920
I sang the whole song,

280
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,359
but someone fell asleep.

281
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Not at all.

282
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,960
I'm wide awake.

283
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,279
I don't want
to go back to Jiangzhou.

284
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,650
Why?

285
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,480
Well, what...

286
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:38,839
What about your job?

287
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,240
I'll quit my job.

288
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,649
Are you unhappy that I'm staying?

289
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,680
No.

290
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,079
It's just a bit sudden.

291
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:53,038
You didn't tell your parents either.

292
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,170
Are they going to be okay with that?

293
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,279
Wouldn't it be better
if I stayed in Hong Kong?

294
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:03,240
This way,
we can be together every day.

295
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,960
We won't have to be
in a long-distance relationship.

296
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Yes.

297
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:09,200
It's certainly better if we
don't have to do long-distance.

298
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
However...

299
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,239
It's work.

300
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,759
Just a second. I need to answer it.

301
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,519
Hello?

302
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,890
Hello, Gao Peng.

303
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,359
You didn't forget that today
is my birthday, did you?

304
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,519
Well, Nan Nan is new to Hong Kong.

305
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,119
I have to stay home with her.

306
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,650
Tonight,

307
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,170
I might not be able to make it.

308
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,000
No way, Gao Peng.

309
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,650
I can't believe you're so whipped.

310
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,650
Listen.

311
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,410
My brother managed to get
Mr. Su from Shengshi to come...

312
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,889
and Han Su is here too.

313
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,890
Opportunities don't wait for anyone.

314
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,200
You need to come over right away.

315
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,759
Babe.

316
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,720
I have to go out for a while.

317
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,559
I'm leaving, babe.

318
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,920
Are you going
to a meeting at this hour?

319
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,799
It's not a meeting.
It's more like a social event.

320
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,839
Mr. Wang introduced me
to a few people...

321
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,559
and suggested
we have dinner together.

322
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,720
I don't really want to go.

323
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,410
Can I join you then?

324
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,960
You really shouldn't go.

325
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,240
These people are so boring.

326
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,650
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

327
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,319
Hello, Han Su.

328
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,079
It's me.

329
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,839
Happy birthday to you

330
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:33,039
Happy birthday to you

331
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,759
Happy birthday to you

332
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,519
My birthday wish this year...

333
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,359
is to spend next year's birthday
with Gao Peng again.

334
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,890
Good!

335
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,000
- Good.
- Good.

336
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,278
Next year on your birthday,

337
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,920
Gao Peng and I
will celebrate with you too.

338
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,038
Didn't you say...

339
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,079
you had a headache
and couldn't come?

340
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,519
Yet here you are.

341
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,920
Emily put so much thought
into welcoming me.

342
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,799
How could I not come?

343
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Happy birthday.

344
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,890
Open it.

345
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Three threes.

346
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,920
Three fives.

347
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,999
Four threes.

348
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,119
- Five fives.
- Open it.

349
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,480
What kind of luck does she have?

350
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,599
You lost. Drink it.

351
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
A bet is a bet.

352
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,119
- Again.
- Again.

353
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,559
- Three fours.
- Four fives.

354
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:59,599
- Four fours.
- Four sixes.

355
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,279
You lost.

356
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:04,798
Come on. A bet is a bet.

357
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,799
Again.

358
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,839
Four fours.

359
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Five fives.

360
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,000
Five sixes.

361
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,480
- Flip it.
- Six. I'll flip it.

362
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:21,559
- There's none.
- None.

363
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,640
None.

364
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,359
- Again.
- Again.

365
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,160
Come on.

366
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,240
Did you call her?

367
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,160
She's the one who called me.

368
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,279
Look at her today.

369
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,319
She's all worked up.

370
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,118
Five sixes.

371
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,119
Stop teasing me.

372
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,639
You should help me cover up.

373
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
Six sixes.

374
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,440
Since she called me,
it means she's suspicious.

375
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,880
We're all together
for a birthday party anyway.

376
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,839
Being all secretive
makes it look more suspicious.

377
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,039
Why even do that?

378
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
The same as her.

379
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,000
Your great vengeance
has been avenged.

380
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,720
This is just the beginning.

381
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,359
Your suggestion to give her
the earring was smart.

382
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,880
I made a powerful first move.

383
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,279
Thank you.

384
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,519
I didn't do it to help you.

385
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,559
That earring is mine.

386
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,839
Emily borrowed it from me.

387
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,359
What do you mean?

388
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,960
It means...

389
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,480
she left the earring on purpose.

390
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,880
She left your thing on purpose?

391
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,559
When I find out
and pursue the matter,

392
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,359
it will also be on you, Han Su.

393
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,720
She set you up.

394
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,559
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

395
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,519
Come on.

396
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,799
I never thought...

397
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,519
someone would go this far...

398
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,599
for love.

399
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,759
It's quite embarrassing.

400
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,200
You have
to achieve your goal first...

401
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,799
before worrying about how it seems,

402
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,279
don't you?

403
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,160
You're right.

404
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:07,919
Emily, come with me.

405
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,999
Why are you here?

406
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,119
- What are you doing?
- Get lost!

407
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,038
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

408
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,079
What's your relationship with her?

409
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,599
- What are you doing?
- Stop it.

410
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,599
What's your relationship with her?

411
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,160
Stop fighting!

412
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,279
Stop fighting!

413
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,598
What are you doing?

414
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,599
Why did you hit him?

415
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,639
Are you crazy?

416
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,679
Who are you?

417
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Are you crazy?

418
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,839
What's wrong with you?

419
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Get out of my way.

420
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,960
What are you doing?

421
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,598
Don't just stand there.

422
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,999
- Call security.
- Okay.

423
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,359
- Are you crazy?
- Stop it.

424
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,480
You hit me.

425
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,640
Mr. Gao, what's going on?

426
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
There's a fight.

427
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,440
What...

428
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,680
What was...

429
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,000
What was the move you used just now?

430
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Nine Yin Skeleton Claw?

431
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,960
You're one to talk.

432
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,440
Didn't you do well
in martial arts during high school?

433
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,359
- Why did you forget everything?
- I didn't forget.

434
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,758
You were...

435
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,838
Didn't you just...

436
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,999
What is the name
of the first move in boxing?

437
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,480
- Get ready!
- Ready!

438
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,920
First stance.

439
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,799
Does it hurt?

440
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
No.

441
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
What kind of loser...

442
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,079
is Emily associating with?

443
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:32,799
Are you trying to say...

444
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,279
that I'm also hanging out
with a bunch of losers?

445
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,960
That's not what I meant.

446
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
Are you saying I've changed?

447
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,359
Of course you have.

448
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,799
You've transformed...

449
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,200
from someone content and happy...

450
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,839
just taking care of little birds...

451
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,240
into a director...

452
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,359
who's surrounded
by people every day.

453
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
To be honest,

454
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,599
in the past few months,

455
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,879
I've been forced...

456
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,160
to know more people
than I've ever known in my life.

457
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,839
In their eyes, I'm just a fool
with too much money and good luck.

458
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,759
Whoever thinks
you're just a fool with money...

459
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,240
is the real fool.

460
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,839
How foolish and mundane.

461
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,559
Your strengths...

462
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,359
are priceless.

463
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,759
Do you remember...

464
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,599
the final mock test
before the college entrance exam...

465
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,839
when I did poorly?

466
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,279
We were sitting by the flower bed
next to our school...

467
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,400
and you squatted next to me,

468
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,960
saying something similar
to what you're saying now.

469
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Of course I remember.

470
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:37,839
To cheer you up,

471
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,119
I squatted so long
that my legs went numb.

472
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,440
Nan Nan.

473
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,160
I can only be myself
in front of you,

474
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,839
without pretending
or carrying burdens...

475
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,920
and I'm not afraid
of being looked down upon.

476
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,079
You're really my family.

477
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,720
You mean the same to me.

478
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,319
You're the closest person to me...

479
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,799
after my parents.

480
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,480
All that glitz and glamour
is just superficial.

481
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,599
I only feel at ease
when I hold your hand.

482
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,559
They all say I'm lucky.

483
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,759
I think so too.

484
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,720
Because I have you.

485
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,480
I don't want to be apart
from you anymore.

486
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,920
If you can't sell buns,
you can sell dumplings.

487
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,079
What dumplings? What buns?

488
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,839
Have you forgotten?

489
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,599
You once said that
if you stayed in Hong Kong,

490
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,839
you'd sell buns in Central...

491
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
and be like Bao.

492
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,880
I don't want to be like Bao.

493
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,200
Hearing you say that...

494
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,599
makes me seriously think
about what I want to do.

495
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,000
There's no need to think.

496
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,319
It's up to you.

497
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,720
As long as you feel happy
and content every day.

498
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,759
Stop filming.

499
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,599
Stop filming.

500
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,679
Stop filming.

501
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,199
(Gosh. What happened?)

502
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,439
(It's him. Look at his shoes.)

503
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,838
- Yi Ming.
- Yi Ming.

504
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,200
- Yi Ming.
- Yi Ming.

505
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,000
It's real.

506
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,000
It's most likely...

507
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,119
in Wei's hands.

508
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,759
It's not easy...

509
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,880
to deal with him.

510
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,359
Yi Ming's manager is his cousin.

511
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,880
She comes to me every day crying,

512
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
saying she has been set up.

513
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,279
She has a lot of artists...

514
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,680
and a big business to manage.

515
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,319
If Yi Ming's career collapses,

516
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,519
the penalty fees
will cost her everything.

517
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,359
She has been my client for years.

518
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,359
I can't ignore this.

519
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,000
Mr. Wang.

520
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,839
You're like an older brother to me.

521
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,680
You can talk to Wei about this.

522
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,400
I really need your help
with this matter.

523
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,079
Zeng Cheng is good at this.

524
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,960
If she can't handle it,

525
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,880
then I really have no chance at all.

526
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,160
Stop filming.

527
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,159
Stop filming.

528
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,240
Stop filming.

529
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,759
- Yi Ming.
- Yi Ming.

530
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,839
After all our struggles
to reach this age,

531
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,759
a divorce can be...

532
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,559
so damaging.

533
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,680
- Yes.
- It even ruins one's future.

534
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:18,559
Why put yourself through that?

535
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,319
As someone who has experienced it,

536
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,200
I have to say something
you may not want to hear.

537
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,359
Those young girls...

538
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,319
have nothing to offer...

539
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,680
except their youth.

540
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,720
They're hot-headed.

541
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,400
Are you going
to get caught up in it too?

542
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:44,799
Sincerely admit your mistakes.

543
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:46,640
As long as you're sincere,

544
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,839
you can achieve great things.

545
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,839
The one who can truly help
in times of trouble...

546
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,400
is your wife.

547
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,200
The elevator is here.

548
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

549
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:25,799
Thank you.

550
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,160
These are supplements
for you and Mr. Gao.

551
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,559
Thank you.

552
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,960
How's your injury?

553
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,839
- It's almost healed.
- Thank you.

554
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,519
Emily's boyfriend
is still in the hospital.

555
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,519
I really don't get it.

556
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,839
How did you
end up flying out sideways...

557
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,000
like a low-altitude cannonball?

558
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,519
I was drunk.

559
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,119
The view here is really nice.

560
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,160
It's to the point
where I can't bear to leave...

561
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,880
after just one more look.

562
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,799
You see the view...

563
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,400
while I see the mirror.

564
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,079
I'm not going back.

565
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
I'll quit my job
and stay in Hong Kong.

566
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,480
If you quit your job,

567
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,400
the focus of your life
will only be on men.

568
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,159
I know women need to be independent,

569
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,679
so I studied hard.

570
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,360
After I graduated from college,

571
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:23,519
I joined a company and got a job.

572
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,960
It seems like I'm independent,

573
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,880
but I still feel dispensable
in the workplace.

574
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,239
Could it be that...

575
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:35,440
you just haven't found
what you truly enjoy doing?

576
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,289
I've asked myself...

577
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,329
what I like and what matters to me.

578
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,199
After some thought...

579
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,559
Don't laugh at me.

580
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,239
It's love.

581
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,559
Loving someone...

582
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,159
and being loved by someone.

583
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:01,079
That's what...

584
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,289
I strive for.

585
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,809
It seems you've realized your dream.

586
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,440
You have love...

587
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,000
and are living the life
many people dream of.

588
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,289
That's great.

589
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,039
You're a lucky woman.

590
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,519
I realized that growing up
happens in an instant.

591
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,159
When I was young, my ideal love...

592
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,440
was passionate and tumultuous,

593
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,519
without regrets...

594
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,289
and leaving no room for flaws.

595
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,480
But now,
I'm willing to go all out for a man.

596
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:48,920
I choose to selectively overlook...

597
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,920
those imperfections...

598
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,639
and I believe
this is my best choice.

599
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,239
Han Su.

600
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,239
In fact,

601
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,809
there are
very few people like you...

602
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:09,239
who strive to carve out a space
for themselves in unfamiliar places.

603
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,559
I admire you,

604
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,559
but I don't envy you.

605
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,079
I know it's something
I can't aspire to.

606
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,289
I can't control my feelings...

607
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,559
and I don't possess your strength...

608
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,079
and bravery.

609
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,000
I didn't expect her...

610
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,599
to trust me so much...

611
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:45,960
and to speak so openly.

612
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,360
It turns out I was the one
being narrow-minded.

613
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,959
(Independence,
I Wish I Could Be Like Ms. Nan)

614
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,999
(Overly relied on
independent women...)

615
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,119
Don't laugh at me.

616
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:10,839
It's all just scattered nonsense
that I say occasionally.

617
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,880
It's quite silly.

618
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,239
I didn't expect to have
a few fans who like it.

619
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,678
(Your writing
is very emotional and relaxed,)

620
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,558
(yet intuitively accurate.)

621
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,328
(It's also quite sharp
and humorous,)

622
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:32,238
(making it easy to read.)

623
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:34,808
(Some sentences
leave a lasting impression.)

624
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,399
(You should keep writing.)

625
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,719
(Maybe this is...)

626
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,399
(Thank you.)

627
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,919
(This is the first time
someone told me...)

628
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,039
(I could make a living from this.)

629
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,960
Here's your coffee.

630
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,679
Don't cry.

631
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,400
Mr. Zhou has been working
on a way out.

632
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:20,559
How can I not cry?

633
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,769
If our artist's career
gets ruined because of this,

634
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,769
not even my life
as their manager could pay for it.

635
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,960
When is Mr. Zhou coming back?

636
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,559
He should be here soon.

637
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,119
Be here soon?

638
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,679
He'd better show up soon.

639
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:35,559
Tell Mr. Zhou...

640
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,639
that if he doesn't come up
with a solution today,

641
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,079
both he and I are done.

642
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,719
Mr. Zhou.

643
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:44,809
Is she inside?

644
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,239
She has been crying.

645
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,769
She insisted on waiting
for you to come back.

646
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,518
Get me two cups of coffee.

647
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,599
Okay.

648
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,519
Hello.

649
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,639
The number you have dialed
is currently busy.

650
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,159
Please try again later.

(Rucheng Group)

652
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,679
Xiao Li, go to the hospital.

653
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,480
What's wrong?

654
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:44,719
Are you not feeling well?

(Zhou Bin, Divorce registration)

657
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,199
What do you mean?

658
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,519
A remarriage.

659
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,119
All the documents are in there.

660
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,840
If you're willing,

661
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:28,559
we can go to
the Civil Affairs Bureau now.

662
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:42,360
Stop the car.

663
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
I've thought it through.

664
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I said stop the car.

665
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,679
You don't think...

666
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:05,199
I'm behind your trouble, do you?
