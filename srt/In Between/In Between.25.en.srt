1
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,598
(Episode 25)

3
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,319
(Building 3 and 8,
Building 1, 6, 14, and 19)

4
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,799
Su Su.

5
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,519
Here.

6
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,200
Drink the milk.

7
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,840
I asked you
to come home this time...

8
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,719
because I have something
to discuss with you.

9
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,159
You sounded anxious on the phone.

10
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
What is it?

11
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,810
Maybe I'm getting married.

12
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,400
Really?

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
That's good news.

14
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,319
I've always supported
your decision to remarry.

15
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,079
To be honest,
I've always wanted to tell you this.

16
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,438
You should find someone reliable,

17
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,679
someone you like,

18
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,800
and live a good life.

19
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,960
So what's this person like?

20
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,639
Is he good?

21
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,719
He's quite average.

22
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,039
He doesn't have much money.

23
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,999
He's not tall and handsome.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,280
He's not good-looking.

25
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,560
I was just worried...

26
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,560
that you wouldn't agree.

27
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,799
Who just told me...

28
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,400
that as long as I like him,
you'll like him too?

29
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,800
It's the same for me.

30
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,599
As long as you like him,
I'll like him too.

31
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,719
That's great.

32
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,439
Actually,

33
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,439
I...

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,120
I want to remarry your dad.

35
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,360
Haven't you always...

36
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,000
hated him?

37
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,680
During all these years at home,
you have never mentioned him.

38
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,519
What's his name?

39
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,199
I don't even know who he is.

40
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,120
Don't blame me.

41
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,759
Back then,

42
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,319
when I broke up with him,

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,198
it was due to
a big misunderstanding.

44
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,239
No.

45
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,120
Didn't you say...

46
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,518
that he ruthlessly left us behind...

47
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,839
and went to be with another woman...

48
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,399
to enjoy a better life?

49
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,279
No. That's not true.

50
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,279
Actually, back then,

51
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,398
he was scammed...

52
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,639
while doing business
in another city,

53
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,279
running away from his debts.

54
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,519
To avoid dragging us down,

55
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,758
he spread lies everywhere.

56
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,919
As a result,

57
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,560
the intermediary got
the message wrong.

58
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,610
Later on,

59
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,000
he came home and explained it to me,

60
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,610
but I didn't give him a chance.

61
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,639
Do you have a photo of him?

62
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,679
(Building One)

63
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,319
What's his name?

64
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,399
Qin Zhi Wei.

65
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,839
Who's Sun Xu then?

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,198
What?

67
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,199
Sun Xu?

68
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,920
Yes, Sun Xu.

69
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,920
You took a photo
with him by Taihu Lake...

70
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,040
on June 26, 1993.

71
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,078
Sun Xu is in Hong Kong now.

72
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,279
He's a lawyer.

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,758
Before your dad and I got married,

74
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,920
your grandpa introduced someone
to me...

75
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
for a blind date.

76
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,519
We spent some time together
as friends,

77
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,360
but it didn't work out.

78
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,519
Later, I heard he went to Hong Kong.

79
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,600
Why are you asking about him?

80
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,198
When you took
the college entrance exam back then,

81
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,000
you insisted on majoring in law.

82
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,879
Was it because of him?

83
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,800
Since I was 16,

84
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,040
I've set a goal for myself.

85
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,719
I'm going to work hard
to get close to him.

86
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,000
I want to stand
in front of him confidently...

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,680
And with my head...

88
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,879
held high...

89
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,920
However, I didn't expect
that the way to get close to him...

90
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,079
to be so long.

91
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,319
Ever since I found out
he's in Hong Kong,

92
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,600
everything I've done
is to get close to him.

93
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,959
Was it for revenge?

94
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,000
If there's a possibility,

95
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,839
I'm still fighting for a chance
to go to Hong Kong.

96
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,120
Remember.

97
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,878
You're doing this for yourself...

98
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,039
to fight for better opportunities...

99
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,079
for progress.

100
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,040
I think I've been very childish...

101
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,959
for the past 10 years.

102
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,879
Hello, Mr. Gao.

103
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,000
Ms. Han.

104
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,159
You promised me yesterday...

105
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,918
that you would show me
around Suzhou.

106
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,240
Look at the time.

107
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,720
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,240
I went back to Jiangzhou last night.

109
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,480
What happened?

110
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
It's nothing.

111
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,360
Are you home now? I'll come over.

112
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,360
It's okay. I'm...

113
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,799
I'm a bit tired.

114
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,879
I want to be alone.

115
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,159
I'm sorry, Mr. Gao.

116
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,798
You didn't come on Member's Day.

117
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,089
It's such a shame.

118
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,480
We had so much fun there.

119
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,759
If you see anything you want,

120
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,879
just tell me.

121
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,600
I'm the boss now.

122
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,678
You're amazing, Ms. He.

123
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,960
You'll support me from now on.

124
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,559
It's nothing.

125
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,559
There are three shareholders.

126
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,638
They're all really nice.

127
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,639
I'll introduce them to you later.

128
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,759
Okay.

129
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,120
What are you two doing?

130
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,210
Chu Yi is gone.

131
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Who's gone?

132
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:57,879
Chu Yi.

133
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,330
He wants to go back to get married.

134
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,450
I'm leaving Jiangzhou.

135
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,759
Chu Yi.

136
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,639
Here.

137
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,359
I made this myself.

138
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,450
It's a global limited edition.

139
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,559
It's the only one.

140
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,480
Congratulations on your wedding.

141
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
This is the best wedding gift
I've ever received.

142
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,120
Didn't you tell me...

143
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,559
that your biggest dream
is to marry Yi Yi?

144
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,639
Congratulations.
Your dream came true.

145
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,159
We're buddies...

146
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,799
for...

147
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,919
nine years, right?

148
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,960
Even though our dream empire
hasn't come true yet,

149
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,639
I don't regret it at all.

150
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,758
I feel that for the past nine years,

151
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,200
I've been living...

152
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,320
in hope...

153
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,720
and I feel very blessed.

154
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,960
Liu Fu.

155
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,879
Zi Lu.

156
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,639
Hope...

157
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,639
is the most precious thing.

158
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,679
Not everyone can afford it.

159
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,360
Buddy.

160
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,480
I can't be with you two anymore.

161
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,639
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,320
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,039
There's nothing to be sorry about.

164
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,519
We got together back then...

165
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,360
because we liked each other.

166
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,840
Right?

167
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,799
You're now a grown man
preparing to get married.

168
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,480
You need to take on
the responsibilities of a family.

169
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,240
That's how you deserve
her affection.

170
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,480
Understand?

171
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,799
I'll wait for you here.

172
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,320
Okay?

173
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,559
I'll get going.

174
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,480
Chu Yi.

175
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,480
Chu Yi.

176
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,679
Let me help you.

177
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,200
Wang Zi Lu may look like a gangster,

178
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,159
but he's really nice.

179
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,879
He's more reliable
compared to all your exes.

180
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,799
(Ms. Hu, can I take
an emergency annual leave?)

181
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,799
Hello?

182
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,639
Han Su.

183
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,240
I'm downstairs right now.

184
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,480
Are you all right?

185
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,600
I'm worried about you.

186
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,720
If I don't see you today,

187
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,159
I'll wait for you
at the office tomorrow.

188
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,159
Okay?

189
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,399
Let's meet.

190
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,399
Here's to you.

191
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,360
I'm really sorry
about what happened in Suzhou.

192
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,159
It's really okay.

193
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,399
As long as I know you're fine,

194
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,159
I feel better.

195
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,519
Let's eat.

196
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,440
Gao Peng.

197
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,159
Let's...

198
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,480
just be friends?

199
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,080
May I ask why?

200
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,000
It's my problem.

201
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,518
What you really mean to say is,

202
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,600
"I'm sorry,"

203
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,000
"but I really don't like you."

204
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,120
Gao Peng, it's not some tactic.

205
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,279
I mean it.

206
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,919
I even regret not telling you...

207
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,759
when you first
came back to Jiangzhou.

208
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,240
I'm a selfish person.

209
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,759
You're my first major client
in life...

210
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,919
and I don't want to lose you.

211
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,200
It's really my problem.

212
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,600
- No, don't.
- I really...

213
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,200
Han Su.

214
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,959
Honestly, I wish I could keep using
the title of a client...

215
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,119
and let you continue
to take advantage of that.

216
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
However,

217
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,479
don't find any more excuses
to comfort me.

218
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,519
It's too awkward.

219
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,159
After all, all this time,

220
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,079
I've been the one rejecting people.

221
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,759
No one has ever rejected me.

222
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,319
It seems like you have
a lot of girls pursuing you.

223
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,680
Of course.

224
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,359
After all, in many people's eyes,

225
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,759
my biggest strength
is being wealthy.

226
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,319
I'm not good enough.

227
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,759
Apart from being wealthy,

228
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,890
I can't find a reason
for you to like me.

229
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,240
That's why it's not your problem.

230
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,559
Don't say that.

231
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,890
Actually, I'm already lucky
to have met you.

232
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
If you make me say that again,

233
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,359
it would be too cheesy.

234
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,680
Even though you rejected me,

235
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,839
can I still...

236
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,240
be your best client,

237
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,960
Ms. Han?

238
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,599
Thank you, Gao Peng.

239
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,359
Have some food.

240
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,410
I know my 30,000 yuan isn't enough.

241
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,599
You're even prepared to sell...

242
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,078
the limited-edition figurines...

243
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,359
you've been collecting
for over 10 years.

244
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,409
Why did Liu Fu have to be
such a blabbermouth?

245
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,650
He also said...

246
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,680
those things are your treasures...

247
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,480
that no one else
is allowed to touch.

248
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,319
However, for a more important dream,

249
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,599
some sacrifices must be made.

250
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,480
Plus, the process of letting go
isn't as hard as you might think.

251
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,359
I'm going to mortgage my house...

252
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,440
to invest more capital.

253
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,409
No.

254
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,680
But you don't have any money left.

255
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,759
How about this?

256
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,359
I'll rent out my house.

257
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,039
The location and layout
of my house are the best.

258
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,758
Renting it for 6,000 yuan
a month is no problem.

259
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,480
With a deposit
and three months' rent paid upfront,

260
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,599
I'll have 24,000 yuan in cash flow.

261
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,890
What do you think?

262
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,279
Where will you stay?

263
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,359
At my parents' place.

264
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,359
That way,
I can save on living expenses.

265
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,758
I'm so smart.

266
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,759
I won't ask you for another cent.

267
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,680
What about your treasures?

268
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,799
That's my business.

269
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:57,960
But I feel bad for you.

270
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,920
I took all my annual leave at once.

271
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,720
All of them?

272
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,960
Ever since I was little,

273
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,399
I've always been
the kind of person...

274
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,279
who lives strictly
according to my schedule.

275
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,160
However, from now on,

276
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,079
things will be different.

277
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,639
I'm going to waste time...

278
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,240
and do nothing.

279
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,480
Well,

280
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,079
this is called
retaliatory self-sabotage.

281
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,400
Do you have to go to such extremes?

282
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,039
I'm tired.

283
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,400
I'm so tired.

284
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,160
It feels like I used to never know
what it meant to be tired.

285
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,279
The past couple of days,

286
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,799
this so-called father of mine...

287
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,319
is just like the necklace
in Maupassant's story.

288
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
It's all fake.

289
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,799
You know what?

290
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,279
Lately, I've suddenly realized...

291
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,920
that everything I once craved,

292
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,519
like the best award,

293
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,799
now seem...

294
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,839
so meaningless...

295
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,880
and worthless.

296
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,639
But you know what?

297
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,239
I've been working hard
since I was 16...

298
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,359
all the way to 28,

299
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,240
without ever stopping.

300
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,519
All that precious time...

301
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,440
has been wasted on...

302
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,759
a misunderstanding.

303
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,759
It's the same for us.

304
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,319
Our dreams don't exist anymore.

305
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,480
From now on,

306
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,599
I'm going to live a new life.

307
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,839
What kind of life?

308
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,119
I don't know,

309
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,240
but I want to try it.

310
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,680
Then I want to try it too.

311
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,240
Okay, let's try it together.

312
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,999
Let's try it.

313
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,079
Let's do it.

314
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,200
- Okay.
- Okay.

315
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,799
It's released!

316
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,160
Right on time.

317
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,039
We have views.

318
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,799
There's a bullet comment.

319
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,400
Number of people online is 44.

320
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,640
There are 70 bullet comments.

321
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,558
Wang Zi Lu, come and take a look.

322
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,160
Don't make a fuss, okay?

323
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,719
He's just nervous.

324
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,880
Right?

325
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,519
He's so nervous
that he doesn't dare to look.

326
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,679
Once the artwork is out there,

327
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,599
it's like a child growing up
and leaving home.

328
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,640
I can't worry about it
too much anymore.

329
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,799
When you released
this kind of video in the past,

330
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,680
what was the highest view count?

331
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,679
When we first launched Cement Genie,

332
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,720
it was just over 5,000 views.

333
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,440
Is anyone here?

334
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
Coming.

335
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:52,920
You watch first.

336
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,119
It's so cute.

337
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,640
I can't stay composed.

338
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,999
Someone is praising us.

339
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,359
Wang Zi Lu.

340
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,160
This guy...

341
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,000
usually...

342
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,440
has a sharp tongue.

343
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,240
At first glance,

344
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,359
he looks polished and showy.

345
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,279
However, upon closer look,

346
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,720
he's quite composed and appealing.

347
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,079
He Zhi Nan.

348
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,680
Are you being lovesick again?

349
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,240
You agreed to focus on your career.

350
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,039
You're hopelessly in love.

351
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,079
Yes.

352
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,400
Focus on my career.

353
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,680
What's wrong?

354
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,279
I...

355
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,559
We have over 10,000 views.

356
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,519
I'm going to buy
some alcohol to celebrate.

357
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,839
We have alcohol.

358
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,359
What are you doing?

359
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,119
The atmosphere tonight...

360
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,119
is a bit dangerous.

361
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
How useless.

362
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm working on my career...

363
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,960
and dating at the same time.

364
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,118
I have good news.

365
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,440
- Go ahead.
- Cutie...

366
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,000
is on the recommendation page.

367
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,518
- Really?
- Yes.

368
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,199
There are over 40 orders
in the online store now...

369
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,680
and many people
have left their comments.

370
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,279
That's great.

371
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,359
Let's celebrate...

372
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,199
the successful launch
of our Cutie's promo video.

373
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,758
And of course,

374
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,278
a big thank you to Zhi Nan...

375
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,358
for her financial support this time.

376
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,359
Here.

377
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,679
Thank you, God of Wealth,

378
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,920
He Zhi Nan.

379
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,200
Cheers.

380
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,400
Wang Zi Lu.

381
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,759
It's nothing.

382
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,920
I just wanted to call you.

383
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,640
Do you think Cutie
will become famous?

384
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,639
Maybe tomorrow morning,

385
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,880
our store will be packed.

386
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,959
If Cutie is popular,

387
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,799
Toys Universe will be popular too.

388
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:20,200
We have to hurry
and launch new stories...

389
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,440
and new characters.

390
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,960
We might even collaborate
with some streetwear brands...

391
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
and film companies
might buy our characters.

392
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,439
You're acting just like me...

393
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,439
on the night
of my first product launch...

394
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
nine years ago.

395
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,039
The water truck is here. Hurry.

396
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,920
- Come up.
- It's spraying over.

397
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,680
(For rent)

398
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,159
However,

399
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,720
it's the same dream for nine years,

400
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,079
repeating again and again.

401
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,598
It's still the same. You know?

402
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,879
Just when I get my hopes up,

403
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,000
you pour cold water on me.

404
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,078
Hope is beautiful,

405
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,318
but it's also dangerous.

406
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,440
Do you know?

407
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,599
How lame.

408
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,039
It's nothing to be surprised about.

409
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:33,079
Just like my phone and keys,

410
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,559
I have them with me every day.

411
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,359
Does that mean...

412
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,079
you carry it with you all the time?

413
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,000
Yes.

414
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,599
I'm a single man after all.

415
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,640
Wang Zi Lu.

416
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:54,839
So...

417
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,079
who were you planning to meet?

418
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,359
Is that any of your business?

419
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,079
Aren't you being too nosy?

420
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,799
Do you love her?

421
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,119
Didn't you say...

422
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:15,679
you wouldn't touch
someone you don't like?

423
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,119
So the person
you're going to meet...

424
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,599
must be someone you love, right?

425
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:28,079
Well, it's just something natural...

426
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,360
between men and women, isn't it?

427
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,239
Don't make such a big deal
out of everything.

428
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,809
Why do you girls always obsess
over the little, pointless stuff?

429
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,960
You're so mean.

430
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,960
Six o'clock in the evening.

431
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:28,000
It was when you were
at the convenience store...

432
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,880
that he had wicked thoughts.

433
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:33,920
I thought he was different
from other men,

434
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,079
but all men are the same.

435
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,440
Women are the same too.

436
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,809
We're all the same.

437
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,079
Pure heart?

438
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,639
Mature man?

439
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,809
He's nothing but a jerk.

440
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,599
I must have been blind.

441
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,519
Will you really not regret it...

442
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,679
if you lose her?

443
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,920
I will.

444
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,559
Then why did you...

445
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,329
What if I fail tomorrow?

446
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,559
She likes you, not your success.

447
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,880
She doesn't even mind
that you're poor.

448
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,199
But I do.

449
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,159
What if I stay poor forever?

450
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,769
What if my dreams never come true?

451
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,439
Someone like me...

452
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,599
who's broke...

453
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,960
and in debt...

454
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,519
I'm such a loser.

455
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,719
Even if I regret it,

456
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,919
what's the use?

457
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,599
Then don't do
something you'll regret.

458
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,599
Just hang in there.

459
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,519
There's always darkness
before the dawn.

460
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,769
I used to believe...

461
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,519
that when I turned 30,

462
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,639
success would be mine.

463
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,519
But now,

464
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,960
I've done my best.

465
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,719
What about my dream?

466
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,809
It's like the stars in the sky,

467
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,769
drifting away from me.

468
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,920
You're not even 30 yet.

469
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,000
There are still a few months left.

470
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,599
Liu Fu.

471
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,289
It's time for you to wake up.

472
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,000
It's time for us to wake up.

473
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,809
Dreams and reality
are two different things.

474
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,329
I like living in my dream.

475
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,960
I find this process very enjoyable.

476
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,440
The way you put that...

477
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,809
sounds a bit annoying.

478
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:41,078
If I tell He Zhi Nan...

479
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,840
that I can't keep going
and want to give up,

480
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,400
she'll be very disappointed.

481
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:47,039
Very, very disappointed.

482
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,920
I'm tired.

483
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,559
So tired that I don't want to bear
another person's disappointment.

484
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,239
Coming.

485
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,239
The sad trio.

486
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,239
It's exactly what I need.

487
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,199
You're not happy either, are you?

488
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:01,599
That's good. Let's eat.

489
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:38,769
Why are you unhappy?

490
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Wait.

491
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,119
Don't tell me...

492
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,519
you want to make up with me.

493
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:57,809
(An Unattainable Lover)

494
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,079
I don't know when it started,

495
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:29,000
but she has intruded into my heart.

496
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
However,

497
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,159
she has never noticed me.

498
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,239
It's as if...

499
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,159
there's an invisible wall
between us.

500
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,519
I want to break through it,

501
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,679
but I'm afraid I'll scare her.

502
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,199
Every time...

503
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,329
I feel discouraged,

504
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,198
even her slightest hint...

505
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,719
can send me into a frenzy of joy.

506
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,519
She can hear me too, right?

507
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,880
Can she also see me...

508
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,768
and maybe...

509
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,880
like me a little?

510
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:51,719
It turns out...

511
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,769
she has never truly noticed me.
