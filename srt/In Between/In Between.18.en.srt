1
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 18)

3
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,680
(I'm one month old)

4
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,680
I'm one month-old.

5
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,119
We'll be waiting for you
at Jiangzhou Garden Hotel.

6
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,199
See you there.

7
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,719
If he still loves me,

8
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,599
he'll marry me, right?

9
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,879
Are you waiting for him
to propose to you?

10
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,959
I was wondering...

11
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,199
what I should do...

12
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,039
if he doesn't ask.

13
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,479
Isn't marrying him...

14
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,759
a natural progression?

15
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,520
But when will that...

16
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,840
actually happen?

17
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,199
You won't stoop
to asking him, will you?

18
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm home.

19
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,919
Didn't you have a meeting?

20
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,439
Why are you drinking again?

21
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,879
This forced socializing
is driving me crazy.

22
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,079
I have to act like
I really enjoy talking to them.

23
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,520
I barely took
a few bites of my meal.

24
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,199
What do you want to eat?

25
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,280
Anything will do.

26
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,080
I'll cook for you.

27
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,719
Han Su has been asking me...

28
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,639
about you for the past two days.

29
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,400
She wants to know how you're doing.

30
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,119
Weren't you two inseparable
just a couple of days ago?

31
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,439
What's going on now?

32
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,050
Nothing.

33
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,480
Just some girl stuff.

34
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,730
It's no big deal.

35
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,839
- Is it good?
- It's good.

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,170
Li Di and Xu Ying are having...

37
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,758
a party for their baby's
one-month celebration.

38
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,958
Did you get the invitation?

39
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,959
Yes.

40
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,279
I told them we couldn't make it...

41
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,240
and sent them a huge red packet.

42
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,518
I don't have to give one then.

43
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,959
Of course. I gave them a huge one.

44
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,800
Among our high school classmates,

45
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,000
apart from those
who got married and broke up,

46
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,240
we're the only couple left.

47
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,639
You know what?

48
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,169
Your noodles taste good.
You've improved.

49
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,519
Really?

50
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,079
When will you marry me?

51
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,838
I'm just kidding.

52
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,240
Look at how scared you are.

53
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,079
I don't want to get married yet.

54
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,600
What's so good about marriage?

55
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,600
We're both too young.

56
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,879
Didn't you see Xu Ying?

57
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,239
It has only been a few months
and she looks so aged.

58
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,318
That's right.

59
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,479
We're still young.

60
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,279
Did you see the photo
on the invitation?

61
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,399
They both look so old.

62
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,040
I'll get you some water.

63
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,120
(One moment, one universe)

64
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I'll drink some more and go home.

65
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,360
Stop drinking.

66
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
We agreed...

67
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,399
to get wasted like a corpse.

68
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,519
Do you want to be wasted
and get picked up?

69
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,679
Who would care?

70
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,720
Gao Peng?

71
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,120
He doesn't love me.

72
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Hey, pretty lady.

73
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,639
Why did you drink so much?

74
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,759
I don't think you can go home.

75
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,519
Taxi.

76
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,600
Lan Kwai Fong, 1902.

77
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,800
Come on. Get in.

78
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,800
Give me your bag.

79
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,839
Be good.

80
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,600
Come on.

81
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,960
Let's get in. Be careful.

82
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,639
- Be careful.
- Don't touch me.

83
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,039
Let's go.

84
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
Zhi Nan.

85
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,759
Zhi Nan, get up.
Don't lie on the street.

86
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,919
Call Gao Peng...

87
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,240
and ask him to take you home.

88
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,450
He won't come.

89
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,600
He doesn't love me anymore.

90
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,480
Because I'm not pretty...

91
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,450
or smart.

92
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,159
Zhi Nan.

93
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,720
Zhi Nan.

94
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,450
Zhi Nan.

95
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,840
Let me take you home.

96
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,840
Come on.

97
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,439
Do you have a headache?

98
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,600
Do you want some painkillers?

99
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,679
Do you want some honey water?

100
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,320
Zhi Nan.

101
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,200
Actually,
my breakup with Qu Yi Peng...

102
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,480
has nothing to do with you.

103
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,720
Taking it out on you...

104
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,200
and hiding things from you...

105
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,519
were my faults.

106
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,480
I sincerely apologize.

107
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,320
If I got a phone call...

108
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,440
dripping with sarcasm
and provocation like that,

109
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,320
I'd be totally pissed too.

110
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,080
If that person crossed my path,

111
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,320
I wouldn't spare her either.

112
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,480
So I guess we're even now.

113
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,240
Did I say or do anything last night?

114
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,919
Last night,

115
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,799
you first cried...

116
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,039
and then laughed.

117
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,079
One moment you told me...

118
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,440
you were going
to break up with Gao Peng.

119
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,759
The next you said...

120
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,879
you brought up marriage with him.

121
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,919
Basically,

122
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,480
you said everything.

123
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,960
Do you know
how dangerous it was yesterday?

124
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,759
If I hadn't happened
to see you at Lan Kwai Fong...

125
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,200
after drinking with my colleague,

126
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,840
you wouldn't even know
who picked you up.

127
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,960
I called Gao Peng this morning.

128
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,159
I told him that
you were with me last night...

129
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,919
and I was the one
who asked you to drink with me.

130
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,639
He asked if he should
come pick you up.

131
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,080
I don't want to see him.

132
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,720
Can you really bear
to break up with him?

133
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
I don't know.

134
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
I'm so confused.

135
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,759
Anyway,

136
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,599
if you want to stay at my place,

137
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,879
you can stay as long as you want.

138
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,600
I'll provide food and accommodation.

139
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,279
You can take your time to think...

140
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,798
about the breakup.

141
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,240
Don't be too impulsive.

142
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,278
Do you smell it?

143
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,840
I made porridge. It smells so good.

144
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,600
Have some.

145
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,480
Yes, it does smell good.

146
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,759
Han Han, come with me.

147
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,559
Han Han.

148
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,120
Think carefully.

149
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,120
Did you do something
to offend Mr. Li?

150
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,120
No.

151
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,320
Logically speaking,
I shouldn't be telling you this.

152
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,840
However, you've worked
under me for three years...

153
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,399
and I see you as a sister.

154
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,719
Mr. Li just talked to me...

155
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,080
and has been oddly critical of you.

156
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,320
I've covered for you
in business matters,

157
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,158
but I can't shake the feeling...

158
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,080
that there's
something else going on.

159
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,879
I'll be honest with you.

160
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,320
Mr. Li wants to fire you.

161
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,759
Didn't I promise to let you
take a few days off before?

162
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,479
You absolutely can't take
a leave during this time.

163
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,120
You need to keep a low profile.

164
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,360
I have to figure out
where the root of this problem lies.

165
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,320
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

166
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,159
You're so good to me.

167
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,678
Don't say that. It's useless.

168
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,960
Be cautious.

169
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,599
Ms. Xin.

170
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,559
I think I should quit.

171
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,838
Why?

172
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,000
I know...

173
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,759
this day will come.

174
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,759
What do you mean?

175
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,920
My ex-boyfriend...

176
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,599
is Zhou Bin.

177
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,000
Call me when you're all settled.

178
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,999
Let me treat you to a meal.

179
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
(Hong Kong)

180
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:05,480
(Liying Residence)

181
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,240
Okay, here. Take care.

182
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,319
Thank you.

183
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,319
Nan Nan!

184
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,839
Sun Han Han!

185
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,410
I missed you so much.

186
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,559
- How are you?
- I'm not good.

187
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,000
What about you?

188
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,319
I'm not good either.

189
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,119
Let's make a deal then.

190
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,599
The most important thing
is to be happy.

191
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,410
Of course.

192
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,079
Let's go.

193
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,599
Let's take a photo.

194
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,920
One, two, three.

195
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,759
It's so pretty.

196
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,960
- I'll use my phone.
- Okay.

197
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,798
Yes.

198
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,000
One, two, three.

199
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,839
Let's do this side too.

200
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,359
You're done.

201
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,680
I'm making sparkling wine.

202
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,240
Let's have...

203
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
a refreshing girl's night in summer.

204
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,650
You even set a theme.

205
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,519
I'll help you.

206
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,519
Is Gao Peng not coming back?

207
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,440
He usually comes home
in the middle of the night.

208
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,480
We don't see each other...

209
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,359
for more than half an hour.

210
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,319
When he heard you were coming,

211
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,079
he took the initiative
and moved to the office.

212
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,410
Why don't I stay at a hotel?

213
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,279
What?

214
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,680
You didn't see
how he looked when he left home.

215
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,720
No exaggeration.

216
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,960
It was like
he had been granted a reprieve.

217
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,919
I told him that
once you're done having fun,

218
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,318
I'll go back to Jiangzhou with you.

219
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,160
He happily booked the ticket for me,

220
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,799
but he didn't ask...

221
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,598
when I'd be back.

222
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,799
You can return whenever you want.

223
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,440
It's not like a breakup.

224
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,680
Don't be so discouraged.

225
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,519
I know Gao Peng better than anyone.

226
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,720
He's kind and softhearted.

227
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,519
He wouldn't want to be blamed
for hurting anyone.

228
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,519
Instead, he'll lead me...

229
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,079
to say that word
through his actions.

230
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,439
Then live with it.

231
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Don't say anything.

232
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,160
We're like...

233
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,920
a car running on empty.

234
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,759
We don't even feel like
looking for a gas station.

235
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,319
What's the point
of a relationship...

236
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,720
fueled by memories and habits?

237
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,038
Sometimes, I wonder too.

238
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,079
Am I really that bad?

239
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,039
I have to live so miserably.

240
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,480
Are you stupid?

241
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,038
How a man treats you...

242
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,680
doesn't reflect your worth.

243
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,640
Don't let a man
be the one to rate you.

244
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,879
Who can rate me then?

245
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,240
You, of course.

246
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,960
Only we can.

247
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,518
Don't doubt yourself
for the sake of an unworthy man.

248
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:24,559
You're right.

249
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
Here.

250
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,640
Cheers to this chicken soup.

251
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,920
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

252
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,078
Relax.

253
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,519
The anaesthesia
will take effect soon.

254
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,440
Will we know...

255
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,000
the viability of the eggs today?

256
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,879
You'll probably have
to wait a few days...

257
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,960
for the results from the embryo lab.

258
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,480
But don't worry.

259
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,039
This kind of multiple egg retrieval
is quite common here.

260
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,359
Perhaps the only love that lasts...

261
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,799
is the one
that has been through everything.

262
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,720
After going through failure...

263
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,999
and betrayal,

264
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,160
they eventually...

265
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,279
accept a sad truth.

266
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,759
All they want is companionship.

267
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,119
The simplest of needs.

268
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,558
Why didn't you stay in the hospital
for a few more days?

269
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,000
Why did you have to rush back?

270
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,720
I hate the smell
of disinfectant in the hospital.

271
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,079
It's for observation anyway.

272
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,079
I feel more comfortable
staying at home.

273
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,879
Get me a blanket.

274
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,279
I want to rest in the living room.

275
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,359
Sure.

276
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,720
It's too stuffy in the bedroom.

277
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,319
Here, give me your clothes.

278
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,880
Do you think...

279
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,960
I look old now?

280
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,319
No.

281
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,599
Here.

282
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,439
You're just too tired.

283
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
That's why you think that way.

284
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,799
Once you get better,

285
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,480
you won't think that way anymore.

286
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,160
If the number of viable follicles...

287
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,279
is still too low,

288
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,960
I'll have to go through it
all over again.

289
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,279
Just the thought of it scares me.

290
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Here.

291
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,839
That doesn't sound like
something you would say.

292
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,720
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

293
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,119
Why would I be?

294
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,119
It breaks my heart...

295
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,200
seeing you go through...

296
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,079
so much.

297
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,400
We will succeed.

298
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,720
There's nothing I can't handle.

299
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,680
Trust me.

300
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,359
I won't let you down.

301
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,759
I'm sure...

302
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,319
there's nothing...

303
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:18,279
you can't handle in this world.

304
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,599
It's so nice to live here.

305
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,558
We can bask in the sun downstairs.

306
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,880
Next time we come,

307
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,559
we'll be tourists,

308
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,839
spending the whole day
following GPS...

309
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,559
from Victoria Peak
to Eight Great Immortals.

310
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,759
Do you regret it?

311
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,680
Have Gao Peng
refund the ticket then.

312
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,640
Let's talk about something else.

313
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,440
(Andy, whom you follow,
just posted a new moment.)

314
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,319
That guy of yours?

315
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,798
He knows I love posting
on this platform,

316
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,079
so he followed me silently.

317
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,879
Now that I've noticed him,

318
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,680
he posts various moments...

319
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,359
in the square
every day for me to see...

320
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,200
as if he wants to check in with me.

321
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,799
It's obvious that
our relationship isn't that close.

322
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
It's quite interesting.

323
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,000
What's interesting about him...

324
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,759
is that he's very straightforward.

325
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,759
He mentioned that
he's used to competition.

326
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,959
A good girl with a good job.

327
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,680
When he comes across
such a high-quality resource,

328
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,960
he has to hold onto her tightly.

329
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,839
That's why he's so attentive to me.

330
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,839
What about you and Zhou Bin?

331
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,880
Maybe Zhou Bin hurt me too deeply.

332
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,079
Looking back now,

333
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,839
I realized that our relationship
was quite twisted.

334
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,640
The charm that Andy has
really heals me.

335
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,640
Do you really want to be with Andy?

336
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,920
Well,

337
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,759
I'll give him a chance to show more.

338
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:04,838
Then let me ask you.

339
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,839
Do you have an appointment
with him this afternoon?

340
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,480
He has to work during the day,

341
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,598
so let's see about tonight.

342
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,599
That's good.

343
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,239
You can go to happy hour with me.

344
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,359
I'll introduce you to a pretty lady.
Her name is Han Su.

345
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,758
Sure. You always talk about Han Su.

346
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,039
I'll join you today.

347
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,119
But there's something
I just found out now.

348
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,920
Han Su...

349
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,160
is Qu Yi Peng's ex-girlfriend.

350
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,759
Really?

351
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,119
Over there.

352
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:41,039
Not bad. She's really pretty.

353
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,319
I'm not bluffing, right?

354
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

355
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,400
Let me introduce you.

356
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,480
Here we have
the beautiful Sun Han Han.

357
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,200
And this is
the stunning lawyer, Han Su.

358
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

359
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,039
I already ordered
the happy hour items earlier.

360
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,640
You guys can check
if you want to add anything more.

361
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,920
This will do.

362
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

363
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,359
He Zhi Nan.

364
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,000
Truth or dare?

365
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,119
Truth is the biggest dare.

366
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,319
I choose truth.

367
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,400
Let me ask you then.

368
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,799
Between Qu Yi Peng and Gao Peng,

369
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,118
if you set aside money
and just consider character,

370
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,159
who do you think is more attractive?

371
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,519
I'll strangle you to death.

372
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,799
You can't handle it?

373
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
Tell us.

374
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,960
Qu Yi Peng may look handsome,

375
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,798
but when you get to know him,

376
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,000
you'll realize
that he's actually a bit...

377
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,200
Superficial.

378
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,079
That's the word.

379
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,279
Superficial.

380
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,999
Come on.

381
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,278
Get lost, jerk.

382
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,639
I want in too.

383
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,519
- Get lost, jerk!
- Get lost, jerk!

384
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,400
Three fives.

385
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,759
Han Su.

386
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:14,119
Truth or dare?

387
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,679
Dare.

388
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,920
I was waiting for you to say that.

389
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,559
There's a handsome guy...

390
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,679
in a blue and white striped shirt...

391
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
at the bar.

392
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,318
Go and add him on WeChat.

393
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,319
Luo Ma.

394
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,799
There's a charming lady
at the back looking at you.

395
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,960
I'm honestly not into younger guys,

396
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,558
but adding him on WeChat is okay.

397
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,838
At worst,
I'll just say Sun Han Han likes him.

398
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,079
That won't do.

399
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,359
What I mean is for you
to go over and find a way...

400
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,440
to get him to add you on WeChat.

401
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,440
Go on.

402
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,919
He's quite handsome.

403
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,960
Okay.

404
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,000
Guess how long it will take.

405
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,518
Five minutes.

406
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,680
Three minutes.

407
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,319
One minute after applying lipstick.

408
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,440
- Flaunt your charm.
- Ask him to add you on WeChat.

409
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,278
Ten seconds.

410
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,598
I can't take it anymore.

411
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,440
Luo Ma, buy her a drink.

412
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,960
No.

413
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,039
She's coming.

414
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,960
- Hi.
- Hi.

415
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,119
Liqueur special, please.

416
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,200
Thank you.

417
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,759
She only brought back a drink.

418
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,358
Why did she come back?

419
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,880
He didn't want to add you?

420
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,719
You failed?

421
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,920
Let's drink as punishment.

422
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,319
He's coming.

423
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,519
He's coming over.

424
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Hi.

425
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,240
Hi.

426
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,599
Hello, I'm Luo Ma.

427
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
Hello.

428
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,799
Can we...

429
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,279
add each other on WeChat?

430
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,960
Sure.

431
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,960
Sorry.

432
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,880
Thank you.

433
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,440
That's awesome.

434
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,839
How did you do that?

435
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,078
Let's toast. Cheers.

436
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,159
That's so cool.

437
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,960
I caught you.

438
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,920
Truth or dare?

439
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,599
Truth.

440
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,440
May I ask...

441
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,399
who is more attractive,

442
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,840
Zhou Bin or Andy?

443
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,440
Why?

444
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,159
That's two questions.

445
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:35,239
Answer the first one.

446
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:38,000
Zhou Bin...

447
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:40,360
Zhou Bin is a jerk.

448
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,639
Honestly, he's charming enough.

449
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,159
Well, that's what makes him a jerk.

450
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Well, how is Zhou Bin a jerk?

451
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,000
He's the scum of the earth.

452
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,440
He's married,

453
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,329
yet he had a fake divorce
and fooled me.

454
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,288
Then he and his ex-wife
got back together,

455
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:03,199
but he's still pestering me.

456
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,919
I shouldn't have asked that.

457
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,289
It's good that you know.

458
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,639
One more round. I want revenge.

459
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,769
Come on.

460
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,679
Well...

461
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,400
I just saw that my colleagues
sent me a message.

462
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,719
They want me
to go back to the office.

463
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,880
You can't.

464
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,440
Are you trying
to escape from drinking?

465
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,079
I've already had
so many drinks with you all.

466
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,519
I really skipped work today
to come out.

467
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,119
All right then.

468
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:46,519
Should we take a photo?

469
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,679
Sure.

470
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,289
Thank you.

471
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,840
Here. I'll get you some soup.

472
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:04,000
The doctor mentioned that
since you just had surgery,

473
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,769
this soup is the best for you.

474
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,000
You have to drink more later.

475
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,039
I asked the housekeeper
to make it for you.

476
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,880
Here, try it.

477
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,880
You've been with me
these past few days.

478
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,480
Isn't the law firm busy lately?

479
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,599
The cases are piling up.

480
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,809
I have to go on
a business trip tonight.

481
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,119
Tonight?

482
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:34,119
Can't it wait until tomorrow?

483
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:36,039
I have an early meeting tomorrow,

484
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,440
so I have to be there tonight.

485
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,920
Are you done packing?

486
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,518
Let's eat first.

487
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:44,599
There's still time.

488
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,840
(Meet interesting souls on Soul)

489
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,638
Zeng Cheng.

490
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,440
Take a look. Is that her?

491
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,039
Here, eat more pork liver.

492
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:25,808
Where are you going
on a business trip?

493
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:27,039
Hong Kong.

494
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:29,639
Just for two days.

495
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:49,038
(All Roads Lead To: You left?)

496
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,518
(Conversation)

497
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,598
(All Roads Lead To)

498
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,329
(Delete contact)

499
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,440
Hey.

500
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:07,519
Hey.

501
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:09,519
Why did you delete me?

502
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,289
What?

503
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,769
Are you messing with me?

504
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:17,920
Yes. I'm messing with you.

505
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,920
No.

506
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,199
Wait. That's not what I meant.

507
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,719
Can you add me back?

508
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,039
Zeng Cheng.

509
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,360
I don't think Sun Han Han is lying.

510
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,439
No wonder Sun Han Han...

511
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,719
shredded those things...

512
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:52,159
and scattered them
all over his office.

513
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,769
I asked him about it,

514
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,679
but he didn't dare to admit it.

515
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,079
He really harassed her.

516
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,879
In any case,
you must stay calm about this.

517
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,078
Okay?

518
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,079
I'm calm.

519
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,920
I'm as calm as I can be.

520
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:10,519
Knowing this at this time...

521
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,880
is a good thing for me.

522
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,719
Zeng Cheng.

523
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:25,038
It's almost time.
I need to head to the airport.

524
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,519
Make sure to rest well
in the next couple of days.

525
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,769
Zeng Cheng.

526
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,039
What's wrong?

527
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,289
I'm watching a drama.

528
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
It's quite good.

529
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'm so into it.

530
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,599
What drama is it?

531
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,480
It's about three women
from different eras.

532
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,440
Each marriage has its own drama.

533
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,400
One of the women...

534
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,679
kills the husband
who betrayed her at last.

535
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,679
What kind of drama is this?

536
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,399
By the way, I'm going to Hong Kong.

537
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
Do you need anything?

538
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:09,880
No.

539
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:15,119
I'm a bit tired.

540
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,808
All right then.

541
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:18,840
Get some rest.

542
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,769
If you need anything,
give me a call.

543
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,959
Hello.

544
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,360
I'm in love with a rich CEO.

545
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,639
He said he likes virtuous women.

546
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,289
May I ask...

547
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,480
how can I be virtuous?

548
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,599
Rule number one.

549
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,960
Remember this.

550
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:14,719
He's always right.

551
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:17,329
Always put his needs first.

552
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,239
If he wants to move a mountain,

553
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,039
you move a mountain for him.

554
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,768
I'll remember that.

555
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:24,809
Rule number two.

556
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,959
If he needs you,

557
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,440
you must always be there.

00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:30,639
Keep your phone on 24 hours a day.

559
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:33,198
Reply to his WeChat messages
as soon as possible.

560
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,238
I'll remember that.

561
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:35,480
Rule number three.

562
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,239
Keep up your good image.

563
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:38,639
In front of him,

564
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:41,000
always be exquisite and beautiful.

565
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:43,639
Always show your best side.

566
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,079
Is there anything else?

567
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,400
Don't ask stupid questions.

568
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,238
Compliment more.

569
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,360
Work more.

570
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,519
Ask fewer questions.

571
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,119
What successful men hate the most...

572
00:41:56,809 --> 00:41:57,960
are stupid questions.

573
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,199
Thank you.

574
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:02,400
Wait for my good news.

575
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,289
I'll make sure
I marry into a rich family.

576
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:10,159
(Half a year later)

577
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:21,078
(Consultation office)

578
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,359
Miss.

579
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,919
Thank you so much.

580
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,519
I owe it all to your advice.

581
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:28,809
Did you really marry the CEO?

582
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:32,119
He's young and handsome.

583
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:34,519
No. He's my model boyfriend.

584
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,719
I did everything
you told me to do...

585
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,639
and realized that I can make...

586
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,360
a million dollars a year on my own.

587
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:43,480
There's no point
in marrying into a rich family.

588
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,329
Self-reliance is the way to go.
