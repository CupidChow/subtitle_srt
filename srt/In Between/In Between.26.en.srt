00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 26)

3
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,810
That sad trio...

4
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,639
from the old days...

5
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,158
was truly legendary.

6
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,159
It's spicy...

7
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,759
and good.

8
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,319
My unhappiness...

9
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,319
all evaporated with the sweat.

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,400
This is great.

11
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,240
Why are you unhappy?

12
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,240
You go first.

13
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,919
Well, I...

14
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,759
When I passed by this store yesterday,

15
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,560
it reminded me of the past.

16
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,680
I felt quite dazed.

17
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Wait.

18
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,918
Don't tell me...

19
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,319
you want to make up with me.

20
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,039
I'm just kidding.

21
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,080
I guess you had a fight with Han Su.

22
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,919
No.

23
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,280
But she rejected me.

24
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,080
I don't know what happened.

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,319
I just messed up.

26
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,240
If you knew what happened,

27
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,879
you wouldn't have messed up.

28
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,599
You know what?

29
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,400
To put it simply,

30
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,919
I'm just an ordinary guy.

31
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,800
The only extraordinary thing about me is my luck.

32
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,559
My parents suddenly got rich overnight...

33
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,360
and people's attitudes toward me changed.

34
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,879
Over time, I started to believe it.

35
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,240
Especially when...

36
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,000
all those good-looking girls...

37
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,360
who never noticed me began sticking close.

38
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,519
You were tempted.

39
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,879
Look, I...

40
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,679
I'm being honest with you.

41
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,759
Go on.

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,520
Back then, I thought to myself,

43
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,960
"So it's true."

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,439
"Money really can buy a woman's heart."

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,800
I indulged in it,

46
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,719
yet I felt contemptuous at the same time.

47
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
It was a bit of...

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,240
a mental conflict.

49
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,560
Han Su isn't that kind of person.

50
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,279
Even though she rejected you,

51
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,639
it's not your fault.

52
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,800
She has her own plans.

53
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,170
Don't you get it?

54
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,759
We broke up...

55
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,730
and you don't like me anymore.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,609
- Is it my fault? - Of course not.

57
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,120
- It's yours then. - You...

58
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
You...

59
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,120
After we broke up,

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,959
I felt so inferior.

61
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,639
I thought I was useless...

62
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,610
and worthless.

63
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,399
It took me a long time to understand this.

64
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,679
A healthy relationship is about two loving souls...

65
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
encouraging each other and growing together,

66
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,480
not about one person...

67
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,480
putting a price tag or score...

68
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,319
on the other.

69
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,160
If a person...

70
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,639
really had a score,

71
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,760
it should be one they give themselves.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,480
I'm impressed, He Zhi Nan.

73
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,039
What I admire most about you...

74
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,518
is how you always manage to recover so quickly,

75
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,279
like nothing happened.

76
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,079
Are you making fun of me?

77
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,879
So why are you unhappy?

78
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,920
Seeing you so unhappy makes me happy now.

79
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,120
Me too.

80
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,758
You're so mean.

81
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,839
Me too.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,040
Are you unhappy?

83
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,399
I'm leaving.

84
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,439
He Zhi Nan.

85
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,240
I forgot to tell you.

86
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,879
I'm planning to return to the Botanical Institute.

87
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,600
One moment.

88
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Han Su.

89
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,360
Can we talk for a moment?

90
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,160
About what?

91
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,759
Han Su.

92
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,480
Tell me honestly. Are you sick?

93
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,159
Or did something happen to you?

94
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,879
You can tell me. I can help you.

95
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,040
What are you talking about?

96
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,520
After returning to your hometown, you've completely changed.

97
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,720
How could you allow yourself to take a long break?

98
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,759
Tell me. What happened?

99
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,600
Han Su.

100
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,240
No matter what happens,

101
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,720
I'll always be by your side.

102
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,959
For a lifetime.

103
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,319
Wipe off your sweat.

104
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,479
You're still young.

105
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,600
Don't always talk about a lifetime.

106
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,560
Aren't all women looking for a man to be their ultimate love?

107
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,240
I'm sorry,

108
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,799
but I want to be the pioneer of love.

109
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,120
It'll be easier that way.

110
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,896
Does that mean you're ready to be in a relationship with me?

111
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,199
Right?

112
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,840
I want to give it a try.

113
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,759
The rice is ready. Do you want to eat together?

114
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,878
Yes.

115
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,279
Take me out after eating.

116
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,480
Okay.

117
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,360
Yes.

118
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,479
It's just a game.

119
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,696
You don't have to be so serious.

120
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,210
I've noticed the pattern.

121
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,450
If I go for the 20 or 30 when I come up,

122
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,159
I definitely won't be able to get the 40.

123
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,480
So after I come up,

124
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,399
I first go for the smaller dinosaur eggs.

125
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,039
That way,

126
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,360
I'll have a better chance.

127
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,840
- Well, we... - Yes.

128
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,450
Did you see that?

129
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,960
Slow down.

130
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,360
You're too slow.

131
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,759
Are you okay, Han Su?

132
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,210
Are you okay?

133
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,450
I'm fine.

134
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:37,559
It's just a sprain.

135
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,360
Here.

136
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,679
You don't have to spray it.

137
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,398
I just reviewed it.

138
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,449
When I stepped on the gas, my point of force was a bit off.

139
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,450
Also, my coordination with the steering wheel...

140
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:49,678
wasn't great.

141
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,719
Otherwise, I definitely could have turned...

142
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
that corner perfectly.

143
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,519
It's just a game.

144
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,759
You don't have to go all out.

145
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,879
Well, you seek victory in risk.

146
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,799
Your competitive spirit is truly ingrained in you.

147
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,399
Besides,

148
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,079
I've noticed that what excites you...

149
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,159
isn't the game itself,

150
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,039
but rather the sense of achievement and the pressure it brings, right?

151
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,639
I guess you're right.

152
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,679
Games are all just pretend...

153
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,399
and I don't think any game can satisfy you.

154
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,559
Just stick it on.

155
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,518
Here you go.

156
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,799
That's why...

157
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,200
conquering the real world...

158
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,200
is much more exciting than games.

159
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,000
One more time.

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
One more piece.

161
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,720
- One more round. - One more piece.

162
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,720
You should get some rest.

163
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,519
Nan Nan.

164
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,440
Can you come and keep me company?

165
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,000
The trial is tomorrow.

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,120
I'm a bit scared.

167
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,559
Come on.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,560
I don't know the first part. You do it.

169
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,038
It's like an imaginary time

170
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,440
It's nice.

171
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,919
It becomes infinite in your eyes

172
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,360
Youth is full of sleepless nights

173
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,000
It's for the sake of tomorrow

174
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,240
Hello, I'd like two avocado yogurt smoothies.

175
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,679
This is good. It's delicious.

176
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,919
Hello, I'd like your signature sashimi.

177
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,360
- The food here is delicious. - Hello, welcome.

178
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,159
Hello, I'd like a large one.

179
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,600
Okay, what flavour would you like?

180
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,799
I'm brave!

181
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,799
I'm brave!

182
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm strong!

183
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,320
I'm strong!

184
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,759
I'll go with you tomorrow.

185
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,519
It's okay!

186
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,919
I'm brave!

187
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,759
- We're brave! - We're brave!

188
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,518
The trial has started.

189
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,839
When it comes to the testimony phase,

190
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,080
the court will summon you.

191
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,759
Okay.

192
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,279
Have some water.

193
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,120
Thank you.

194
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,480
Your hand is a bit cold.

195
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,360
I'm a bit nervous.

196
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,278
The testimony phase is usually very fast.

197
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,360
Don't worry.

198
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,279
You must have handled a lot of divorce cases.

199
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,679
Following my mentor, I've handled quite a lot.

200
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,600
Is this the first time you've seen...

201
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,399
such a melodramatic one?

202
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,039
Witness, please come to the stand.

203
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,399
Let's go.

204
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,359
Here we are.

205
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,960
Give me your bag.

206
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,719
The following are the rights and obligations of witnesses...

207
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,960
when testifying in court.

208
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,079
Witnesses shall testify to the facts they know.

209
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,719
When giving testimony,

210
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,400
they should provide their statements impartially and objectively...

211
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,319
without using speculative or opinionated words.

212
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,199
They must truthfully answer the questions posed by the court...

213
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,480
and the parties involved.

214
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,479
They have the right to refuse to answer questions...

215
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,960
that are irrelevant to the case.

216
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:15,318
If they intentionally distort the facts...

217
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,650
or provide false evidence.

218
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,279
Plaintiff's witness, Sun Han Han,

219
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,319
the witness testimony...

220
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,626
and the corresponding documentary evidence you provided...

221
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,798
prove that you had an inappropriate relationship...

222
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,200
with the defendant.

223
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,960
Is that true?

224
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,359
Yes.

225
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,359
Defendant.

226
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,480
Do you need to question the plaintiff's witness?

227
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,480
Your Honor.

228
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,359
I have three questions for the plaintiff's witness.

229
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,960
Go ahead.

230
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Plaintiff's witness.

231
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,359
Do you know what an inappropriate relationship is?

232
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,680
Do you understand...

233
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,480
the legal definition of such a relationship?

234
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,495
I'm not clear on what an inappropriate relationship...

235
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,240
is under the law.

236
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,839
Legally,

237
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,720
an inappropriate relationship...

238
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,359
refers to sexual relations outside of marriage.

239
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,959
Witness.

240
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,759
Have you had sexual relations...

241
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,959
with the defendant during the period...

242
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,559
when the parties were still married?

243
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,440
Yes.

244
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,279
How many times?

245
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,410
What kind of strategy is this?

246
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,999
Apart from embarrassing Sun Han Han,

247
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,680
I don't see any strategy.

248
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,319
Can you stop it?

249
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,360
- Please answer the question. - Objection.

250
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,078
The defendant's question is irrelevant to this case.

251
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,598
Weren't you the one who cheated?

252
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,959
How dare you ask me that?

253
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,078
Are you going senile?

254
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,409
What's your next question?

255
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,799
Are you going to ask for more details?

256
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,959
If you really want to know,

257
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,359
I'll give you a serious answer.

258
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,799
But it seems like the answer may not be very favourable to you.

259
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,599
Zhou Bin.

260
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,480
I'm here to testify.

261
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,480
I'm not here to be judged as a slut.

262
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,920
Anyone has the right to call me a third party,

263
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,519
except for you.

264
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,890
You deceived me.

265
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,599
Defendant,

266
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,480
do you have a third question you'd like to ask?

267
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,170
- No, thank you. - Your Honor.

268
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,799
I'm not done yet.

269
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,410
Since I'm here today,

270
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,279
there are a few things I must say.

271
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,410
I admit that I'm ambitious in love.

272
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,170
I'm vain and immature,

273
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,759
but I've never thought of hurting anyone.

274
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,480
I'm not the reason for their divorce.

275
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,170
I'm merely a mirror...

276
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,410
that reveals the truth of their marital estrangement.

277
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,410
Zhou Bin doesn't love me...

278
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,279
or Zeng Cheng.

279
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,960
He only loves himself.

280
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,169
He doesn't deserve any woman...

281
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,519
to entrust her lifetime love and happiness to him.

282
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,799
Zeng Cheng.

283
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,680
From another perspective, you should thank me.

284
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,519
Thank me for showing up...

285
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,890
and helping you understand this man.

286
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,359
That's all I wanted to say.

287
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:22,960
You're very cool.

288
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,200
Thank you.

289
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,920
After the trial,

290
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,079
Zeng Cheng's lawyer told me something.

291
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:02,839
She said...

292
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,680
we could both let it go.

293
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,160
My cousin told me too.

294
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,039
Actually, between the two of you,

295
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,240
there won't be any forgiveness or blame.

296
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,680
You and her need to move on.

297
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,799
I'm just thankful that I won't be her enemy anymore.

298
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,480
You've finally crossed this hurdle.

299
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,559
What do you plan to do next?

300
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,159
Sleep hard.

301
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,319
Relax hard.

302
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,960
Recharge my energy.

303
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,440
After a week, I'll go and look for a job.

304
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,960
Let's go.

305
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,400
Come on.

306
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,640
Speaking of relaxing,

307
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,639
I think a week off is just right.

308
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,720
If it's too long, I'll start to feel a bit bored.

309
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,039
Can you stop showing off here?

310
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,720
You took a week off.

311
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,319
You must be so happy.

312
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,480
To be honest, I was so happy on the first day.

313
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,920
On the second day, I thought it was a bit bland.

314
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,279
After that, I tried all kinds of games.

315
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,558
It was fun at first,

316
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,639
but after a while,

317
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,679
I still found it boring.

318
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,720
If we were to replace the game with men here,

319
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,920
you would be a true femme fatale.

320
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,559
You're a typical career woman.

321
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,838
You're destined to enjoy your work.

322
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,039
Accept your fate.

323
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,960
Win the clients and get the project...

324
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,440
are indeed much more exciting than go-karting.

325
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,278
Do you think I'll become...

326
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,519
a career woman?

327
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,640
You?

328
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,559
Becoming a career woman?

329
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,919
I don't feel it yet.

330
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,960
However,

331
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,479
He Zhi Nan,

332
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,279
have you fallen for Wang Zi Lu?

333
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,798
No!

334
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,039
No?

335
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,200
Then why did you give him all your money?

336
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,119
You live a poor life, but you're so happy every day.

337
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,799
I'm just investing.

338
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,880
If it weren't for him, would you invest in trendy stuff?

339
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,038
It's hard to say.

340
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,799
So you fell for him.

341
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,439
I'm working on my career,

342
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,720
but you make it sound so tacky and low-class.

343
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,598
We didn't say you're not working on your career.

344
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,798
It's just that...

345
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,558
you can work on both at the same time.

346
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,920
That's right.

347
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,640
That makes sense!

348
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,759
There's a kite.

349
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,959
Let's go fly a kite sometime.

350
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,160
- Sure. - Sure.

351
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,078
What's going on?

352
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,240
What happened?

353
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
Wang Zi Lu...

354
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,160
is going to sell the studio.

355
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,439
This is our new doll.

356
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,480
It's called Cutie.

357
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,000
I know.

358
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,798
According to our data research,

359
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,240
aside from the promotional video...

360
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,319
generating over 50 sales on its launch day,

361
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,160
the subsequent conversion rate has been basically zero.

362
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,720
The sales aren't optimistic.

363
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,680
Don't you think...

364
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,439
the target audience for the product itself...

365
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,079
is too narrow?

366
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,679
From the beginning,

367
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,480
I intended to create toys for adults.

368
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,079
Because I believe this audience should be quite broad.

369
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,358
After all,

370
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,775
regardless of whether you are male or female,

371
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,319
whether you are rich, where you live,

372
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:54,920
or where you work.

373
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,640
I believe...

374
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,400
that everyone,

375
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,440
no matter how they appear on the outside,

376
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,200
has a child...

377
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,400
living inside them.

378
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,640
I can tell...

379
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,440
that you still have a deep love for Toys Universe.

380
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:14,599
So why did you suddenly give it up?

381
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,319
Because I owe a lot of money.

382
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,359
I also owe my friends a lot.

383
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,599
I have to pay them back now.

384
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,319
I've been running the studio for nine years.

385
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,559
At first, I thought my dreams were beautiful,

386
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,559
but the reality is also very harsh.

387
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,319
I'm at the age where I need to be responsible for others,

388
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,400
so I can't allow my own whims to pull all my friends down with me.

389
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,680
Mr. Wang Zi Lu.

390
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,640
I admire your attitude.

391
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,880
However,

392
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,879
regarding the acquisition of Toys Universe...

393
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
I don't agree.

394
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,079
Hello.

395
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,880
I'm one of the shareholders of Toys Universe.

396
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,759
Whether to sell the studio is not up to him alone.

397
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,720
My stance is...

398
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,039
that I absolutely won't sell it.

399
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:13,999
You don't have to contact us.

400
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,200
I'm sorry.

401
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,518
Where are you going? What are you doing?

402
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,839
He Zhi Nan, slow down.

403
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,159
Be careful.

404
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
Slow down.

405
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:28,480
You traitor. Stay away from me.

406
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:31,119
- No, let me explain. - Who wants to listen to you?

407
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,759
Liar.

408
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,839
You go back on your words.

409
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,160
I didn't.

410
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,840
How is that not going back on your word?

411
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,319
Stop first. Let me explain, okay?

412
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,920
Who wants to listen to you?

413
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,079
Stay away from me.

414
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,960
Be careful. Don't fall.

415
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,518
You don't want to listen?

416
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,799
Fine. Continue riding it then.

417
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,559
I'll follow you wherever you go.

418
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,000
You're so annoying.

419
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Go faster.

420
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,240
What?

421
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,760
You haven't locked the bike yet.

422
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,200
He Zhi Nan, wait!

423
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,680
Slow down!

424
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,118
Let me explain, okay?

425
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,799
- I don't want to hear it. - Don't be mad.

426
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,758
Slow down. I had no choice.

427
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:39,159
That's why I went to see them. Do you understand?

428
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,078
Please go through the security check. Thank you.

429
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:43,399
If you're carrying liquids, please remove them in advance.

430
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,399
If they are really willing to acquire it,

431
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,599
then that's the only way Toys Universe can survive.

432
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,079
They only care about whether they make money.

433
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,959
They have their reasons too.

434
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,558
Now that things have turned out this way,

435
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,598
we are completely out of options.

436
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,599
Do you understand?

437
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,480
I'll go see Gao Peng.

438
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,759
What?

439
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:09,199
Am I supposed to rely on his charity for my dream?

440
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,519
I'd rather not have it.

441
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:13,359
Any money that can save the studio is worthwhile.

442
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,759
Stop being so prideful.

443
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,359
What do you mean by that?

444
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,480
I'm facing reality. Understand?

445
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,720
I accept the losses.

446
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,960
I think you're jealous.

447
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,559
Why would I be jealous, He Zhi Nan?

448
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,119
Open your eyes and take a look.

449
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,279
This isn't some fantasy world like those idol dramas, you know?

450
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,038
In this real world,

451
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:33,160
adult careers aren't mere props for kids playing house.

452
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,039
Can you stop with the self-indulgence?

453
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,240
The challenges and despair I'm dealing with now...

454
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,078
are way more important than any jealousy.

455
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,079
Do you understand?

456
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,839
Will you really give up if there's no new investor?

457
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:50,480
Sometimes, giving up takes more courage than holding on.

458
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,639
However, successes usually came...

459
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,735
when one gathered his strength again...

460
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,480
while facing breakdowns.

461
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,078
Don't give up.

462
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,240
Hang in there.

463
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,960
Just hang in there.

464
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,920
Let me tell you.

465
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,359
Encouraging others to persist...

466
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,279
is the cheapest and easiest thing to do.

467
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,720
Wang Zi Lu, what do you mean?

468
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,279
I'm a shareholder too.

469
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:35,640
I have also put in my heart and soul,

470
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,759
as well as my passion!

471
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,559
I won't accept such an outcome.

472
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,599
Let me tell you.

473
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:42,879
When I was a kid,

474
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,456
I couldn't accept that ice cream would melt.

475
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,758
I couldn't accept that summer vacation would end.

476
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:46,759
And I couldn't accept...

477
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,896
that the girl I liked would transfer to another school.

478
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,640
But when these things happened,

479
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,920
crying and shouting didn't change anything.

480
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,479
If it happens, it happens.

481
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,599
Growing up is about being compelled to accept things.

482
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,799
Sometimes, stubbornly insisting on something...

483
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,559
is just a fear of admitting one's failure.

484
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,920
Isn't that an even bigger failure?

485
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,920
The Wang Zi Lu I liked...

486
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,359
wasn't like this.

487
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,359
I'm timid.

488
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:31,160
I like you but don't dare to say it.

489
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,319
I can't believe you're worse than me.

490
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,360
(The Story of Cutie)

491
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,359
Is this store reliable or not?

492
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,439
Still no shipping after all this time?

493
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,519
Unfollow it.

494
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,078
What cutie?

495
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,439
Why are you pretending to be cute?

496
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,840
I heard the designer is a man.

497
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,039
What a pervert.

498
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,679
She wants to grow up, but she can't?

499
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:37,000
How pretentious.

500
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,598
It only lasted for a few days.

501
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,809
Will it work?

502
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:45,239
Do youngsters nowadays give up on their dreams so easily?

503
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,759
What kind of writing is this?

504
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:49,239
No wonder the whole shop is closed.

505
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:53,015
If you have no talent for writing, then don't waste time doing it.

506
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,559
Find another job before it's too late.

507
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,920
Are you sad...

508
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,039
because of those comments about Cutie?

509
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:27,639
I have no talent.

510
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
I shouldn't have dreamed of writing.

511
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,329
I should have found a job like before.

512
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,520
Being a full-time housewife isn't an option anymore.

513
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,809
I need a job to support myself.

514
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,840
I can't go back to my parents' house...

515
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:52,920
and rely on them.

516
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,679
Wang Zi Lu is right.

517
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:02,679
The world is fair...

518
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,920
because no matter how hard you work,

519
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,400
success is uncertain.

520
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,769
Chasing dreams...

521
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,289
is a lot like falling in love.

522
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,960
It takes more than effort.

523
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,679
Love needs timing and strategy.

524
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,679
Pursuing dreams...

525
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:38,400
requires skills and opportunities.

526
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,769
Failing in love is normal...

527
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,840
and failing in dreams...

528
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:52,400
should be too.

529
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,960
So when should you keep going...

530
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,480
and when should you give up?

531
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,079
Right now.

532
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,519
(Hiring talents)

533
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,768
(Admin clerk, basic 3,500)

534
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,199
(High salary, Accommodation provided...)

535
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,769
Which one is good for an interview?

536
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,039
Since I'm going to make a change,

537
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,079
I might as well go all out.

538
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,399
After graduation,

539
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,880
I've been working as...

540
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,799
the second administrative secretary to the boss at that company.

541
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:20,039
Why did you quit...

542
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,559
after three years?

543
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:23,679
I wanted to further my studies,

544
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,158
so I went to Hong Kong.

545
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,519
What major did you focus on?

546
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,289
I'll be honest with you.

547
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,159
I...

548
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,880
I went to Hong Kong...

549
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,960
to find my boyfriend.

550
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:43,840
I know...

551
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,960
that my resume is mediocre.

552
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,198
My university is mediocre.

553
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,559
My job is mediocre too.

554
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,119
I've always followed the routine of studying...

555
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,329
and taking exams.

556
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,600
I never really thought about...

557
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:59,769
what kind of job I wanted...

558
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,440
or the kind of person I wanted to be.

559
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:06,400
- But it's different now. - How is it different?

560
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:07,880
It's different because...

561
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,719
The position you're applying for...

562
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:14,769
is still an administrative secretary.

563
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,319
You're a city beauty, an independent woman.

564
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,785
But you don't care about work at all.

565
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:28,889
What's there to care about?

566
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,679
Folding bills into roses?

567
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,400
Here you go.

568
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,880
What colour did you buy?

569
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,769
Look at this.

570
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,329
I joined a company and got a job.

571
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:47,159
But I still feel dispensable in the workplace.

572
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,439
Could it be that...

573
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,079
you just haven't found what you truly enjoy doing?

574
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,960
Your writing is very emotional and relaxed,

575
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,198
yet intuitively accurate.

576
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,359
It's also quite sharp and humorous,

577
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,399
making it easy to read.

578
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,719
So why keep the studio open...

579
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,518
if it's not profitable?

580
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:00,809
Because I like it.

581
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,329
Some of your lines leave a lasting impression.

582
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:04,769
You should keep writing.

583
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,329
Perhaps this is what you're meant to do.

584
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,399
I'm sorry.

585
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,480
I made a mistake.

586
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,880
I'm not that keen on this job.

587
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,558
I'm sorry.

588
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,639
Thank you for your time.

589
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:03,919
Product in position.

590
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,198
Investors, please come in.

591
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:13,360
(Product trend chart)

592
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,639
Product number one.

593
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,359
Slick-haired finance guy.

594
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,519
Dressed in a suit and tie.

595
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,518
Proficient in English and Chinese.

596
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,479
Smooth-talking with knowledge of three languages.

597
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:24,079
He's popular in the market.

598
00:42:24,289 --> 00:42:26,238
Large transaction volume and high liquidity.

599
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,480
He's a popular stock.

600
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,559
I want him.

601
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:30,920
Look carefully.

602
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,239
"Large transaction volume and high liquidity."

603
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:34,719
It's only for short-term use.

604
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:39,879
A smart woman should invest only a little time in such a man.

605
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,329
She should never invest her love.

606
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,840
What should a smart woman invest in?

607
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,769
Product number two.

608
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:49,360
A potential stock.

609
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,559
He's a programmer at a startup Internet company.

610
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:52,919
He's honest and down-to-earth.

611
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,960
High income and low expenses.

612
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,808
He only wears checkered shirts.

613
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:57,999
His life motto is,

614
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,288
"To win the heart of one person..."

615
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:01,039
- "and grow old together." - See?

616
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:02,599
That's the best choice.

617
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,769
- I want him. - Buy him.

618
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,960
The market is closed today.

619
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,959
Please come back tomorrow.

620
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,960
(Love investment market, The market is closed today)

621
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,198
(Love Investment)

622
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:19,920
(Love investment market, The market is open today)

623
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:21,769
Number two.

624
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:23,199
Number two.

625
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,639
Where's number two?

626
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,678
Where's that potential stock from yesterday?

627
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:31,809
My darlings.

628
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,440
I'm here.

629
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,038
Thanks to you guys,

630
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:41,760
my market suddenly improved.

631
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,015
I've skyrocketed from a potential stock...

632
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,320
to a hot stock.

633
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:47,719
I'm now a rising Internet mogul with a soaring value.

634
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,638
What are you waiting for?

635
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:51,000
Hurry up and invest in me.

636
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:53,598
By the way, you can invest in anything.

637
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,039
But don't invest in love.

638
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:56,719
Because love...

639
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:58,320
is worthless to me.

640
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,480
You're the worthless one.

641
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,760
Don't go.
