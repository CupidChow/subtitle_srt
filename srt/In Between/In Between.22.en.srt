00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 22)

3
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,040
(Crayfish)

4
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,960
(Salon upstairs)

5
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,370
The food here is really good.

6
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,090
The portion is big. Eat more.

7
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,090
You know where to find good food.

8
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,479
I'm so lucky.

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,810
That woman's waist-to-hip ratio
is amazing,

10
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,639
but her legs are too skinny.

11
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,280
It'd be better
if they were a little fuller.

12
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,718
This is called the male gaze.

13
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,520
It's offensive to women.

14
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,520
Look at how she's dressed today.

15
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
It proves that she knows
what her strengths are.

16
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,280
She purposely shows them off.

17
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,439
Why?

18
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,639
It's just to get attention, right?

19
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,199
I'm the one who knows
how to appreciate beauty.

20
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,479
That's not appreciation though.

21
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,479
You're staring at her.

22
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,878
That's harassment.

23
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,039
Harassment?

24
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,438
Staring and being stared at.

25
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,039
Enjoying staring
and being stared at.

26
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,680
These are the fundamental origins
of human art, okay?

27
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,280
Don't use art as an excuse
for being a creep.

28
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,280
You're just a shallow guy
who likes pretty women.

29
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,960
I hate people like you the most.

30
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,919
You claim to care
about the soul and spirit,

31
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,719
but you're clearly
all about appearances.

32
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
I like pretty women,

33
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,718
especially those with great bodies.

34
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,719
Let me tell you.

35
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,800
For me, a girl with a good body
is all about the numbers.

36
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,198
Hip size, leg size,
and that waist-to-hip ratio.

37
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,239
Get it?

38
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,039
To be in a relationship with me,
these are the hard measurements.

39
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,680
Excuse me.

40
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,759
Hello?

41
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,959
You have the wrong number.

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
What air conditioner? Wrong number.

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,680
What the heck?
There's no end to this.

44
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,719
Serves you right.

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,879
You have a big mouth.

46
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,319
What did you say?

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
I said you're so handsome.

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,039
I'm okay.

49
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,050
Come on.

50
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,480
My house is just up ahead.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,639
I don't need you to see me off.

52
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,730
Who wants to see you off?

53
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,920
I ate too much crayfish
and now I'm uncomfortably full,

54
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,120
so I want
to take a stroll to digest.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,239
By the way, how about cutie?

56
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,360
Have you considered it?

57
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,680
We'll see.

58
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,279
Do you need to have a chat
with that other side of you first?

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you.

60
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,959
Han Su.

61
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,079
Gao Peng.

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,439
- What?
- Do me a favour, please.

63
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,479
Gao Peng, when did you get back?

64
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Why didn't you tell me?

65
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,560
I just got back.

66
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,360
I was busy with work.

67
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,638
After I returned,

68
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,680
I had a meeting
with Ms. Han and the team.

69
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,480
The meeting just ended.

70
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,439
No wonder...

71
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,120
you said you were busy
with a meeting...

72
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,600
when I called you for dinner.

73
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,360
So you were with him.

74
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,199
So are you guys...

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,639
having a meeting...

76
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,000
or having dinner?

77
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,879
Let me introduce you.

78
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,879
Wang Zi Lu.

79
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,199
A rising designer
in the trendy toy industry.

80
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,319
He's my new boyfriend.

81
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,680
This is Gao Peng,

82
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,279
the boss of a listed company.

83
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,319
He's my ex-boyfriend.

84
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,920
Hello.

85
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,720
This is...

86
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,000
Han Su.

87
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,079
She's a lawyer at a law firm.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,839
She's my best friend.

89
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,480
Let go of me.

90
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,278
Zi Lu,

91
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,480
don't you think...

92
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,079
they're perfect for each other?

93
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,560
Gao Peng,
why don't you try pursuing Han Su?

94
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,519
Why are you squeezing me so hard?

95
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,199
You're turning my hand purple.

96
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,680
Babe, I'm sorry.

97
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,879
I'll give you a good massage
when we get home.

98
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,639
No, He Zhi Nan.

99
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,720
She's your best friend...

100
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,639
and he's your ex-boyfriend.

101
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,920
They're dating each other
behind your back, right?

102
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,078
Do you want me to pretend
to be your boyfriend...

103
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,438
because you think
this will help you...

104
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,639
- get the upper hand?
- Zi Lu.

105
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,919
- What does it have to do with you?
- Wang Zi Lu.

106
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,119
What does it have to do with them
whether you have a boyfriend or not?

107
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,439
Wang Zi Lu, shut up!

108
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,199
All right. Don't walk so fast.

109
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,519
Don't be mad. All right?

110
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,518
Your acting just now was so bad.

111
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,040
It's useless for me to play along.

112
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,800
Do you want to drink?

113
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,079
It's my treat.

114
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,959
Let's go.

115
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,199
(Thai cuisine)

116
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,840
Drink up.

117
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,559
A woman who can handle
this much alcohol...

118
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,279
is unbreakable.

119
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,159
The first time I drank with you,

120
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,759
I was really intimidated.

121
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,558
I thought to myself...

122
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,039
that a woman like this...

123
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,039
should never be taken home,

124
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,519
but she would definitely
make a great buddy.

125
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,600
Tell me.

126
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,360
Your ex-boyfriend is so rich...

127
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,038
and your best friend is so pretty.

128
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,919
Don't they look good together?

129
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,959
Can't you just let them be?

130
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,480
Would it kill you not to be mean?

131
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,639
I'm just stating a fact, okay?

132
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,759
Han Su is prettier than me.

133
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,210
She's smarter than me.

134
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
She's better than me in every way.

135
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,600
Gao Peng is my ex-boyfriend.

136
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,039
I can't control what he does.

137
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,639
However, I'm sad.

138
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,639
What does that have to do
with being magnanimous?

139
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,039
Can't I be sad?

140
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,210
Don't I have the right to be sad?

141
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,559
They know...

142
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,559
I'll be sad if they're together,

143
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,210
but no one...

144
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,120
No one cares.

145
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
No one cares what I think.

146
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,960
No one cares if I'm sad.

147
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,159
No one cares...

148
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,158
No one cares about me...

149
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,679
losing my worthless love
and my best friend.

150
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,039
I hate them.

151
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
I know.

152
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,359
You feel like...

153
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,200
the whole world has betrayed you.

154
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,440
Right?

155
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,559
It's too painful,

156
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,440
but the problem is,

157
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,840
do you think the world revolves
around your emotions?

158
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,278
Your childish, overbearing,

159
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,279
and wishful thinking
have come to nothing.

160
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,559
And now you want to complain
about the whole world?

161
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,959
The problem is,
does it really matter to them...

162
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,559
whether you forgive them or not?

163
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,960
If you really don't care about them,

164
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,360
treat them like
non-player characters in a game...

165
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,840
and just delete them.

166
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,080
However, if you do care,

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,079
you need to remind yourself...

168
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,399
to view this situation
with a lighter perspective.

169
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,559
Understand?

170
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,480
Even if you drink
all the alcohol here today,

171
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,120
you can't change anything.

172
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,559
Go get more alcohol.

173
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,559
You don't look that heavy.

174
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,879
Why are you so heavy?

175
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,000
My goodness.

176
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,360
I'm exhausted.

177
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,999
Hang in there.

178
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,080
The door is unlocked.

179
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,480
Do I look pretty?

180
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:16,960
You're drunk.

181
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,039
Do I look pretty?

182
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,559
Not bad.

183
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,320
Do I look cute?

184
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,679
Yes.

185
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,599
Hug me.

186
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,519
How did I get home last night?

187
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,559
I don't know.

188
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,359
Wang Zi Lu.

189
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,559
Wang Zi Lu sent me home.

190
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,519
I think so.

191
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,919
He took off my clothes.

192
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,649
He changed my pants too.

193
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,719
He and I...

194
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,839
I...

195
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,650
I'm doomed.

196
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,650
Last night, I...

197
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,279
Last night, I drank too much.

198
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,890
I...

199
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,839
Last night, I...

200
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,440
I think...

201
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,000
I drank too much.

202
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,519
Wang...

203
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,079
Thank you.

204
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,079
You're sober now.

205
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,890
Last night, you took me home.

206
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,519
What? Did you end up blacking out?

207
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,240
What's wrong with your voice?
Did you catch a cold?

208
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes.

209
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,319
I have a cold.

210
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,079
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

211
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,240
- Take it.
- Thank you.

212
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,559
You're just in time.
Let me introduce you.

213
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,960
This is our partner, Liu Fu.

214
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,720
This is Chu Yi.

215
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,358
He Zhi Nan.

216
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,480
An emerging online writer.

217
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,279
She'll be writing
a story for our cutie.

218
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,890
Hello.

219
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,440
Hello.

220
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,759
Nice to meet you.

221
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,440
Nice to meet you.

222
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,960
Is there anything else?

223
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,519
I...

224
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,279
I want to talk to you privately.

225
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,680
Please wait a moment.

226
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,920
- Let's go.
- Okay.

227
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:00,839
Hurry up.

228
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,880
What do you want?

229
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,200
Why are you being so mysterious?

230
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,119
Did something...

231
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,240
Did something happen last night?

232
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,679
What happened yesterday?

233
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,720
Don't you remember?

234
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,839
I only remember vaguely.

235
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,920
Then why are you asking me?

236
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,039
So did something happen?

237
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,160
You invited me...

238
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,598
No.

239
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:51,359
To be more precise,

240
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,000
I was forced.

241
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,400
And?

242
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,200
And I have my principles too, okay?

243
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,839
What do you mean?

244
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,919
I stayed at your place until 2am.

245
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,680
I saw that you were fine, so I left.

246
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,240
Don't worry. Nothing happened.

247
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,159
- Really?
- What do you mean?

248
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,920
Do you think I'm a jerk
who takes advantage of everything?

249
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,680
That's not what I meant.

250
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,239
I was too drunk.

251
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,278
I'm sorry.

252
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,519
There's nothing to be sorry about.

253
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,960
I didn't lose my virginity anyway.

254
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,159
I understand that
when you grabbed me at that time,

255
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,358
it wasn't because you liked me...

256
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,000
or really wanted sex, right?

257
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,879
You were just feeling weak...

258
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,319
and instinctively needed
to cling to something,

259
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,000
as if that would prove
your own worth.

260
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,879
- What's wrong?
- We're adults.

261
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,319
Don't make it so clear.

262
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,559
Thank you.

263
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,319
There's no need to thank me.

264
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:02,839
You know what?

265
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,119
What I dislike the most...

266
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,278
is waking up the day
after being intimate...

267
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,880
and realizing
the other person is a stranger.

268
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,519
You look cheesy,

269
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,920
but your views are pretty sound,

270
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,920
so I guess you're a good person.

271
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,279
Come on. Don't friendzone me.

272
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,078
It's not about being good or bad.

273
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,599
If I don't like someone,
I definitely won't touch her.

274
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,519
Well, thank you for not touching me.

275
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,119
I'm leaving.

276
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,680
Hold on.

277
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,439
I read the articles...

278
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,559
from the public account
that you sent me.

279
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,559
I believe you're really fit
for writing stories about the cutie.

280
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,439
- I'll give it a try.
- Okay.

281
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,598
Liu Fu is in charge of the payment.
You can ask him.

282
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,599
It's okay.

283
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,919
I'll write
a couple of paragraphs first...

284
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,279
and you can give
your feedback afterwards.

285
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,559
Okay.

286
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
Hello.

287
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,559
The person you're trying
to reach is busy.

288
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,319
Please try again later.

289
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,720
Zhi Nan.

290
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,480
Well,

291
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,400
I know you're still mad at me.

292
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:47,799
I'm getting off work soon.

293
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,920
Let's have dinner together
and talk in person.

294
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,960
Even if you're mad,

295
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,599
you can't be mad at Han Su.

296
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,039
Why are you doing this?

297
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,319
Even if I'm not mad,
I don't want to eat with her.

298
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,279
So you're mad at Gao Peng.

299
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,039
Are you mad at Wang Zi Lu?

300
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,999
I'm mad.

301
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,078
I can't be calm.

302
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,279
I can't be reasonable, okay?

303
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,079
Why don't you
think of another way...

304
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,160
to get back at Wang Zi Lu?

305
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
It's childish.

306
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,000
So you know it's childish.

307
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,798
Getting mad is meaningless.

308
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,078
Not getting mad is also meaningless.

309
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,159
Revenge is meaningless.

310
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,240
Not seeking revenge
is just as meaningless.

311
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,519
Zhi Nan.

312
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,880
Zhi Nan.

313
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,079
I know you're mad at me,

314
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,919
but I still want to explain to you.

315
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,000
You don't have to.

316
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,839
You, me, and Gao Peng are free.

317
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,159
The three of us have nothing
to do with each other.

318
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,759
Zhi Nan, you're my best friend.

319
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,319
I once heard a saying...

320
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,920
that I now find quite meaningful.

321
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,200
The bonds formed between women...

322
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,400
by the age of 25...

323
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,960
are comparable to cheap earrings...

324
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,759
sold at a clearance sale.

325
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,559
You don't need to be picky
with these earrings.

326
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,160
If you feel happy, you wear them.

327
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,759
And if you throw them away,

328
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,799
you won't feel a sense of loss.

329
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,518
(Boyfriend and Bestie)

330
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,680
Are you going to confess?

331
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,119
This is a candid photo of you
without makeup, right?

332
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,400
Do you believe I'd make
this photo public?

333
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,119
Whatever.

334
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,920
I'm pretty without makeup.

335
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,640
I guess that doesn't work for you.

336
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,079
How about this?

337
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,519
If you confess,

338
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,440
I'll give you these.

339
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,400
What are they?

340
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,680
They are the social media accounts
and daily lives...

341
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,599
of your ex-boyfriend's
current girlfriend,

342
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,559
his first love,

343
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,480
your current boyfriend's
ex-girlfriend,

344
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,480
and your ex-boyfriend's ex.

345
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,599
Also,

346
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,039
I'll keep you updated.

347
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,440
What do their affairs
have to do with me?

348
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,759
You're not easily swayed, are you?

349
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,400
Let's go for the kill.

350
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,839
Is this the new guy you like?

351
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:19,480
Is this your pretty bestie?

352
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,519
Do you believe I'll introduce
this guy to your bestie?

353
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,279
- No.
- Someone.

354
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,359
Immediately share
this guy's WeChat with her bestie.

355
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,839
No!

356
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,359
No, you can't do this!

357
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,039
No!

358
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,519
No.

359
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,799
No.

360
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,798
She confessed.

361
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,880
(Confessed)

362
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,680
(Boyfriend and Bestie)

363
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,239
Ms. Sun, you're here.

364
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,279
Please have a seat.

365
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,519
Have some water.

366
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,440
This is great.

367
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,759
Thank you, Ms. Sun.

368
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,000
Based on my guess,

369
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,558
given Zhou Bin's personality,

370
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,640
he will probably
come looking for you...

371
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,240
once he finds out
about what you did today.

372
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,279
So from now on,

373
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,960
you need to pay attention
to your personal safety.

374
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,039
Don't go
to unfamiliar places with him.

375
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,559
He may seek revenge,

376
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,559
so you have to be prepared.

377
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,400
Zeng Cheng, I'm back.

378
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,679
So you came to me
because I'm young...

379
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,919
and can have children for you.

380
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,440
Don't think of me as so superficial.

381
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,880
So when do you
plan to get a divorce?

382
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,960
I have it all arranged.

383
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,160
At most, it will take a year.

384
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,440
If things go well,
it could be as soon as six months.

385
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,480
Is this ring...

386
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,880
a token of your promise?

387
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,160
Yes.

388
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:04,799
Zeng Cheng.

389
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,039
What are you doing?

390
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,559
Mr. Zhou.

391
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,160
Sign this.

392
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,640
Take your luggage and leave.

393
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,000
The house and money are mine.

394
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,119
You can't have any of them.

395
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,480
Why not?

396
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,160
Is what you saw and heard today...

397
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,559
not enough?

398
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,000
This...

399
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,880
This is unfair, Zeng Cheng.

400
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,240
Well...

401
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,480
I'll see you in court then.

402
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,880
No, Zeng Cheng. Listen to me.

403
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,599
I'm a lawyer,
so I know better than you.

404
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,358
Even if we go to court,

405
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,519
based on this,

406
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,759
the judge won't give you
an extra penny.

407
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Zeng Cheng.

408
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:01,039
This is within our expectations.

409
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,279
How many men claim
they want to leave with nothing,

410
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,319
yet in the end, they're more
calculating than anyone else?

411
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,680
If he really signs a clean break,

412
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,240
I'll acknowledge him as a man...

413
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,920
and we can end it here.

414
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,400
He's the one
who wants to start a war.

415
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,200
Then let's start a war.

416
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,799
Proving this extramarital affair
is inherently challenging.

417
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,639
The chat contents
and transfer records...

418
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,200
only show that their relationship
is somewhat ambiguous.

419
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,439
Our most compelling evidence...

420
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,039
should be the audio recording...

421
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,960
secretly made by Sun Han Han.

422
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,838
However, since it pertains
to her privacy with Zhou Bin,

423
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,759
if she brings it up herself,

424
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,119
the validity and legality
of this evidence...

425
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,000
could likely be challenged
by Zhou Bin in court.

426
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,359
If we want to win,

427
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,440
Ms. Sun has to do more.

428
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,759
Then call her now.

429
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,759
Teach her
how to gather evidence legally.

430
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
Understood.

431
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,039
If it comes to actual conflict,

432
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,000
it's not just about money.

433
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,679
He'll come for you soon.

434
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,360
Don't run away or stay in public.

435
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,639
You've grown up.

436
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,679
You have her back you up.

437
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:50,119
Let's talk at my place.

438
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,159
A private space
might encourage his arrogance.

439
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,400
He might assault you or harass you.

440
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,199
You should think of a way
to collect evidence.

441
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:17,289
Why would a young girl like you
want to learn this?

442
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,360
Do you want to record it again?

443
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,159
Zhou Bin is thoughtful,
prudent, and distrustful.

444
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,400
You need to be well-prepared.

445
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,079
Who taught you that?

446
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:34,880
Zeng Cheng?

447
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,289
Give it to me!

448
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,920
Who do you think you are?

449
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,480
How dare you provoke me?

450
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,239
Let me tell you.

451
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,079
You'll never be able
to get rid of me.

452
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,719
What I hate the most...

453
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:00,000
is betrayal.

454
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,879
What are you doing?

455
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,919
Let go of me!

456
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,039
Let go of me!

457
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:10,289
Don't try to defy me.

458
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,000
Do you think...

459
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,639
Zeng Cheng can defeat me?

460
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,639
Let go of me!

461
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,809
Let me go!

462
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:31,769
Let me tell you.

463
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,769
You can't get rid of me...

464
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,558
in this life.

465
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,960
Don't resist too much.

466
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,239
Lead him...

467
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,719
and let him have his way.

468
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,400
Some sacrifices are unavoidable.

469
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,039
Who taught you that?

470
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,119
Who taught you that?

471
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:15,880
We'll see about that.

472
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,039
Hello?

473
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,239
Is this the police?

474
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,119
I want to report a crime.

475
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:59,960
I encountered a case
of molestation at home.

476
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,840
The perpetrator is my friend.

477
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,400
His name is Zhou Bin.

478
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,440
There are cameras.

479
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,239
I have video records.

480
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,289
Okay.

481
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,919
From a legal perspective,

482
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,719
we generally classify this
as a commission contract.

483
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,598
Under contract law,

484
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,288
a commission contract
is an arrangement...

485
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,000
between the client and the trustee.

486
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:01,679
Mr. Zhou, sorry to interrupt.

487
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,199
The police are here to see you.

488
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,289
Which one of you is Zhou Bin?

489
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,119
I am.

490
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:09,118
There's a case
that requires your cooperation.

491
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,119
Please come with us.

492
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
No problem.

493
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,199
Carry on with the meeting.

494
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,239
This way.

495
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,599
Officer, I have a question.

496
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,039
What's the case?

497
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,329
Why do we have to go to the station?

498
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:54,159
(Arrest warrant)

499
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,239
Molestation?

500
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:57,839
Wait, officer.

501
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,159
This is a criminal case.

502
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,639
Could there be a mistake?

503
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,559
Let's talk at the station.

504
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
Okay.

505
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,079
(Police)

506
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:20,360
(Name: Zhou Bin)

507
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,000
Okay, come here.

508
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,769
Sit here.

509
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,840
I cried in front of the police.

510
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,400
The police saw the video
and they're all angry.

511
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,329
They said based on the video,

512
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,289
Zhou Bin is guilty
of forced molestation.

513
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,880
They told me to get
a medical examination first.

514
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,239
They will call Zhou Bin in
for questioning.

515
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:13,159
If his crime is confirmed,

516
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,239
I just need to sign
a case filing notice.

517
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,809
Zhou Bin will be
in big trouble then.

518
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,119
Will he be sentenced?

519
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,079
Unless he confesses to the police...

520
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,400
that he and I
had a romantic relationship,

521
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,079
recording a statement,
signing, and fingerprinting.

522
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,400
This is what Zeng Cheng wanted.

523
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,719
You did it on purpose.

524
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:37,519
It was Zeng Cheng
who taught me to do this.

525
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,920
She said that legal evidence...

526
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,239
needs to be valid.

527
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,359
The recording
I previously gave Zeng Cheng...

528
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,289
may not be fully accepted,

529
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,039
so the safest approach...

530
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,639
is to obtain written evidence...

531
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,329
where Zhou Bin
admits to a third party...

532
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,440
that we had...

533
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,289
a romantic relationship.

534
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,920
That sounds really complicated.

535
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:05,719
I guess I'll just have to do
what they say for now.

536
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,289
Okay.

537
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:13,329
I'll go first thing in the morning.

538
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
It was the police.

539
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,359
They said Zhou Bin's
evidence and testimony...

540
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,329
don't match what I said.

541
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,880
They told me to go
to the police station again.

542
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,079
I'll go with you.

543
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:27,809
No need.

544
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:34,360
Nan Nan.

545
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:36,079
I'm a little scared.

546
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:38,518
If Zhou Bin admits to the affair,

547
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:40,159
he'll probably be released soon.

548
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,809
What should I do
if he takes revenge on me?

549
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,480
I don't know.

550
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:49,559
Let's figure something out.
