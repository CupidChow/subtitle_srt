00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 6)

3
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:31,240
(Huanking Business Building)

4
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,639
I really hope to learn more...

5
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,090
from you, Ms. Hu.

6
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,000
Where did you learn Cantonese?

7
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,840
I listen to music...

8
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,360
and watch Hong Kong dramas.

9
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,879
You could say...

10
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,719
You could say I taught myself.

11
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,280
We can speak Mandarin.

12
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Sorry.

13
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,879
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,960
My Cantonese is bad.

15
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,240
My Mandarin was as bad as your Cantonese,

16
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,039
but learning languages is all about the environment.

17
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,240
Since I've been working longer in the mainland,

18
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,520
it has improved over time.

19
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,520
Listen and talk more.

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,080
You'll get the hang of it.

21
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,439
You just got transferred from the mainland.

22
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,479
I should've given you more time...

23
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,960
to get used to the work environment and pace here.

24
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,439
My plan was for you to assist my colleague,

25
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,960
but she had to leave for a sudden business trip,

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,039
so...

27
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,800
I have to let you take on this case right away.

28
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,199
I'm fine with that.

29
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,999
Read it in a day.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Can you do that?

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,520
- Yes.
- Good.

32
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,840
Yes.

33
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,159
Yes, that's me.

34
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,919
You want to confirm section 3A-5.

35
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,039
- Hold on. Let me check.
- Excuse me.

36
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
It's fine.

37
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,080
Page three.

38
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,439
Hold on.

39
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,080
You need to reserve it.

40
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,800
The last page. Yes.

41
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,439
Let me write it down first.

42
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,479
Okay.

43
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,599
No problem.

44
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,239
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

45
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Hello.

46
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,518
I'm the new lawyer,

47
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,560
Han Su.

48
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,639
I know.

49
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Sophie.

50
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,050
Here's your work ID.

51
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,480
- Come with me.
- Thank you.

52
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,120
Hello.

53
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,119
This is your desk.

54
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,680
If you need anything, just let me know.

55
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,319
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

56
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,360
Are you new here?

57
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,838
Nice to meet you.

58
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,279
I'm new here. My name is Sophie.

59
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,759
What's your name?

60
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,839
Hey. I just got back.

61
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,199
Okay.

62
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,518
I'm just picking up things others don't want...

63
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,730
and selling them as scrap.

64
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,279
How does that hurt anyone?

65
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,680
Why did he complain about me?

66
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,958
We're really in a difficult situation.

67
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,000
Slow down.

68
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,560
It's okay.

69
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,679
You're so capable.

70
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,879
Go back and find another job.

71
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,079
You can support your family.

72
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Slow down.

73
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,600
- I'm leaving.
- Take care.

74
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,959
Ms. Gu.

75
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,279
Xiao Qu.

76
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,680
I heard you're leaving.

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,079
Yes.

78
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,279
I lost my job.

79
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,119
I wonder which scoundrel...

80
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,360
has nothing better to do and framed me.

81
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,519
What a petty person.

82
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Ms. Gu.

83
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,959
I have some old clothes here.

84
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,120
If you don't mind,

85
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,519
just take them.

86
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,240
How can I do that?

87
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,040
Your clothes are all good stuff.

88
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,639
I'm embarrassed to take them.

89
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Ms. Gu, just take them.

90
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,959
If you don't take them, it means you think less of me.

91
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,480
Thank you, Xiao Qu.

92
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,758
What do you think?

93
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,759
It has a wide view and good natural light.

94
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,600
It's quite good.

95
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,758
Can you give me a discount?

96
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,839
Miss.

97
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,879
If the tenant wasn't in a hurry to move out,

98
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,920
I'd definitely raise the price.

99
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,439
This young man said...

100
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,639
that once he finds a place,

101
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,639
he'll move out right away.

102
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,519
The early vacancy...

103
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,959
will be a discount for you.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
- Okay?
- Yes.

105
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,399
I'll let you know once I find a place.

106
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,959
Then I'll move out as soon as possible.

107
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,319
We'll wait to hear from you.

108
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,319
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

109
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,639
Do you feel nostalgic about this place?

110
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,959
Come on. It's just a breakup.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I hope I didn't embarrass myself.

112
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,240
- Thank you.
- It's okay, young man.

113
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,680
Don't take it to heart.

114
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,800
Thank you.

115
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,278
Let me tell you.

116
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,639
In our neighbourhood,

117
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,240
the cleaning lady comes to clean every day.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,040
What's wrong with him?

119
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,439
Young man.

120
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,600
He's...

121
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,319
Young man.

122
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,559
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,679
I need to go to the toilet.

124
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Yes.

125
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,199
I can't see you off.

126
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,759
I'll show you downstairs.

127
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Okay.

128
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,960
(Huanking Business Building)

129
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,480
I'm still fighting for a chance to go to Hong Kong.

130
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,919
Is there a personal reason?

131
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,879
You want to go to Hong Kong so badly.

132
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,450
Is it because of that person?

133
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,240
Ever since I found out he's in Hong Kong,

134
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,879
everything I've done is to get close to him.

135
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Hello?

136
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,240
Is anyone there?

137
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
Hello.

138
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,360
Is anyone there?

139
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,919
Miss.

140
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,279
The exit is over there.

141
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,120
This entrance is locked after midnight.

142
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,519
They all use the side entrance.

143
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,840
Which way is the side entrance?

144
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,879
- Come with me.
- Thank you.

145
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,279
Are you new here?

146
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,480
It's my first day of work.

147
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,120
You worked overtime
on your first day.

148
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,519
You're so hardworking.

149
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,960
Where are you from?

150
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,440
Jiangzhou.

151
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,000
What?

152
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,679
Jiangzhou.

153
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Jiangzhou.

154
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,359
Jiangzhou's crawfish is delicious.

155
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Have you been to Jiangzhou?

156
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes. For travel purposes.

157
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,159
Thank you so much. How should I address you?

158
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,798
Just call me Mr. Zhong.

159
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,840
Thank you, Mr. Zhong.

160
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,158
Mr. Zhong.

161
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,840
Are there any good late-night snacks nearby?

162
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,919
Yes.

163
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,399
Turn right up ahead.

164
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,919
Then turn left at the first intersection.

165
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,039
There's a restaurant.

166
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,159
Their pineapple bun is delicious.

167
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,199
Plus, they have meal sets...

168
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,440
with coffee and milk tea.

169
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,399
It's quite a good deal.

170
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,559
Turn left here...

171
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,080
and at the first intersection,

172
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,720
you'll see a stall...

173
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,398
- selling boat congee.
- Boat congee.

174
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,719
It has a lot of ingredients.

175
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,120
It's delicious and famous.

176
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,360
If you go straight ahead,

177
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,600
you'll find a stall selling noodles.

178
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,840
Those instant noodles.

179
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,679
But its broth is different.

180
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,720
It uses fish for the base,

181
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,279
which is very fresh.

182
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,279
I see.

183
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,000
- Thank you, Mr. Zhong.
- You're welcome.

184
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,279
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

185
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,320
Be careful.

186
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,039
My name is Han Su.

187
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,720
All right, Han Su.

188
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,840
Bye.

189
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,679
(Yue's Orthopedics)

190
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,279
I'll walk you home.

191
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,638
It's just a short way.

192
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,639
I can go home by myself.

193
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,399
Sir, you may leave.

194
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,398
(Occupied)

195
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,440
Let's go.

196
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,359
By the way, I've been house hunting lately...

197
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,440
as I'm preparing to move.

198
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,159
Where to?

199
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,879
The nearby neighbourhood.

200
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,359
My house-hunting criteria...

201
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,720
is that it should take no more than 10 minutes...

202
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,080
to walk to your place.

203
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,600
I'll invite you over once I move in.

204
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,639
I'll cook for you.

205
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,200
- Can you cook?
- Yes.

206
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,799
I can't imagine what your cooking would taste like.

207
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,480
It's beyond your imagination.

208
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,240
Don't be so sure.

209
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,440
You'll know once you try it.

210
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,759
I have...

211
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,480
many skills you don't know about...

212
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,759
and they're beyond your imagination.

213
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,279
I have to go upstairs.

214
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,120
I can tell...

215
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,879
from the way you looked at me just now.

216
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,919
I just learned how to make Hong Kong-style milk tea.

217
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,120
Do you want to try it?

218
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
There's CCTV in the elevator.

219
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,639
Aren't they all broken?

220
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
I mean,

221
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,758
in typical neighbourhoods,

222
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,600
the elevator's cameras are mostly not working.

223
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,960
Our neighbourhood ones are fine.

224
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,559
It was broken a while ago,

225
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,679
but it's fixed now.

226
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,480
It's better than my place.

227
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,720
What's wrong? What are you sniffing?

228
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,159
My evil neighbour...

229
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,678
must have left something in the hallway.

230
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,720
It stinks.

231
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,600
He's really uncivilized.

232
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,920
What's that sound?

233
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,359
My chinchilla.

234
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,440
Why don't I do it?

235
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,959
I feel somewhat embarrassed...

236
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,480
for having you help out in the kitchen...

237
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,200
on your first visit to my home.

238
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,039
Come on. Who are you kidding?

239
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,680
Judging by your kitchen and fridge,

240
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,000
it's obvious you rarely cook.

241
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,240
Well, we're short on ingredients today,

242
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,199
so I can't show off my cooking skills.

243
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I'll just make you some instant noodles.

244
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,480
Do you always cook?

245
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,319
Well,

246
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,039
did you also do the cooking when you were with your ex?

247
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,279
I did the cooking most of the time.

248
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,650
She rarely did it and wasn't very good at it.

249
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,649
She was pampered by her parents,

250
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,680
unlike me.

251
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,960
I've been through tough times and became independent early.

252
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,758
I got used to all kinds of house...

253
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,799
and fieldwork.

254
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,319
He'll find out sooner or later.

255
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,039
I just can't cook.

256
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,440
He's truly a hidden gem.

257
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
It's delicious.

258
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,890
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to learn from you.

259
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm going to learn how to cook too.

260
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,480
Usually, girls would say,

261
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,038
"Keep up the good work."

262
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,319
They'd praise me and even coaxed me.

263
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,200
You're good.

264
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,599
You're quite special.

265
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,890
Are you going to learn cooking?

266
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,720
You're the most honest...

267
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,078
and sincere girl...

268
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,119
I've ever met.

269
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,240
That doesn't sound like a compliment.

270
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,170
Why isn't it a compliment?

271
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,079
Seriously.

272
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,599
I'm worried you're too perfect and I'm not good enough for you.

273
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,650
Why not?

274
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,650
Because of my dark side.

275
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:31,890
Your dark side?

276
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,039
Tell me about it.

277
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,039
Actually,

278
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,759
I've always had a deep sense of distrust toward women.

279
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,799
Why?

280
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,480
Didn't I tell you before?

281
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,078
I was born...

282
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,920
into a typical farming family.

283
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,720
My dad was a loser.

284
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,119
The only thing he asked of me was to study hard.

285
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,559
At the last parent meeting...

286
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,079
prior to my college entrance exam,

287
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,079
to save money,

288
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,240
he took the village's cargo truck.

289
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,039
(Mini melons)

290
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:31,960
(Community policing)

291
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,240
Are you waiting for your dad?

292
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,720
Have you looked at today's chemistry questions?

293
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,240
I have one that I don't quite understand.

294
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,799
I picked him up at the school gate.

295
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,170
Coincidentally, I bumped into a female classmate.

296
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,079
The answer is C.

297
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,480
My dad is here.

298
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,170
Dad.

299
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,359
Yi Peng.

300
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,480
- Let me help you.
- Okay.

301
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,000
It's your favourite fruit.

302
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,758
This is my classmate.

303
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:55,839
Hello, sir.

304
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,599
When we passed by that female classmate,

305
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,279
she covered her nose...

306
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,720
in obvious disgust.

307
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,160
She's the daughter...

308
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,640
of the head of our county.

309
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,519
I've long been used to...

310
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,759
the disdainful looks they give me.

311
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,039
They're all from...

312
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,400
prestigious families...

313
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,559
and have beautiful appearances.

314
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,279
It was around the summer of my first year of college.

315
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,399
I went back to my hometown.

316
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Hi.

317
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,038
That female classmate enthusiastically asked me out.

318
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,039
It has been a while.

319
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,240
I deliberately chose a roadside snack bar...

320
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,480
without air conditioning.

321
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,599
I spent the afternoon chatting with her,

322
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,680
watching her carefully applied makeup...

323
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,200
gradually fade away...

324
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,200
until it looked terrible.

325
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,518
I have something to do tonight.

326
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,558
I'll get going.

327
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,639
By the evening, I said I had something to do...

328
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,719
and that I'd leave first.

329
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,440
- Before I left, I told her...
- Are you leaving now?

330
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,400
Also, if you have pimples on your face,

331
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,759
don't apply too much makeup.

332
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,079
Otherwise, when you sweat,

333
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,279
it'll get muddy.

334
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,240
Isn't that too much?

335
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,599
Yes, it is.

336
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,119
But she went too far too.

337
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,079
It's okay.

338
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,119
Yes.

339
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,160
I'm just using her feelings for me...

340
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,440
to get back at her.

341
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,279
That day,

342
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,960
I felt quite satisfied,

343
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,240
but I also...

344
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,920
I also felt a bit sad at the same time.

345
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,839
My malice and immaturity took me aback.

346
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,200
From that day on, I decided...

347
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,920
to change my situation completely.

348
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,000
I can understand.

349
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
No, you can't.

350
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I watched a movie...

351
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,759
that mentioned...

352
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
how some people...

353
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,039
have a similar scent.

354
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,240
In the movie,

355
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,359
the protagonist's feeling of being looked down upon,

356
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,799
that painful feeling,

357
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,079
is something...

358
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,799
that those who have always been privileged and pampered...

359
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,960
can't understand.

360
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
What's wrong? What are you sniffing?

361
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,559
My evil neighbour...

362
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,118
must have left something in the hallway.

363
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,119
It stinks.

364
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,960
He's really uncivilized.

365
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,599
Many things...

366
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,039
you consider ordinary...

367
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,559
and unremarkable are,

368
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,480
to me,

369
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,319
as...

370
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,839
As difficult as reaching the sky.

371
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:43,759
That's why...

372
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,200
all that...

373
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,039
I have now...

374
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,839
is something I've worked hard for...

375
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:53,119
and I don't find it shameful.

376
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,119
However,

377
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,880
those girls who grew up in a life of privilege...

378
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,680
often look down on people like me.

379
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,640
Everyone is different.

380
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,599
I've never looked down on you.

381
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,880
I think you're amazing.

382
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,440
Of course you're different.

383
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Nan Nan.

384
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,640
I feel so lucky...

385
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,559
to have met you.

386
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,319
Me too.

387
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,200
Eat up.

388
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,599
You're in a good mood.

389
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,319
Nan Nan, you're in a good mood today.

390
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
He Zhi Nan.

391
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,440
I notified you a week ago...

392
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,679
that the printer in the meeting room needs a new cartridge.

393
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,720
Why haven't you taken care of it yet?

394
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,079
It's here.

395
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,640
Hurry up and change it. We need it for the meeting.

396
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,319
Okay.

397
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,720
Wait. What colour did you buy?

398
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,999
Well,

399
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,680
you didn't say anything about the colour.

400
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,160
Why didn't you ask me?

401
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,758
You don't even know what colour we need.

402
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,880
How could you simply buy it?

403
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,960
What's wrong with you lately?

404
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,480
You're so absent-minded.

405
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,599
Don't worry.

406
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
I'll take care of it right away.

407
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,759
Don't worry. It will be done shortly.

408
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,038
Get to work, everyone.

409
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,079
Work harder.

410
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,799
Gao Peng is back.

411
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,319
What are you talking about?

412
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,319
Do you have a new lover?

413
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,359
Look at your face.

414
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:15,920
It looks quite vibrant.

415
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,640
Look at your face.

416
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,359
- What's wrong?
- It says "gossip" on it.

417
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,359
He Zhi Nan, documents.

418
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,839
Coming.

419
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,559
Be careful.

420
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,400
Here you go.

421
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,119
All of you...

422
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
See?

423
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,680
Guess where I am.

424
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,519
Where are you?

425
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,319
What's going on?

426
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Company welfare?

427
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,640
I just said I wanted to see the sea.

428
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,559
Then an hour later, he arrived at my house.

429
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,399
After that, we headed to the airport...

430
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,039
and I quickly found myself at a hotel near the beach.

431
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,000
When I woke up, this was the view I had seen.

432
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,440
He's really something.

433
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,119
A spontaneous trip...

434
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,200
sounds romantic,

435
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,880
but it's actually quite a torment in practice.

436
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,160
I didn't bring anything...

437
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,439
and he took me to a duty-free store...

438
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,400
where we ended up buying...

439
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,640
everything you can imagine.

440
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,680
Sun Han Han.

441
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,640
You're radiating a scent...

442
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,599
that only women in love have...

443
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,039
and I can smell it even through the screen.

444
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,359
You have it too, okay?

445
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,480
Well, I can smell it too.

446
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Isn't it nice?

447
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
It's so nice.

448
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,798
Look at him.

449
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,920
What do you think he's doing?

450
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,680
I'm working. I have to go.

451
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,159
Take care.

452
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,200
Bye.

453
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:06,759
Han Han.

454
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,640
What are you so happy about?

455
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,358
My best friend asked me...

456
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,519
if this trip was a company welfare.

457
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,400
What did you say?

458
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,960
I claimed this as my love privilege.

459
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,640
Nonsense.

460
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,960
It's clearly mine.

461
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,000
Eat slowly.

462
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,200
Come out and eat together.

463
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,920
Babe.

464
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,359
Babe.

465
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,799
Babe.

466
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,000
Why are you back?

467
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,480
I missed you.

468
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,160
Why did you bring them back?

469
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,720
I just brought them back.

470
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,440
I just happened to.

471
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,720
Gao Peng.

472
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,160
Something is wrong with you.

473
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,920
Talk to me properly.

474
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:08,920
Why are you back?

475
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:13,880
Is your dad sick?

476
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,160
Or is it your mom sick?

477
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
No.

478
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,279
Did your family go bankrupt?

479
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,039
No.

480
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,240
What's going on then?

481
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,719
Do I look bad?

482
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,279
You look terrible.

483
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,359
So tell me.

484
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I miss you.

485
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,680
I miss you.

486
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,640
All right. I know.

487
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,720
There are a lot of people here.

488
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Let's talk at home.

489
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Let's go.

490
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,839
Stop sighing.

491
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,119
I'm so mad.

492
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,720
The previous manager...

493
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,559
couldn't get many of the accounts right...

494
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,809
and my dad ended up arguing with him.

495
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,840
They fought fiercely.

496
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:12,400
Later on,

497
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,679
he and his team were all fired.

498
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,329
My dad was so mad that he was hospitalized.

499
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,199
Later on, my dad said...

500
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:23,400
he wouldn't trust those managers anymore...

501
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,198
and insisted on handing over all the Hong Kong business...

502
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,289
over to me.

503
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:28,329
Is that why...

504
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,920
they forced you to leave the research institute?

505
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,440
They spoke directly to my boss...

506
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
and messed up my work life.

507
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:37,119
I've told them countless times...

508
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,599
that I'm not interested in business...

509
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,360
and I'm not used to dealing with people.

510
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,920
Of course. Besides you, Nan Nan.

511
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,199
I'm not cut out for it.

512
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,000
And still, they want me to deal with the public listing.

513
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:50,199
I don't know anything about it.

514
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,000
Your company can go public now?

515
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,360
That's why it's a mess.

516
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,119
I originally said okay.

517
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,079
Next year,

518
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,559
I'll do part-time management for the company...

519
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,679
and learn slowly.

520
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,440
They insist that...

521
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,840
I must work full-time this year.

522
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:09,000
You have a huge family business...

523
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,559
to inherit and manage.

524
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,199
This major headache...

525
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,719
is something many people dream of having.

526
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,679
Who wants it?

527
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,000
Hurry up and let him take it.

528
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,079
Make him take it away.

529
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,360
Since I was little,

530
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,840
I've always been under their control.

531
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,719
They've never considered my feelings.

532
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,639
That's what I can't stand the most.

533
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,289
No one likes me.

534
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:32,920
My parents don't like me either.

535
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,920
Now you don't like me either.

536
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,000
What's the point of living?

537
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,289
Why did you drag me into this?

538
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,518
Then why did you break up with me?

539
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,519
We...

540
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,769
Those are two different matters.

541
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,079
Nan Nan.

542
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,239
Let's get back together, okay?

543
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,559
Sharing our thoughts is one thing.

544
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,440
Getting back together is impossible.

545
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:21,289
I was wrong.

546
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,679
I really know I was wrong.

547
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,719
I thought you'd be like before.

548
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:31,880
Throwing a tantrum...

549
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,079
and I could just smooth over with some gentle words.

550
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,329
I admit I was wrong.

551
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:37,598
I'd rather buy a bunch of gifts...

552
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,039
than talk things out with you.

553
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,639
I disappointed you.

554
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,079
I made you feel bad.

555
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,329
Right?

556
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,639
I really know I was wrong.

557
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,039
It's too late...

558
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,159
to say that now.

559
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:55,360
No.

560
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,558
Give me another chance.

561
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,599
No way.

562
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:12,519
Do you have a new boyfriend?

563
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,769
Who is it?

564
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,119
Who?

565
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,920
Who?

566
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,639
The food delivery guy.

567
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:35,840
Who else could it be?

568
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:37,809
The food delivery guy.

569
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:47,599
It's good.

570
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,119
You've been in Hong Kong for so long...

571
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,159
and your taste hasn't changed at all.

572
00:37:56,769 --> 00:37:57,840
Hong Kong...

573
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,000
is known as a food paradise,

574
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,769
but it still can't conquer...

575
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:05,199
this unruly and carb-loving stomach of mine.

576
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,679
(Qu)

577
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,839
(Qu)

578
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,920
What do you want for dinner?

579
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,199
(I'm going to have dinner with my parents tonight.)

580
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,959
After you're done eating,

581
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
go home.

582
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:57,920
Go to a hotel then.

583
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,329
- You can't stay at my place.
- I can't.

584
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,678
I'm taking Jojo with me.

585
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,679
No hotel will keep me.

586
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,960
Jojo can stay.

587
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:08,328
You go.

588
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:09,329
That won't do.

589
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,839
If Jojo causes trouble for you tonight,

590
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
I'll be even more worried.

591
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:13,880
No.

592
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,159
Gao Peng.

593
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,199
You did it on purpose.

594
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,840
You brought Jojo back on purpose.

595
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,119
You wanted to stay here.

596
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,480
How about this, Nan Nan?

597
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,119
I'll sleep on the couch tonight.

598
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,198
I...

599
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,000
Draw a circle next to the couch.

600
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,769
I'll stay put...

601
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,079
inside that circle.

602
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,679
I swear.

603
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,239
Fine.

604
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,559
At night,

605
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,039
I'll lock my bedroom door.

606
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,679
You have to lock it.

607
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:44,809
Lock it tightly.

608
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,239
Babe.

609
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,519
All right, babe.

610
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:01,119
Stay at home with your parents.

611
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,159
Han Han.

612
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,769
This is bad.

613
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,599
Gao Peng is at my house.

614
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,288
He won't leave no matter what.

615
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:27,440
Come and save me.

616
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,880
Are you being forgetful?

617
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,519
I'm currently in Sanya.

618
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,599
If he's still pestering you,

619
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,119
just tell him that you have a new boyfriend.

620
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,599
He ran away from home.

621
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,960
He's utterly dejected.

622
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,809
If I tell him now,

623
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,920
he'll...

624
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,960
He'll be so pitiful.

625
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:52,960
Anyway, there's a lot going on.

626
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,960
It's a long story.

627
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,809
I feel so bad right now.

628
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,679
I'm so stressed out.

629
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,880
(Accusefive, Miss You Day and Night)

630
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,079
Help.

631
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,439
He's playing "Miss You Day and Night"...

632
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,518
by Accusefive...

633
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,599
in the living room.

634
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:17,809
Isn't this a memory trigger?

635
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
It's killing me.

636
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,920
I'm going to go all out

637
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,079
The fireworks in the distance grow increasingly poignant

638
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,400
Gazing at the distance before and behind me

639
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:06,840
I'll miss you day and night

640
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:35,598
(Are you back at Baiyujia Residence?)

641
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:42,880
(No, I'm staying at my parents' house tonight.)

642
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:49,039
(He Zhi Nan)

643
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,840
Round one.

644
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,719
Ready. Go.

645
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:33,239
Academic credentials.

646
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,960
Two, one, one.

647
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:38,289
Academic credentials.

648
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:40,079
Nine,

649
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:42,679
eight,

650
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
five.

651
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:46,559
Pair of three.

652
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,079
Three houses. Third-tier city.

653
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,239
One house.

654
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,280
First-tier...

655
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:56,159
city.

656
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:57,639
Pair of aces. Do you want it?

657
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,320
No.

658
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:12,679
Image five.

659
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,079
Image seven.

660
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,000
KO.

661
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,360
Round two.

662
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,400
Ready. Go.

663
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:41,679
Ladies first.

664
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:52,239
Ten Bomb.

665
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,960
Pass.

666
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,119
Academic credentials.

667
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,800
Two,

668
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:04,519
one,

669
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
one.

670
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:08,519
Pass.

671
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,599
Third-tier city.

672
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,119
Three houses.

673
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:18,960
KO.

674
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,039
This is having the will but no fate.

675
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:34,599
Round three.

676
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,239
Ready. Go.

677
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:06,679
You...

678
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,360
Are you done?

679
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,440
Ten kings.

680
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:13,159
Bomb.

681
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:16,119
Don't you have any other cards?

682
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,800
House, money, and brain.

683
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,960
I don't have any of them.

684
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:21,159
I'm so beautiful.

685
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,840
You're crazy.

686
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:30,719
Security.

687
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,000
I have a crazy person here.

688
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,920
She's abnormal.

689
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:36,078
Ma'am.

690
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,118
Playing that card alone...

691
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,199
is considered a self-destructive foul.

692
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,599
You're disqualified from the game.

693
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,840
Please leave now.

694
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:42,199
I have King Bomb.

695
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,239
I have King Bomb. Let me go!

696
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,559
I have King Bomb!

697
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,400
What a psychopath.

698
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,800
(A favourable situation)
