1
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,400
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,560
A bowl of fried rice.

4
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,079
It's good.

5
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,000
You're taking out everything. Don't you like meat?

6
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,038
What's wrong?

7
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,439
I don't know why my stomach has been throbbing lately.

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,160
It has been a few days. You should go to the hospital.

9
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,800
I can't get an appointment at any municipal hospital.

10
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,879
I'll check somewhere else.

11
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,959
- There's this private hospital. - No, don't.

12
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,119
My health insurance doesn't cover private hospitals.

13
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,360
I won't be able to afford it if it's a huge cost.

14
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,520
Never mind. The appointment is in a few days.

15
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,879
I'll put you in for now.

16
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,080
Ms. Xin.

17
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,039
Okay.

18
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,719
I'll be right there.

19
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,400
I have to work overtime.

20
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,079
A commercial for Ms. Xin's friend will start filming tomorrow.

21
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,615
There's a problem with the art team and they need me there.

22
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,878
Does your stomach not hurt anymore?

23
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,840
I'll get by with some painkillers.

24
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,199
Bye.

25
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,840
Do you have to go?

26
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,280
Be careful.

27
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,199
As for this...

28
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,919
Put it here. These roofs.

29
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,120
Check it, okay?

30
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,439
- Han Han, how's it going? - Put it here.

31
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,959
We'll be done after this batch of furniture.

32
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
- Okay. - Move the fridge to the side.

33
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,639
Yang Yang.

34
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,240
- Coming. - It wasn't this lamp before.

35
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,960
You're right. I'll change it right away.

36
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,158
Yes, make it quick.

37
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,840
- Tell them to change it. - Okay.

38
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,960
Take a break, guys.

39
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,479
Thank you.

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,800
- Ms. Zeng is here. - I brought supper.

41
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,400
- Come and eat. - Thank you, Ms. Zeng.

42
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,170
- Come on. - Wake up.

43
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,120
- Be careful. - I'm going to wash my hands.

44
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,439
Han Han, what are you doing?

45
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,399
I'm putting this on to pray for a smooth shoot.

46
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,879
- It will. Come and eat. - Okay.

47
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,170
You must be tired.

48
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,439
- Ms. Zeng. - Thank you, Ms. Zeng.

49
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,399
Come on. Wipe your hands and eat.

50
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,959
Okay.

51
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,398
- Put some over there. - Okay.

52
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,758
Come on.

53
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,839
Take a seat.

54
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,120
Why did you come in person?

55
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,479
As soon as I got off the plane, I brought over the food...

56
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,610
that was already prepared.

57
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,079
Buying food for everyone is my speciality.

58
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,360
Thank you, Ms. Zeng.

59
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,000
Han Han, come here.

60
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,610
Ms. Zeng.

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,320
This is the Sun Han Han I told you about.

62
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,840
It's all thanks to her help today.

63
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,730
Sun Han Han.

64
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,319
Thank you so much.

65
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,800
I was going to be in despair.

66
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,680
You really saved my urgent problem.

67
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,519
You're too kind, Ms. Zeng.

68
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,800
Thank you.

69
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,560
Why are your hands so cold?

70
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,170
Are you underdressed?

71
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,360
No, this is how I usually dress.

72
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,359
Girls need to take special care of their health.

73
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,759
Don't drink cold water.

74
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,610
I bought hot milk tea. Drink it.

75
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,879
Thank you.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
Have a seat and eat something.

77
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,480
Eat up. We can order more if it's not enough.

78
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
- Okay. - Thank you, Ms. Zeng.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,439
Eat. Thank you for your hard work.

80
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,440
Han Han, what do you like to eat?

81
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,560
I'll have a pizza.

82
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,600
It's still hot. Dig in.

83
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,480
- Here, Ms. Zeng. - Okay.

84
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,759
Did the set go well today?

85
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,040
- Yes. - That's a relief.

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,160
Rest assured.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,079
Your drink.

88
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,120
Lift your body up.

89
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,399
Yes, exhale forward.

90
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,120
That's right.

91
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,639
Okay, keep it up.

92
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,360
Once the test results are out,

93
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,280
the arrangement can be made with Dr. Wang.

94
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,279
- Thank you. - Okay.

95
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,120
Why are you up?

96
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,519
The doctor said you have appendicitis.

97
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,879
You need surgery.

98
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,319
Surgery?

99
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,720
Your appendix has perforated.

100
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
It has been inflamed for a long time.

101
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,295
It'll be serious if you wait any longer.

102
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,199
But my parents are out of town.

103
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,599
They won't make it here in time.

104
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,360
Can we wait for my mom before the surgery?

105
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,439
Miss, you're an adult now.

106
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,879
This illness can't wait for your mom.

107
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,759
Excuse me, I need to take this call.

108
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,279
Give me a moment.

109
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,600
Don't worry.

110
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,160
The lead surgeon, Dr. Wang,

111
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,119
is an expert doctor of the tertiary hospital.

112
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,480
Many people can't see her even if they want to.

113
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,439
She happens to be around today.

114
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,399
Given your situation,

115
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,000
you can't delay at all.

116
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,840
I still need some time.

117
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,679
Let's have the meeting later.

118
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,039
- Sun Han Han. - Okay.

119
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,759
That's all for now.

120
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,519
Mr. Zhou, have you seen Ms. Sun?

121
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,280
The operating room has been arranged but I can't find her anywhere.

122
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,400
I don't know. I was on the phone just now.

123
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,426
Why don't we split up and look for her?

124
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,559
Okay, thank you.

125
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,879
Nan Nan, where are you?

126
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,639
Can you come and keep me company?

127
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,799
I have appendicitis.

128
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,559
They said I have to get a surgery.

129
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,959
You know it.

130
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Ever since I was little,

131
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,775
I have to hold my mom's hand when I get a shot.

132
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,879
But now, I'm sure she won't make it here in time.

133
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,559
Come and keep me company.

134
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm scared.

135
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,240
It's normal to be scared of getting surgery.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,279
Why are you hiding here alone?

137
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,199
The doctor and nurses are looking for you.

138
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,960
Don't worry.

139
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,799
The doctor I got for you is very skilled.

140
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,000
You'll fall asleep after the anaesthesia.

141
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,450
When you wake up,

142
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,840
the surgery will be over.

143
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,090
Don't be scared.

144
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,039
I'm here with you.

145
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,159
Please wait outside.

146
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,456
No matter how big of a star she is,

147
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
she can't just come and go as she pleases.

148
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,879
I'm busier than she is.

149
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,400
If she wants to meet, tell her to make an appointment.

150
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,639
Nan Nan.

151
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,120
Han Han, you finally picked up.

152
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,159
I was in a meeting. Are you okay?

153
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,720
I just had the surgery.

154
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,120
I'm okay.

155
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,879
When can you come?

156
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,039
I'm meeting a client with Ms. J.

157
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,080
I'll come as soon as I'm done.

158
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,879
Come quickly and console me.

159
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Nan Nan, come another day.

160
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,559
I'm hanging up.

161
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,518
Was it your boyfriend?

162
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,759
Tell him to come quickly.

163
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,120
It's my best friend.

164
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,559
I don't have a boyfriend.

165
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,240
Have you contacted your family?

166
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,519
Not yet.

167
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,919
My mom is rather timid.

168
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,720
There's no point in making her worry.

169
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,360
I'll tell her when I'm better.

170
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,840
You're a girl navigating this world alone.

171
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,360
It's not easy.

172
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:32,039
During this time, let me take care of you.

173
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,840
I don't know...

174
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
how to thank you.

175
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,039
It's nothing. Don't thank me.

176
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,039
Don't move.

177
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,398
I'll wire the hospital bill...

178
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,639
to you later.

179
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,038
Just get well. Don't worry about this.

180
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,200
How can I do that?

181
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,840
You already saved my life.

182
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,519
I can't spend your money too.

183
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,120
If you won't take my money, I'll leave the hospital now.

184
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,840
There's no rush.

185
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,279
Let's talk about the money later.

186
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,360
Anyhow, I won't spend so much of your money for no reason.

187
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,799
Then let's find a reason...

188
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,320
for me to spend money on you.

189
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm sorry. Something came up.

190
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,720
I have to go.

191
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,439
Call me if you need anything.

192
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,600
Thank you.

193
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
You're here.

194
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,159
Coco.

195
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,960
What's the matter?

196
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,679
I was downstairs.

197
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,159
I saw Chen Shi Shi getting out of a luxury car.

198
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,559
Do you think she got herself a rich boyfriend?

199
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,039
I've seen that a few times.

200
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,960
And it's a different luxury car every time.

201
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,039
The chauffeur opened the door for her.

202
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,278
She probably doesn't need to marry into a rich family...

203
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,360
because she's rich herself.

204
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,680
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

205
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,279
She's so near. How could I tell you?

206
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,319
Then why do you think she's hiding it so well?

207
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,440
Coco.

208
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,799
Come to my office for a second.

209
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,679
Good morning, Ms. Nan.

210
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,040
It's just a small matter. How many times must I tell you?

211
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,160
Do you think you're still in school?

212
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,759
Do you need a counsellor to spoonfeed you?

213
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,240
Are you stupid or lazy?

214
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,080
Look at what you have here.

215
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,679
I've confirmed that email with Ms. J.

216
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,040
I only sent it to the client because she said it was okay.

217
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,480
Now that there's a problem, it's all my fault.

218
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,080
Does it have nothing to do with her?

219
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,759
That's too much.

220
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,759
Did you offend her in some way?

221
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,080
I deserve it.

222
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,759
I shouldn't have gossiped about that scholar.

223
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,159
But the two of them were never meant to be.

224
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,679
Why is she blaming it on me?

225
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,600
What scholar?

226
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,919
Qu Yi Peng.

227
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,640
Ms. J thought she was getting it on with him.

228
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,440
But he has been long taken.

229
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,279
Does he have a girlfriend?

230
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,918
A few days ago,

231
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,639
I went shopping with my best friend at SKP.

232
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,120
I saw him holding hands with a girl.

233
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,519
They were so close.

234
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,279
And that girl has fair skin and long legs.

235
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,559
She's really pretty. They look good together.

236
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,159
Seems like he was just playing along with Ms. J.

237
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,320
Turns out, men only like pretty girls.

238
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,519
Ms. J should know her place.

239
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,410
(Are you free this weekend?)

240
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,170
What are you looking at?

241
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,319
I'm wondering...

242
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,279
what you would look like in those heels.

243
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,890
Ms. Gu, can you help me with this invoice?

244
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,799
This month's invoices were due at noon today.

245
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,720
You'll have to wait for the next time.

246
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,839
No.

247
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,730
I'm really sorry. I was in a meeting just now.

248
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,650
I couldn't step away.

249
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,240
Please help me. Lunch break isn't over yet.

250
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,279
I'm rushing to the bank.

251
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,079
No, Ms. Gu. It's really urgent.

252
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,170
Please.

253
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,000
It's just a few thousand yuan.

254
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,759
Can't you wait for two weeks?

255
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,519
It's 3,272 yuan.

256
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,518
My family is sick. Please.

257
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,720
I just need this much money.

258
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,039
Okay?

259
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,170
Ms. Gu. Thank you.

260
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,119
Han Su.

261
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,200
- Ms. Xu. - Congratulations.

262
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,800
The Hong Kong office is very pleased with you.

263
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,010
As you know, the Hong Kong office has always been rigorous.

264
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,399
They want you to report in a week.

265
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,890
- Go and take care of the handover. - Thank you, Ms. Xu.

266
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,319
Ms. Xu.

267
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,039
In a week? That quickly?

268
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,170
Why? Is there a problem?

269
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,279
No. I'll get started right away.

270
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,318
The company will give you a relocation allowance of 20,000 yuan.

271
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,735
Go to the finance office and get the paperwork done.

272
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,890
Okay.

273
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,599
Miss, the 8cm heel you asked for will be last time in stock today.

274
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,440
- Would you like to try it? - No.

275
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,240
- I'll take this pair. - Okay.

276
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,410
My gosh, Han Su.

277
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,170
These shoes suit you so well.

278
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,799
Your aura is over the roof.

279
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,456
I've had my eyes on these shoes for a long time.

280
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,680
I finally bought them today.

281
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,889
You know, wearing these shoes on my feet,

282
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,039
I really feel different.

283
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,279
I know that feeling so well.

284
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,960
It feels so good.

285
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:43,200
I know it all too well.

286
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,559
The heels are 10cm tall.

287
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,200
You're a female warrior indeed.

288
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,159
I'll go to the ultrasound with you later.

289
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,799
The checks here are so meticulous.

290
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,599
Mr. Zhou added it especially for you yesterday.

291
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,279
He said you neglect your body too often.

292
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,170
So while you're in the hospital,

293
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,959
you should get your whole body examined.

294
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,696
You have such a handsome and attentive uncle...

295
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,960
who loves you so much.

296
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,440
We're so envious.

297
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,039
Uncle?

298
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,920
Han Han.

299
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,680
I'll come back for you later.

300
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,650
Mr. Zhou.

301
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,319
How are you?

302
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,810
Are you feeling better today?

303
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,240
Much better.

304
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
And uncle?

305
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,079
At most, you look like a cousin to me.

306
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,000
When I brought you in that day,

307
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:43,519
the situation was a mess, so I just said it without thinking.

308
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,079
Looks like I was too modest.

309
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,118
But an uncle is right.

310
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,799
Calling you my cousin sounds too intimate.

311
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,000
They would overthink it.

312
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,519
I have a contract to revise.

313
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
It's quiet here.

314
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:02,960
You don't mind, do you?

315
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,039
No.

316
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,799
I promise I'll be quiet.

317
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,799
Since our brother-in-law lost his job,

318
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,279
he has been lounging around at home.

319
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,640
All he does is ask for money.

320
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,616
The money you transferred to our sister...

321
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,039
has been all taken away by him.

322
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,079
This can't go on.

323
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,960
How about this? When I have time,

324
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,359
I'll find him a job.

325
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,240
But he's already like that.

326
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,759
He's lazy and useless.

327
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,358
Why don't you just tell her to get a divorce?

328
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,759
Divorce?

329
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,039
That's it for now.

330
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,000
Let me do it.

331
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,760
Did something happen with your family?

332
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,799
It's nothing.

333
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:29,880
It's just life.

334
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,720
Things happen every day.

335
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,240
It's fine.

336
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,880
Let's have a feast later.

337
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,039
It's my treat.

338
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,039
Did you get a bonus?

339
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,079
Just a small windfall.

340
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,519
Tell me what you want to eat.

341
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,519
Forget it.

342
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,799
Let's be frugal.

343
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,480
It's not a special occasion anyway.

344
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,880
There's something important I want to tell you.

345
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,240
What is it?

346
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,440
Do you need to buy me a meal to tell me?

347
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,959
Are you having an affair?

348
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,480
You're the one who's having an affair.

349
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
I'm treating you to a meal and you're doubting me.

350
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,920
I passed by there for a meeting today.

351
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,239
I thought about it.

352
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,759
The 10cm heel would suit you more.

353
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,519
So I bought it for you.

354
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,839
I will do...

355
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,720
what I promised you.

356
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,799
Come on, try it on.

357
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,839
Perfect.

358
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,159
Let's wear this...

359
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,519
out for dinner.

360
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,119
Let's eat at home.

361
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,358
What's wrong?

362
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,559
Nothing.

363
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,160
I just suddenly don't want to go.

364
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,959
Don't you have something important to tell me?

365
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,519
What could be so important?

366
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,640
I was just looking for an excuse to have a good meal.

367
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,560
I'll make you something delicious.

368
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,400
Where are you going in those clothes?

369
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:42,359
There's an industry banquet tonight.

370
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,799
My boss invited a client's boss.

371
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,055
It won't be good if I'm not there.

372
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,200
What client's boss?

373
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,079
To me, they're all simply money-minded businessmen.

374
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,959
You have a leave of absence.

375
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,320
If they force you to go, it's a violation of the Labor Law.

376
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,960
I can file a complaint for you.

377
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,039
No.

378
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:00,759
This is the first major client I'm in charge of.

379
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,400
It's a great project.

380
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,839
I worked so hard to get it.

381
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,616
If I don't show up at the crucial moment...

382
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,759
and other colleagues take the credit for my work,

383
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,519
I'll be the one at a loss.

384
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,880
You're working so hard at such a young age.

385
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,159
Don't forget. Your stitches are still in.

386
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,720
What if an accident happens?

387
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,119
Don't shoot yourself in the foot.

388
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,079
Mr. Zhou.

389
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,440
You don't know the hardships in life.

390
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,240
Being able to keep my face is good enough.

391
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:30,079
You know how hard it is in this industry now.

392
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,759
If I'm not there tonight,

393
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,439
my bonus will be deducted.

394
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,880
I can't afford that.

395
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,480
Health is more important.

396
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,920
I know you truly care about me.

397
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,480
Come back soon.

398
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,118
I got it.

399
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,279
One more thing.

400
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,399
I'm still worried. How about this?

401
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,480
I'll drive you there.

402
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,519
Finish your work in two hours.

403
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,839
Then I'll drive you back.

404
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,720
Most importantly,

405
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,240
don't drink alcohol.

406
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,359
Okay.

407
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,839
During the last meeting, Ms. Sun left a deep impression on me.

408
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,599
Let me toast to our talented and beautiful woman.

409
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,456
I hope our collaboration will be successful.

410
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

411
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,799
Cheers.

412
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,119
Okay. You're a good drinker.

413
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,400
Han Han, come.

414
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,200
Let me introduce you to Simon, Dacheng Group's CEO.

415
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,255
This is our new advertising creative,

416
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,319
Sun Han Han.

417
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,440
She's outstanding.

418
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,079
Hello.

419
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,640
Next, we'll go...

420
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,798
Xiao Sun.

421
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,839
Mr. Li.

422
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,078
The project you did last time for Mr. Gao was awesome.

423
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,680
It was so creative.

424
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:55,119
Find a chance to do one for our company.

425
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,799
- Bottoms up. - Thank you.

426
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,039
Hello. Are you okay?

427
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,319
Ms. Zeng.

428
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,599
You were with Xiao Xin.

429
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,839
Sun... Sun Han Han.

430
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,200
Yes. I'm Sun Han Han.

431
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,720
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

432
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,359
Why did you drink so much?

433
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,240
Actually, I didn't drink much.

434
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,759
I just had a minor surgery.

435
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,015
The stitches haven't been removed yet.

436
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:48,160
Then why did you drink? Sit down.

437
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,200
You're still on medication. You can't drink.

438
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,335
The bosses and clients are giving me face...

439
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,359
and toasting to me.

440
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,319
If I explain too much to them,

441
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,680
I'll just ruin everyone's mood.

442
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,759
I'll grit my teeth and get through it.

443
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,400
How do you feel now?

444
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,839
Do you want me to find a place for you to lay down?

445
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,240
There's no need. I'm much better now.

446
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,519
I was sweating all over earlier and had no energy.

447
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,079
Wait for me here.

448
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,799
(Uncle: Is everything going well?)

449
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,440
(Yes, don't worry.)

450
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,798
(I'll come to pick you up in half an hour.)

451
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,799
(Okay.)

452
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,598
Hold this. It's a bit hot.

453
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,640
Thank you, Ms. Zeng.

454
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,880
I think you're just weak after the surgery.

455
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,200
This is ginseng tea. Drink it while it's hot.

456
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,400
Thank you.

457
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,039
You're not feeling well,

458
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,400
but you're still carrying on and drinking with clients.

459
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,920
I did these things a lot when I was young.

460
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,799
I'm much better now, Ms. Zeng.

461
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,319
You should get more rest.

462
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,759
Hello, dear.

463
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,759
Something happened to my car today.

464
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,319
Can you come and pick me up?

465
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,440
(I'm almost done here.)

466
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,039
Sun Han Han.

467
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,278
Ms. Zeng.

468
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,519
Are you feeling better?

469
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,920
Much better. Are you leaving?

470
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,680
My husband is picking me up.

471
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,600
How are you leaving? Do you need a ride?

472
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,295
No, it's okay. My friend is picking me up.

473
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,400
He should be here soon.

474
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,400
That's good.

475
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,359
Hello, sir. You can't park here.

476
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,255
Just five minutes. I'm picking someone up.

477
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,279
Okay, sir.

478
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,679
You don't have to see me off.

479
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,241
My friend should be here soon. I'll wait for him outside.

480
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,880
Thank you.

481
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,240
Dear.

482
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,400
I'll get going then.

483
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,559
- Bye, Ms. Zeng. - Bye.

484
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,360
- Let's go. - Okay.

485
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,809
You two...

486
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,480
Nothing happened between you two, right?

487
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,079
Please.

488
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,960
I'm already disembowelled.

489
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,480
What else can happen?

490
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,039
What about a kiss...

491
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:54,329
or a hug?

492
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,440
He didn't even lay a finger on me.

493
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,599
I'm relieved then.

494
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:08,880
What do you think that man wants from you?

495
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:11,519
Why is he so nice to you?

496
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:19,809
I know.

497
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,880
He wants to lure you in with these small favours,

498
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,639
so that you can't untangle yourself from him.

499
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,880
In the end, you'll throw yourself at him.

500
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,840
Zeng Cheng is such a strong woman.

501
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:37,159
Why would she fall for such a hypocrite?

502
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,960
She even thinks he's a treasure.

503
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:41,519
She called him "dear" so sweetly.

504
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:43,360
I feel so wronged to her.

505
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,600
Let's leave the hospital now.

506
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,000
I have my limits.

507
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,439
Since he has crossed the line,

508
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,920
I have to cut all ties with him.

509
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,840
Your stitches are still in.

510
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,559
I can get them removed.

511
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,999
I don't want to see him for the rest of my life.

512
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,879
I'm going to delete him from my life...

513
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,329
and block him.

514
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,639
I don't need his little favours.

515
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,440
It's just a hospital bill.

516
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:08,920
Who is he looking down on?

517
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,239
Mr. Zhou has left a deposit.

518
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:13,360
There's no need to pay.

519
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,000
I don't need Mr. Zhou's money.

520
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,960
Just give me the bill. I'll pay for it now.

521
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,199
Okay, please wait.

522
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:20,519
That's a lot of money. Why bother?

523
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,559
I can't take advantage of him.

524
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,678
Besides, I have to do something...

525
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,039
to let him know how angry I am.

526
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:28,440
You're right.

527
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,198
We can't be underestimated.

528
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,329
We have our dignity too.

529
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,879
After the discount, it will be 59,180 yuan.

530
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,199
Will you pay by transfer or card?

531
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:46,809
- Please wait a moment. - Okay.

532
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,440
I'll wire the money to you.

533
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:56,880
It's okay.

534
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,558
This bill is too expensive.

535
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,639
I can't afford it.

536
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,719
We can't leave like this either.

537
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,639
I didn't ask for this hospital.

538
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,560
I told him I'd leave after the surgery.

539
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,359
He insisted that I stay for a few more days.

540
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,679
He was the one with motives.

541
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,519
Shouldn't he pay a price?

542
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:29,159
Hello. I'll pay with Mr. Zhou's deposit.

543
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,809
No problem. Mr. Zhou just has to come to sign it.

544
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Thank you.

545
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,599
I was deceived.

546
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,440
I was deceived so completely.

547
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,199
So badly that I can't completely call him a liar.

548
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,769
What did he lie about?

549
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:49,289
He didn't even lay a finger on me.

550
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,640
From the beginning to the end,

551
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,880
I was the one who thought too much.

552
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,599
In the end, he's just a scumbag.

553
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,519
He didn't make it clear that he has a wife...

554
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,559
and flirted with another girl.

555
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,079
He has ulterior motives.

556
00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:05,840
That's right.

557
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,159
Men are so scary.

558
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
By the way,

559
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,289
what about your scholar?

560
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:16,519
How is it going with you two?

561
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,519
I blocked him.

562
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,199
He has a girlfriend.

563
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,199
He has a girlfriend?

564
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:25,920
How did you know?

565
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,559
Someone saw them, of course.

566
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,159
I'm blessed to find out early.

567
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,360
Are you okay?

568
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,400
Don't you think it's good?

569
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:43,920
This is God's blessing to us,

570
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,480
stopping us...

571
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,080
and cutting our losses in time.

572
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,639
Let's sleep.

573
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,239
The food will be ready soon.

574
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,769
Have you talked to Qu Yi Peng about your transfer to Hong Kong?

575
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:39,329
I don't know how to tell him.

576
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,119
There have been times...

577
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:47,199
when I had the urge to just break up with him.

578
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,719
I think he had a hunch too.

579
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,679
As if...

580
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,920
we had both been waiting for this day...

581
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:56,239
and were afraid of it at the same time.

582
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,440
You're just reluctant to be the one who initiates the breakup.

583
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,199
You want to take advantage of that little morality.

584
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:06,000
You don't have to be so blunt.

585
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:11,000
I was like you when I was young.

586
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:12,400
I wanted to be strong...

587
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,960
and got myself a strong man.

588
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,159
It was a lot of pressure to the man.

589
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:19,769
Do women have to suffer...

590
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,639
just because she's strong?

591
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:24,679
Actually, you don't have to suffer.

592
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:27,159
I figured something out.

593
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,239
Women find strong men...

594
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,880
because they are weak.

595
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,719
Basically, it's for survival.

596
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,960
But if the woman is confident,

597
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:39,678
why do they want the man to be better?

598
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,119
Food is ready.

599
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,360
- Food is ready. - Coming.

600
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,079
Don't think anymore. Come and eat.

601
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,400
Thank you.

602
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,400
Eat up.

603
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,809
Don't lose your appetite because of me.

604
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,519
But let me tell you.

605
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,360
You can't always be strong.

606
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:10,519
Only when you are truly strong inside...

607
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,519
can you show your weakness...

608
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,079
in front of a man without any burden.

609
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:16,809
Give me a break.

610
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,719
I'm not as strong as you.

611
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,360
Right now,

612
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
I don't have the courage to break up with him.

613
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:31,000
Nor the courage to continue being with him.

614
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,519
I can't step back or move forward.

615
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:35,519
What should I do?

616
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,799
Let him be the one to say it.

617
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,760
Going to Hong Kong and breaking up are two different things.

618
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,360
If he really loves you,

619
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,239
he'll make his intention clear to you.

620
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:47,480
Forget about Hong Kong.

621
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,400
Be it America or Europe,

622
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:52,159
time and distance are not the real problem.

623
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,719
The real problem is determination.

624
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:58,199
The only thing that can defeat love...

625
00:41:58,809 --> 00:41:59,840
is not enough love.

626
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:14,159
You don't have special features.

627
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:15,769
And you don't have the right accent.

628
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,679
You should go back to your double major.

629
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,920
Okay, go.

630
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,119
Thank you, Director.

631
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,480
Hello, Director. Look at me.

632
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,960
(Lies and acting in love)

633
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,079
Our only requirement is good acting.

634
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,559
I'm a good actor.

635
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,880
I fooled eight men.

636
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:38,119
At my best, I dated two at the same time.

637
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,809
Director, look at mine.

638
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,039
Look at mine.

639
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,679
You? You want a try too?

640
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,000
Yes, of course.

641
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:46,239
But...

642
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:49,239
But I've never deceived a woman.

643
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:50,769
I...

644
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,919
I gave my all in every relationship.

645
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,360
I truly loved them.

646
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:57,559
But in the end, they all abandoned me.

647
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,199
Okay, you do it.

648
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
On what grounds?

649
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:05,719
In love,

650
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,639
men are naturally better actors than women.

651
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,840
You have to admit that fact.

652
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,440
Thank you, Director.
