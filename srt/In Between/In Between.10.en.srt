1
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,799
Hey, Sophie.

4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,239
Get in the car.

5
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,480
Okay.

6
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,639
I heard you have been unwell
since returning from Jiangzhou.

7
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,879
Judging by your complexion,
you don't seem fully recovered.

8
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,810
I had a cold.

9
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,919
I rested for two days
and feel much better now.

10
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,599
It seems like
it's more than just a cold.

11
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,240
Is it something emotional?

12
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,240
If it's too personal,

13
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,919
feel free not to answer.

14
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,090
I went back to Jiangzhou
and broke up with my boyfriend.

15
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,680
It seems
he's only worth a cold after all.

16
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,719
Well, half a cold.

17
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,878
The other half came
from being chilled on the plane.

18
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,120
It was too cold on the plane.

19
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
You know what?

20
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,799
Women who join our law firm...

21
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,479
usually break up pretty quickly,

22
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,560
but you seem to have set
a new record.

23
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,360
So does the firm offer
special compensation for that?

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,719
Usually, it's just a meal treat.

25
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,319
Because women like that
tend to get promoted the fastest.

26
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,319
I hope your words come true.

27
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,439
You know what?

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
We have an unwritten rule
at the firm...

29
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,719
to encourage everyone.

30
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,759
Even a first-year lawyer...

31
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,599
can have the chance...

32
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,039
to lead a project...

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,439
if they successfully land a client.

34
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,039
Sadly,

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,319
this rule hasn't been
put into practice yet...

36
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,319
since it's quite challenging
for newbies to bring in clients.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,079
I remember it took me...

38
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,919
around 13 months
after joining the firm...

39
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,759
to land my first client.

40
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:44,080
Do you want to see
if you can break my record?

41
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,520
Don't drink alone.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,079
By the way,

43
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,679
about the guy you told me about...

44
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,560
who studied abroad with you,

45
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,839
is his company
planning to go public?

46
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,050
He just took over
his family's company...

47
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,278
and has been troubled
by the IPO preparations lately.

48
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,319
Really?

49
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,730
Then could you
introduce us to each other?

50
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,800
The determination of single women
is just impressive.

51
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,759
I wonder who said last time...

52
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,480
that I shouldn't be so eager...

53
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,050
and that she wasn't in that mindset.

54
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,120
Sorry, but you've
really misunderstood.

55
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,730
At this stage,

56
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,759
I have to be extremely proactive...

57
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,519
in seeking out my clients.

58
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,519
It's way more important
to me than dating.

59
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,610
What a coincidence.

60
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,879
He asked me a couple of days ago
about the company's IPO...

61
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,279
and wanted me
to help him find a law firm.

62
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,399
Could you do me a favour...

63
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,680
and exaggerate a little
by praising me in front of him?

64
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,959
Don't worry about that.

65
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,079
Can you tell me
the name of his company?

66
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,360
I'll look into it.

67
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,759
Take it easy.

68
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,730
It's your first time meeting him.

69
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,199
Being professional is secondary.

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
Most importantly,

71
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,279
you have to be friends
with Gao Peng...

72
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,639
and make him...

73
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,439
interested in you.

74
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,319
To me,

75
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
neither of these is a challenge.

76
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,040
Welcome.

77
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,319
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,438
There was a traffic jam.

79
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,518
- I'm late.
- It's okay.

80
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,560
Let me introduce you.

81
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,079
This is Gao Peng,
Hengliyan's new CEO.

82
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,000
This is Han Su
from Yingtian Law Firm.

83
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Hello.

84
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:44,439
Hello, I'm Han Su.

85
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,160
Normally, at your age,

86
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,800
ovarian function would decrease.

87
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,279
However, your main issue
isn't with the ovaries.

88
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,519
The primary concern
is your retroverted uterus,

89
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,240
which makes
natural conception challenging.

90
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
So...

91
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,319
would in vitro fertilization
be an option?

92
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,639
Modern assisted
reproductive technologies...

93
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,959
are fairly mature.

94
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,920
However, the process
can be quite difficult.

95
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,198
You would need to take
ovarian stimulation injections...

96
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,199
for a while...

97
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,079
and then we'll retrieve...

98
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,560
10 to 20 eggs at once
from your body.

99
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,480
After combining them with sperm,

100
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,800
they would be implanted
back into your body.

101
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,958
The chance of the fertilized egg
surviving in the body...

102
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,000
is between 20 percent...

103
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,759
to 50 percent.

104
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,439
If it fails
and you want to try again,

105
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,120
there's a risk of needing
a dilation and curettage,

106
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,560
which is harmful to your body.

107
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
All right. Don't be sad.

108
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,680
At worst, we won't have children.

109
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,199
We've been doing pretty well
all these years, haven't we?

110
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,480
But you said...

111
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,879
you wanted it.

112
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,759
It has been so many years.

113
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,480
Haven't I accepted it?

114
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,960
But you love kids.

115
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,210
That day,

116
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,399
you were so happy...

117
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,879
and excited.

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,039
In order to get pregnant,

119
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,120
you have to go through
so much pain and suffering.

120
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Forget it.

121
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,759
I'm not afraid of suffering.

122
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,840
I just feel a sense of injustice.

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,279
Why?

124
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,279
Didn't you say
you didn't want children?

125
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,039
Not wanting them is my choice,

126
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,840
but I can't accept...

127
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,450
not being able to have them.

128
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,799
All right.

129
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,210
This isn't like
working on a project...

130
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,330
where you can just grit your teeth
and get through it.

131
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,090
It's in vitro fertilization.

132
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,279
You heard the doctor, right?

133
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,519
If things go wrong,

134
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,120
it could really harm your body.

135
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,639
This is a lifelong matter.

136
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,399
Let's think about it
some more, shall we?

137
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,799
Let's discuss when we get back.

138
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,879
Why are you suddenly listening
to this kind of song?

139
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,480
Lately, a few of the young folks
at the company...

140
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
have been making fun of me
for listening to classical music.

141
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,919
I think I should catch up a bit.

142
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,559
Otherwise,

143
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
I'll be too disconnected
from the lives of young people.

144
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,000
But I still don't understand...

145
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,330
what's so great
about this kind of music.

146
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,039
Dear.

147
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,210
I've decided...

148
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,639
to go through with the IVF.

149
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,279
Do you want to reconsider?

150
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,679
I've made up my mind.

151
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,799
You know that...

152
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,360
whatever you decide,

153
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,480
I'll always support you.

154
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,519
I know.

155
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,039
That's why I made this decision.

156
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Ms. Xin.

157
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,200
What's wrong with Ms. Zeng?

158
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,559
What do you mean?

159
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,200
I wanted to deliver
the reference materials to her,

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
but I saw her crying.

161
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,919
Don't pry into the boss's affairs.

162
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,679
Don't you think
she looks worn out lately?

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,080
She seems to be aging a bit.

164
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,840
She's just too tough.

165
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,600
There's a saying that goes,

166
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,360
the more someone lacks something,

167
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,759
the more they desire it.

168
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,719
Ms. Zeng seems perfect
and all-capable...

169
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,440
in front of everyone.

170
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,720
Could she be
quite lacking in private?

171
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
It's possible.

172
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,080
You should really talk to her.

173
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,039
She needs to face
the reality of life.

174
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,639
Han Han.

175
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,159
Have you lost your mind?

176
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,320
You've been acting strange lately.

177
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,720
You always appear...

178
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,279
as if you want...

179
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,039
to show off...

180
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,600
or challenge someone.

181
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,200
What are you talking about?

182
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,720
I've been observing you for days.

183
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,080
Are you in a new relationship?

184
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,000
I knew it.

185
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,519
It's the early-stage love syndrome.

186
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,399
What syndrome?

187
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,639
It means that when a woman
enters a new relationship,

188
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,080
it's normal for her brain
to short-circuit.

189
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,678
Hormones fluctuate.

190
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,759
It's a matter of regulation.

191
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,120
I don't have it.

192
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,399
You do.

193
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,399
Sun Han Han.

194
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,798
You said you found
a reference advertisement.

195
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,878
Play it for me.

196
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,919
Okay.

197
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,039
(Zhou Zhou: Are you off work?
Let's have dinner together tonight.)

198
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,320
Zhou Zhou, I'm still at the office.

199
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,679
I think I'll be late tonight.

200
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,559
Don't wait for me.

201
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,719
(Doupi)

203
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,200
- It's not spicy, right?
- It's not spicy.

204
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,559
What are you so happy about?

205
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm wondering...

206
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,039
what is the difference...

207
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,840
between this bowl of noodles
that costs 13 yuan...

208
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,440
and that white truffle...

209
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,159
that costs 3,000 yuan per gram.

210
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,320
Why are you thinking about that?

211
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,759
Let me tell you.

212
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,840
The girl
in the workstation next to me...

213
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,799
is the daughter
of a real estate tycoon.

214
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,000
She kept her identity hidden
when she first joined the company.

215
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,519
After we became close,
she finally confided in me.

216
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,600
The daughter
of a real estate tycoon...

217
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,879
is in this building...

218
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,960
and the company she works for
as a secretary...

219
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,159
has close business ties with ours.

220
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,080
Now that she's leaving,
she invited me to her home.

221
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,678
I can truly experience...

222
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,720
what it means...

223
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,320
for poverty
to limit one's imagination.

224
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,360
I grabbed a jar of something...

225
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,840
that looked like
pickled vegetables...

226
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,559
and tasted a small bite.

227
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,720
I only tried a small bite.

228
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,000
Honestly, I didn't
even find it that tasty.

229
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,799
She told me later
that it was white truffle.

230
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,320
It's sold by the gram...

231
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,559
and that one bite cost thousands.

232
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,039
I didn't even have time
to savor it properly.

233
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,240
They're from your neighbour
from across the hallway.

234
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,440
Look at her.

235
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,159
She has just started working...

236
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,720
and instead of
saving up while she can,

237
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,320
she's spending carelessly.

238
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,000
No.

239
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,679
No matter how modest you are,

240
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,200
you're not poor.

241
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,360
Besides,

242
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,440
someone like her wouldn't pick
just anyone to be her friend.

243
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,759
Thankfully, she thinks highly of me.

244
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,879
The rich girl...

245
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,439
has been slacking off
at work for months...

246
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
and now she's tired of it.

247
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,600
She's off to Tahiti
for a vacation to recharge.

248
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,279
Seeing the sea too much gets boring,

249
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,758
but the little cabin
I booked by the shore...

250
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,759
is quite comfortable.

251
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,320
Let me show you.

252
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Here.

253
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,320
It's so pretty.

254
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,039
- Right?
- It looks so comfortable.

255
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,399
Can you send me these photos?

256
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,839
My mom loves using these pictures
as her profile photo.

257
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,319
Okay, I'll send them to you.

258
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,890
My soul has taken a huge hit.

259
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,039
Seriously?

260
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,359
Let me show you.

261
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,170
It's quite shocking.

262
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,559
(The Frog Prince)

263
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,199
(The Frog Prince)

264
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,279
Mirror on the wall.

265
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,599
Is that you?

266
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,920
It's me.

267
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,960
I have a question for you.

268
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Go ahead.

269
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,759
How can I become a prince?

270
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,650
Travel through the deep valleys,

271
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,200
defeat the wicked dragon,

272
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,649
and save the sleeping princess.

273
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,839
No.

274
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,359
It's too dangerous.

275
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
Then call your seven brothers...

276
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,410
to go mining
in the mountains together.

277
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,598
You might find a princess
as white as snow.

278
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,720
No.

279
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,000
It's too troublesome.

280
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,838
Then continue being a frog,

281
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,650
sitting by the well
until a real princess kisses you.

282
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,599
That's a good idea.

283
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,240
Mirror on the wall.

284
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,319
Why didn't it turn into a prince?

285
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,890
Because she's not a real princess.

286
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,039
Remember.

287
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,079
If you want to be a prince,

288
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,410
you have to find a real princess.

289
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
I'll go outside for a while.

290
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,039
Hey.

291
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,279
Here's the thing.

292
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,479
I have two discount vouchers...

293
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,599
for Western cuisine
that a client gave me.

294
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,359
I wonder if you're free.

295
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:46,799
Sure.

296
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,559
I'll send you the address later.

297
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,480
So all this trouble...

298
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,440
was just to ask me about He Zhi Nan?

299
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,839
It's a favour from someone.

300
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,650
Well, she was indeed hired by me.

301
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,799
She graduated
from a regular university.

302
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,720
After three years, she's still
in the secretary position.

303
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,119
The good thing is
she lacks ambition,

304
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,240
has a kind heart,

305
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,359
and her work is reliable.

306
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,279
What does your friend see in her?

307
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,890
To me,
she looks cute at first glance,

308
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,960
but if you look at her closely,
she's just average.

309
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,119
Her youth is her only advantage.

310
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,799
By the way,
what's her family background like?

311
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,439
Don't tell me
your friend thought that...

312
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,518
just because she wears nice clothes,

313
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,839
carries expensive bags,

314
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
lives in a good neighbourhood,

315
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,039
and owns her own home,

316
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,519
she must be a rich girl.

317
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,000
That's really short-sighted.

318
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,359
She's so-so in every way,

319
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:53,799
but she's very lucky.

320
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,920
She has a boyfriend
she has been dating for years...

321
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,640
and I've heard he's well-off.

322
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,359
Maybe she feels
a certain sense of superiority...

323
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,440
just because someone buys her gifts.

324
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,079
I think you should advise
your friend to leave her alone.

325
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
I see.

326
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,359
I should talk to my friend then.

327
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,240
A girl like that
is not worth pursuing.

328
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,799
Here.

329
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,839
I heard that a rich heiress
has joined your company.

330
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,559
Is she a secretary now?

331
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,640
You're asking the right person.

332
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,880
I was the one
who dealt with this matter.

333
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,559
Apart from the boss,

334
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,200
I'm the only one
who knows about her.

335
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,839
She's truly a real-life princess.

336
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,119
However, after a few months,

337
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,640
she thought the ordinary life
was tedious...

338
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,039
and chose to leave.

339
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,000
Don't you have an appointment later?

340
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,759
You don't have to see me off.

341
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
I can make it.

342
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,279
Collect electrical devices...

343
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,479
Collect...

344
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,000
Collect...

345
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,680
By the way,

346
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,039
isn't your family local?

347
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,160
Why do you only have
this one property?

348
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,400
Do you think all locals
are from relocated families?

349
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
This house was assigned to us
by my dad's workplace.

350
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
It's even older than I am.

351
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,759
My dad is a section leader
and my mom is a supervisor.

352
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:41,359
They saved for years to buy me
a unit in Baiyujia Residence.

353
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,279
Time is a bit tight.

354
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,480
I won't see you up.

355
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,240
Just go up and sit for a while.

356
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,200
I'm in a hurry.

357
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,920
Remember to pick me up tomorrow.

358
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,519
I'm leaving.

359
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,279
Take them down first.

360
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,720
That's the rich kid they mentioned?

361
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,880
I saw a chauffeur pick her up...

362
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,079
and open the door for her.

363
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,599
Hello.

364
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:26,799
I'm Qu Yi Peng.

365
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,799
It has been a while.

366
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,038
Are the customs officers here?

367
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,078
Yes.

368
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,118
They arrived this afternoon.

369
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,200
Stay close.

370
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,240
Be careful.

371
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,200
Here, sir.

372
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
This is...

373
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:06,519
Yes.

374
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,880
Hello, Zhou Zhou.

375
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,359
Are you off work?

376
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,680
Not yet.

377
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,318
What day is it today?

378
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,358
Friday.

379
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,399
Speed up the work.

380
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,960
- There's not much time left.
- Okay.

381
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
I'm sorry, Zhou Zhou.

382
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,200
I thought tomorrow was Friday.

383
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,880
I'm at the convention centre
and I can't leave either.

384
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,359
I even canceled my business trip
for this dinner.

385
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,359
Why don't we reschedule it
to next week?

386
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,439
Ms. Zeng is treating everyone
to pizza.

387
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Eat up, everyone.

388
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,559
We have to work after this.

389
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,039
- Thank you, Ms. Zeng.
- Thank you, Ms. Zeng.

390
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,118
We've been too busy lately.

391
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,319
It must be hard for everyone.

392
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,799
It's fine.

393
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
It's fine.

394
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,119
You're fine,

395
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,518
but your boyfriends
and girlfriends...

396
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,720
should be protesting, right?

397
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,318
Ms. Zeng,
we've been single since birth.

398
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,319
It doesn't matter.

399
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,839
- We're still single.
- We're still single.

400
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,758
Han Han.

401
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:35,838
You're so pretty.

402
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,920
Are you single too?

403
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,440
She's in love.

404
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,838
You can tell by just seeing
how she frequently sneaks out...

405
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:43,920
to make calls.

406
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,839
Han Han, are you dating someone?

407
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,720
Han Han, when did this start?

408
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Tell us.

409
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:50,799
What does your boyfriend do?

410
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:53,759
He's in law.

411
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,079
A lawyer.

412
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,279
Lawyers are good.

413
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,319
Lawyers are rich.

414
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,000
Not necessarily.

415
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,799
That's right.

416
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,119
Ms. Zeng has the most say.

417
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,880
Back then, Mr. Zhou...

418
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,240
was gradually promoted...

419
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,480
to a senior partner by Mr. Zeng.

420
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
Right, Ms. Zeng?

421
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,599
During those years, I often helped
clients negotiate endorsements.

422
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,839
I also knew a lot of celebrities.

423
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,038
Back then,

424
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,959
the laws related to the film
and entertainment industry...

425
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,039
were just starting to develop.

426
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,119
Many film companies
and celebrities...

427
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,480
we're at a loss...

428
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,519
when they encountered
legal disputes.

429
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,119
I happened to introduce them
to Zhou Bin.

430
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,440
He built his reputation
on several significant cases...

431
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,279
and subsequently opened
his own law firm.

432
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:36,279
No wonder Mr. Zhou
is so obedient to you.

433
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,519
He wouldn't be
where he is today without you.

434
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,400
We're just lucky.

435
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,639
Ms. Zeng.

436
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,519
Do you know
what I admire most about you?

437
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
It's your keen eye for things.

438
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,640
You're spot on
with business opportunities,

439
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,920
you choose great food,

440
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
you judge people accurately,

441
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,279
and more importantly,

442
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,000
you have a knack
for choosing the right husband.

443
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,359
Yes, why not share some
of your insights with us, Ms. Zeng?

444
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,480
- Right.
- Tell us.

445
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:06,240
Honestly, I never considered
the idea of gambling on love.

446
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,519
Being in a relationship
is quite simple.

447
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,599
It's all about being sincere
with one another.

448
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,640
I remember
when we first started dating,

449
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,680
I wanted to prove
I was a good partner,

450
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,680
so I bravely offered
to cook him a big meal.

451
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,359
I didn't expect to cut my hand
while doing it.

452
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
My husband,

453
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,319
who was still
my boyfriend back then,

454
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,960
rushed over right away.

455
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,920
I'll never forget...

456
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,839
the look of worry and concern
on his face at that time.

457
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,640
Now, over a decade has passed...

458
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,400
and he has never asked me
to cook for him again.

459
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,119
He's so sweet.

460
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,920
Yes.

461
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,118
That's so blissful.

462
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,240
That's so sweet.

463
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,160
All right. That's enough.

464
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,839
I've told you my story.

465
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,400
Can you guys
please focus on eating the pizza?

466
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,400
I'll never forget...

467
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,240
the look of worry and concern
on his face at that time.

468
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,839
Zhou Zhou.

469
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,519
I was all set to leave work today,

470
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,959
but then the client suddenly came...

471
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,358
and requested some changes.

472
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,639
I had to change it on the spot.

473
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,400
- I'm sorry.
- You haven't eaten, right?

474
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,839
I'll heat up the food for you.

475
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,559
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

476
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,440
It's not easy for us
to go on a date.

477
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,400
It should be your priority
on the schedule.

478
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,240
In the past, I've always been
the one waiting for your schedule.

479
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,680
Today is an unexpected situation.

480
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:13,880
I'm sorry.

481
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,799
I turned down
an invitation to dinner...

482
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,920
from a big agent
and a big star for you,

483
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,000
but you're making me...

484
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,880
wait all night...

485
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,200
just to revise
a crappy presentation.

486
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,480
My presentation is crappy...

487
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,920
while your dinner invitation
is something superior.

488
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,239
We're all just doing our jobs.

489
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,519
Why is your work important
and mine isn't?

490
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,078
You work yourself to the bone.

491
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,079
How much can you make?

492
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,919
How about you quit your job?

493
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,960
I'll pay you.

494
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,720
Are you suggesting that...

495
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,839
I should be your doll,

496
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,199
always on call,

497
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,160
with the only job
being to please you?

498
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Don't exaggerate, okay?

499
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,759
I'm talking about work.

500
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,079
I'm talking about
the cost-effectiveness of the job.

501
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,159
What you just mentioned
is an emotional value judgment...

502
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,240
which is not the same.

503
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,359
I'm just worried about you.

504
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,599
I'm worried that
you'll wear yourself out.

505
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
I really miss you...

506
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,079
tonight.

507
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,720
I'll never be your doll.

508
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,719
I can't be available
at your beck and call,

509
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,758
not working every day,

510
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,160
and just thinking
about how to please you.

511
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,959
When are you
and Zeng Cheng going to...

512
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,039
Don't worry.

513
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,880
Very soon. Really.

514
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,880
How soon is very soon?

515
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,400
Three months.

516
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Just three months.

517
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,559
I promise.

518
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
I'll take care of everything.

519
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,799
Don't lie to me.

520
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,000
Nan Nan,
do you want to soak your feet?

521
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,519
No, Mom. I just took a shower.

522
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
(Qu)

523
00:34:42,361 --> 00:34:43,518
(I miss you, babe.)

524
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,599
(What are you doing?)

525
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:53,808
Hello.

526
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:55,719
The number you've dialded is busy.

527
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,239
Please try again later.

528
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,809
(Qu: I'm busy.)

529
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,639
Let's go and eat.

530
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,880
Let's go.

531
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,238
(I know. Take care of yourself.
Babe, are you off work?)

532
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,598
(I saw a new restaurant online.
When are we going together?)

533
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,639
(Reply, please!)

534
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,639
(Yi Peng,
I don't know what's wrong...)

535
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,809
Writing an essay again?

536
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,840
You did the same thing to Gao Peng.

537
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:48,329
Did it work?

538
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,159
(Qu)

539
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,880
You should go.

540
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,079
You should go.

541
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,559
No, you should go.

542
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,719
Go to his office
and ask him in person.

543
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,960
See what he's up to.

544
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,480
Otherwise, if this continues,

545
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,119
the ones suffering
will be both, you...

546
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:43,360
and me.

547
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,920
The rich girl...

548
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:55,329
has been slacking off
at work for months...

549
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,769
and now she's tired of it.

550
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,329
She's off to Tahiti
for a vacation to recharge.

551
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:02,960
I'd like to inquire
about the Tahitian agency.

552
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:07,880
Go ahead.

553
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:25,000
(Yinzhongda Capital)

554
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:30,719
Hello, is Qu Yi Peng here?

555
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,920
He just left.

556
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,809
He's not replying to my messages.

557
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,519
He's not answering my calls either.

558
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,880
He just disappeared.

559
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,769
Did I do something wrong?

560
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,400
Is he giving me
the silent treatment?

561
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:55,400
I don't want to be
in this kind of relationship.

562
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,039
This is the last time.

563
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,239
I'll give him one last chance.

564
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:04,159
If he replies to me within 24 hours,

565
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,159
I'll let bygones be bygones.

566
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,920
Wake up, He Zhi Nan.

567
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:21,769
He Zhi Nan.

568
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:24,360
Your attendance wage
will be deducted.

569
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,960
He Zhi Nan.

570
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,440
He Zhi Nan.

571
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,079
Do you really believe
that he's working overtime?

572
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:47,809
Does he have a terminal illness?

573
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,440
He doesn't want to drag me down.

574
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,000
The code of conduct
between adult men and women.

575
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,039
If they don't reply
to your messages,

576
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
either they're dead...

577
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,440
or they just don't want
to deal with you.

578
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,719
Stop looking at it.

579
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,920
If he can't even be bothered
to reply to messages,

580
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,769
how could he possibly
update his social media?

581
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:17,519
If it weren't for these photos,

582
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:20,360
I'd almost doubt it.

583
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,440
Did Qu Yi Peng really exist?

584
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:30,360
He disappears without a trace
before anything even happens.

585
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,329
Men like this are a definite no-go.

586
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,880
There's nothing you can do.

587
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,119
He doesn't belong to you.

588
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,769
Did you forget about that jerk
from the forum?

589
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,079
You sent him thousands of messages,
but he never responded.

590
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,199
Are you really that foolish?

591
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,880
I was only 18 back then.

592
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,400
You're 26 now.

593
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,239
Haven't you made any progress?

594
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,400
Haven't you learned to be strong?

595
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:12,079
Can't you face reality?

596
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,959
Come on. Everyone, follow me.

597
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
This way.

598
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:49,879
For today's itinerary,

599
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,920
we'll fly to Tokyo for a layover.

600
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,440
After that, we'll go to Papeete.

601
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,000
Then we'll fly to Julia Island.

602
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,679
Lastly, we'll see later.

603
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,519
After that, we'll arrive at...

604
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,719
Tahiti, a place famously referred
to as the paradise on Earth.

605
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,519
Now, we can take a look
at our flight information here.

606
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,639
This side shows...

607
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,400
the departure information
for our international flights...

608
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:11,809
and here's the first flight
we will be boarding shortly.

609
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:13,678
Okay, once you're here,

610
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,638
make sure to protect
your belongings.

611
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,718
If anything happens,

612
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,920
feel free to communicate
with me promptly.

613
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,079
Okay. Let's keep moving forward.

614
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:47,159
(Hong Kong)

615
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,559
Hello, Mr. Gao.

616
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,559
There's an office space over there.

617
00:41:58,289 --> 00:41:59,440
This is a meeting room.

618
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,769
There are also
two conference rooms here.

619
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,039
By the way,

620
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,199
you asked me
to find two influencers...

621
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,329
for promotional purposes
the other day.

622
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,559
I've contacted them for you.

623
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,078
When you're free, I'll ask them
to come for an interview.

624
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:12,158
Sure.

625
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,328
As long as
they have enough followers...

626
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:14,360
and are active.

627
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:15,840
They have a lot of followers.

628
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,079
Look.

629
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,840
Mr. Gao, you can follow them
and observe in secret first.

630
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,559
Yes, observe them first.

631
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:24,880
Come, Su Su. Have a seat.

632
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,239
Weibo...

633
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:31,329
Well,

634
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:33,078
I haven't used Weibo
for a long time.

635
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:34,808
Look at this.
What verification code?

636
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:35,809
Do it for me.

637
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:39,159
It's time to eat.

638
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
It's time to eat.

639
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,480
Are you not eating?

640
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:47,599
Here.

641
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:52,960
This account has been
sending you direct messages.

642
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
Is it good?

643
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,719
It has no profile picture.

644
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,159
Whose account is it?

645
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,480
"Yi Loves Zhi Nan."

646
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,159
This is He Zhi Nan's account, right?

647
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:24,639
Give it to me.

648
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:29,769
Are you looking for Yi Peng?

649
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:32,079
I know you.

650
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:33,199
Su Su.

651
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:36,880
Give it to me.

652
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:39,559
Give it to me. Hurry up.

653
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,360
Didn't you break up
with her long ago?

654
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,440
We made up.

655
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,960
I have something to do today.

656
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,519
I have to go back first.

657
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:18,559
Mr. Gao.

658
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,960
Can you give me a ride?
