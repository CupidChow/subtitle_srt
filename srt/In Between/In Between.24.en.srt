00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 24)

3
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,438
It's Member's Day and a holiday.

4
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,000
Why don't you hire more people?

5
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,878
Hiring people costs money.
Are you going to pay for it?

6
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,120
No money to hire people?

7
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,438
If so, ask your friends for help.

8
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,879
Aren't you one of them?

9
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,198
Didn't they have a fight?

10
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,400
Do you need help?

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,159
Han Su, why are you here?

12
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,638
I saw your post on Moments.

13
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,809
Change it to the circus series.

14
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,479
- Okay.
- It's so cute.

15
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,719
Thank you for coming.

16
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,809
Here.

17
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,090
Is it crowded inside?

18
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,280
It seems okay today.

19
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,000
Do you know how to use
the payment terminal?

20
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,039
Here, watch.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,840
Scan this QR code first.

22
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,240
It's 280 yuan. Thank you.

23
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,599
Pretty lady, take a look.

24
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,599
Take a look at today's promotions.

25
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,919
Get 200 off for purchases over 1,000
and 80 off for purchases over 500.

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,560
Let's go.

27
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,479
Come and take a look.

28
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,960
Excuse me, sir.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,318
We have promotions today.

30
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,719
- Get 200 off...
- He Zhi Nan.

31
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,719
Shi Shi.

32
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,239
Go greet your friends.

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
I got it.

34
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,438
I can also give you...

35
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,599
Thank you.

36
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,718
I can give these away, right?

37
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,080
How much is this?

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,679
Why are you here?

39
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,839
I just happened to be in the area
and saw your posts,

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,159
so I came to check it out.

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,840
This place is amazing.

42
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,719
When did you switch
to this trendy stuff?

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,039
I didn't switch careers.

44
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,560
I'm just helping a friend.

45
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,919
This is so cute.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,560
You look great.

47
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,120
Did something good happen?

48
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm getting married.

49
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,400
Really?

50
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,000
Congratulations.

51
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,199
So who's your true love?

52
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,359
Let me introduce you.

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,438
Qu Yi Peng.

54
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,799
You should know each other.

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,999
There was a time...

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,919
when he often visited
our company for talks.

57
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,920
Do you recall Ms. J boasting
about wanting to pursue him?

58
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,759
Of course I remember.

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,680
Hi, it has been a while.

60
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,170
It has been a while.

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,839
Congratulations.

62
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,759
I never had a chance to talk to him
face-to-face at the company.

63
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,560
I never expected...

64
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,199
that we would end up together...

65
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,610
after crossing half the globe.

66
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,519
What do you mean?

67
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,680
He and I met by chance in Tahiti.

68
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,050
Fate is truly indescribable.

69
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,239
We have to go now.

70
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,480
Let's talk another time.

71
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,199
Bye.

72
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,958
Take this.

73
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,720
Take this one.

74
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,360
It's chubby and cute.

75
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,040
How many have you sold?

76
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,680
Two or three.

77
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,959
Not bad.

78
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,240
Are you okay?

79
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,879
Are you okay?

80
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,519
Are you okay?

81
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,600
Why do I feel like
Qu Yi Peng has changed?

82
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,920
He seems fine,

83
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,399
but his clothes
look better than before.

84
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,120
However, I think...

85
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,879
he appears to have aged.

86
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,759
His hairstyle gives that impression.

87
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,879
The word "Tahiti"...

88
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,399
seems to have solved
the mystery for me.

89
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,879
What do you mean?

90
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,000
What's wrong?

91
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,240
We ran into each other in Tahiti.

92
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,639
It wasn't exactly
a coincidence, right?

93
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,720
What are you thinking?

94
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,959
I deliberately brought you here
to meet He Zhi Nan today.

95
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,920
Why won't you
just tell me the truth?

96
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,279
What was your relationship
with her before?

97
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,879
Shi Shi.

98
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,839
I didn't mean to lie to you.

99
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,360
I just care about you too much.

100
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,920
I don't want my unrelated past...

101
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,120
to affect our relationship.

102
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,879
You saw it just now.

103
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,720
There's nothing
between me and He Zhi Nan.

104
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,360
What about before He Zhi Nan?

105
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,000
What do you mean?

106
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,120
Are you going to investigate me
for three generations?

107
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,399
We're getting married soon.

108
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,039
Even if you manage
to hide it from me,

109
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,480
there's still my parents.

110
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
They take a long time
to do background checks...

111
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:52,759
even for hiring a manager.

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,450
Let alone a son-in-law.

113
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,279
There's a difference...

114
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,960
between you telling me...

115
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,399
and them finding out.

116
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,090
Look how nervous you are.

117
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Let's go.

118
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,840
My parents are expecting us
at home for dinner.

119
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,600
So Qu Yi Peng
suddenly disappeared to Tahiti...

120
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,720
to chase after this girl
named Shi Shi?

121
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,720
Turns out my so-called love...

122
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,919
was nothing but a big joke.

123
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,210
I guess I should say...

124
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,159
that passion comes and goes quickly.

125
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,600
This guy really went all out
to get into the wealthy circle.

126
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,159
- What do you think?
- I have to get back to work.

127
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,559
This girl is good.

128
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,639
Not bad. She's hardworking.

129
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,799
It's 299 yuan.

130
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,919
Come and take a look.

131
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,720
Look at our second-generation cutie.

132
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,038
You have been here before, right?

133
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,090
Yes.

134
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,798
Did you buy it before?

135
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,919
This is the first generation
and this is the second generation.

136
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,119
- You can compare them.
- It's 79 yuan.

137
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,158
Yes, because we're...

138
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,239
We have an event today.

139
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
Get 200 off for purchases
over 1,000.

140
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,359
This is 200 yuan.

141
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,039
This is 100 yuan and this is 50.

142
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,600
If you buy this,
you can get two small ones for free.

143
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,159
Yes. You can.

144
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,279
Later on,
we will also launch some...

145
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,518
There will be stories
and introductions...

146
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,210
about our cutie on the mini-program.

147
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,119
- You can check it out.
- Okay.

148
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,479
Take a look at this.

149
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,919
There's a difference
between this and this.

150
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,450
Yes.

151
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,959
- Come and take a look.
- What is it?

152
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,158
Guess how much we made today.

153
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,720
- How much?
- It's 20,000 yuan.

154
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,159
20,000 yuan?

155
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,000
Zhi Nan.

156
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,758
I have some work to do.

157
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,840
I'll get going.

158
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,799
I'm leaving.

159
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,759
- Bye.
- Bye.

160
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,559
I'll get going.

161
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,879
Even though...

162
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,320
Zhi Nan usually appears easygoing,

163
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,360
she's actually quite sensitive.

164
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't let her drink tonight.

165
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Take care of her.

166
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,679
Me? Take care of her?

167
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,798
It's more like
she should be taking care of me.

168
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,759
My back is still sore
from carrying her home last time.

169
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,679
All right. Bye.

170
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
I got it.

171
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,879
Thank you.

172
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
You're welcome.

173
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,079
Han Su.

174
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,158
I'm old.

175
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,519
I'm retiring.

176
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,840
But I have good news.

177
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,159
I'm going to open
a pineapple bun shop.

178
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,240
When you come to Hong Kong,
you must come and try it.

179
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,799
Sure.

180
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,399
Your pineapple bun
is the best in Hong Kong.

181
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,159
Let's drink.

182
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,278
- I'm not drinking.
- Drink up. Stop pretending.

183
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,720
I'll carry you home
if you're drunk later.

184
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,159
Boss, a bottle of water, please.

185
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
- Sure.
- Are you really not drinking?

186
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:23,919
(Tianji Tofu Skin)

187
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,360
That's weird.

188
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
What is it?

189
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,360
When I saw Qu Yi Peng
this afternoon,

190
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,919
I felt nothing for him at all.

191
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
Even though
I used to like him so much.

192
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,840
Now,

193
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,159
it feels like...

194
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
I'm reading someone else's story...

195
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,440
and it's not even a good one.

196
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,720
I used to think
I was all about love.

197
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,759
Live for love, die for love.

198
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,519
Without love,
my world would collapse.

199
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
However,

200
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,320
when I realized the love was gone,

201
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,679
I didn't feel anything.

202
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,919
This is called transcendence.

203
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,519
"Transcendence"?

204
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,799
Fine.

205
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,879
Here.

206
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,878
Congratulations.

207
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,919
You've reached
a point of total realization.

208
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:27,960
Not bad.

209
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,519
I can now let go of both
Gao Peng and Qu Yi Peng.

210
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,200
If one day,

211
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,758
I disappear...

212
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,878
That means...

213
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,600
I've returned to the 22nd century.

214
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,839
And you, Leviathan.

215
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,919
I forgive you.

216
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,279
Leviathan?

217
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,959
Who's Leviathan?

218
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,039
How many ex-boyfriends do you have?

219
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,840
Isn't that your online name?

220
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:01,720
My online name?

221
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,679
I think I used this name before.

222
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:07,200
However, I only used it for a week.

223
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,960
A week?

224
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,360
Don't tell me you stick
with the same username for life.

225
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,000
Then...

226
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,960
When you were drunk,
you said that if you disappeared,

227
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,320
it would mean
going back to the 22nd century.

228
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,200
Isn't that a line from Doraemon?

229
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,600
Did I say that?

230
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,360
Why don't I remember?

231
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,519
I'm going to the restroom.

232
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,159
What's wrong?

233
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,840
He's not Leviathan.

234
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,240
I misunderstood.

235
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,720
You can't do this anymore.

236
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,079
When there's a problem
you don't want to face,

237
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,120
you just run away.

238
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,360
It's too embarrassing.

239
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,759
What else can I do?

240
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,879
Admit that I approached him
to take revenge on him?

241
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,759
Let him know that since I was 18,

242
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,159
I've always been this foolish?

243
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,519
If you run away,
how will that solve anything?

244
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,000
You have to face it.

245
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,240
I waited for you downstairs
for a long time.

246
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,920
There's so much
I wanted to say to you.

247
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,410
But in the end,

248
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,200
I couldn't gather
enough courage to face you.

249
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,960
I never thought we'd meet again
in a situation like this.

250
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:58,960
I wished to keep at least
a shred of dignity in front of you,

251
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,039
but I know someone
as perceptive as you...

252
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
already sees how pathetic I am now.

253
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,039
We have been poor and struggled,

254
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,839
but I've never felt as humble...

255
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,920
as I do now.

256
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,359
Seeing you live your life...

257
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,650
happily and confidently,

258
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,039
I can't help...

259
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
but regret.

260
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,279
I know it sounds melodramatic...

261
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,279
and I can barely stand it myself,

262
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,960
but I'm genuinely unhappy.

263
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,240
I'm very, very unhappy.

264
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,839
Ms. Chen will complain again
if she smells it.

265
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,440
Let me help you clean up.

266
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,519
It's okay. I can do it myself.

267
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,960
I'm sharing this truth with you...

268
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,359
whether it makes you
feel pity for me...

269
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,839
or brings you satisfaction.

270
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,240
Perhaps you'll say I deserve it.

271
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,650
Yes, I deserve it.

272
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,680
I was too smart for my own good.

273
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,039
I was reckless and vain.

274
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,440
I ruined everything.

275
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,839
My dear Han Su.

276
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,839
Please allow me to call you that.

277
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,279
No matter what people say
about me in front of you,

278
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,720
I can't explain it...

279
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,759
and I don't want
to explain it either.

280
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,039
I just want to tell you this.

281
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,319
You can despise me
for who I am today...

282
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,000
and not want to see the person
I'll become in the future,

283
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,799
but never doubt the person I was...

284
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
in the past.

285
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,359
The person...

286
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,759
who truly loved you.

287
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,650
I hope you find happiness.

288
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
I mean it.

289
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,359
My character makes it
impossible for me...

290
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,278
to be a person
driven solely by feelings.

291
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,359
Neither can you.

292
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,200
Our lives...

293
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,359
are tied to practicality,

294
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,240
but there's nothing shameful
about admitting that.

295
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,200
(The King's Last Wish)

296
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Your Majesty, you fell asleep again.

297
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,759
I dreamed that...

298
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,119
when I was young,

299
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,170
I captured countless hearts...

300
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,650
and achieved numerous successes.

301
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,519
Do you know...

302
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,720
what this crown is made of?

303
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,170
Is it made of gold?

304
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,960
It's made of women's tears...

305
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,960
and broken hearts.

306
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,759
I've hurt many people in my life.

307
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,890
I made them cry...

308
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,240
and broke their hearts,

309
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,720
slowly crafting this crown
with their suffering.

310
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,559
What a magnificent life it has been,
Your Majesty.

311
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,000
Yes.

312
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,599
All my life,

313
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,889
I've captured countless hearts...

314
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,079
and won countless battles.

315
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,650
I possess everything
that anyone could want!

316
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,480
I've been winning all along!

317
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,359
I've never regretted it.

318
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm tired.

319
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,119
Is that you?

320
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
It's me.

321
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,480
Are you all right?

322
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,279
I'm fine.

323
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,319
Then why do you...

324
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,640
dream of me again and again?

325
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,440
Because I want to tell you...

326
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,119
that I've never regretted
leaving you.

327
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,519
I've never regretted hurting you.

328
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,279
Never.

329
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,799
I'm doing well.

330
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,240
Look.

331
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,119
I'm doing better than anyone.

332
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,519
However,

333
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,640
I have so much to say to you.

334
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,439
Where are you going?

335
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,719
I'm not done talking.

336
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Where are you going?

337
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,079
Your Majesty,
you're sleepwalking again.

338
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,039
Do you know what this crown...

339
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,960
is made of?

340
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,359
No.

341
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,359
It's made of my misfortune.

342
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,039
It's not a crown.

343
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,200
It's a hoop.

344
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,240
When I read that letter,

345
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,519
I felt like I could see him
trying so hard to put on a façade.

346
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,559
Suddenly,

347
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,640
I found him rather pathetic.

348
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,440
He went from an awful jerk...

349
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,079
to a pathetic jerk.

350
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,680
If someone had told me a year ago...

351
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,880
that I...

352
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,400
need to accept
my plain, average self,

353
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,400
I'd definitely tell him...

354
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,720
to get lost.

355
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,480
However, I've recently realized...

356
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,240
that maybe I really am
just a very ordinary person.

357
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,599
I'm not pretty...

358
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
nor ugly.

359
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,039
I'm not stupid,

360
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,799
but not dumb either.

361
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,559
If I were in a crowd,

362
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,640
no one would even notice me.

363
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,160
What are you talking about?

364
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,559
How are you not pretty?

365
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,200
Don't say that about yourself.

366
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,240
That's just your perception.

367
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,400
Embrace the ordinary.

368
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,680
That's how they define growth
in self-help books.

369
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,559
I used to think
Gao Peng was ordinary,

370
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,599
but he's rich now.

371
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,039
He's no longer ordinary.

372
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,200
That's why he looks down
on someone like me.

373
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,440
You know...

374
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,519
it's not like that
between you and Gao Peng.

375
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,920
I acted like...

376
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,639
I was above it all,

377
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,759
but the truth is...

378
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,519
The truth is...

379
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,200
I had a bit of insecurity...

380
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,240
in my relationship with Gao Peng.

381
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
He Zhi Nan.

382
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,279
No matter what you say,

383
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
in my heart,

384
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,359
you deserve the best.

385
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,079
You're great.

386
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,240
Really.

387
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,839
You have to like yourself.

388
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,799
What about you?

389
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,400
Do you like yourself?

390
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,559
Okay.

391
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,680
I don't like myself that much.

392
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,758
Sometimes,
I'm even a bit annoyed with myself.

393
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:15,799
See?

394
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,279
Liking me is much easier for you...

395
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,119
than liking yourself.

396
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,000
It's the same for me.

397
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,839
Let's like each other then.

398
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,079
What's the big deal?

399
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,880
Find out more
about my good qualities.

400
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,480
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

401
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,519
Bye.

402
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,839
I fixed that table for you.

403
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,359
That's great.

404
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,119
My neck can finally get some relief.

405
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,240
Thank you.

406
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,118
What?

407
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,680
Are you expecting me
to treat you to dinner tonight?

408
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,359
Sure. I happen to be free tonight.

409
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:04,839
Han Su.

410
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,399
Mr. Gao.

411
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,519
Come with me.

412
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,960
I heard you're going back
to Suzhou tomorrow.

413
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,559
You're so well-informed.

414
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,240
Did Ms. Hu tell you?

415
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:18,759
What time is the train?

416
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,880
I'll take you to the station.

417
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,400
It's okay. I already booked a ride.

418
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,199
I found
a really good Suzhou restaurant.

419
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,559
Haven't you always wanted to try it?

420
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,200
Their crispy pastry is really good.

421
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,759
How about I treat you
to some as a farewell?

422
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,039
I can go home and eat.

423
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,720
How about this, Mr. Gao?

424
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,278
Let me treat you tonight...

425
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:44,319
to your favourite noodle place.

426
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,920
Okay. Let's go.

427
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,200
(Yangzi Noodle House)

428
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,959
(Welcome to try,
Beef noodles, 16 yuan...)

429
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,799
Young man, it's ready.

430
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,359
Eat it while it's hot.

431
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,000
- Here you go.
- Okay, thank you.

432
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,160
Well,

433
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,039
how long has it been
since you last went back to Suzhou?

434
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,519
It has been a while.

435
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:52,358
I was actually planning
to take some time off...

436
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,518
after this project ends...

437
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,680
to go back
and spend time with my mom.

438
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,599
However, for some reason,

439
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,640
she has been really anxious
on the phone,

440
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,799
so I thought I'd just go home...

441
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,480
this weekend.

442
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,720
That sounds good.

443
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,119
Thank you.

444
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,279
Drive safely.

445
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,079
Aren't you...

446
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,960
going to invite me up for tea?

447
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,119
Maybe some other time, Mr. Gao.

448
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,479
My house hasn't been
tidied up for days.

449
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,519
It's a mess.

450
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,440
Also, I have to work tonight.

451
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,839
I'll probably pull an all-nighter.

452
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,518
I have to catch the train
tomorrow morning.

453
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,599
It's really...

454
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,960
It's not easy
to come up with an excuse.

455
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,239
You used them all up at once.

456
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,279
What are you going to do next time?

457
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
I told you.

458
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,440
I'll be very patient.

459
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,519
I'm really happy tonight.

460
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,079
Rest early. I'm leaving.

461
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,440
- Bye, Mr. Gao.
- Bye.

462
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,119
Luo Ma.

463
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,799
What...

464
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,319
What are you doing here?

465
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,480
I've been waiting for you.

466
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,640
Waiting for me?

467
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,519
Why are you...

468
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,759
Are you...

469
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,400
How...

470
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,358
How could I
have left this at the office?

471
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,439
Thank you.

472
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,758
Otherwise, I'll have to make
a trip back to the office...

473
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:01,920
in the middle of the night.

474
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,440
Thank you.

475
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,239
You need to go through...

476
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,480
the IPO documents
of these companies.

477
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,959
After going through
that mountain of information,

478
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,920
you need to compile all the issues
into one spreadsheet.

479
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,640
How are you going
to finish all that work?

480
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,559
How can you go home
if you don't finish?

481
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,559
Do you want to come up for some tea?

482
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,359
Sure.

483
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,240
It's hot.

484
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,240
I need some strong tea.

485
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,000
Let me help you with this.

486
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,599
Okay, thank you.

487
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,719
Use this to cool yourself down.

488
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,799
Okay, thank you.

489
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,279
Okay. It's done.

490
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,679
Luo Ma, thank you.

491
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,000
It's all thanks to you today.

492
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,079
You're welcome.

493
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
Thank you for your hard work.

494
00:32:58,241 --> 00:32:59,400
Thank you.

495
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,400
Do you want to take a break?

496
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:06,759
I'll be done soon.

497
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,680
It's almost done.

498
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,359
I've gone through your report.

499
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,960
Your reasoning is really clear...

500
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,559
and it's not easy
to do such a good job.

501
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,039
Can I ask you something?

502
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,680
Why do you want to be a lawyer?

503
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,279
The salary is high and it pays well.

504
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,519
All dreams, in the end,
are just a way to make a living.

505
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,119
So it's all about money, right?

506
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:25,839
You like money so much.

507
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,440
Of course.

508
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,319
You look like someone
who grew up in a rich family.

509
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,200
You'll never understand...

510
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,519
the longing
and sense of deprivation...

511
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,720
that we from ordinary families
feel about money.

512
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,039
It's deeply ingrained.

513
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,799
However,

514
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,519
rich people have their own troubles.

515
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,400
Many people spend their lives...

516
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,880
chasing money,

517
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,159
but end up losing
and missing out on a lot...

518
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,480
because of their struggles.

519
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Right?

520
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,240
Then perhaps
it wouldn't have to be so hard.

521
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,920
What is the easier way?

522
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,920
For example,

523
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,680
marry a rich man.

524
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,799
Some people start off at a point...

525
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,440
that others can only reach
after a lifetime of effort.

526
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:13,000
Saying this so bluntly
is quite cruel,

527
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,000
isn't it?

528
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,199
I was just using it as an example.

529
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,840
So in pursuit
of your so-called shortcut,

530
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,809
you would have to love
someone you don't love?

531
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,809
You're not that kind of person.

532
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,079
Maybe...

533
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,329
I'm that kind of person too.

534
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,559
I'm not even sure.

535
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,880
How can you be so sure?

536
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:56,679
It's important
to find someone you love.

537
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,880
But what good does it do?

538
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,329
Doing whatever you love...

539
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,960
is child's play.

540
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,000
All affections have a shelf life.

541
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:07,599
No matter how much you love someone,

542
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:10,400
when the time comes,

543
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,519
it's still a fruitless endeavour..

544
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,559
Don't you need love?

545
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,400
Kiddo.

546
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,159
in real life,

547
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,159
the more tasks we complete
that require love,

548
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,440
the more blurred
the boundaries become.

549
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:25,840
The definitions will also
grow increasingly intricate.

550
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Fine.

551
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,480
Let me ask you.

552
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,679
What's your relationship
with Gao Peng?

553
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:40,679
He's my client.

554
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:43,360
Okay.

555
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:44,840
I understand.

556
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,159
I'm leaving.

557
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,400
Stop calling me kiddo.

558
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,840
I knew you had to take
the morning train.

559
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,000
Let me help you.

560
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,000
- Thank you, Mr. Gao.
- You're welcome.

561
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Mr. Gao.

562
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:51,719
Don't bother.
I've already called a taxi.

563
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,159
It's okay. Cancel it.

564
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,079
Get in.

565
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,639
Get in.

566
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

567
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,078
Mr. Gao.

568
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,079
This isn't the way
to the train station.

569
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,769
We'll get on the highway
at the next intersection.

570
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,960
I haven't been to Suzhou before...

571
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:36,399
and I'm eager to taste...

572
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,920
the hometown dishes
you've been boasting about.

573
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,559
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

574
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,159
Well,

575
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,639
go up by yourself.

576
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,079
What about you?

577
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,198
I'm good.

578
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,289
I'll just find a hotel nearby.

579
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,559
After driving for so long
to bring me here,

580
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,289
I didn't even ask you
to come up for tea or a meal.

581
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,000
Isn't that a bit unreasonable?

582
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,599
You're right.

583
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,289
But you have to think carefully.

584
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,960
If you take me
to meet your parents now,

585
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,679
will your mom be too surprised?

586
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,000
I don't think so.

587
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:40,639
I'll tell her that you're my boss...

588
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,679
and that you're just in Suzhou
on a business trip,

589
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:43,919
stopping by my house...

590
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,079
to get a feel
for the local situation.

591
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Okay.

592
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,719
Hold on.

593
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,599
You planned this ahead.

594
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,440
It's better to be safe than sorry.

595
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,119
- Let me help you, Mr. Gao.
- It's okay. I'll take it.

596
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,239
- Let's go.
- Okay.

597
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:11,480
(Building one)

598
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,880
Thank you, ma'am.

599
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:16,809
Mr. Gao, you're too kind.

600
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,638
Make yourself at home.

601
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:19,959
You didn't have to bring so much.

602
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,039
It's okay.

603
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,239
Ma'am, just call me Xiao Gao.

604
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,199
Xiao Gao.

605
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:29,239
What do you do in the company?

606
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:31,719
My company is busy with the IPO.

607
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,809
I'm helping my parents.

608
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,920
A listed company?

609
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,559
That's amazing.

610
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,639
- Have some water.
- Okay.

611
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:43,839
Have some fruit.

612
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,880
Okay.

613
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,638
Don't be shy. Eat up.

614
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,119
- Okay.
- Here. Eat up.

615
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,919
Here. Eat more.

616
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,960
Thank you, ma'am.

617
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,880
The fish soup is fresh.

618
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
It's delicious.

619
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:05,288
I'm just worried
that you won't like it.

620
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:06,479
It's good.

621
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Eat more if you like it.

622
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,039
It's delicious.

623
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:17,769
Xiao Gao,
you're so young and capable.

624
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,559
There must be...

625
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,559
a lot of girls in the company
pursuing you, right?

626
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:25,360
I don't have a girlfriend yet.

627
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,239
Have some vegetables.

628
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,519
Come on.

629
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,769
Help yourself.

630
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,599
Thank you, ma'am.

631
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:49,480
(Building one)

632
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,920
I'll get going then.

633
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,599
Go home.
There's no need to see me off.

634
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,400
It's not easy for you to come back,
so spend more time with your mom.

635
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:57,598
Okay.

636
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,719
See if there are any attractions
you want to visit tomorrow.

637
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:03,559
I can join you
to extend my hospitality.

638
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,119
Okay.

639
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:07,360
Let's keep in touch.

640
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,639
- Okay.
- Okay.

641
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,400
- I'll get going. Bye.
- Bye.

642
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,239
Mom, I'm so tired.

643
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,400
Yes, it's tiring.

644
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:36,159
I can see how hard it is for you.

645
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,769
If you don't like him,

646
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,960
why bring him home?

647
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:49,400
I thought you would like him.

648
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:51,239
I really like him.

649
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,599
Too bad, I'm not
the one getting married.

650
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:56,809
No matter how much I like him,

651
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:58,289
it's useless.

652
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,599
How do you know
that I don't like him?

653
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,809
You're my daughter.

654
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,559
How could I not know...

655
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,880
if you like him or not?

656
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,920
But you should know,

657
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:19,039
if I marry him,

658
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,199
we won't have to worry...

659
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,000
about making ends meet
for the rest of our lives.

660
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,199
You won't have to worry...

661
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,679
about making a living on your own.

662
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,880
Why have you studied
so hard for so many years?

663
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,079
Why would you...

664
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,039
marry someone you don't love?

665
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:43,119
Su Su.

666
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:46,400
It's your life,

667
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,119
so you should make your own choices.

668
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,079
But remember one thing.

669
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,480
I'll only like him...

670
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,960
if you do.
