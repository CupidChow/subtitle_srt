00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,120
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 2)

3
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,560
He Zhi Nan, wake up.

4
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,400
He Zhi Nan.

5
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,079
Your wage is going to be deducted.

6
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,640
He Zhi Nan.

7
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,159
He Zhi Nan.

8
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,680
He Zhi Nan.

9
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,479
- Morning, Han Han. - Morning.

10
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,240
- Morning. - Morning.

11
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
Good morning.

12
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,810
Morning.

13
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,879
Han Su, let me tell you something.

14
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,679
I just heard...

15
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,680
that the Hong Kong branch is asking for someone.

16
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,999
Really?

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,376
After the meeting earlier, the district lawyer Mr. Wu...

18
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,719
asked Ms. Xu if she has a suitable candidate.

19
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,079
What did Ms. Xu say?

20
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,758
She told him not to worry.

21
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,599
It seems like she already has someone in mind.

22
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,520
You're so quick to find out.

23
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,999
When filling out the intention survey for HR,

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,439
that was what I applied for.

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,799
Job opportunities in Hong Kong...

26
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,479
are very attractive to everyone.

27
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,799
But I have to remind you...

28
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,480
that you just became a second-year lawyer.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,758
The work environment in Hong Kong...

30
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,439
is too stressful...

31
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,639
for a junior lawyer.

32
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,280
Why don't you practice in a familiar environment...

33
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,759
for another two years...

34
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,479
before you go there?

35
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,918
Of course,

36
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,479
the income in Hong Kong is much higher.

37
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
But the cost of living will also be higher.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,079
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

39
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,360
You're very thoughtful.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,280
But if it's possible,

41
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,959
I'd still like to seize the opportunity...

42
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
to work in Hong Kong.

43
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,439
Is there a personal reason?

44
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,400
I'll be honest with you.

45
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,879
The company already has someone in mind.

46
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,198
There's also the language barrier issue.

47
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,280
That's not a problem.

48
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I've been learning Cantonese on my own for a year.

49
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,169
I just hope that the company...

50
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,199
will give me a fair chance to compete.

51
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,759
You came prepared.

52
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,639
Okay.

53
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,800
If you insist.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,519
Go and prepare the application.

55
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,730
But you have to know that the final decision...

56
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,519
is with the major partner in Hong Kong.

57
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,959
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

58
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,839
Han Su.

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,730
I'm just curious.

60
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
You'll have to spend three years in Hong Kong.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
What about your Handsome Qu?

62
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,120
Can you bear to part with him?

63
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,050
He'll definitely support me.

64
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,439
That's good.

65
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,560
Let me see.

66
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,639
Hi.

67
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,279
Xiao Peng.

68
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,656
I sent you an article yesterday. Did you read it?

69
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,730
I did.

70
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,169
It's still early for the meeting.

71
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,479
Why don't we go to my office? I want to hear your thoughts.

72
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,720
- Let's go. - Okay.

73
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,198
Miss.

74
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,600
The client hasn't signed in.

75
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,638
Mr. Qu is my friend from Yinzhong Capital.

76
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,920
Just check the box.

77
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,319
Don't you think...

78
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,278
Ms. J is the type of mistress...

79
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,159
coming from a poor background...

80
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,720
who is desperately climbing up the social ladder in telenovelas?

81
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,319
Have you fallen for the handsome guy?

82
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,480
I do like idol dramas, but I'm not stupid.

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,958
These high achievers...

84
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,800
are mostly from small cities.

85
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,399
They want to settle down in a big city.

86
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,439
At a time like this, Ms. J has the money and resources.

87
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,016
She definitely has more advantages...

88
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
than innocent, young, and pretty girls.

89
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,800
And Ms. J won't force him to get married.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,198
He can have a romantic relationship with an independent older woman...

91
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,278
and not take responsibility.

92
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,519
Why not?

93
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,959
Hello.

94
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
What's your name?

95
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,360
Hello. What's your name?

96
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,600
Let me check. Excuse me.

97
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,295
(Qu Yi Peng: I couldn't say hi to you earlier.)

98
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,919
(Let me thank you for saving me a seat.)

99
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,120
(It's nothing. Don't mention it.)

100
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,278
It's the handsome guy from the food stall.

101
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,759
A lot of girls in our office think he's handsome.

102
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,560
They shared his photos in the group chat.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,079
They said he looks like Xin Yunlai.

104
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,479
How can he be compared to him?

105
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,119
I say, aesthetics have been downgraded.

106
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,999
I think he's quite handsome.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,360
Coupled with the label of a famous company finance man,

108
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,560
he's of top-notch quality.

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,800
Creativity means competitiveness.

110
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,120
It also means facing the unknown.

111
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,560
Compared to being fearless,

112
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,079
I enjoy...

113
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,119
facing the fear and doubt of the unknown more.

114
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,920
You're only eating lunch now?

115
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,559
I just finished the final summary...

116
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,800
of the Melon Seed King project.

117
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,318
Golden Harvest is such a big award in advertising.

118
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,919
Even winning it once, I'll be satisfied for life.

119
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,159
Ms. Zeng has won it three times.

120
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
She's immune to it.

121
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,479
She's amazing.

122
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,599
When I'm out of ideas, I listen to her lecture.

123
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
I always learn something out of it.

124
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,759
Next time,

125
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,599
I should invite her to the company...

126
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,040
to give us a seminar.

127
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,319
Ms. Xin.

128
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,198
Do you know Ms. Zeng well?

129
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,399
She's kind of my mentor.

130
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,040
I see.

131
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,159
This is what they call...

132
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,720
a good teacher produces a good student.

133
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,959
When did you learn how to suck up to others?

134
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,079
But to be honest,

135
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,638
Ms. Zeng is really amazing.

136
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,438
No matter how difficult and boring a project is,

137
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,639
it's always something new in her hands.

138
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,360
Her way of thinking and execution...

139
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,760
is just different from others.

140
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,878
Hi, my babies.

141
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,959
I'm back.

142
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,039
- Monica. - Monica.

143
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,079
You're finally back.

144
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,919
Long time no see. Come.

145
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,758
I came back today...

146
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,329
to give out wedding candies.

147
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,855
It's like I'm back visiting my parents.

148
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,798
- Congratulations. - Congratulations, Monica.

149
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,799
She just did one project with you...

150
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,279
and turned your client into her husband.

151
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,799
I'll go out first.

152
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,599
I brought everything. Hand them out.

153
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Monica.

154
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:50,879
It has been a while.

155
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,919
Ms. Xin.

156
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,449
I didn't expect you to get married so soon.

157
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,050
- Congratulations. - Thank you, Ms. Xin.

158
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,239
Here, this is for you.

159
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,758
- Thank you. - Come this way.

160
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,360
- So how are you? - Pretty good.

161
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,279
It's my fault.

162
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,120
I've loved Norse mythology since I was little.

163
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,240
To fulfil my dream, Sun took the whole family...

164
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,960
to a Nordic castle to hold the wedding.

165
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,918
Time was tight too. It was really tiring.

166
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,758
Your husband is so good to you.

167
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,919
He's all right.

168
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,638
I just got back last week.,

169
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,960
so I'm still jet-lagged.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,210
But I wanted to see everyone.

171
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,999
- It must be tough. - Monica.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,639
Congratulations on your wedding.

173
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,759
Han Han, this is for you.

174
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,240
Thank you.

175
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,799
I haven't thanked you properly.

176
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,600
What for?

177
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,119
In my heart,

178
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,159
I regard you as my matchmaker.

179
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,209
If you didn't take me on the project,

180
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,919
I wouldn't have met Sun.

181
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,798
Mrs. Sun, congratulations.

182
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,918
Mr. Li, please don't call me that.

183
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,090
Just call me Monica.

184
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,918
Very well. May you have children soon.

185
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,000
Thank you, Mr. Li.

186
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,449
During the economic transformation,

187
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,558
China's macroeconomy...

188
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,519
has generally maintained a rapid growth.

189
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,558
A large group of outstanding entrepreneurs...

190
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,799
stood out from the crowd.

191
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,329
Countless small businesses...

192
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,759
have grown into modern mega conglomerates.

193
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
However,

194
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:05,799
many companies were also affected...

195
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,239
by economic cycle fluctuations at the macro-level...

196
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,360
during their growth process.

197
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,329
Or they couldn't adapt...

198
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,209
to the requirements of economic development...

199
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,638
and the demand for industrial upgrades...

200
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,919
on a micro-level.

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,158
Or perhaps...

202
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,089
there were financial crises due to illegal operations...

203
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,399
and so on.

204
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,449
The competition mechanism under market economy conditions...

205
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,398
has caused some corporations in the entire economic system...

206
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,450
to put on a comedy show,

207
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,680
while other corporations...

208
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,000
put on tragedies.

209
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,479
What's more, some corporations...

210
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,159
have become a confluence of comedy and tragedy.

211
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,798
Without a doubt, Delong Group...

212
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,120
has become a typical example of this confluence.

213
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,135
(Qu Yi Peng: Zhi Nan, you have to help me.)

214
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,450
(A girl keeps pestering me.)

215
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,816
(If you don't agree to meet with me tonight, I...)

216
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,089
Delong Group was a small colour photo enlargement shop...

217
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,600
registered in Urumqi...

218
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,450
in 1986 with 400 employees.

219
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,678
After 18 years of development,

220
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,758
in 2004,

221
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,440
the company has developed...

222
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,158
into a multipurpose, multi-industry,

223
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,200
multiregional, and multinational company.

224
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,320
Sorry.

225
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,679
I rushed, but I'm still late.

226
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,279
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,600
It's okay.

228
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,559
Thank you.

229
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,960
Ms. J just wouldn't believe that I had an appointment.

230
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,600
I even showed her the message of the restaurant's location.

231
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,798
She still didn't believe me.

232
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,158
She even insisted on driving me to the restaurant.

233
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,399
That's when she gave up.

234
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,360
Ms. J likes handsome guys from prestigious schools.

235
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,239
"Handsome guys from prestigious schools"?

236
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,759
Do you think I'm one too?

237
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,799
He's so good at flirting.

238
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,919
Actually, it's not just about looks.

239
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,559
Education too.

240
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,079
He must be from a prestigious local university.

241
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,558
Since it has to be a prestigious school,

242
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,440
then are Ivy League schools within her consideration?

243
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,279
To be able to go to an Ivy League school,

244
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,799
then his family must be rich.

245
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,040
She doesn't care about having a rich lady image.

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,080
Is that so?

247
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,880
Take a look at what you want to eat.

248
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,440
I chose this Western restaurant without knowing what you like.

249
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,120
By the way, where are you from?

250
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,120
I'm from here. I can eat anything.

251
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,200
Being a local kid is lucky.

252
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,960
When it comes to rent, it's a lot less stressful.

253
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,720
Do you live with your parents?

254
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,919
I live alone.

255
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,559
My parents bought me a house.

256
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,799
How nice.

257
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,080
Unlike us from out of town.

258
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,080
We have worked hard for years,

259
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,279
but buying a house isn't considered.

260
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,639
Can I take your order?

261
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,279
Perilla pasta.

262
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,679
Caesar salad. Freshly squeezed watermelon juice.

263
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,720
And tiramisu. Thank you.

264
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,039
I'll have a grilled chicken breast salad.

265
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,000
And a bottle of this red wine.

266
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,960
- Okay. - Thank you.

267
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,799
Is he on a diet?

268
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,560
Or is he trying to humiliate you?

269
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,278
Don't get me wrong.

270
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,679
I'm doing this to complement you.

271
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,039
You eat so much, but you're still so skinny.

272
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,760
You must be the envy of so many girls.

273
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,599
It must be nice to be young.

274
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,678
An old man like me...

275
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,559
has to control his calorie intake.

276
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,279
I have to work out too.

277
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,600
How's your workout going?

278
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,600
I'll show you when I have the chance.

279
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,639
That's too forward.

280
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,519
He Zhi Nan, be careful.

281
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,960
I'm kidding.

282
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,639
After I started working,

283
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
I haven't had much time to work out.

284
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,200
But at university, I was in a fitness club.

285
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,000
Every year, we have a bodybuilding competition.

286
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,720
I'm a judge now.

287
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,199
I'll show you the young guys...

288
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,519
who works out next time.

289
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,840
I'll introduce them to you.

290
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,479
Sure.

291
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,440
I love meeting handsome guys.

292
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,240
By the way, the first time I saw you,

293
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,080
you left quite an impression on me.

294
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Why?

295
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:00,518
It's rare to see a girl...

296
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,000
so naturally relaxed...

297
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,039
and humming a song in the office.

298
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,480
I'm not very good at it,

299
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,799
but the song is quite catchy.

300
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,399
After I heard you hum the other day,

301
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
I couldn't help but hum it when I got home.

302
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,559
The key is a bit...

303
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,120
It's a bit like...

304
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,159
a fruit candy, it's sweet.

305
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,440
Excuse me, miss.

306
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Thank you.

307
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,679
Thank you.

308
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,000
Here.

309
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,399
Let's eat.

310
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,878
The cab is almost here.

311
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,279
I'll send you home first.

312
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,120
It's this one. Get in.

313
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,440
I'm here.

314
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,440
I'll take you downstairs.

315
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,890
It's okay.

316
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:59,531
I don't want you to wait for another cab.

317
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay. Let me know when you get home.

318
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
I'll get going.

319
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,839
Qu Yi Peng.

320
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,559
What is it?

321
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,240
This is for you.

322
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,679
I'll leave the blueberry flavour for you.

323
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,119
I'm off.

324
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,519
Bye.

325
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Let's go, sir.

326
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,960
Sir, please go around the neighbourhood once.

327
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,680
Then go back to the place we were just at.

328
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,559
- Okay. - Thank you.

329
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,119
He's from Liuzhou.

330
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,759
He has a dad and two younger sisters.

331
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,798
His biggest wish...

332
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,920
is to build a new house for his dad...

333
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,719
and open a milk tea shop...

334
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,359
in his hometown for his younger sisters.

335
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,360
It's obvious he's a white-collar guy from a working-class background.

336
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,000
What are you saying?

337
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,559
You just like to label people.

338
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,039
He doesn't look like one.

339
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,680
But...

340
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,599
But his study days weren't easy.

341
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,559
He went to a boarding school during middle school...

342
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,680
in the county.

343
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,519
On the first day of school,

344
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,079
his dad took a three-hour bus ride...

345
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:48,650
to get to school.

346
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
He had a large woven bag in his hand.

347
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,319
There was a quilt inside...

348
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,000
that his sisters made for him...

349
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,839
and fruits they picked from the trees.

350
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,440
At the time, his dad...

351
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
was drenched in sweat.

352
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,530
Standing in front of the school...

353
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,039
was my dad who came all the way here.

354
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,839
He got out of the bus drenched in sweat...

355
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,559
and walked towards me.

356
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,200
There was a girl.

357
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,759
She was my deskmate...

358
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,160
who was the daughter of the county leader.

359
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,410
She was disgusted...

360
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,200
and covered her nose.

361
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,240
She was disgusted by my dad's sweat...

362
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,119
and the smell of dirt.

363
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,039
I'm actually quite an uninteresting and boring person.

364
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,559
I have no hobbies.

365
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,240
I'm like a crop in a field.

366
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,559
Rooted in the ground,

367
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,640
it grows straight.

368
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,039
No distractions.

369
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,319
It only has one goal.

370
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,559
It's to go up...

371
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
and up.

372
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,839
Go beyond the mountains...

373
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,680
and live a good life.

374
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,160
Generally speaking,

375
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,279
men like to brag...

376
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,880
about how great they are.

377
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,119
This guy is clearly outstanding.

378
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,119
But he showed me his most vulnerable side.

379
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,039
After this conversation,

380
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,640
I think he's someone very pure...

381
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,039
and sincere.

382
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,640
Like someone I've known for a long time.

383
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,880
We are sorry to inform...

384
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:45,480
that Flight G1012...

385
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,680
has been delayed due to the weather.

386
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,880
We apologize for the inconvenience.

387
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,759
I'm doomed. The flight is cancelled.

388
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
What now?

389
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:57,000
What else can I do?

390
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,079
Wait for the announcement.

391
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,680
Including 45 securities firms,

392
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:03,240
28 accounting firms,

393
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,920
and 49 law firms.

394
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,416
Do you know that the competition for this project is fierce?

395
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,480
Yes.

396
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,519
Tell me about your team's strengths.

397
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,720
Okay, let me introduce them.

398
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,079
We're the leading team in corporate finance.

399
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,719
In the past three years,

400
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,239
we've successfully assisted over 20 companies...

401
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,440
to go public in Hong Kong.

402
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,599
The team members we've equipped for this project...

403
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,839
are all IPO experts.

404
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,519
They have a lot of experience in going public...

405
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,240
and a deep understanding of the industry.

406
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,519
Let me add one more thing.

407
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,880
We have offices in mainland China and Hong Kong.

408
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,279
Our biggest advantage is that...

409
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,440
we can provide your company...

410
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,921
a one-stop legal solution through internal cooperation...

411
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,240
between our team of Chinese lawyers and Hong Kong lawyers.

412
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,480
For matters involving legal projects in both places,

413
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,079
you don’t need to deal with two teams at the same time.

414
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,680
We can solve it once through internal collaboration.

415
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,759
Our team provides round-the-clock legal services...

416
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,240
to make sure you get immediate assistance.

417
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,399
(There's a good tiramisu place south of the city.)

418
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,920
(How about going together in the next few days?)

419
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,358
Temperature's going up...

420
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,400
and so is your heart rate.

421
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,960
It's just tiramisu.

422
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,160
And it's going up?

423
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,559
It's not.

424
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,719
Every time you argue with Gao Peng,

425
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,560
you watch movies and reminisce about the past.

426
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,040
Then you are able to forgive him.

427
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,400
Why are you relying...

428
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,039
on tiramisu this time?

429
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,720
You don't want to fix a broken relationship.

430
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,320
You just want to steal a new one.

431
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,440
If a relationship can never get old,

432
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,960
who would want a new love?

433
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,360
When are your parents coming back?

434
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:03,759
My parents...

435
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,015
are playing mahjong at my second aunt's house...

436
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,240
until after midnight.

437
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,839
When...

438
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,680
I really want to go back.

439
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,000
I really want to go back...

440
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,799
to when we were just together.

441
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,879
You don't want tiramisu anymore, do you?

442
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,040
As long as I still have Gao Peng in my heart,

443
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:51,839
it doesn't matter if I go or not.

444
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,160
- Then I'll go. - Then don't go.

445
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,839
Han Han, check your email.

446
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,520
Mr. Li said the client gave a suggestion for the proposal.

447
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,560
It'd be best if you could revise it overnight.

448
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,680
You'll have to work hard.

449
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,439
You must send it to me as soon as possible.

450
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,359
- Okay. - Can anyone solve this problem?

451
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,359
That's right.

452
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,639
We've been waiting for so long for the announcement.

453
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,960
Get your boss here.

454
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,160
Get your boss here.

455
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,038
You're all disregarding the matter. Get your boss here now...

456
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,159
to give us an explanation.

457
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,359
Which one of you is the boss?

458
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,400
I'm sorry.

459
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,920
Ms. Sun, are you okay?

460
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,440
Are you not feeling well?

461
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,720
Don't stay here. Come with me.

462
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,599
Here.

463
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,440
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

464
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,599
Hello, guests.

465
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,200
These are some tea and snacks for you.

466
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,039
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

467
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,599
The waiting time for your flight might get longer.

468
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,360
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

469
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,279
Sir.

470
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,920
If you need supper,

471
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,255
you can take a look at the menu.

472
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,440
Okay.

473
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,799
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

474
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,680
Take a look first.

475
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,359
Please upgrade this lady's seat on the flight.

476
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,359
- Thank you. - Yes, sir.

477
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,599
You don't have to. It's okay.

478
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
I'm just redeeming the mileage.

479
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:25,680
It's free of charge.

480
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,559
Thank you then.

481
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,279
It's nothing. Don't mention it.

482
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,519
You don't look it.

483
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,039
You're so young,

484
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,480
but you're a workaholic.

485
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,079
We're the same.

486
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,240
The upgrade really makes a difference.

487
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,680
With the upgrade,

488
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,039
he can openly sit next to you.

489
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,759
It's a three-hour flight.

490
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,039
The purpose is obvious.

491
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,599
Is that so?

492
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,319
But I didn't wash my hair today.

493
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,879
And my clothes are all over the place.

494
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,720
Plus, I have a stomachache.

495
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,680
I'm in bad shape.

496
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,680
Mr. Zhou, welcome on this flight.

497
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,279
Your seat is over here.

498
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,039
He's here. I have to go. Bye.

499
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,880
Ladies and gentlemen, our flight is about to take off.

500
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,319
Please fasten your seat belts...

501
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,359
and put your phones in flight mode. Thank you.

502
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,519
Ladies and gentlemen, our flight is about to take off.

503
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,680
Please make sure...

504
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,519
Su Su.

505
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,399
There's a new Japanese restaurant downstairs.

506
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,599
Let's try it for lunch.

507
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,559
Ms. Shan, thank you for the fragrance.

508
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,720
It's nothing. Lunch is on me.

509
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,799
Ms. Shan.

510
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,480
Just say what's on your mind.

511
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,519
Come with me.

512
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,640
Here, sit down.

513
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,440
Su Su.

514
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,400
I heard you submitted an application to go to Hong Kong.

515
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,000
Yes.

516
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,159
As you know,

517
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,000
my parents both live in Shenzhen.

518
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,560
I've been applying to the company to go to Hong Kong.

519
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,239
It wasn't easy for me to get this chance.

520
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,759
You still have a chance.

521
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,479
Han Su, what I'm trying to say is,

522
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,039
you're still young.

523
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
On the account that you were my apprentice...

524
00:33:18,721 --> 00:33:20,201
for a few days when you first joined,

525
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,599
I hope that you can withdraw your application.

526
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,118
As far as I know,

527
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,159
I'm not the only one who submitted the application.

528
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,880
But even if there are more competitors,

529
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,599
as long as you're capable enough,

530
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,559
this opportunity will be yours.

531
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Ms. Shan.

532
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,439
I'm very grateful.

533
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,598
When I first joined the company,

534
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,999
you took care of me for a few days.

535
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,558
But that alone...

536
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,359
isn't enough to make me give up on my goal.

537
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,136
Besides, the selection is decided by the Hong Kong branch.

538
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,680
We're just competing fairly.

539
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,815
The season is changing. My nose is a bit allergic.

540
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,559
I can't use this, but thank you.

541
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Han Su.

542
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,599
Give it to Xiao Qu.

543
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,519
Is he okay with you going to Hong Kong?

544
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:08,920
That's my business.

545
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,719
What's with that attitude?

546
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,288
I've seen people with no EQ,

547
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,039
but not as low as yours.

548
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,809
So shameless.

549
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,359
In our law firm, there's no shortage of sharp tongues.

550
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,079
However, a disciple talking back to the mentor in person...

551
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,289
is rare.

552
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,920
Zhao Shan took me to my workstation on my first day at the company.

553
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,159
That was all.

554
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,439
Other than that,

555
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,638
she never taught me anything valuable.

556
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,199
So I don't think of her as my mentor.

557
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:51,400
There are some things that only you need to know.

558
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,159
Why do you have to say it in person?

559
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,159
Because it's more efficient this way.

560
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,158
I don't have to spend time greeting her and smiling at her,

561
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,400
and beating around the bush.

562
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,119
If so, it'll take at least 30 minutes.

563
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,360
I don't have that kind of time...

564
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,199
nor the energy or ability...

565
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,840
to delve into these office small talks.

566
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,719
It's not that you don't have the energy...

567
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:12,880
or the ability.

568
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,400
You just don't care.

569
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,769
Ms. Xu.

570
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,479
I know you're reminding me this...

571
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,880
for my own good.

572
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,440
I thank you.

573
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,719
But you don't plan to change either.

574
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:27,880
That's right.

575
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,679
You're an honest person.

576
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:40,840
Don't change if you don't want to.

577
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,288
I don't have the interest...

578
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:44,960
or the energy to mediate anyway.

579
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,200
From the perspective of a boss,

580
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,559
I don't mind.

581
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,718
As for the others,

582
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,919
as long as you don't care about them,

583
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,329
it doesn't matter.

584
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:53,960
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

585
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:57,000
People who stand up for themselves...

586
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,329
tend to unconsciously build iron walls around themselves...

587
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,809
for support.

588
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,399
As someone who has the experience,

589
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,679
I want to remind you...

590
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,880
that these iron walls...

591
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,880
can sometimes trap you instead.

592
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:15,920
That feeling of loneliness...

593
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,559
is not pleasant.

594
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:28,039
You're back.

595
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:30,840
Have you eaten?

596
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,440
Yes.

597
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:40,480
Last week, I introduced you to my senior from Huineng Group.

598
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,519
How did the meeting go?

599
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,039
The project...

600
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,599
hasn't been set yet.

601
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,599
I don't think it's going to happen.

602
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:53,400
Their company's lithium technology is state-of-the-art.

603
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,769
New energy source is the current trend.

604
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:00,159
You can't just look at the surface.

605
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,879
You have to put in some effort.

606
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,359
Investigate properly...

607
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,480
and research seriously.

608
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,680
"Investigate properly and research seriously"?

609
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,599
Why do you sound so much like my boss?

610
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:11,679
He only sleeps five hours a day.

611
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:14,599
He despises anyone who sleeps eight hours a day.

612
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:15,809
We're doomed.

613
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,930
He suspects us of slacking off in the office all day.

614
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:22,769
The way you said that is exactly like...

615
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,199
those old-timers in our company.

616
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,079
They can't do their job well.

617
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,360
They're stuck in their comfort zone.

618
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,809
Yet they mock people who work hard for being arrogant.

619
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,039
What do you mean?

620
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:38,920
I meant it literally.

621
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,239
For the past two years,

622
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,239
I've always heard you complaining about your boss.

623
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,119
But...

624
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,039
shouldn't you look for the reason in yourself?

625
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,289
From what you're saying,

626
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,808
you think I'm too slow to get promoted and get a raise.

627
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,169
That's not what I'm talking about.

628
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:09,400
Forget it.

629
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,336
The lid of the pickled bamboo shoots jar is not closed properly.

630
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,360
The smell won't get out for half a day.

631
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,719
You don't like the smell?

632
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,960
I just don't like the smell of always being in the house.

633
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:50,769
This is the smell I've smelled since I was little.

634
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,559
My sister made it herself.

635
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:54,399
I held it and rode the train for over ten hours...

636
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
to bring it back.

637
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:58,039
I'm just a country bumpkin...

638
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,399
who made it to where I am today.

639
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,238
If I don't smell this for three days,

640
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,439
I'll feel uncomfortable.

641
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,800
If you don't like it, just say so.

642
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,289
Let's be objective.

643
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,976
Not liking it and rejecting it are two different things.

644
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,119
Don't exaggerate.

645
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,559
I'm exaggerating?

646
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,480
The first time I made the noodles for you,

647
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,440
you said it tasted heavenly.

648
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,279
The taste of the noodles never changed.

649
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,999
Could it be that you've changed?

650
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,079
I loved it then and I still love it now.

651
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:25,329
I just don't like the smell of the sour marinade.

652
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,159
The ventilation in this house is bad.

653
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:28,718
The smell can't get out. That's the truth.

654
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,809
That's all.

655
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,160
I don't think the bamboo shoots are the problem, it's you.

656
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,840
After all this talk, you finally got to the point.

657
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,559
Yes, the problem is me.

658
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,119
I'm from a poor background.

659
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:42,480
And I don't work hard.

660
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,159
When I don't finish my writing, I can still sleep.

661
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:46,559
That's not progressing.

662
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,960
That's a sin.

663
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,600
I stayed up all night for you.

664
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,559
I didn't complain at all.

665
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,719
Thank you, Han Su.

666
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,920
You don't have to complain.

667
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,289
What you said is true.

668
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,920
I can't be as strong and hardworking as you, Superman Han.

669
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,239
I deserve to be despised.

670
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,360
You're trying so hard to hide your hatred,

671
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,119
acting like you care about my pride.

672
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,678
But let me tell you,

673
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,215
it hurts more than just looking down on me.

674
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:09,360
Qu Yi Peng, be fair.

675
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,239
I just can't stand it...

676
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:12,599
when you don't finish your work,

677
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,920
but can still sleep peacefully.

678
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:15,439
It's the truth...

679
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,400
that I can't say out loud or not tell you either.

680
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,679
What should I do?

681
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,120
- What did I do wrong? - You didn't do anything wrong.

682
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,039
I'm the one at fault.

683
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,599
My existence is a mistake.

684
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,360
I think you want to say...

685
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,840
it's my existence that's a mistake.

686
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,519
No. What do you mean?

687
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:09,360
(Four-year anniversary, tomorrow)
