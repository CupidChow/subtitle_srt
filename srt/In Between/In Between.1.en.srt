00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,560
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,280
(Episode 1)

3
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,200
(Welcome)

4
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,159
(Loading)

5
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,809
(He Zhi Nan)

6
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,000
(Age: 25)

7
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,198
(Occupation: Investment company second administrative secretary)

8
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,719
He Zhi Nan.

9
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,639
An ordinary girl you see on the streets.

10
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,879
A passerby in the eyes of passersby,

11
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,960
but a princess in her own eyes.

12
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,895
She yearns to find the attention she didn't get in life...

13
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,680
in love.

14
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,280
Because it's too ordinary.

15
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,400
She's passionate about being special.

16
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,759
She needs special attention and special love.

17
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,560
She can even sustain...

18
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,530
a super long-distance relationship.

19
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,530
After all,

20
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,639
- in the world of the two people, - He Zhi Nan.

21
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,879
- she'll always be the female lead. - He Zhi Nan.

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,520
Your wage is going to be deducted.

23
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
He Zhi Nan.

24
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,879
He Zhi Nan!

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,638
(Warrior of recovering from breakups)

26
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,800
(Girl next door who looks for love)

27
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,080
- Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning.

28
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,319
Morning, Xiao Hua.

29
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,199
Are you hungry?

30
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,800
I brought you breakfast.

31
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,400
Come here.

32
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,360
You're such a good cat.

33
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,560
You must be hungry.

34
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,199
Signed in.

35
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,319
(Signed in, thank you)

36
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,879
You're right on time, Nan Nan.

37
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,730
- You're here, Ms. Nan. - Morning.

38
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,959
Take a look.

39
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,199
The guy from a prestigious school is coming today.

40
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
Really?

41
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,519
He's my ideal type.

42
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
He's well-educated and handsome.

43
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,920
I like him too. He's very gentle.

44
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,600
He's different from other finance guys.

45
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,439
What kind of girls do you think he likes?

46
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,639
How handsome can he be?

47
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,439
Even Ms. J would fall for him.

48
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
- Whose is it? - Really?

49
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,639
Get to work.

50
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,679
If you have time to chat,

51
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,040
then set up the sign-in desk.

52
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,079
Ms. Nan.

53
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,680
Ms. J is...

54
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,680
Ms. J...

55
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,639
is becoming territorial.

56
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,680
Let me give you context.

57
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,318
Ms. J...

58
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,600
just got divorced.

59
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,920
She vowed to enjoy dating with revenge.

60
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,600
She's targeting well-educated...

61
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,560
and good-looking guys.

62
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,159
Get to work.

63
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Okay.

64
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,720
(Sign-in desk)

65
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,160
Blueberry flavour.

66
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,679
Lemon flavour.

67
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,720
Blueberry flavour.

68
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,399
Which one should I choose?

69
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Hello.

70
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
I'm Qu Yi Peng.

71
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,518
I'm...

72
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,560
I'm He Zhi Nan.

73
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,199
Hello, He Zhi Nan.

74
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,079
Are you here for the seminar?

75
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,240
Did I come too early?

76
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,639
I'll find your seat for you.

77
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,879
Okay.

78
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you.

79
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,920
The blueberry one is better.

80
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,360
What did you say? I didn't hear you clearly.

81
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,640
I said the blueberry one is better.

82
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,040
Xiao Peng.

83
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,759
You're here.

84
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,919
Your seat is right next to mine.

85
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,199
I'll take you there. Let's go.

86
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,159
He said the blueberry flavour is better,

87
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,679
so you chose it?

88
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,450
You listened to him...

89
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,090
because he's handsome.

90
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,159
What is he to you?

91
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,186
I wanted to choose the blueberry flavour anyway.

92
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,490
He just happened to guess right.

93
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,519
Enough.

94
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,039
All right, come on.

95
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,678
You've been at it all night.

96
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,720
What's wrong?

97
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,210
Everything is in vain.

98
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:43,240
Give me the scissors.

99
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,840
What's wrong?

100
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,370
The wedding backdrop was supposed to be fresh flowers.

101
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,960
But it changed in the end.

102
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,120
He and his mom...

103
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,840
called me a spendthrift.

104
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,039
Forget it.

105
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,040
The wedding is around the corner.

106
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,210
Let's not worry about the fresh or fake flowers.

107
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,135
Are our seven years of relationship...

108
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,639
less than 20,000 yuan's worth?

109
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,919
He even said...

110
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,370
if I didn't want to get married,

111
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,330
he wouldn't be marrying me.

112
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,090
Fine.

113
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,039
I won't get married then.

114
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,450
I won't marry him.

115
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,759
- Hey. - Hey.

116
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,535
I'll scold him later. I'll definitely scold him later.

117
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,959
- Yes, she'll definitely scold him. - How could he say that?

118
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,240
I've loved him for seven years.

119
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,960
Everything was worthless.

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,879
I'm at a loss here.

121
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,600
I think the seven years...

122
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,330
wore out their love.

123
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,479
That's why they fight every day.

124
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,679
Gao Peng and I have been together for seven years too.

125
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,210
We're always apart.

126
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,410
We don't even have the chance to fight in person.

127
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,480
Sometimes, I envy them.

128
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,279
But they're in a double bind now.

129
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,759
If they really break up,

130
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,440
her next marriage will be her second.

131
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,919
If they really break up, wouldn't it be a loss?

132
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,080
Yes. Actually, it's worse if they don't get married.

133
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,558
You're better than her.

134
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,480
At least Gao Peng's family is getting better.

135
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,039
If you marry Gao Peng,

136
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,920
you don't have to worry about money at least.

137
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,879
It's not about money.

138
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,319
Hi, what would you like?

139
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,798
Two beancurd skins and two mung bean soups.

140
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,399
Okay, here you go.

141
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,599
- Here. - Thank you.

142
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,719
Hello, what would you like?

143
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
At that time,

144
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,439
- when they were dating, - Take care.

145
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,878
They were very lovey-dovey in the beginning.

146
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,200
They were so sweet.

147
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,320
Even more romantic than my best moment with Gao Peng.

148
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,720
Thank you.

149
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,119
Then tell me...

150
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,000
about your best moment with Gao Peng.

151
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,159
It's nothing special.

152
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,599
It was the summer after the college entrance exam.

153
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,678
Gao Peng invited me and a few other classmates...

154
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,039
to go on a trip to Kangding.

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,279
That place...

156
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,639
was filled with prayer wheels and shrubby cinquefoils.

157
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,200
Under the pure sky,

158
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,120
prayer flags were flying.

159
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,319
We ate and sang...

160
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,599
with our Tibetan friends,

161
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,919
and even played together.

162
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,879
When we left,

163
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,120
he held my hand...

164
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,919
lightly.

165
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,000
That first feeling was unforgettable.

166
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,558
It felt like a blanket...

167
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,359
wrapped around me in an air-conditioned room.

168
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,240
That feeling...

169
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,480
made my heart race...

170
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,639
and made me sweat.

171
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,799
I found out later...

172
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,880
that it was the feeling of love.

173
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,719
That summer was so beautiful.

174
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,879
Time went by so fast.

175
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,840
After that,

176
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,559
he went to study abroad...

177
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,440
and got a job in Hong Kong.

178
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,960
We've been apart ever since.

179
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,080
We could only rely on good memories...

180
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,480
to fight against time.

181
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,200
Gosh, disappointment is the norm in love.

182
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
This won't do.

183
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,719
I need to get more delicious food...

184
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,000
to console myself.

185
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,278
Okay. Would you like some mung bean soup?

186
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,878
We made it fresh today.

187
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,319
Okay, I'll have a hot one.

188
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,599
Okay, that'll be eight yuan.

189
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,798
You can scan the code here.

190
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,919
Okay, thank you.

191
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,640
- Hello, what would you like? - Hello, I'll have this.

192
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,679
Okay, scan the code here.

193
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,600
Three yuan.

194
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,200
Hello, what would you like to order?

195
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,640
Hello, miss. What would you like to order?

196
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,720
What would you like to order?

197
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,359
Why didn't you say hi?

198
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,039
You have nothing against him.

199
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,480
I barely know him.

200
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,918
Why should I say hi?

201
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,399
You know I have social anxiety.

202
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,079
You're afraid that he won't remember you at all...

203
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,680
and it'll be awkward to greet him first.

204
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,398
If you're too friendly, you're scared he'll look down on you.

205
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,039
If you're too cold, you're afraid he'll be sad.

206
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,720
You're not eating?

207
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
I got a membership with Aoyang.

208
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,720
That place is expensive.

209
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,919
Meeting high-quality males comes at a cost.

210
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,559
Right.

211
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,960
It's a place...

212
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,479
where you can proudly show off...

213
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,159
your figure.

214
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,559
Anyone can tell you're a positive and high-quality female.

215
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,199
I'm sure you'll attract...

216
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,519
a high-quality human male.

217
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,919
However,

218
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,840
there are too few high-quality human males.

219
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,399
So far, my huge investment is still hopeless.

220
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,159
Sun Han Han.

221
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,199
A love advisor.

222
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,960
She never fights unprepared battles.

223
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,678
A hundred percent beauty...

224
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,200
plus a hundred percent effort...

225
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,758
make her believe...

226
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,639
that she deserves a perfect ending.

227
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,799
She's sophisticated and smart.

228
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,439
In her heart,

229
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
even love has a price tag.

230
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,679
Sun Han Han knows better than anyone.

231
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,240
At this age, when she has nothing,

232
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,039
she herself...

233
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,480
is the most expensive luxury.

234
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,240
(Make a living, make love)

235
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,680
Do you need help?

236
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,440
- Is it broken? - Step on it first.

237
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,890
Step on it first. Yes.

238
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,799
Look. It's turned on.

239
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,410
Then press start.

240
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Thank you.

241
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,359
Hello, are there any seats?

242
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,039
- Do you have a reservation? - Yes.

243
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
There's an empty seat inside.

244
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:06,321
- But you have to share a table. - Okay.

245
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,279
Hello. Can we share a table?

246
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,240
- Sure. - Thank you.

247
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,959
Their pot sticker is delicious.

248
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,240
It's not bad.

249
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,839
It's not bad indeed.

250
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,200
I saw many people order it.

251
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,079
It's 85 yuan in total.

252
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,280
Just scan the QR code on the table to make the payment.

253
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,758
I'll ask them to separate the bill.

254
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,759
There's no need.

255
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,759
It'll take forever to get him back.

256
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,679
I don't think this is good either.

257
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,359
It's okay. Well...

258
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,200
You can transfer your share to me.

259
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,319
But of course,

260
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,440
I'm happy to treat you to a meal.

261
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,359
I'd feel bad.

262
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,599
By the way, I've seen you at your company.

263
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,649
You might not remember me.

264
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,720
You were busy earlier, so I didn't want to bother you.

265
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,559
I'm sorry. I usually meet a lot of people.

266
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,890
I don't quite remember.

267
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,519
It's okay.

268
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,960
He Zhi Nan, don't get too excited.

269
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,959
The whole thing went smoothly.

270
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,079
He must be a pro.

271
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,240
He could've just let you scan the payment code.

272
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,889
Tell me.

273
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,759
What message should I write for the transfer?

274
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,159
"Happy to meet you." What do you think?

275
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,890
No. That's too ambiguous.

276
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,279
"Thank you, big spender."

277
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,920
You're so old-fashioned, He Zhi Nan.

278
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,600
And you're making it sound like you're familiar.

279
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,799
What should I do then?

280
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,480
I want to be reserved,

281
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,000
but I also want to seem cute and casual.

282
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,240
Mr. Zhou.

283
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Hello.

284
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:26,199
- Are you done working out? - Yes, I'm done.

285
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,318
I'm busy. Think about it yourself.

286
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,440
Bye.

287
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,440
We have a lawsuit we need your help with.

288
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,758
- No problem. - It's about our...

289
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,200
Miss, what would you like to drink?

290
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,480
Okay.

291
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,239
- A glass of water. - This is my business card.

292
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,409
Okay.

293
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,439
How about tomorrow? Let's talk in the office.

294
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,169
Okay. Thank you.

295
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,599
- See you. - Take care.

296
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,559
You're leaving?

297
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,000
Yes.

298
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,839
Miss, your water.

299
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,039
Miss.

300
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,480
It's 15 yuan.

301
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,200
(Thank you, Qu)

302
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,319
(WeChat transfer)

303
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,160
Ms. Gu.

304
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,960
- Did you just get off work? - Yes.

305
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,495
I have some cardboard boxes at home.

306
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,758
That's great.

307
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,199
I'll go upstairs and get them later.

308
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,759
There's a weird smell on the 23rd floor.

309
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,759
It smells like...

310
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,519
stinky tofu.

311
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,519
I don't know if someone put something there.

312
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,999
How about this?

313
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,160
I'll ask the cleaner to do a cleanup.

314
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,400
Don't worry.

315
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,200
- Thank you, Ms. Gu. - You're welcome.

316
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
You're back.

317
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,279
You're awake.

318
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,719
I...

319
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,519
I fell asleep while waiting for you.

320
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,118
You must be hungry.

321
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,199
I'm not hungry.

322
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,359
Go inside and sleep.

323
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,200
I'll heat up some food for you.

324
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,519
Have you been waiting for me?

325
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,680
Are you tired?

326
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,319
No.

327
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,518
Look at you.

328
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,279
Why did you have to catch the night flight?

329
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,000
You should've slept at the hotel.

330
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,598
When you come back tomorrow morning...

331
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,838
and don't go to the office in the afternoon,

332
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,439
your boss won't be able to say anything.

333
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,558
Mr. Wu from the Asia region...

334
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,959
is coming for a meeting tomorrow.

335
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,240
It's not good if I don't go.

336
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,160
If I were your boss, I'd be over the moon...

337
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:41,319
for spending one pay to hire three workers.

338
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,000
Do you think the boss is stupid?

339
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,279
If I don't work hard, who will promote me?

340
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,279
Your sweet and sour spareribs are getting better and better.

341
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,758
Eat slowly. I'll clean up when you're done.

342
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,039
You can take a shower.

343
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,559
By the way,

344
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,959
the article you told me about is due tomorrow, right?

345
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Show it to me.

346
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,799
I only made an outline.

347
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,119
I've been too busy lately.

348
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
If I can't finish it, I...

349
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:15,961
I'll find someone else to write it tomorrow.

350
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,000
Yours is the publication of the parent group.

351
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,961
The big boss at the headquarters will definitely read it.

352
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,318
And it's a cover article.

353
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,480
It's such a good opportunity.

354
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,440
Are you giving it up just like that?

355
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,519
Good opportunities are plenty.

356
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,759
I have to be able to do it, right?

357
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,759
I regret promising my editor-in-chief now.

358
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,880
What if your magazine is a failure?

359
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,480
You'll be hated.

360
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,335
Your editor-in-chief is the vice president.

361
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,839
You're giving him empty promises.

362
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,479
He can casually say in front of the big boss...

363
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,358
that you messed up at the crucial moment.

364
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,559
It'll be enough to ruin you.

365
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,359
Isn't it just general talk about investment philosophy?

366
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,999
Grit your teeth and keep writing.

367
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,640
Look at the time.

368
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,358
I'll hurry and eat.

369
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,399
I'll take a shower afterwards and stay up with you.

370
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,038
Han Su...

371
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,880
is the epitome of a modern-day high-quality woman.

372
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:44,519
She's the neighbour's child who is both loved and hated.

373
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,160
As a well-rounded hexagonal warrior...

374
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,199
with looks, education,

375
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,039
career, ability, and personality,

376
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:53,919
she's always on the road to conquer...

377
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,359
one mountain after another.

378
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,758
Even love...

379
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,599
is just a scenery on her path.

380
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,519
She never cares if she's the main character or not.

381
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,079
Because her world...

382
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,598
is always expanding.

383
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:09,639
(Han Su, 26 Lawyer at a famous law firm)

384
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
(Appearance: 5 stars)

385
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
(Has both brain and brawn, only wants to make a living)

386
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:13,038
(Lone hero, has clarity, offer maniac, workplace genius)

387
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,039
(Flower of older age)

388
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,480
You're awake.

389
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:05,839
What do you think?

390
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,960
The writing is as good as yours, right?

391
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,160
Did you stay up all night?

392
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,960
Just tell me if it's good enough to be submitted.

393
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,039
It is.

394
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,079
I'm sorry.

395
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,359
It's okay.

396
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,560
You've been too tired lately.

397
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,200
But I didn't expect the great lawyer, Su Su,

398
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:31,000
to write about our finance so eloquently.

399
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,599
What a talented writer.

400
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,680
That's because I'm a finance lawyer.

401
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,680
Professional knowledge is a piece of cake to me.

402
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,639
Don't go to work today.

403
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,798
Get some sleep.

404
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,679
I'll make you some soup tonight.

405
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,839
Let's nourish ourselves.

406
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,519
I can't.

407
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,400
Today's meeting is very important.

408
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,278
It's my case.

409
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,720
I can't let others report it to me.

410
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,000
Urban love.

411
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,560
The desire for basic human needs.

412
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,679
Love and hate...

413
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,079
come and go so quickly.

414
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,319
Countless men and women.

415
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,319
Countless emotions and desires.

416
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,039
It's like we're living...

417
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,000
in one Pandora's box after another.

418
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,920
Within this box,

419
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,680
stories of all shapes and sizes happen all the time.

420
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,559
Life is a stage.

421
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,838
Desires and temptations...

422
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,400
can get out of hand...

423
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,318
or die before they're born.

424
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,400
(In Between)

425
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,519
Everyone...

426
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,640
can find their own shadow.

427
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,119
I like spicy crawfish.

428
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:59,000
It's like dating.

429
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,720
You need stimulation.

430
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,039
I like cold crawfish.

431
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,880
It's like running a business.

432
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,680
You need to be cold.

433
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,919
I don't eat crawfish.

434
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,959
Of course,

435
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,880
except when men peel them for me.

436
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,799
Where did you meet your boyfriend?

437
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,439
I picked him up at a bar.

438
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,679
What about you?

439
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
I picked him up on the subway.

440
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,399
Boyfriends aren't trash.

441
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,960
Why pick them up?

442
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,519
But I think our ex-boyfriends...

443
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,240
They were found in the trash.

444
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,839
Why did you break up?

445
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,759
He cheated on me and lied to me.

446
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,759
But I had always wanted to dump him.

447
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,680
He cheated on me and lied to me.

448
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,519
But I cheated too.

449
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,119
He cheated on me and lied to me.

450
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,599
But thankfully,

451
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,000
I got my money's worth.

452
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,039
Come on.

453
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,439
It's up to us...

454
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,039
- To deal with scumbags. - To deal with scumbags.

455
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,200
Do you think Gao Peng...

456
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,799
likes it spicy or cold?

457
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,240
Gao Peng?

458
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,720
He is definitely the crawfish peeler.

459
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,838
What's the show about?

460
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,480
(In Between)

461
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,559
I don't know.

462
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,119
Gao Peng is constantly absent-minded...

463
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,839
when he's on the phone with me.

464
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,359
Based on their logic,

465
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,680
will Gao Peng also end up like that?

466
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,519
Don't worry.

467
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,558
Gao Peng is an honest man.

468
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,720
I'm sure he won't do that.

469
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,440
We don't know that.

470
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,640
I'll call and check.

471
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,200
- Hello. - Hello.

472
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,640
- Hello. - Hello.

473
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:15,518
Babe.

474
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,809
Are you still at work?

475
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,840
Well...

476
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,440
Da Huang is sick. I'm accompanying him.

477
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,519
Babe, let me ask you something.

478
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:26,329
When was the last time you lied to me?

479
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Don't worry. I'm just doing some research.

480
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,519
Gosh, Da Huang. What's wrong?

481
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,879
Is it because you haven't seen me for days?

482
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,558
Did you lose your appetite...

483
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,639
or become depressed?

484
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,809
We haven't seen each other for months either.

485
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,328
Are you listening?

486
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,400
Yes. Babe, I miss you too.

487
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,440
And then...

488
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,079
I think Da Huang is just like me.

489
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,960
He must be lovesick.

490
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,808
You haven't answered my question.

491
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:54,558
I can't talk. I think Da Huang has diarrhoea

492
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,400
I need to take him inside...

493
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,199
and feed him his medicine. Bye.

494
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,159
He's always like this.

495
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,039
- Did he hang up? - Yes.

496
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:14,959
- Morning. - Xiao Gao.

497
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,440
Your bird broke out again.

498
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:17,839
- Xiao Gao. - Morning.

499
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,288
- The warden is looking for you. - Got it.

500
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:20,559
- Hurry up. - Okay.

501
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,745
Xiao Gao, the warden is looking for you.

502
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:26,840
Got it.

503
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,839
Nan Nan.

504
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,960
Don't forget to come to the girls' night out tonight.

505
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:34,440
Okay.

506
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,679
(Yangzi Noodles)

507
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:13,889
The one who danced with you?

508
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,439
- Yes. - Did you add him on WeChat?

509
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,678
Did you add him on WeChat?

510
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,039
That's none of your business.

511
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,038
Come on, let's drink.

512
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,879
- Okay, cheers. - Cheers.

513
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,919
Cheers.

514
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,598
- Forever young! - Forever young!

515
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,360
- Long live freedom! - Long live freedom!

516
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,599
Long live to being single.

517
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:34,719
- That's enough. - Don't drink too much.

518
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,959
You might not fit...

519
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,920
into your size zero wedding dress at the wedding.

520
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,769
I'm fine.

521
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,239
Zhi Nan.

522
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,078
Gao Peng's family...

523
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,599
is getting richer and richer.

524
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,360
You have...

525
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,559
hit the jackpot.

526
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:51,359
If I had known,

527
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,480
I would have said yes to him back then.

528
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,440
What do you mean?

529
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,879
Well... Let's continue.

530
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,078
- Come on, let's drink. - One more.

531
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,768
- To your handsome man. - Yes.

532
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:06,199
To your handsome man.

533
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:07,518
- Let's drink. - Come on, Zhi Nan.

534
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,119
- You still have so many fans. - That's right.

535
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:13,879
I can still drink.

536
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,960
I can still drink.

537
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:18,769
Be careful. Watch your head.

538
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,360
I'll send her home alone.

539
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,760
Why don't you have fun with them?

540
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,920
Okay.

541
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,768
- See you. - Be careful.

542
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:27,960
- Bye. - Sir, drive slowly.

543
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,768
Xu Ying told me...

544
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:33,518
Gao Peng courted her in high school.

545
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,919
He courted her for a semester,

546
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,999
but she didn't like him.

547
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,328
- Really? - Seriously?

548
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:39,598
Yes. She also told me that when they graduated,

549
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,839
Gao Peng invited her to go on a trip with him to Kangding.

550
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,400
Listen. Gao Peng invited me too.

551
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:47,598
Gao Peng invited me too.

552
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,328
- Really? - Really?

553
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:50,559
Why would I lie to you?

554
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,599
Do you know?

555
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,718
Gao Peng and He Zhi Nan started dating after that trip.

556
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,840
See?

557
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:59,289
He planned this all along.

558
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,440
If I had known he was doing so well now,

559
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,558
I would have agreed to go.

560
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,638
You regret it now, don't you?

561
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,399
He Zhi Nan got a great bargain.

562
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
She told me...

563
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:08,118
Gao Peng is always in Hong Kong.

564
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,479
He has no time for her and keeps sending her gifts.

565
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,399
Isn't this the same...

566
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,879
as dating a personal shopper?

567
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,559
A free personal shopper, okay?

568
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:18,159
I wish I could be free and rich like that.

569
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,920
That's called living a carefree life.

570
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,079
Babe.

571
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Why...

572
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,519
Why are you still up?

573
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,329
Gao Peng.

574
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:40,920
I...

575
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
I know.

576
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:46,920
You're doing a surprise check, right?

577
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,159
I'll show you.

578
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,118
No one's here.

579
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,329
No one.

580
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:52,879
It's just me alone...

581
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,199
in an empty bed.

582
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,440
Right. I have this.

583
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,280
The stuffed animal you bought me.

584
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,159
I can sleep so well with it.

585
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,159
You already made up your mind to break up with him,

586
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,760
but you still couldn't bring yourself to say it.

587
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:27,808
So pathetic.

588
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:29,079
No matter how many people...

589
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,199
he confessed to in the past,

590
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,329
I'm the one he likes now.

591
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,808
Wake up.

592
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,569
Whoever agreed to go on the trip with him...

593
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,078
is the one he likes now.

594
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,289
You're not special.

595
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
Call him. Tell him you want to break up.

596
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,440
Tell him.

597
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,960
This is the invitation list for tomorrow's seminar.

598
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,840
Print it out and sign them in accordingly.

599
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:13,288
(Will I see you tomorrow?)

600
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:16,159
(Will I see you tomorrow?)

601
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,920
(You'll be here tomorrow afternoon?)

602
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:46,079
(You'll be here tomorrow afternoon?)

603
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,400
(Forgot to reply to the invitation. Is it too late to reply now?)

604
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,880
(Number 27, Gu Yi Peng)

605
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,519
(Yinzhong Investment)

606
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:18,519
(It's already full, but it's okay.)

607
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,809
(I'm here.)

608
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,360
(Just come.)

609
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,769
That's the rich kid they mentioned?

610
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:40,769
I saw a chauffeur pick her up...

611
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,920
and open the door for her.

612
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:17,679
(Thanks, Zhi Nan.)

613
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,079
(Thanks, Zhi Nan.)
