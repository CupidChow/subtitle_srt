00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 13)

3
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Gao Peng.

4
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,799
I'm in front of your house.

5
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,920
Where are you?

6
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,439
(Little Peng: Enter the password to get inside. I'm in a meeting.)

7
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,530
What the heck?

8
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,638
I'll drink.

9
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,719
- Okay. - Okay.

10
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,479
Hello, Ms. He.

11
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm Emily.

12
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,599
This is Alex.

13
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,096
He was Gao Peng's classmate when he studied abroad.

14
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
He's also my cousin.

15
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,719
Hello.

16
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,879
This is Kathy and Allen.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,279
They were Gao Peng's classmates.

18
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,359
And Jack.

19
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,438
Fiona.

20
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,639
They're Gao Peng's colleagues.

21
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,800
Where is Gao Peng?

22
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,360
Mr. Gao is in his study.

23
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,520
He has an online meeting.

24
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,960
We met in Jiangzhou before.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Do you remember?

26
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,839
Yes, I remember.

27
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,919
Of course I do.

28
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,816
Anyway, we have to wait for Mr. Gao to finish his meeting.

29
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,200
Why don't I show you around first?

30
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,000
Hello, Ms. He. I'm Gumina.

31
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,039
Welcome to Hong Kong.

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,120
Please change your shoes.

33
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,800
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

34
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,439
Everyone likes to visit Gao Peng's house.

35
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,360
It's very convenient here.

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,560
Look at this balcony.

37
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,599
It's beautiful.

38
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,960
Just as Su Su predicted,

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,759
she must have a sense of crisis.

40
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,279
Is this really a good idea?

41
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,439
We'll find out whether it's a good idea or not.

42
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,730
Don't be impatient.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,639
Sometimes, when we look at things from a different perspective,

44
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,570
many answers turn out to be completely different.

45
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,360
What do you mean?

46
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,559
Have you ever thought that the real issue...

47
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,050
between you and He Zhi Nan...

48
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,480
is that she doesn't truly grasp your importance?

49
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,800
In love,

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,280
we all need a sense of security.

51
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,000
However, too much security can backfire.

52
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,319
Sometimes,

53
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,839
a sense of crisis and a sense of security...

54
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,730
are two sides of the same coin.

55
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,026
I heard that you've been in a long-distance relationship...

56
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,169
for seven years,

57
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,239
but the time you've actually spent together...

58
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,080
is less than a few months I've known Gao Peng.

59
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,639
Come on. I'll show you your room.

60
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,680
The clothes and cosmetics inside...

61
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,479
were all carefully selected for you,

62
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,560
piece by piece,

63
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,610
during my shopping trips...

64
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:08,851
around Hong Kong with Gao Peng.

65
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,319
You have to let her know...

66
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
that you're surrounded by choices...

67
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,439
and...

68
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,959
temptations.

69
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,759
My favourite part of the house is the master bedroom.

70
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,920
Is it nice?

71
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,519
Yes.

72
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,879
A bathtub with a view of the mountains.

73
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,279
I'll try it out tonight.

74
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
You should try it.

75
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,879
Last night, I even told Gao Peng...

76
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
that if two people used it together,

77
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,840
it'd be incredibly relaxing.

78
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,680
Are you two close?

79
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,519
Not really.

80
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,560
However, Gao Peng is really thoughtful...

81
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,199
and generous.

82
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,318
We all like him very much.

83
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,398
Gao Peng.

84
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,438
Gao Peng!

85
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,439
Gao Peng.

86
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,240
Nan Nan.

87
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,159
- Gao Peng. - All right.

88
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,279
I miss you so much.

89
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,639
Are you looking for Yi Peng?

90
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,079
I know you. Su Su.

91
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,959
Here. Let me introduce you.

92
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,639
This is Han Su.

93
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,119
She's the lawyer who will soon be working with our company.

94
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,920
Hello.

95
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,040
Hello.

96
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,879
Mr. Gao always talks about you.

97
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,359
I finally get to meet you today.

98
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,199
You must be tired from the trip.

99
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,039
Do you want to wash your face and change into comfortable clothes?

100
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,439
Go ahead.

101
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,639
Nan Nan.

102
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,720
What's wrong?

103
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,319
Did I look...

104
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,680
really bad just now?

105
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,240
No.

106
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,560
This happens to everyone right after deplaning.

107
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,639
Don't think too much.

108
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,958
Did I embarrass you?

109
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,959
No.

110
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,838
I'll wait for you downstairs.

111
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,920
Unpack first.

112
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,439
Han Han, I've thought about it.

113
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,560
Once I'm in Hong Kong,

114
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,399
I'll tell Gao Peng everything,

115
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,039
including my innermost thoughts.

116
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,079
What if he can't accept it?

117
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,319
If he can't accept it,

118
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,759
we can...

119
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,120
just be friends or even strangers.

120
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,759
I'm okay with that.

121
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,200
The more I think about it, the more I feel something is off.

122
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,640
He must be doing this on purpose...

123
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,079
to intimidate me.

124
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,039
This place feels like a spider's lair,

125
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,880
filled with all sorts of tricksters coming in and out.

126
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,160
Did you see how Gao Peng...

127
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,279
is being fawned over by those tricksters?

128
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,319
It's infuriating.

129
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,840
He has really changed.

130
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,480
Why would I confess anything about Qu Yi Peng at this time?

131
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,759
I'm not that foolish.

132
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,840
She's quite ordinary.

133
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,480
I don't think she's a match for Gao Peng.

134
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,279
That means her strengths are hidden away.

135
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,879
No wonder Qing Wen likes to rip fans.

136
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,159
It's quite stress-relieving.

137
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,639
Stress-relieving?

138
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,000
What stress do you have?

139
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,559
Emily, you're not going to do it for real, are you?

140
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,279
Some people have their strengths hidden away.

141
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,840
This makes them more rare,

142
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,159
more valuable,

143
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,919
and more difficult to deal with.

144
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,279
Han Su.

145
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,720
Any man I desire,

146
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,279
I can always get.

147
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,840
- Bye. - Bye.

148
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,038
You don't have to see us out. Bye.

149
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,158
Okay. You forgot your bag.

150
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,210
Thank you.

151
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,535
Go be with your girlfriend.

152
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,039
You guys haven't met for a long time.

153
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,919
I really like your big bathtub.

154
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,159
- Bye, Mr. Gao. - Bye.

155
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Bye.

156
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,120
Bye.

157
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,210
Leave it there.

158
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,960
Someone will clean it up later.

159
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,840
It's the same if I do it.

160
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,240
If you do the work of a maid,

161
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,798
she'll think you look down on her and feel that she is unprofessional.

162
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,840
Just leave it there.

163
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,840
You have a meeting tonight, right?

164
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,999
Han Su sent me a ton of materials that I need to review.

165
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,360
We have a meeting tomorrow too.

166
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,080
You can do whatever you want here.

167
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,480
This person is my ex-boyfriend.

168
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,120
When I found out about her existence,

169
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,960
we hadn't completely broken up.

170
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,399
If she's honest with you,

171
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,039
will you forgive her?

172
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,879
If she lies to you,

173
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,639
will you give up completely?

174
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,279
I...

175
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,240
I want to talk to you.

176
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,640
Let me finish reading this first.

177
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,840
I think we've grown too distant.

178
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,000
We haven't seen each other for such a long time.

179
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,959
It's not that I don't want to spend time with you.

180
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,279
- I'm really busy. - Busy?

181
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,799
I know you're busy.

182
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,480
I'll just say a few words.

183
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,799
I came to Hong Kong...

184
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,879
to tell you this in person.

185
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,759
I'll leave after that.

186
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,799
After breaking up with you,

187
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,159
I met a guy.

188
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,320
He was nice to me.

189
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,799
He cared about me.

190
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,480
I was really into him for a while...

191
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,080
or maybe...

192
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,400
I was just into the feeling of being in love.

193
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,080
When we broke up last time,

194
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,480
I thought you were just throwing a tantrum.

195
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,440
After all, when I returned last time,

196
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,279
we were still so close.

197
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,639
I thought we could reconcile.

198
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,799
I'm confused too.

199
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm confused...

200
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,096
I'm confused as to why I feel so at ease...

201
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,720
- whenever I see you? - Stop it.

202
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,678
Since you chose him,

203
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,239
as long as you're happy, that's enough.

204
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,639
We broke up.

205
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,519
I was really confused during that period.

206
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,759
It felt like two selves were living inside me.

207
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
One said...

208
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,720
to keep it a secret from Gao Peng.

209
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,320
He would be sad if he found out.

210
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,360
The other insisted that...

211
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,200
I can't betray the one I love.

212
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,279
From the time I was 18...

213
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,879
until now,

214
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,759
you've always been the most important person to me.

215
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,960
People can fool others,

216
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,039
but how can one fool themselves?

217
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,239
I felt so touched...

218
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,416
when you came to my house last time...

219
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,480
and gave me the bracelet.

220
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
At that time,

221
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,600
that guy was also pursuing me.

222
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,279
To be honest, I quite enjoyed...

223
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,480
the excitement of such a dramatic situation.

224
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,120
Perhaps it's a girl's vanity.

225
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,160
When I came to Hong Kong, I was really afraid.

226
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,279
I was afraid of making you sad,

227
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,879
afraid of making you angry,

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and also...

229
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,639
afraid of losing you.

230
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,240
However, after I came here, I realized...

231
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,559
that you're no longer the Gao Peng I used to know.

232
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,399
I don't seem that important anymore.

233
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,480
I can feel it.

234
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,279
You love her very much.

235
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,559
Perhaps she's...

236
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
struggling internally as well.

237
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,840
I've said what I wanted to say.

238
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,639
I'm going back tomorrow.

239
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,600
Nan Nan.

240
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,120
You're the person I love the most in this world,

241
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,440
even if you're confused for a moment.

242
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,600
You've been saying so much.

243
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,080
So just tell me...

244
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,639
if you love me at this moment.

245
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,839
All right.

246
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,120
Tell me that you love me.

247
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,360
I love you.

248
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
All right.

249
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:51,759
I love you too.

250
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,399
I love you.

251
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:11,960
(Baibaotang, Chinese herbal jelly)

252
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,000
(Baibaotang)

253
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,839
We've eaten too much spicy food.

254
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,558
How about having some herbal tea to reduce the heat?

255
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,639
Sure.

256
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,759
Here you go.

257
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,120
What would you like?

258
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,158
Two bowls of herbal tea.

259
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,159
- Okay. - Thank you.

260
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,240
Have a seat.

261
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,279
Emily.

262
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,039
Last time,

263
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,199
you left your phone at Gao Peng's house.

264
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,560
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

265
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,279
Han Su.

266
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,879
Don't say it out loud.

267
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,360
Be honest with me.

268
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,399
How far have you and Gao Peng progressed?

269
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,759
I remember Gao Peng said...

270
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,519
he loves Northern food,

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,239
so I purposely packed...

272
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,680
a serving of grilled lamb kidneys...

273
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,119
and delivered it to him last time.

274
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,650
He was quite touched.

275
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,479
He asked me if I was thirsty.

276
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,680
Of course, I said I was.

277
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,279
I asked him to open a bottle of Lafite for me.

278
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,759
And then?

279
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,279
Then he forgot that his bathtub was filling up...

280
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,960
and it almost overflowed.

281
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,359
I also took a moment to admire his master bedroom's large bathtub.

282
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,480
Okay. And then?

283
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,319
Then I took off my shoes...

284
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,960
and helped him clean the floor,

285
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,799
which left me completely soaked.

286
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,649
To be honest,

287
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,450
I don't even consider He Zhi Nan as a threat.

288
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
However, you,

289
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Han Su,

290
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,656
if you want to compete with me,

291
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,920
you're still a worthy opponent.

292
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,759
You really are like a kid.

293
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,358
Do you think that what you like...

294
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,015
has to be liked by everyone else in the world?

295
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,240
Gao Peng is not my type.

296
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,255
Why are you just like my brother,

297
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,479
always treating me like a kid?

298
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,838
You guys might not have...

299
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,559
more experience in relationships than I do.

300
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,079
In this game of love,

301
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,039
you might not play better than I do.

302
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,240
I don't like this game.

303
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,650
I'll miss you day and night

304
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,799
I'm going to go all out

305
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,559
The fireworks in the distance grow increasingly poignant

306
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,890
(He and I have reconciled.)

307
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,679
(Gosh! How did you do that?)

308
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,559
(We've found that old feeling again.)

309
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,920
No wonder you're in such great shape.

310
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,680
I thought you had cosmetic treatments.

311
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,680
Turns out it's the glow of love.

312
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,039
Not exactly.

313
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,920
I just used a beauty device on my face.

314
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,759
I want Gao Peng...

315
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,240
to see the refreshed me later.

316
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,359
The fireworks in the distance grow increasingly poignant

317
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,479
Gao Peng.

318
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,720
I love you.

319
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,000
What are you yelling about?

320
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:30,839
I said,

321
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,000
I love you.

322
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,170
What?

323
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,559
Why didn't you say "me too"?

324
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,680
Me too.

325
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,200
Do you know what I'm saying?

326
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,759
When I say I love you,

327
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,239
you have to say, "Me too."

328
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,279
Me too.

329
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,319
I haven't said it yet.

330
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:09,559
(What should I do? Gao Peng cheated on me.)

331
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,358
(I found it on Gao Peng's bed!)

332
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,680
(It doesn't belong to me!)

333
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:29,079
(I thought you just reconciled?)

334
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,919
(That's the problem!)

335
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,519
(I've come clean, but he's still hiding something from me.)

336
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,039
Who are you texting?

337
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,799
Han Han.

338
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,650
We're sharing some important gossip.

339
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,440
(What should I do?)

340
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,200
(Confront him now?)

341
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,170
Whose is this?

342
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,440
I'm sorry, Nan Nan.

343
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,799
I've had too many temptations lately.

344
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,599
If you tell me the truth,

345
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll forgive you this time.

346
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's call it even.

347
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,838
(No!)

348
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,039
Whose do you think it is?

349
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,559
It's probably Emily's.

350
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,520
There were so many people at the scene.

351
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,890
A barking dog doesn't bite.

352
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Besides,

353
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
the earring seems elegant and refined.

354
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,080
It doesn't seem like Emily's style.

355
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,359
That's a good point.

356
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,279
We don't know the enemy's intentions.

357
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,880
It's wise of you not to make a move.

358
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,720
In a situation like this,

359
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,095
we need to know ourselves and our opponents...

360
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,160
to strike decisively.

361
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,799
Got it.

362
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:05,200
What a poor performance.

363
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,559
What are you doing?

364
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,759
I'm advising Han Han.

365
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,240
Why do you girls...

366
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,119
have to take love...

367
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,039
to such an extent?

368
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,999
That's true.

369
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,079
Why bother?

370
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,160
Who's texting you at this hour?

371
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,920
The company.

372
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,079
Well,

373
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,519
the lawyers work all day until midnight.

374
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,559
The constant emails are driving me crazy.

375
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,719
You sleep first.

376
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,856
I have to reply to this email.

377
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,920
I'll be right back.

378
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,559
Gao Peng.

379
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,319
Gao Peng.

380
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,480
Have you seen the photos?

381
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,920
That's the surfing spot I told you about.

382
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,319
Isn't it beautiful?

383
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,400
You have to come with me next time.

(Huanking Business Building)

385
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,680
The proposal is good.

386
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,616
But that's only part of it.

387
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,680
In our line of work,

388
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:59,759
the most important thing is building deep trust with clients.

389
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,759
Many lawyers rely on time.

390
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,279
You're a newbie.

391
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,519
You should think about...

392
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,159
how to build...

393
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,560
the strongest trust with clients...

394
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,440
in the shortest time.

395
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,519
Understood.

396
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,440
This is only the initial stage,

397
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,640
but you've already made such a thick proposal.

398
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:18,159
It seems like you're determined to win this client.

399
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,640
Even if there's only a 10 percent chance,

400
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,000
I'll still give 100 percent effort.

401
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,599
Why do I feel like it's more than 10 percent?

402
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,281
Seems like there's an 80 to 90 percent chance of success.

403
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,479
Did you discover the secret?

404
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,400
I happened to have an opportunity...

405
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,359
to help the client with some personal issues...

406
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,919
and offered some emotional support,

407
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,079
so it's not really a secret.

408
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,359
It's just good luck.

409
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,719
It seems like there's a lot of romance in there.

410
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,758
Don't get me wrong.

411
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,799
There's nothing going on between me and the client.

412
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,119
Well,

413
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,559
it's none of my business.

414
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,559
Luck is hard to come by.

415
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,518
I hope you hold on to it.

(Hengliyan)

417
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,559
I will.

418
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,000
Amy.

419
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,599
This is Ms. Han Su.

420
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,039
She may be working on our company's listing plan later.

421
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,399
For the detailed company information...

422
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,439
and tax matters,

423
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,656
you two can coordinate directly.

424
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,720
Okay, Mr. Gao.

425
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,480
Okay, thank you.

426
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,559
Please.

427
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,680
Have a seat.

428
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,839
I used to feel stressed seeing so many people.

429
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,680
I can't imagine having to manage them.

430
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,200
Well,

431
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,079
I can't imagine you back at the botanical institute either.

432
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,280
However, the way you got those birds to trust you so much...

433
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,240
shows you've got...

434
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,679
a natural talent for communication.

435
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,616
People and birds don't speak the same language,

436
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,400
but communicating with them is a lot easier.

437
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,720
Sometimes, it's even easier than with people.

438
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,920
I made up with He Zhi Nan.

439
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,759
She told me everything.

440
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Including...

441
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,039
that guy?

442
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,199
The way she described your ex-boyfriend...

443
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,360
was similar to what you said.

444
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,400
She also told me about her feelings.

445
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,559
Actually, sometimes, I feel the same way.

446
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,200
I can empathize with her.

447
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,799
Have you forgiven her?

448
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,400
We've been together since we were 18.

449
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,440
She's the kindest...

450
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,960
and most straightforward girl I've ever met.

451
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,960
I've never been wrong about her.

452
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,839
She's really something.

453
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,440
I'm happy for you...

454
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,680
and for her too.

455
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,319
I still have to thank you.

456
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,759
Why thank me?

457
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,319
Compared to her,

458
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,839
I'm the small-minded one.

459
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,319
Why do you think so?

460
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,255
If it weren't for yesterday's situation,

461
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,719
maybe everything would be different.

462
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,720
Actually, the style of the earring...

463
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,599
is more like that of the pretty lawyer.

464
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,799
So what's your first impression of her?

465
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,880
Do you hate her?

466
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,799
Out of the crowd, she's the only one I find likeable.

467
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,960
Then trust your first instinct.

468
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,720
When you hate a girl for no reason,

469
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,720
it's your subconscious warning you...

470
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,039
that your man has a thing for her.

471
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,400
It must be Emily.

472
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,160
Then go make friends with that pretty lawyer...

473
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:45,359
and use her to understand those other women.

474
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,400
Know your enemy.

475
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,200
Why would she want to side with me?

476
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,519
Don't be naive.

477
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:54,680
You're Gao Peng's girlfriend.

478
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,480
To her, you're like the client's wife.

479
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,920
She'd be more than happy to have you on her side.

480
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:01,799

00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
That's good.

560
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,119
I'll make you some salad.

561
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,359
Let's eat together.

562
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,599
If you don't want to get back together,

563
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:55,839
I can understand that.

564
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,680
I'm not a little girl anymore...

565
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,800
and you don't need to explain anything to me.

566
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,440
I know...

567
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,359
what happened between us.

568
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,359
It's just that I realized it too late.

569
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Otherwise,

570
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,679
I wouldn't have been so foolish...

571
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:10,769
as to divorce you.

572
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,440
Don't think too much.

573
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,329
It's not what you think.

574
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,329
Then tell me.

575
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,000
What happened?

576
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,039
I've explained everything to you about how things are.

577
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,135
It's just that you don't believe me.

578
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,599
There's nothing I can do about that.

579
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,519
We can be frank...

580
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,639
with each other.

581
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,039
You can tell me the truth.

582
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,239
I'm really calm right now.

583
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,329
I admit I was wrong,

584
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,808
so I can understand and accept it...

585
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:46,329
if you yell at me or want me to leave.

586
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:49,000
That's because deep down,

587
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,559
this will always be my home.

588
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,039
Does that mean...

589
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:55,639
you still see us...

590
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,768
as husband and wife in your heart?

591
00:34:57,769 --> 00:34:58,840
Of course.

592
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,199
When we got divorced,

593
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,079
all the assets were under my name.

594
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:09,679
There's also my shares in your company.

595
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:12,329
If we don't get back together,

596
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,440
your losses will be substantial.

597
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:19,489
The money is in your hands...

598
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,519
and I'm here with you.

599
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,920
I'm truly devoted to you.

600
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,079
I promise you.

601
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,559
From now on, I'll live well with you.

602
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,639
What else do you have to worry about?

603
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,719
Do you want the empire or the beauty?

604
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,559
Think carefully.

605
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,079
You don't have to decide now.

606
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,479
Take your time to think it over.

607
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,159
Both of us...

608
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:58,129
have to think about it carefully.

609
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,239
Su Su,

610
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,119
I was packing for a business trip to Shanghai.

611
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,679
Why were you looking for me?

612
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:20,439
You didn't answer my calls.

613
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,920
I was so worried about you.

614
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,440
Why are you going to Shanghai at this time?

615
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,000
Aren't you just giving Zhou Bin a chance to find that woman?

616
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:29,416
If I don't give him a chance, will he just sit around?

617
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,519
Besides,

618
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,839
what's the difference between once and countless times?

619
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,400
Am I supposed to drop everything...

620
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,575
and keep him tied to me every single day?

621
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,559
I don't quite understand your strategy here.

622
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,559
Didn't you say you want to win Zhou Bin back...

623
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:42,039
and declare war on that woman?

624
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,079
I hinted to Zhou Bin...

625
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:45,695
that even if we get back together,

626
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,305
I'd turn a blind eye to their relationship.

627
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:48,639
That's what he wanted me to do.

628
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:50,329
At that time,

629
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,679
Sun Han Han would start to get anxious.

630
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,639
Once she loses her temper,

631
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,719
Zhou Bin will naturally get tired of her.

632
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,719
What if she accepts it?

633
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,519
How many years of youth do we have?

634
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,599
Sun Han Han has a high opinion of herself.

635
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,199
Plus, she's not stupid.

636
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,238
Why would she waste her golden years...

637
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,329
being a third wheel?

638
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,599
But would you still accept a man like that?

639
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,599
Of course not.

640
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,639
The divorce certificate is the worst card I have.

641
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,400
I'm going to turn it into a trump card.

642
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,769
I just want to vent my frustration.

643
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,440
I bet Zhou Bin will come back begging me to remarry him.

644
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,480
At that time, I'll reject him and humiliate him.

645
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,040
I also want Sun Han Han to see him for who he is...

646
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:37,079
and ensure Zhou Bin loses everything.

647
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,880
How many more?

648
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,639
Ten more.

649
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,720
- No. I can't do it anymore. - You can do it.

650
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,840
- You can do it. - I can't.

651
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,559
Hang in there.

652
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,239
I really can't do it anymore.

653
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:58,559
I can't do it.

654
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,679
I can't do it.

655
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,920
It's too tiring.

656
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,559
I realize that women's periods of passion...

657
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:06,880
last longer than men's.

658
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,400
It's always men who come out of the honeymoon phase first.

659
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,329
What do you mean?

660
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,399
I'll always remember...

661
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,880
how tireless...

662
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,158
and youthful you looked,

663
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,769
sweating it out in the gym.

664
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,558
Now that we're together,

665
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,199
you've lost that energy inside and out.

666
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,239
I really can't do it today.

667
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,239
Let's do it another day.

668
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,329
You promised to persevere.

669
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,840
I let you have your way too much.

670
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,400
I knew it wasn't good,

671
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,680
but I pretended not to see it.

672
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,329
The busier you are, the more you have to persevere.

673
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,960
That's the only way I can be motivated every day.

674
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,440
Mr. Zhou.

675
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,559
Mr. Wang.

676
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,519
It has been a while.

677
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,920
Yes. It has been a while.

678
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,809
This is Ya Ya.

679
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,559
You've met before, right?

680
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,199
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

681
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:03,879
I kind of remember.

682
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,920
Hello.

683
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,439
This is my niece.

684
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,520
She just came to Jiangzhou.

685
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,639
Hello.

686
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,816
You just got here too, right?

687
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
Yes.

688
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:13,920
We'll go in first.

689
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:15,399
Let's have a meal together next time.

690
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Sure.

691
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:21,400
Han Han.

692
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,079
What's wrong?

693
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,000
Who's your niece?

694
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,336
Back when we were at the hospital,

695
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,289
who was it that followed me around every day...

696
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:32,449
and kept calling me "uncle"?

697
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,719
Is Mr. Wang also Zeng Cheng's friend?

698
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,000
Look. I'm so tired today.

699
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,919
Let's take a shower and find a place to eat.

700
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,799
How long have you been together?

701
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:13,559
What?

702
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,135
When we bumped into familiar faces outside,

703
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:18,559
he'd tell them that I'm his cousin.

704
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,719
These people are so funny.

705
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,000
Who doesn't know that?

706
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,360
They're still pretending.

707
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,599
I'm leaving.

708
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,000
Didn't you two make it clear?

709
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,519
Why are you still lying to me?

710
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,840
When will you tell me the truth?

711
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,599
I'm going to remarry her.

712
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,719
All my assets, stocks,

713
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,920
and cash...

714
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,039
are under her name.

715
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,558
This is the only way I can get back what's mine.

716
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,759
Don't worry. I'll divorce her.

717
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:34,639
You're single now,

718
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:36,840
yet you can't be with me wholeheartedly.

719
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,495
And you want to remarry and make me wait for your divorce?

720
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,359
Then are you willing to bear the debt with me?

721
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,159
I'll be honest with you.

722
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,720
I don't have a penny to my name.

723
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:48,400
All the expenses were paid in advance by the firm.

724
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,238
Zeng Cheng is the firm's major shareholder.

725
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,479
If she turns against me and digs up the past one by one,

726
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:54,199
my assets will immediately turn negative.

727
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,400
Zhou Bin, you're too greedy.

728
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,679
If you want to hear the truth, I can tell you now.

729
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,615
That would mean suffering and living on nothing.

730
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,679
Are you up for that?

731
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,678
You don't have to threaten me with these words.

732
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:07,960
I have my own job.

733
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,840
I can live without you supporting me.

734
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:11,840
Also, I have my limits.

735
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,039
I can't be your mistress.

736
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,328
Can you put away that whole independent woman act...

737
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:16,329
for a moment?

738
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,440
Look around you.

739
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,159
I've worked so hard...

740
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,640
to give you the life you want.

741
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:23,376
Depending solely on yourself,

742
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,360
it could take you 10 or 20 years to achieve that.

743
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,785
If I were just a middle-aged man with nothing to show for myself...

744
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:31,238
and no money,

745
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,559
would you even spare me a glance?

746
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,119
Who doesn't yearn for romance?

747
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,680
Who doesn't yearn for sweet talk?

748
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:38,599
But the reality...

749
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,960
is too harsh.

750
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:44,079
Every decision I'm making now...

751
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:46,679
is for the future of both of us.

752
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:48,840
That's the reality.

753
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,679
Leave.

754
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,199
Han Han.

755
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:05,159
Romanticism...

756
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,719
requires realism...

757
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:10,678
and even utilitarianism...

758
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:11,679
to sustain it.

759
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,239
What we seek is love.

760
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:16,769
We should relish love...

761
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,160
instead of sacrificing for it.
