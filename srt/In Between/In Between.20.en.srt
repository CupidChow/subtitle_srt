(Episode 20)

3
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,640
Be good. Fasten your seatbelt.

4
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,000
Dad, I want some gum.

5
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,439
You can't eat gum in the car.

6
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,760
Why not, Dad?

7
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,519
Because this is my car.

8
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,680
You have to follow my rules.

9
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,159
(Life's Steering Wheel)

10
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,530
Babe, I'll protect you from now on.

11
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,918
What song is this? It's so bad.

12
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,000
Turn it off.

13
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,759
This is my favorite sticker.

14
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,560
I'll stick it on your car.

15
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,360
This way, you can see me more often.

16
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,800
It's so ugly. Take it off.

17
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,318
Let me tell you.

18
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,800
Only black is allowed in my car.

19
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,638
What are you doing?

20
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,879
Hurry up and take it off.

21
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,256
Can't you show some qualities of a good woman?

22
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,638
You can't wear this in my car.

23
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,199
Why do you have so many rules?

24
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Do you think there are too many?

25
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,401
If so, feel free to get out.

26
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,758
Miss.

27
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,599
Do you have rules in your car?

28
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,520
Yes.

29
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,758
Just one.

30
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,840
Just be yourself.

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,879
Do you want some gum?

32
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Miss.

33
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,520
I think you're very happy.

34
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Really?

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,520
The secret to a happy life...

36
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,319
is to take the steering wheel into your own hands.

37
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,599
Where do you want to go?

38
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,960
The park.

39
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,319
The park?

40
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,000
What do you want to do?

41
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,799
I was supposed to receive the documents five days ago,

42
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,336
but they have been delayed for no reason.

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
I just took a look.

44
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,776
The content we need to review is much more than we expected.

45
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,199
Isn't this a rip-off?

46
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,439
This is too much.

47
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,679
- Are they for real? - Are they for real?

48
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,050
Okay, I'll go to confront them in person.

49
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,120
Confront who?

50
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Molina.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Come with me.

52
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,959
Employees in our law firm can apply for interest-free loans.

53
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,959
Have you looked into the benefits?

54
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,279
I know.

55
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,175
Are you not thinking of going abroad...

56
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,610
to study or anything?

57
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,920
I'll get straight to the point.

58
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,680
I have high hopes for you.

59
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,729
However, in a law firm like ours,

60
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,370
if you aim for significant career growth,

61
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,878
not having an overseas degree...

62
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,240
is a real setback.

63
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,170
I understand what you're saying.

64
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,199
Actually,

65
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,878
I've thought about it.

66
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,560
However, the biggest problem now...

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,360
is that I don't have money.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,730
The tuition is quite a hefty sum...

69
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,839
and I won't have any income while studying.

70
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,560
I'll be living off my savings.

71
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,240
Even with a loan, I can't handle it.

72
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,879
I understand.

73
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,959
Does it look good?

74
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,199
Yes.

75
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,759
Work harder then.

76
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,480
However, it's better if someone gives it to you.

77
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,199
Mr. Gao is pursuing you, right?

78
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,639
I heard he has been dedicated to helping you...

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,399
at the printing company every day...

80
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
without any complaints.

81
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,039
Molina, you're mistaken.

82
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,120
He's just doing his job.

83
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,240
If he really pursues you,

84
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
will you consider it?

85
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,839
He's not my type.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,839
When I had a meeting with him this morning,

87
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,360
he inadvertently asked me about you.

88
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,878
What did he ask about me?

89
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,560
He's concerned about you.

90
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,199
He even asked me if you're planning to study abroad.

91
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,199
I think Mr. Gao really cares about you.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Bye, Sophie.

93
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,360
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

94
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,438
(Let's have dinner together after you get off work.)

95
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,239
(No rush. Just let me know when you're done.)

96
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,399
(Okay)

97
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,199
(Luen Wah Café)

98
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,560
Table for how many?

99
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,639
Mr. Zhong.

100
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,680
Have a seat.

101
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,240
Let me tell you.

102
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,079
This place has the best stir-fried beef noodles.

103
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,920
To make a good plate of stir-fried beef noodles,

104
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,319
the chef needs to be skilled.

105
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,879
Look at the noodles.

106
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,879
They break easily.

107
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,639
They must be flavorful and chewy...

108
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,319
and the beef shouldn't be tough.

109
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,439
Only a good chef can make it.

110
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,519
Timing is everything.

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,920
You've got a good understanding of food now.

112
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,120
I'm a picky eater now.

113
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,120
Is it good?

114
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,319
It's delicious.

115
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,970
Would you like to get another serving?

116
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,840
That's enough.

117
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,638
You're so skinny.

118
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,639
Turns out you're also a foodie.

119
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,039
You eat so much.

120
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,039
I'm so full.

121
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,799
Mr. Zhong.

122
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,519
Lately, someone has been pursuing me.

123
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,759
Really?

124
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,159
Is he handsome?

125
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,090
Why don't you ask me if he's rich?

126
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,758
If you say so, he must be really rich.

127
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,798
He's super rich.

128
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,919
- Is that so? - It's true.

129
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,399
He's so rich...

130
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,239
that even if you don't like him,

131
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,120
you'll fall for his money.

132
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,330
He's pursuing you anyway.

133
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,919
How about this?

134
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,559
Give him more chances.

135
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,279
Who knows?

136
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,039
Maybe you'll like him.

137
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,840
I don't like him.

138
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,240
However, in the past couple of days,

139
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,600
I've been giving it a lot of thought.

140
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,799
Perhaps finding...

141
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,639
a well-off partner in the future...

142
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,759
would be a good choice.

143
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,919
At least it wouldn't be so tiring, right?

144
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,209
I won't have to work overtime and stay up all night,

145
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,919
juggling project after project.

146
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,918
Do you know how tired I feel...

147
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,210
when I go home every day...

148
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:01,210
and walk up those steps in high heels?

149
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,519
Why can't we...

150
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,480
take a shortcut sometimes?

151
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,360
Actually, I worked really hard.

152
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,519
I scrimped and saved to get to where I am today.

153
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,239
But sometimes,

154
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,399
when I look at the people around me,

155
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,759
their background,

156
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,360
education,

157
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,879
qualifications, and connections...

158
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,360
are just so much better.

159
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,679
I don't even dare to consider...

160
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,399
studying abroad...

161
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,840
or getting more training.

162
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,159
I really envy them.

163
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,158
No matter what happens,

164
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,519
they're always so carefree.

165
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,639
I can't do that.

166
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,960
Actually,

167
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,919
I feel quite inferior.

168
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,759
Han Su.

169
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,399
Think about it.

170
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,159
They have a lot of external support,

171
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,440
but you're doing it all on your own.

172
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,559
That proves that your abilities are stronger than theirs.

173
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,279
You have more potential.

174
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,120
You're the best.

175
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,439
Really?

176
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,638
Yes.

177
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,639
Here.

178
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,080
Here's a toast to you.

179
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,159
A toast to the best of you.

180
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,879
Mr. Zhong, let me ask you a question.

181
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,678
If your daughter meets a man with great qualities...

182
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,240
but she doesn't like him,

183
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,799
how would you advise her?

184
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,399
I've told them.

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,240
"As long as you like him,"

186
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,879
"I'll like him too."

187
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,679
Being your daughter must be such a blessing.

188
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,919
Come on.

189
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,679
Don't drink too much.

190
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,399
It's not worth it for a love that's gone.

191
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,080
Who drinks for love?

192
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,879
I drink for my own happiness.

193
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,479
There are so many fun things to explore.

194
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,518
Actually, I'm really curious.

195
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,119
What do you ladies think...

196
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,599
are the top 10 worst behaviors...

197
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,240
a man can have?

198
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,360
That's a great ranking idea.

199
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,600
I need to write this down.

200
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,479
I'll make a list of the worst behavior of men...

201
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,279
and let everyone vote for the top 10.

202
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,200
I need to dig deep into life,

203
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,879
gather stories,

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,518
and through my "Guide to Spotting Jerks",

205
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,320
reveal the ugliest behaviors of men,

206
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,720
turning my grief into views.

207
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,000
Are you seriously going to try out every man on yourself?

208
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,960
I'm impressed.

209
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,159
Why are you sighing?

210
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,360
I got rejected again.

211
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,000
This is my last hope.

212
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,679
Is that woman really going to ruin your career?

213
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,999
There are only a handful of top ad companies.

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,279
The industry is too small.

215
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,440
Zeng Cheng claims...

216
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,816
to keep her work and personal life separate.

217
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,960
What a hypocrite.

218
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,240
After I pay the rent,

219
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,000
I'll have just enough left to survive for three months.

220
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,679
If I can't find a job, I'll really be doomed.

221
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,240
As you always say,

222
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,639
"Tomorrow is another day."

223
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,840
Sun Han Han, you can do it.

224
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,600
Okay.

225
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,879
Tomorrow, I'll start a new career.

226
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,840
Forget about multimedia and short videos.

227
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,399
I'm going to cast a wide net on job sites.

228
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,678
The world is huge.

229
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,519
There's no way anyone can control everything.

230
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,799
You're right.

231
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,159
I need to take this call.

232
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,960
Rui, one more glass.

233
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,320
What's up?

234
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
I heard that Zeng Cheng wants to ruin your career.

235
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,120
I had a big fight with her...

236
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,558
and she still won't admit it.

237
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,079
Is there anything I can help you with?

238
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,158
It's none of your business.

239
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,199
Is there anything else?

240
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,240
If not, I'm hanging up.

241
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,240
I want to talk to you. Let's meet.

242
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,159
I don't want to meet you.

243
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,480
How did you know I was here?

244
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,200
You brought me here before.

245
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,239
You posted on social media and I recognized it at a glance.

246
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,679
Didn't I block you?

247
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,120
You didn't block my assistant.

248
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,159
I want to talk to you.

249
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,038
We have nothing to talk about.

250
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,079
Han Han.

251
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,999
Regarding that matter with Andy, I officially apologize to you.

252
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,360
I was angry at the time.

253
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,080
Out of jealousy, I truly lost my mind.

254
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,816
I don't want to see you struggling so hard to find a job.

256
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,320
I just want to help you.

257
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,240
Can we talk somewhere else?

258
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,120
Zhou Bin, what do you want?

259
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,279
Let's talk in the car.

260
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,879
Just say it here.

261
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:32,879
Han Han.

262
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,320
I promise you.

263
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,480
I'll leave Zeng Cheng.

264
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,840
No matter what you want, I can give it to you.

265
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,279
Just don't leave me.

266
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,039
Stop dreaming.

267
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,399
It's impossible for us.

268
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,720
I just want you to be with me.

269
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,279
As long as you...

270
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,120
Once you get pregnant,

271
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,759
I can logically divorce her.

272
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,720
By then,

273
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,960
you'll be my wife.

274
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,680
Let's talk after you're divorced.

275
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,170
Sun Han Han.

276
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,079
I've put everything on the line.

277
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,079
You're already part of this gamble.

278
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,519
Without my permission,

279
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,839
you can't go anywhere.

280
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,318
So what you're saying...

281
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,696
is that regardless of whether I agree or not,

282
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,839
you won't let me go.

283
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,600
You can find a man who is stronger and wealthier than me...

284
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,599
to rely on...

285
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,599
and then you can get rid of me.

286
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,079
But let me tell you.

287
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,480
In this world,

288
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,319
no one will love you as much as I do.

289
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,600
Do you really not love Zeng Cheng anymore?

290
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,679
Have you made up your mind to divorce her?

291
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,799
Yes.

292
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,000
But she's still diligently trying to have a baby for you.

293
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,559
It failed.

294
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,839
She has given up too.

295
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,199
So you came to me because I'm young...

296
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,295
and can have children for you.

297
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,960
Don't think of me as so superficial.

298
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,890
So when do you plan to get a divorce?

299
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,119
I have it all arranged.

300
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,239
At most, it will take a year.

301
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,360
If things go well, it could be as soon as six months.

302
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,319
Is this ring...

303
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,650
a token of your promise?

304
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,599
Yes.

305
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,960
Okay.

306
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,839
I'll trust you one more time.

307
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,079
Rui, give me a glass of ice water.

308
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:06,920
What? Ice water?

309
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,410
I don't know where those ladies at the table popped up from,

310
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,626
but they insisted on drinking with me.

311
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,000
They couldn't match me.

312
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,720
So they resorted to playing dirty,

313
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,359
acting all coy.

314
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,758
You know I can't stand that, right?

315
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,839
I told them they were playing dirty.

316
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,335
Guess what happened after that?

317
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,170
- What? - They all came up to get me drunk.

318
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,090
There are all kinds of people.

319
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,649
Rui, listen to me.

320
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,558
In this life, never drink with women.

321
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,559
Got it?

322
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,960
This is a truth I've learned.

323
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,559
If you feel she's not up to par,

324
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,650
just say that about her.

325
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,810
There's no need to generalize and criticize all women.

326
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,200
Who are you?

327
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,440
How about this? Drink with me.

328
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,079
If you win,

329
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,696
I'll take back what I said about you.

330
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,960
If you lose,

331
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,039
you have to apologize to all the women here.

332
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,599
Do I know you?

333
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,199
Why should I drink with you?

334
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,680
I didn't do anything to you.

335
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,359
Why should I listen to you badmouth all the women?

336
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,480
Rui, be my witness.

337
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,759
I'm serious...

338
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,170
about this bet.

339
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,680
Do you know her?

340
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,650
Let me introduce you.

341
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,078
This is Wang Zi Lu.

342
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,279
This is He Zhi Nan.

343
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,758
Red wine, beer, or imported liquor.

344
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,839
You can pick.

345
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,890
Do I know you?

346
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,119
Why should I drink with you?

347
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,119
I'm a woman,

348
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,650
but my drinking etiquette...

349
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,519
should be better than yours.

350
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
What does it have to do with me?

351
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,080
If you're not willing to take on the challenge,

352
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,519
just apologize to them.

353
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,095
- Apologize to us. - Apologize to us.

354
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,775
- You made us drink just now. - Apologize to us now.

355
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,889
- Hurry up. - That's right.

356
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,199
- Can you do it? - That's right.

357
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,318
Drink if you don't want to apologize.

358
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,358
Apologize now.

359
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,119
- Do you have no guts? - Apologize now.

360
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,680
- Come on. - Are you afraid to drink?

361
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,039
- Let's do it. - Come on.

362
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,319
- Drink up! - Drink up!

363
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,359
Apologize and it's over.

364
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,960
Apologize?

365
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,359
No way.

366
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,000
- Down! - Down!

367
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,440
- Down! - Down!

368
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,170
Nan Nan.

369
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,720
What happened?

370
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,479
That fool couldn't handle his drink,

371
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,839
but still tried to show off.

372
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,960
- Who's coming with us? - Me.

373
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,199
- Come here. - Are you going too?

374
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,409
I have to go.

375
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,416
I was the one who caused this,

376
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,519
so I have to go.

377
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,119
You should go.

378
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,920
(Ambulance)

379
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,920
Thank you.

380
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,599
Doctor, how is he?

381
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,799
He's out of danger now, but we still need to observe him.

382
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,640
Thank you.

383
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,720
You can't even drink much.

384
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,959
And you still want to challenge me?

385
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,839
You're quite bold.

386
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,480
You're awake?

387
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,759
If...

388
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,240
If one day,

389
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,079
I disappear...

390
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,240
You disappear?

391
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,440
That means...

392
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,519
I've returned to the 22nd century.

393
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,839
The 22nd century?

394
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,440
The 22nd century.

395
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,279
Do you think you're Doraemon?

396
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,920
Am I drunk?

397
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,839
Am I hallucinating?

398
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:50,039
Isn't he your first love at 18,

399
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,519
Leviathan?

400
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,640
The line he just said...

401
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,359
is actually Leviathan's signature on Adou Forum.

402
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,160
It's obscure and pretentious.

403
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,519
He's not my first love.

404
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,839
He's just someone I've never met.

405
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,599
I don't even know his real name.

406
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,480
Leviathan...

407
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
is his online name.

408
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,079
You didn't seem to mind...

409
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,319
when he was sending you indie music suggestions...

410
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,680
and quoting the most romantic movie lines online.

411
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,920
You said he was your everything.

412
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,920
Your first love.

413
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,078
I remember...

414
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,039
you two had agreed to meet offline.

415
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,440
But as soon as you sent him a selfie,

416
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,200
he vanished.

417
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,480
After that,

418
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,599
you sent him...

419
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,200
3,528 tearful messages...

420
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,439
and none of them got a response.

421
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,319
(Leviathan's profile, Personal signature)

422
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,200
Why do you remember it so clearly?

423
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,320
It has nothing to do with my selfie.

424
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,720
He's a jerk.

425
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,880
Now that...

426
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,440
you've come across the jerk who hurt you again,

427
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,920
what's your plan?

428
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,720
(Emergency, Examination, Medical screening)

429
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,920
Did you send it?

430
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,038
We haven't received it yet.

431
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,079
Send it quickly.

432
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,319
Okay, right away.

433
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,359
It's sent.

434
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,160
Please sign off quickly.

435
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,319
Who's left?

436
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,359
Statistics consultants.

437
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
I'll call them now.

438
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,558
It's already past 2 pm.

439
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,640
They're not at the scene.

440
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
Maybe they're already asleep.

441
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:28,039
No. I called them this afternoon.

442
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,360
They'll be waiting for approval no matter how late it is.

443
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Hello?

444
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,679
The final draft has been sent.

445
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,200
Please confirm it as soon as possible.

446
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,839
(Email notification)

447
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,319
It's done.

448
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,359
Congratulations.

449
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,039
- Thank you. - Thank you.

450
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,799
Thank you, everyone.

451
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,039
Ms. Su.

452
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,416
I'll make a toast to you later.

453
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,518
Thank you.

454
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,839
Here. Thank you, everyone.

455
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,240
- Thank you. - Thank you.

456
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Thank you for your hard work.

457
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:01,799
Cheers.

458
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,440
Thank you.

459
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,759
You're amazing.

460
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
You're great too.

461
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,680
Mr. Gao, Ms. Su, let's drink.

462
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,176
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

463
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,239
- Thank you. - Thank you.

464
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,319
Cheers.

465
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,559
Get in.

466
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,640
No need. It's easy to get a taxi here.

467
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,759
It's late now. Just get in.

468
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,720
Okay, thank you.

469
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,720
That's great.

470
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,240
It's finally over.

471
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,160
It's finally over.

472
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,119
It's a new beginning for me as well.

473
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,480
I suddenly remembered the first time we met.

474
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,480
It feels like it was yesterday,

475
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,720
but it also feels like a long time ago.

476
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,119
After He Zhi Nan left, I thought about it for a long time.

477
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,639
I kept pondering...

478
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,200
and finally decided to say it out loud.

479
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,279
I like you.

480
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,759
I know you might have concerns...

481
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,999
because of He Zhi Nan.

482
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,319
To be honest, I do too,

483
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,279
but I also...

484
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,000
have to face my true feelings.

485
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,599
Don't you think so?

486
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,119
Gao Peng.

487
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,318
I'm sorry.

488
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,559
I sleep until now.

489
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,519
Why didn't you wake me up?

490
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,775
You were sleeping so soundly.

491
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,039
I couldn't bear to wake you up.

492
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,015
I used to think you were a species...

493
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,319
that didn't need sleep.

494
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,680
The tension in my brain suddenly snapped...

495
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,720
- and I relaxed. - I understand.

496
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,838
Go home and get some rest.

497
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,440
I'll take my things.

498
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,000
Han Su.

499
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,880
Did you hear what I said in the car just now?

500
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,240
So you pretended to be asleep to turn me down?

501
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,400
Not exactly.

502
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,519
At first, I was really sleepy.

503
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,279
I was in a daze when I heard what you said to me.

504
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,640
I didn't know how to react,

505
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,240
so I just...

506
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,920
Then I really fell asleep.

507
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,680
As I looked at your sleeping face,

508
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,720
I was also hesitating...

509
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,079
about whether to tell you.

510
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:28,799
You know, right?

511
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,200
He Zhi Nan is my best friend.

512
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,400
I know.

513
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,399
So don't reject me right away.

514
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,600
Because I believe you don't truly want to turn me down.

515
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I can wait.

516
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,278
Some things will fade with time.

517
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:49,720
Others might get stronger.

518
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:52,759
Right?

519
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,518
I've spent so much time with you.

520
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,839
Treat me to breakfast.

521
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,240
Let's go.

522
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Come on.

523
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:10,079
Let's go eat.

524
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,039
Come on.

525
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,999
Ms. Hu told me...

526
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,158
that you're planning to study abroad...

527
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,639
and are facing some financial issues.

528
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,640
Did you ask my boss about me?

529
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,239
We were just chatting.

530
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,159
If you really need help, I can help with the fees.

531
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,199
Han Han.

532
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,639
This ring is worth two years of my salary.

533
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,840
If I don't find a job soon,

534
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,119
I'll have to sell it sooner or later.

535
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,360
It's so shiny.

536
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,880
People like us...

537
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,159
appear polished and well-dressed,

538
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,879
but no matter where we go,

539
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,639
we always have to carry a laptop.

540
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,079
Whether it's a message from a client or a boss,

541
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,239
we have to immediately pull out our laptop...

542
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,095
and use our phone as a hotspot to reply to emails...

543
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,719
even in the subway, on the street,

544
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:33,359
in a restaurant, or even in the restroom.

545
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,840
We're on standby 24 hours a day.

546
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:38,000
I've given all my passion and time,

547
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:40,009
yet I'm still living paycheck to paycheck.

548
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,769
In the end, what do I have left?

549
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,238
If love could be sold,

550
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,679
what would it actually be worth?

551
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,519
Youth and grievances?

552
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,919
You're talking nonsense.

553
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,440
Are you mixed up because you're angry?

554
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,360
Last night,

555
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,559
I stared at it for hours.

556
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,079
Look at this house...

557
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,199
and think about City Hua.

558
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,599
I suddenly realized that being independent is so exhausting.

559
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,879
If only there were someone reliable around,

560
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,809
who wouldn't want an easier life?

561
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,719
Han Han.

562
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,159
You're not like that.

563
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,239
You don't love him anymore.

564
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,480
Love him?

565
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:21,960
I hate him.

566
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,769
I hate myself even more for loving him.

567
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,840
The stupidest thing about me...

568
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,440
is that I overestimated myself.

569
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,599
That's why I fell into his trap...

570
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,079
and have come this far.

571
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,000
I've driven myself into a corner.

572
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,639
I'm a mess.

573
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,440
But how are you going to get rid of him?

574
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,400
I've thought it through.

575
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,119
If I want to get rid of Zhou Bin,

576
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:50,880
I have to find someone more powerful than him.

577
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
Who?

578
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,639
Zeng Cheng.

579
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Han Han.

580
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,809
I really can't help you with this.

581
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,199
It's okay. I understand.

582
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,639
I'll look for her myself.

583
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:24,359
Actually, I've been to Ms. Zeng's office a few times,

584
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,439
but the receptionist kept saying she wasn't in.

585
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,519
She wouldn't let me in.

586
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,920
I guess I've been blacklisted.

587
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,679
Ms. Zeng is indeed on a business trip.

588
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,329
She'll be back in three days.

589
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,639
I see.

590
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:46,000
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

591
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,360
(Rucheng Group)

592
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,559
Ms. Zeng, I need to talk to you.

593
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:12,960
I have nothing to say to you.

594
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,856
I've been waiting here for you...

595
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,360
because I wanted to tell you that Zhou Bin has returned to me.

596
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,839
What do you want now?

597
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,999
You've misunderstood me.

598
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,599
I just want to tell you the truth.

599
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,239
I can never be with Zhou Bin again.

600
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:26,936
Do you really not love Zeng Cheng anymore?

601
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,640
Have you made up your mind to divorce her?

602
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,769
Yes.

603
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,161
But she's still diligently trying to have a baby for you.

604
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:34,639
It failed.

605
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,809
She has given up too.

606
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,879
So you came to me because I'm young...

607
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,199
and can have children for you.

608
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,679
Don't think of me as so superficial.

609
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,559
So when do you plan to get a divorce?

610
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,679
I have it all arranged.

611
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:52,856
At most, it will take a year.

612
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,000
If things go well, it could be as soon as six months.

613
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Is this ring...

614
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,519
a token of your promise?

615
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
Yes.

616
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:04,119
Okay.

617
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,679
I'll trust you one more time.

618
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,480
The ring and recording can be used as evidence.

619
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,718
If you need them...

620
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,840
There's no need.

621
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,329
You can get out now.

622
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,038
Ms. Zeng.

623
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:27,199
I know our relationship is kind of awkward.

624
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,809
You want to ruin my career and I accept that.

625
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,360
But please believe me.

626
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,079
I just want to stay away from Zhou Bin.

627
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,039
Who wants to ruin your career?

628
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,809
I've been rejected by several advertising agencies.

629
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,920
You hold a high status and have a lot of influence.

630
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,639
I admit defeat. I deserve it.

631
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,599
You've done all this, so why not just admit it?

632
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:47,639
Which agencies? Tell me.

633
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,159
I wouldn't resort...

634
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,480
to such despicable actions.

635
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,199
Could it be Zhou Bin?

636
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,199
He should know your friends at those advertising agencies.

637
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,159
He probably used your name to do it.

638
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,599
Ms. Zeng,

639
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:09,119
you're the only one who can help me get rid of him now.

640
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,289
Not holding it against you...

641
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,289
is already my utmost kindness.

642
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,400
Why should I help you?

643
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,039
You can keep the ring.

644
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,159
Get out.

645
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,119
I was too presumptuous and reckless.

646
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,440
If I were her, I would have reacted the same way.

647
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,200
Although they don't love each other anymore,

648
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,559
they're still married.

649
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,199
To put it bluntly,

650
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,080
they are just in a shared-interest partnership.

651
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,440
Didn't you think about it?

652
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,400
What would you do if she told Zhou Bin about this?

653
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,329
I've already come this far.

654
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,719
There's no turning back.

655
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,161
I sent her those recordings, but she didn't say anything.

656
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,920
I've made up my mind.

657
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,079
If Zhou Bin still texts me,

658
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,559
that means she's hiding it from him.

659
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,400
I'll forward all the messages to her.

660
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,039
I guess that's the only way.
