(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,400
I'm a bit full.

4
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,680
I had a nightmare last night.

5
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,799
It was so scary.

6
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,999
I dreamt that my no-makeup,

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,038
unfiltered photo...

8
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,530
was played on a loop all day...

9
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,319
at the biggest square in the city.

10
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,758
There were tons of people watching.

11
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,759
It freaked me out.

12
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,759
I had a similar dream before.

13
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,370
I dreamt that my legal document,
full of typos,

14
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,879
was projected on a big screen...

15
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,240
with my name next to it,

16
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,680
playing on a loop all day.

17
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,439
Those dreams are nothing
compared to mine.

18
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,879
I dreamt that...

19
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,530
our over 20 years of chat history...

20
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,879
was being shown on that screen,

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,199
playing all day long.

22
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,529
That's scary.

23
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,559
Go to sleep.

24
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:45,520
(The Ultimate Nightmare)

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,680
(The Ultimate Nightmare)

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
(Pool bar)

27
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,560
Okay, I'll go back tomorrow.

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,520
Tomorrow morning.

29
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,439
(Zeng Cheng)

30
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,520
(Yesterday, this week)

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,478
She's a workaholic.

32
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,519
Why...

33
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,840
Why are you peeping at my phone?

34
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,439
Who were you on the phone with?

35
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
You've been talking forever.

36
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Zeng Cheng.

37
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,679
She seems perfectly fine.

38
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,879
She's in a good mood
and her work isn't affected.

39
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,638
She also didn't announce
to the world...

40
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,639
that she's single again.

41
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,800
Han Han.

42
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,319
There's something
I need to discuss with you.

43
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,438
I've booked a flight
for early tomorrow.

44
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,560
I have to rush back.

45
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,918
Why?

46
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,120
Aren't we staying for one more day?

47
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,039
There's a problem with Zeng Cheng.

48
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,479
She needs me.

49
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,000
You know Zeng Cheng.

50
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,120
You've met her too.

51
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,879
But no one knows
what she's really like...

52
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,360
except me.

53
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,120
What do you mean?

54
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,480
Actually, Zeng Cheng
is very fragile and sensitive.

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,279
She has to keep up
appearances outside,

56
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,279
which puts even more stress
on her privately.

57
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,000
The divorce has hit her hard.

58
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,879
She was crying
on the phone just now...

59
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,319
and she was very emotional.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,318
So I promised her
I'd go back to visit her.

61
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,839
Who would have stable emotions
after a divorce?

62
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,240
Han Han.

63
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,729
When Zeng Cheng was in college,

64
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,730
she suffered from bipolar disorder.

65
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,199
She got better after treatment.

66
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,079
I'm worried that
the divorce will provoke her.

67
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,878
If she relapses
and her health takes a hit,

68
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,050
I'd feel very guilty.

69
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,170
Han Han.

70
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,170
Listen to me.

71
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,120
You're the most sensible girl
I've ever met.

72
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,519
Although Zeng Cheng
and I are separated,

73
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,279
but we were married
for more than 10 years.

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,560
I can't just stand by
during her toughest times.

75
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,730
You can understand that, right?

76
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,480
Haven't you made
your divorce public?

77
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,560
It can only be made public
when she feels it's appropriate.

78
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,610
This was our agreement
during the divorce.

79
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,278
She values her reputation a lot
and we have...

80
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,720
- a common circle of friends.
- What about me?

81
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,319
This is a different matter.

82
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,639
For her, it's about responsibility.

83
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,839
For you, it's about feelings.

84
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,359
You know I love you.

85
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,399
Even if it's not announced,

86
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,559
you can at least let her know...

87
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,719
you have a new girlfriend,
can't you?

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
No.

89
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,639
When the time is right,
I'll tell her.

90
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,759
Telling her now
will only provoke her.

91
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,839
Right?

92
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,879
Why...

93
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,959
Why should we
create trouble for ourselves?

94
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,279
You saw her Moments, right?

95
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,439
Why is she working so hard?

96
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,199
Taking the early flight out
and the late flight back.

97
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,680
She just doesn't want
to face reality.

98
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,319
It's nothing but avoidance.

99
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,000
She doesn't want to be alone.

100
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,920
This situation...

101
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,600
won't last long.

102
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,720
You have to trust me.

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
I know...

104
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
what I'm doing...

105
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,319
and my boundaries.

106
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,240
I knew...

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,000
you'd understand me.

108
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,199
You certainly won't stoop...

109
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,759
to such vulgar thoughts.

110
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,480
Since you've put it that way,

111
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,680
even if I have vulgar thoughts,
I can't say them out loud.

112
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,160
However, I have a condition.

113
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,279
What is it?

114
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
When you visit her,

115
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:00,000
you have to think of me
all the time.

116
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,199
Of course.

117
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,480
The way you treat your ex-wife...

118
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,839
shows that
you're a sentimental person.

119
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,680
Han Han.

120
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,439
You're the most
understanding girl...

121
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,279
I've ever met.

122
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,480
I'm so lucky to have met you.

123
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,680
Babe.

124
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,279
Babe.

125
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,360
Hello.

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,039
He Zhi Nan.

127
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,120
He Zhi Nan.

128
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
He Zhi Nan.

129
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,360
Babe.

130
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,279
Hello?

131
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,330
Lazy bum.

132
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,090
Why aren't you up yet?

133
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,090
I called you so many times,
but you didn't answer.

134
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,639
What are your plans today?

135
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,039
What plans can there be?

136
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,240
I'll just stay home with my parents.

137
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,759
What a surprise.

138
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,360
You said you wouldn't spend
the whole weekend at home.

139
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,210
It's my grandma's birthday...

140
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,279
next week.

141
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,329
Are you hiding something from me?

142
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,399
No.

143
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,279
What makes you think so?

144
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,039
Nan Nan.

145
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,399
We just got together.

146
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,879
What I like...

147
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,360
is your honesty and sincerity,

148
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,519
so I hope you won't hide anything...

149
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,039
from me.

150
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,600
Tell me the truth.

151
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,638
Did I scare you?

152
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,919
I'm just kidding.

153
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,600
Why are you doing this to me...

154
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,879
early in the morning?

155
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,479
I'm still half asleep.

156
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,559
All right.

157
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,090
I know you're still half asleep.

158
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,879
I just wanted
to help you wake up faster.

159
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,600
Well, please wish your grandma
a happy birthday for me.

160
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,239
Bye.

161
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Bye.

162
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,679
Babe.

163
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,759
He Zhi Nan.

164
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,638
Babe.

165
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,720
He Zhi Nan.

166
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,999
Slow down.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,398
You can't stay here tonight.

168
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,399
Yes, I understand.

169
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,879
You can either go home
or go to a hotel.

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,440
Nan Nan, listen to me.

171
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,840
I understand what you mean.

172
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,159
I have to face...

173
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,039
my miserable life.

174
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,120
I have to face my parents.

175
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,559
I'll do as you say.

176
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Okay?

177
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,159
That's more like it.

178
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,120
Let's check out the mall
before I go home.

179
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,320
I'm not going.

180
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,158
Come on. It's still early.

181
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,799
I'm not going.

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Just for a while.

183
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,799
Think of it as helping me
with some mental preparation.

184
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,038
Okay?

185
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,799
- I'm not ready yet.
- Let go of my hand.

186
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,840
I'm not ready yet.

187
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,879
Buy whatever you want.

188
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,360
Upstairs.

189
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,639
They have food upstairs.

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,559
Let's get something to eat
after this.

191
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,398
Let's check out this shop.

192
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,399
Come on.

193
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,840
- Welcome.
- Hello.

194
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,320
What's wrong?

195
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Nothing.

196
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,600
Their clothes are nice.

197
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,199
There are no men's clothes here.

198
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Why are we here?

199
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Didn't you always say...

200
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:12,319
you didn't have appropriate clothing
for the company's annual event?

201
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Take a look.

202
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:14,559
I don't want to buy clothes anymore.

203
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,320
We're already here. Take a look.

204
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,399
Hello, sir. How may I help you?

205
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,600
Do you have
this year's new collection?

206
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,239
Yes, it's over there.
Let me show you.

207
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,320
Okay.

208
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,638
(I saw you with him!)

209
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,519
(Nan Nan, I'm very sad.
Why did you lie to me?)

210
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,679
Whatever happens will happen.

211
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,480
Nan Nan.

212
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,000
What do you think of this?

213
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,080
It's nice, right?

214
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,600
Look at its design.

215
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,559
And the pants too.

216
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,679
Your phone is ringing.

217
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm going to try it on.

218
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:20,919
Hello?

219
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,000
You're with him, right?

220
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Don't panic.

221
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,399
Where are you?

222
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,919
I saw him.

223
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,879
What's done is done.

224
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,600
Let's hear what he has to say.

225
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,399
I miss you so much.

226
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,919
I'm so jealous that I'm going crazy,

227
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,879
but I still miss you so much.

228
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,360
I'll wait for you.

229
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll be right back.

230
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,480
Okay, I'll wait for you.

231
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,519
I won't bother you anymore.

232
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Don't just stand there.

233
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,919
Gao Peng is waiting for you outside.

234
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Take this opportunity
to clear things up with him.

235
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,759
(Qu: Nan Nan, I love you)

236
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,120
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

237
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,559
Why...

238
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
Why aren't you wearing it?

239
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,720
I don't want it.

240
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,200
No.

241
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,279
That shirt is pretty.

242
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,558
- Try it on.
- That shirt...

243
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,799
If you want to buy it,

244
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,039
you'll have to spend
your parents' money.

245
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,720
You're giving them
the silent treatment...

246
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,320
while spending their money.

247
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,120
How can you confidently announce
that you've grown up?

248
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,039
- But I...
- Gao Peng.

249
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,399
You can't avoid
what you have to deal with.

250
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,440
If you really want
to give me a gift,

251
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,000
spend your own money.

252
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,279
Go back and talk to your parents.

253
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,679
Okay?

254
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,798
Go back and talk to your parents.

255
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,879
Take your time.

256
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,960
Call me if you need anything.

257
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,799
You too.

258
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,960
Bye.

259
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,799
How despicable.

260
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,840
The worst part is that
you're actually enjoying it.

261
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,158
Being liked by two people
at the same time...

262
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,159
proves I'm attractive,

263
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,159
so why can't I be happy?

264
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,758
There's nothing wrong
with being pursued.

265
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,119
But if you enjoy it,
you're being trashy.

266
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,600
Lying to enjoy it
makes you even worse.

267
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,440
(Shengyi Taxi)

268
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,799
What's wrong?

269
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,890
What are you thinking about?

270
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,410
Nothing.

271
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,558
I just think...

272
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,890
that the past few days
have been so wonderful.

273
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,359
It feels like a dream.

274
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll be back to reality soon.

275
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,519
Silly girl.

276
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,559
Currently,
the route ahead is congested.

277
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,000
The estimated travel time
is 50 minutes.

278
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,479
It's way too congested
going to my place at this hour.

279
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,000
I might as well take the ferry
and then switch to the subway.

280
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,000
That won't do.
Let me give you a ride.

281
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,119
By the way,
why do you live so far away?

282
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,559
You must spend a lot of time
commuting every day.

283
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,839
Mr. Zhou.

284
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:45,759
That's easy for you to say,

285
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,650
but I can't afford to rent
a place closer to the company.

286
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,758
That's easy.

287
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:50,919
I'll rent it for you.

288
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
No.

289
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,890
If I live in the house you rent,
I'll be like your kept woman.

290
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't want that.

291
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,920
Just drive...

292
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,759
and take me to the ferry terminal.

293
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,799
Be careful on the road.

295
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,960
Text me when you get home.

296
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,649
Don't worry.

297
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,440
I take this route twice daily.

298
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,559
It's not like
I'm going on an adventure.

299
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,439
Hurry up and go.
Parking isn't allowed here.

300
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
- All right.
- Bye.

301
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:34,519
Bye.

302
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,240
I'm a bad woman.

303
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,519
A typical jerk.

304
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,519
Even Sun Han Han
thinks you're a jerk.

305
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,000
You're really a jerk.

306
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,440
To be honest, aren't you happy?

307
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,720
A little.

308
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:33,519
When they're fighting over me,

309
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,440
it makes me feel like
they care about me.

310
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,359
I'm quite happy.

311
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,799
You're incorrigible.

312
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,319
Get your morals back in check...

313
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,559
and put away
that darned sense of satisfaction.

314
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,039
Qu Yi Peng
is not answering my calls.

315
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,719
Do you think he's ignoring me?

316
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,759
Serve you right.

317
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,440
Don't worry.

318
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,799
Jealousy only makes men
love you more.

319
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,920
- Qu Yi Peng?
- Gao Peng?

320
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,838
You have to make it clear
to Gao Peng...

321
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,920
before you see him.

322
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,519
Boyfriend?

323
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,759
Ex-boyfriend.

324
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,650
He has left.

325
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,200
Did you lie to me?

326
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,960
Did he sleep
at your place last night?

327
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,759
No.

328
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,119
He had a fight with his parents
and had nowhere to go.

329
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,960
He slept on the couch.

330
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,799
I swear.

331
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,119
Why are you telling me this now?

332
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,839
I don't want you to overthink it.

333
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,799
Nan Nan.

334
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,410
Do you have any expectations...

335
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,599
for our future?

336
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
I don't know.

337
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,400
What about you?

338
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,720
I want us to get married.

339
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,640
What do you think?

340
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,160
Actually,

341
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
I don't have a clear idea...

342
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,200
about marriage.

343
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,880
I'm not in a hurry either.

344
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,599
But the word "marriage"...

345
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,400
feels so sacred,

346
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,000
romantic,

347
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,799
and blissful.

348
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,920
It's like being acknowledged,

349
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,119
loved,

350
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,559
and chosen by someone.

351
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,039
It's like earning
a certificate of love.

352
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,200
Let's review
the key points from the last video.

353
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,319
Many people...

354
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,720
no longer believe
in the phrase "I love you".

355
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,758
They see it as
an expression of emotion...

356
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:50,759
rather than a commitment.

357
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,318
It has long become...

358
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,279
the most clichéd
and irresponsible phrase.

359
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,079
It's merely a passionate declaration
without any responsibility.

360
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,480
Always keep in mind...

361
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,959
that when interacting
with a partner,

362
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,038
a meaningful confession...

363
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,279
should be as fitting...

364
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,240
and sincere as a commitment.

365
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:05,920
"I want us to get married"
is different.

366
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,758
This phrase hasn't been overused.

367
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,000
It's still full of ceremony...

368
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,559
and the warmth of life,

369
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,400
embodying the beauty
of walking hand in hand.

370
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,880
(I'm currently trying...)

371
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,880
Babe.

372
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,759
Babe.

373
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:38,839
Gao Peng.

374
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,240
I wish I could speak
to you openly...

375
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,799
and honestly in person,

376
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,000
but whenever the words
are on the tip of my tongue,

377
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,599
I can't seem to say them.

378
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,880
I'm currently trying
to start a new relationship.

379
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,319
No matter what,

380
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,680
we've shared
a lot of wonderful moments...

381
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,279
over the past seven years.

382
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Nan Nan.

383
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,000
Thank you.

384
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,479
If it weren't for you,

385
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,640
I really have no idea
what I would have done.

386
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,440
- Gao Peng.
- Listen to me, Nan Nan.

387
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,640
Listen to me.

388
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,160
On my way home yesterday,

389
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:48,920
I kept thinking
about what you said...

390
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,358
to calm myself down.

391
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,359
It's really effective.

392
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
Listening to them calmly
is actually not that hard.

393
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,240
You're right.

394
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,799
I'm the one
who refused to communicate.

395
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,160
I felt it for the first time...

396
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,839
that my parents...

397
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,880
are getting old.

398
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,960
They need me...

399
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
and anticipate my support.

400
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,439
The way they want to speak,

401
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,599
but are afraid of making mistakes...

402
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:17,599
makes me feel uneasy and guilty.

403
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,599
So I've decided.

404
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm going to Hong Kong tomorrow.

405
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,880
I'll gradually take over their work.

406
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,039
Don't worry.

407
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,839
I've bought a lot of food.

408
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,679
This is pineapple.

409
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,759
Seasonal pineapples.

410
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:39,319
These are for Jojo.

411
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,200
And these little persimmons.

412
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,720
And most importantly,

413
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
this bottle of wine.

414
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,680
We have to finish it.

415
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,720
These are chopsticks.

416
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:51,039
There's a lot anyway.

417
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,119
We'll go downstairs to buy more
after we finish these.

418
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,359
- If you want anything...
- Gao Peng, we broke up.

419
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,839
It's okay to break up.

420
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,999
We broke up a few times before.

421
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,400
- Didn't we make up?
- It's different this time.

422
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,640
We're not kids anymore.

423
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,838
I'm serious.

424
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,839
No.

425
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,200
Don't do this, Nan Nan.

426
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Sit down.

427
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,400
It was all my fault.

428
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,598
I promise to change.

429
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,039
Give me another chance, okay?

430
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,079
This.

431
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,199
Why are you going through my stuff?

432
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
I'm not.

433
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,640
I bid it this morning...

434
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,960
and chose to meet in person.

435
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,720
When I saw you listing it
on the online marketplace,

436
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,078
I was so angry.

437
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,440
That's why I called you.

438
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:53,640
But after I called you,
I regretted it.

439
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,440
As you know,
I'm bad at coaxing people.

440
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,559
Especially over the phone.

441
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,720
I was afraid I'd make things worse,

442
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,559
so I thought
I should talk to you in person...

443
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,200
to clarify things
and ask for a reconciliation.

444
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,039
Nan Nan, listen to me.

445
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,758
Please listen to me.

446
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:06,759
Listen to me.

447
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,599
It's 49,999.

448
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,759
I know.

449
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,720
You marked the price
so that I would buy it back.

450
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,079
The first time...

451
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,440
I saw you wearing it
seven years ago...

452
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,279
feels like just yesterday.

453
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,200
I don't remember...

454
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,240
the title or plot of that movie.

455
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,640
Because at that time,

456
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,319
I was only looking at you.

457
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,720
I remember you were crying...

458
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,640
with tears and snot all over.

459
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,240
What are you looking at?

460
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,799
It's so spicy.

461
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Come on.

462
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,640
Let's go.

463
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,480
(Jiangzhou Taxi)

464
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,839
I still remember...

465
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,680
how good we were,

466
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,160
- If you...
- but it's in the past now.

467
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,319
No.

468
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,038
No. I'll go home now.

469
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,039
- I'll tell my parents...
- Gao Peng.

470
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,039
that I'm not going to Hong Kong.

471
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,118
I'll leave after we reconcile.

472
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,160
- Okay?
- Gao Peng.

473
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,919
Gao Peng, are you
throwing a tantrum again?

474
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,719
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

475
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,798
You're the one who doesn't want
to go back to Hong Kong.

476
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:43,838
Don't use me as an excuse.

477
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,919
I didn't.

478
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,440
I sincerely want
to start over with you.

479
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:48,960
Sincerely?

480
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,319
It's too late.

481
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,839
How is it too late?

482
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,359
How is it too late?
It's not too late.

483
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,079
There's still
a cooling-off period for divorce.

484
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,480
We can break up
if you really want to.

485
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,759
Let's wait until
the cooling-off period is over.

486
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,200
Right now,

487
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,640
I'm very calm.

488
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
You're not very calm.

489
00:32:08,681 --> 00:32:09,720
You're not.

490
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,880
In three months and five days,

491
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,400
it will be our seventh anniversary.

492
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,960
We agreed last year...

493
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,440
that we'd celebrate it
in Hong Kong this year.

494
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,640
Did you forget?

495
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You didn't forget.

496
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,279
Right?

497
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,000
You didn't forget at all.

498
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,999
(Seventh anniversary)

499
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,039
By the way,

500
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,000
I've bought you
the ticket to Hong Kong.

501
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,279
I've added it
to the list of reminders.

502
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:10,880
Your phone will remind you.

503
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,759
Nan Nan.

504
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:15,720
Do you have any expectations...

505
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,480
for our future?

506
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,599
What about you?

507
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,559
I want us to get married.

508
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,319
One is a tall, handsome,
and dedicated scholar.

509
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,440
The other
is a wealthy business elite.

510
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
One is asking for marriage...

511
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:33,920
and the other
is seeking reconciliation.

512
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,839
This is too satisfying...

513
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,359
and too sinful, isn't it?

514
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,319
Don't you feel guilty?

515
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,119
After we broke up,

516
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,880
I didn't tell Gao Peng...

517
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,639
that I have a new boyfriend...

518
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,759
because I'm afraid he can't take it.

519
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
What would you like?

520
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:50,039
Two bowls of noodles, please.

521
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,160
Okay, two bowls of noodles.

522
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,279
Tell me the truth.

523
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,639
Are you leaving yourself
a way out...

524
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,000
- by not being honest with Gao Peng?
- Your noodles.

525
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,119
Here, your noodles are ready.

526
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,480
I couldn't bring myself to tell him.

527
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,839
I just couldn't make myself
send him the letter I wrote.

528
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,880
I originally planned to wait
until he returns to Hong Kong...

529
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,000
to talk to him about it slowly.

530
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,769
I have to remind you
at this crucial moment.

531
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,809
With Gao Peng's
current capabilities,

532
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,880
he should be a very desirable match.

533
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:17,769
I know.

534
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,769
Do you really not love him anymore?

535
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,119
Sometimes,

536
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,679
I find myself feeling lost.

537
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,920
I'm too familiar with him.

538
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,719
The familiarity between us...

539
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,960
can be exhausting,

540
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:51,329
yet it also provides
a unique sense of security.

541
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,769
Anyway, when I'm with Qu Yi Peng,
it's a whole different experience.

542
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,038
Are you in love with Qu Yi Peng...

543
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,719
or is it just the excitement
of a new romance?

544
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,840
It might be both.

545
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,960
Can you really tell the difference?

546
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:11,719
You're right.

547
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:16,289
When you talked about Gao Peng,

548
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,960
it reminded me of Zhou Bin
and his ex-wife.

549
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,480
They must have developed
a familial bond.

550
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,769
He said that's different from love.

551
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:25,480
Our relationship is full of passion,

552
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,159
but can passion last forever?

553
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,289
I don't know.

554
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,879
Why are you here?

555
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,480
What? Am I not welcome?

556
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,638
Come on in.

557
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:27,639
Do I need to change my shoes?

558
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,718
No.

559
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,809
What happened to you?

560
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,199
Didn't you drive?

561
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,809
No, I took the subway.

562
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:37,440
Didn't you tease me last time?

563
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,599
I thought
I should really experience...

564
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,440
what your daily commute is like.

565
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,880
I haven't taken the subway
for years.

566
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,639
When I entered the subway station,
I was like a headless chicken.

567
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:53,480
I didn't even know
where to buy a ticket.

568
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,329
After finally getting one,

569
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,639
I got crammed into the subway...

570
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,769
like a lightning bolt.

571
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,920
I even ended up
at the wrong station.

572
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,599
When I exited the station,
I even went to the wrong exit.

573
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,559
And just my luck,
it started raining.

574
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,359
Hurry up
and drink some cold medicine.

575
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,360
Don't catch a cold.

576
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:17,400
Thank you.

577
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:19,809
I counted.

578
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,719
From your office to home,

579
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,880
there are 17 stops in total.

580
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,079
You have to transfer three times...

581
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,039
and it takes
a full hour and nine minutes.

582
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:31,880
Your daily life...

583
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,480
is too tough.

584
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,079
Mr. Zhou.

585
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,840
You've just experienced
the hardships of the commoners...

586
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
and you can't take it anymore.

587
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,480
I already got used to it.

588
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,638
With my headphones on,

589
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,289
I can listen to audiobooks,
music, and lectures.

590
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,239
Sometimes,
I even binge-watch dramas.

591
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,519
Before I know it, time has flown by.

592
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,000
I guess I have a lot
to learn from you.

593
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,559
I happen to be cooking.

594
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,000
Do you want to eat something
before you go?

595
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:03,639
It's my pleasure.

596
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,920
- Thank you.
- Have some soup first.

597
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,440
They're just some simple dishes.

598
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,519
What do you think?

599
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,159
It's not bad.

600
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,159
You usually eat
pretty light, don't you?

601
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
By the way,

602
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:33,000
about what I told you
at the ferry terminal,

603
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:34,119
what do you think?

604
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,679
I just want to rent...

605
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,119
a place near your office.

606
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,159
That way,
it'll be convenient for you too.

607
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,679
Don't worry.

608
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,159
I'll take care of everything.

609
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:53,920
Do you mean you'll pay for the rent?

610
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,199
Of course.

611
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,400
Is that house
considered yours or mine?

612
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,079
You paid for the rent.

613
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,480
Of course it's yours.

614
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,719
If I stay there,

615
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,519
naturally, I'll be yours.

616
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:11,360
If I eat the food you cook,

617
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,288
will I be yours too?

618
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:14,360
Not necessarily.

619
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:18,329
What I mean is,

620
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,440
they're two different things.

621
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:21,518
We're in a good relationship now.

622
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:22,599
That's why you say so.

623
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,119
If we don't get along in the future,

624
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,960
do I have to move out immediately?

625
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,079
To me,

626
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,119
relationships are pure.

627
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,769
I don't want to give up
my equality and freedom...

628
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,719
just because
I'm living in your house.

629
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,920
You're young,

630
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,199
but you have a set of principles.

631
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,880
If we fight in that house,

632
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,289
would you leave or would I?

633
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,519
Of course I'll leave.

634
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,289
I just want you
to live a comfortable life.

635
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,440
To be honest,

636
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,079
I really can't bear to see
the woman I love...

637
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,559
suffer and go through this hardship.

638
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,880
All right. I get it.

639
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:08,719
Your sincerity
is more than enough for me.

640
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,880
As for renting a house for me,

641
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,920
I won't accept it.

642
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Good morning.

643
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,159
Good morning.

644
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:36,808
Good morning.

645
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:37,809
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

646
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:39,329
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

647
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,239
Good morning.

648
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,480
Ever since I found out
he's in Hong Kong,

649
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,840
everything I've done
is to get close to him.

650
00:41:57,809 --> 00:41:59,039
Was it for revenge?

651
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,519
Good morning.

652
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,679
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

653
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,039
Molina.

654
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:11,039
Dingbao just sent this to us.

655
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:12,840
Okay, thank you.

656
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:14,880
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Ms. Hu.

657
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,329
I read your email on my way.

658
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,329
It was sent at 3am.

659
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:20,599
Don't you ever sleep?

660
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:21,840
I got some sleep.

661
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,880
I don't sleep much
since I was little.

662
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,480
I'll be fine
after five to six hours of sleep.

663
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,519
I really envy you.

664
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,960
If I don't sleep
for at least eight hours,

665
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,329
my brain doesn't want to function.

666
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,679
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

667
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
Good morning.

668
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,439
I read your report.

669
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,519
It's well done.

670
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:38,239
It's comprehensive and clear.

671
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,199
Looks like you've adapted faster
than I thought.

672
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:44,289
Ms. Hu.

673
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,039
Actually, you're a legend
at Jiangzhou Law Firm.

674
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:48,329
You're exaggerating.

675
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,920
Ryan.

676
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,078
Dingbao just sent this to us.

677
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:53,288
Get it done
and submit it to me by 5pm.

678
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:54,289
Okay.

679
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
Really?

680
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,239
Even though you're only
three years older than me,

681
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:58,559
you're already one...

682
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:00,119
of the youngest partners
in this firm.

683
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:02,360
One of the main reasons...

684
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:03,598
I made an effort
to come to Hong Kong...

685
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,639
is to work under you.

686
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,920
Han Su.

687
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,808
You're different
from the other girls...

688
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:11,879
from the mainland.

689
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,960
How so?

690
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,289
They're all much more
reserved than you.

691
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:19,360
You're smart and diligent,

692
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,039
but that doesn't really matter.

693
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:23,159
Everyone here is just as capable.

694
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,920
However,

695
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,239
you don't know
how to hide your ambition.

696
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:34,599
That suits me quite well.

697
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,880
Keep it up.

698
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,159
I believe you'll win
the Best Lawyer award this year.

699
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,239
At that time, our charming
and elegant Mr. Sun Xu...

700
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,960
will personally present
the award to you.

701
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,760
Good morning.

702
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:57,679
Does Mr. Sun usually come here
for meetings or work?

703
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:01,400
He's the most senior partner
in the Asia-Pacific region.

704
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:02,639
He rarely comes to the office.

705
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:04,239
Usually,

706
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:07,879
he'll give a speech
at the annual dinner...

707
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
and also hands out bonuses
to everyone.

708
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,440
Do you admire him?

709
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,360
Keep it up.
