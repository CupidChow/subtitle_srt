00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 16)

3
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,359
Zeng Cheng.

4
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,120
You must be hungry.

5
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,879
Let's eat.

6
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
You're spacing out.

7
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,280
What are you thinking about?

8
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,639
When I was a freshman,

9
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,919
Baidu search was a new trend.

10
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,919
It took me quite a while...

11
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,879
to teach my mom.

12
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,919
One time, I went home during a break.

13
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,120
I found the search history on my computer...

14
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,319
was all about husbands cheating on wives.

15
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,960
My mom was in the kitchen at the time.

16
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,639
The range hood...

17
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,560
was buzzing...

18
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,559
and through the crack in the door,

19
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,759
I saw her crying.

20
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,039
My dearest dad...

21
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,520
was one among countless men...

22
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,759
who made the one mistake he shouldn't have.

23
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,599
I think...

24
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,319
your mom and dad seem quite happy,

25
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,159
as if nothing like that ever happened.

26
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,719
Zhou Bin.

27
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,479
Tell me the truth.

28
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,199
Did the doctor say...

29
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,879
that my condition might be bad?

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,039
No matter what happens,

31
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,479
I won't remarry you.

32
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,719
This is my final decision.

33
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,439
This is my final stance.

34
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
Whether or not we remarry...

35
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,479
and no matter how bad the test results are,

36
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,360
I won't leave you.

37
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,319
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

38
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,198
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

39
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,959
We've secured Hengliyan's project.

40
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,360
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

41
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,336
Congratulations. We'll sign the contract tomorrow.

42
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,439
Really?

43
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,359
Come on. Let's celebrate.

44
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,638
Thank you.

45
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,920
Cheers!

46
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,240
- Cheers! - Cheers!

47
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,438
Mr. Gao Peng specifically sent me an email,

48
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,199
praising Han Su,

49
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,878
saying you're diligent, responsible,

50
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,319
and highly capable.

51
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,559
He even copied all the partners.

52
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,839
The higher-ups have decided...

53
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,239
to give you an exceptional promotion...

54
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,680
to lead the entire project.

55
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,480
Han Su, well done.

56
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,958
- Congratulations. - Congratulations, Han Su.

57
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,878
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

58
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,879
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

59
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,278
Thank you, everyone.

60
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,799
It's all thanks to everyone's hard work.

61
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,958
Thank you, everyone.

62
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,318
- Good! - Good!

63
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,359
Congratulations, Han Su.

64
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,439
Han Su is awesome.

65
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,439
Han Su, come here.

66
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,839
For this year's award,

67
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,360
I'm going to nominate you.

68
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,120
Thank you, Molina.

69
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,639
Thank you for your help all along.

70
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,040
I didn't do anything.

71
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,959
It was all your own effort.

72
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,519
Cheers.

73
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,040
Cheers.

74
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,959
- Cheers. - Cheers.

75
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,438
Here's to the world's most powerful, all-rounded female warrior,

76
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,758
Ms. Han Su.

77
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,399
And to the silliest client's wife...

78
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,800
in the world.

79
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,519
Who's silly?

80
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,120
It's not bad.

81
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
It's delicious.

82
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,240
It goes so well with the sweet and sour wine.

83
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,600
A five-star rating.

84
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,959
Really?

85
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,039
I used to get criticized often...

86
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,439
when I cooked...

87
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,680
which made me lose confidence in my cooking skills.

88
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,560
Who criticized you?

89
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,879
Your ex-boyfriend?

90
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,680
What kind of person is he to be able to criticize you?

91
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,319
Tell me more.

92
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
It's all in the past.

93
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:44,759
There's nothing to talk about.

94
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,439
I'm just curious.

95
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,639
Why did you break up?

96
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,920
When I came to Hong Kong,

97
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,240
he had someone else.

98
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,319
He had someone else?

99
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,839
What kind of woman can steal a man from you, Han Su?

100
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,199
What a seductress.

101
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,759
Have you seen her?

102
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,439
She's actually...

103
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,720
very charming.

104
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,959
She has her own charm.

105
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,000
No way, Han Su.

106
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,799
You're taking her side at a time like this?

107
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
Are you a saint?

108
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,480
Actually, I broke up with him.

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,090
It has nothing to do...

110
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,720
with that woman.

111
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,279
How so?

112
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,090
We're both too...

113
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,159
Too rational, realistic,

114
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,330
and apathetic.

115
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,159
Moreover,

116
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,120
I don't really believe in love.

117
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,758
When it comes to relationships,

118
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,798
I don't want to waste too much time...

119
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,000
or opportunities.

120
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,640
That's why we're destined to break up.

121
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,480
He's probably like that too.

122
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,279
The more idealistic it is in the beginning,

123
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,450
the more chaotic it will be...

124
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,090
in the end.

125
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Love...

126
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,519
may only exist for a brief moment.

127
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,240
Love...

128
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,639
only exists for a brief moment.

129
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,240
Han Su.

130
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Do you think...

131
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,720
I shouldn't stay in Hong Kong?

132
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,159
Aren't you and Gao Peng doing quite well together?

133
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,639
The two of us...

134
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,330
have been trying hard to find...

135
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,480
the feelings we had before.

136
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,840
But at the same time, we both know...

137
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,599
that we're no longer the same people we used to be.

138
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,879
It seems difficult...

139
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,840
for both of us to adapt...

140
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,399
to each other's new selves.

141
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,000
Honestly, I have some guilt...

142
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,559
toward Gao Peng.

143
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,560
I fell in love with someone else while I was in Jiangzhou.

144
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,480
Gao Peng and I have been apart for too long.

145
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,558
In my life,

146
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,840
he's more like...

147
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,799
a chatbot...

148
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,879
on WeChat...

149
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,559
or to be blunt,

150
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,330
just an ATM in my life.

151
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,879
When I was at my most lost,

152
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,960
a guy appeared out of nowhere,

153
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,200
giving me affection,

154
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,919
care,

155
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,120
and meeting...

156
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,320
all my fantasies about love.

157
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,679
Stop it.

158
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,799
Why?

159
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,679
Are you silly?

160
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,960
Gao Peng is my client.

161
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,840
You've told me so many secrets.

162
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,359
What if I can't keep them and I tell him everything?

163
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,558
You won't tell him.

164
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,639
We're so close.

165
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,039
That guy actually has a girlfriend.

166
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,200
He broke up with her...

167
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,840
to pursue me.

168
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,720
He also knew about Gao Peng's existence,

169
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,960
but he said he didn't mind.

170
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,159
One day,

171
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,240
he told me he wanted to marry me.

172
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,200
I was so happy at that moment.

173
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,159
Why?

174
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,599
What do you mean why?

175
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,878
You love him so much.

176
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,479
Why didn't you stay with him?

177
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,719
He disappeared.

178
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,039
Disappeared?

179
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,360
Why did he disappear?

180
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,799
One afternoon,

181
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,600
I couldn't find him.

182
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,759
I couldn't find him anywhere.

183
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,320
He didn't reply to my messages.

184
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,399
I was dumped just like that.

185
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,758
He worked so hard to pursue you.

186
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,440
How did it end up like this?

187
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,200
Why do you think he worked so hard?

188
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,720
Well, after listening to what you said,

189
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,759
I think...

190
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,320
he's a bit strange.

191
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,000
Now that you mention it,

192
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,559
I think he's a bit strange too.

193
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Han Su.

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,199
You're from a famous university.

195
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,880
Then your ex-boyfriend must be from the same university too, right?

196
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,840
He's from a famous university too.

197
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,720
The three of you might even know each other.

198
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,720
Zhi Nan.

199
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,279
I have something to tell you.

200
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,799
Actually...

201
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,878
It's my best friend.

202
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,919
Excuse me.

203
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,678
Han Han, what's up?

204
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,440
I arranged to meet Zhou Bin directly at the forum site of Zeng Cheng.

205
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,159
Are you sure you want to do this?

206
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,440
I'm not sure.

207
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,999
Nan Nan, I'm so anxious.

208
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,655
What would you do if you were in my shoes?

209
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,519
I'd run away if I were you.

210
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
The three of you are going to confront each other.

211
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,519
The thought of it sends chills down my spine.

212
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,480
(Zeng Cheng, Artificial intelligence...)

213
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,878
Zeng Cheng.

214
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,600
You're back to full health.

215
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,399
My health is all good now.

216
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,839
What a narrow escape.

217
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,720
That's good. Thank goodness.

218
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,320
I took a good rest for a while...

219
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,399
and Zhou Bin was always there with me.

220
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,879
For this love, I can give up everything.

221
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,919
I just want him...

222
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,480
to clarify everything...

223
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,798
in front of me and her.

224
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,799
What if...

225
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,240
I mean, what if...

226
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,080
he feels pressured or something,

227
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,120
wouldn't you be left with no way out?

228
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,960
Do you really want to remarry him?

229
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,759
Not long ago,

230
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,960
I lay on the hospital bed,

231
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,119
feeling utterly defeated and wishing I were dead.

232
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,200
Looking back, it still scares me.

233
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,000
In comparison,

234
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,919
having a bit of sand in my eye is nothing.

235
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,879
He's here. I have to go.

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,200
He promised me...

237
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,159
that we would start over.

238
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
He said...

239
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,319
that neither of us...

240
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,399
will bring up the past again.

241
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,080
He'll break up with her.

242
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,840
But do you still believe him?

243
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,759
What's more important than that...

244
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,480
is my willingness to believe him.

245
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,960
Actually,

246
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,840
I can only choose to believe.

247
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,879
He asked me to give him a chance,

248
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,600
but deep down,

249
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,799
I know I'm giving myself a chance.

250
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,600
Okay.

251
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,200
All right. I respect you.

252
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,239
Get back to work.

253
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Bye.

254
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,000
What's wrong?

255
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,600
Why are you spacing out?

256
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,559
What did you want to tell me just now?

257
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,159
I...

258
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
I suddenly forgot.

259
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,639
I can't remember.

260
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Come on.

261
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,039
You've lost weight.

262
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,039
I've been pulling all-nighters lately.

263
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,279
I know you've been taking care of her.

264
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,520
I've been pulling all-nighters too.

265
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,519
I have a lot on my mind every night.

266
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,799
I'm sorry, Han Han.

267
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,599
I'm jealous,

268
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,650
but I'm not completely jealous.

269
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
I think you're a loyal person.

270
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,680
Now I know...

271
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,039
how complicated it is to love someone.

272
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,679
My reservation is over there.

273
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,440
Let's sit down and talk, okay?

274
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Okay.

00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,960
(Technological empowerment and integrated innovation)

276
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,519
(Integrated Media Advertising Summit Forum)

277
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,519
You knew she was here, right?

278
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,080
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

279
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,558
I want you to hold my hand and walk all the way there...

280
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,758
to her.

281
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,439
I want us to confirm our love for each other under the sun.

282
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,758
Can you not force me?

283
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,799
I can let bygones be bygones.

284
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,359
However, for the future, you have to make a choice.

285
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,409
The three of us should meet face-to-face...

286
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,558
and talk everything out.

287
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,679
It's best for everyone.

288
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,519
Zhou Bin, I really can't believe your one-sided story anymore.

289
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,839
Sun Han Han.

290
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,719
Have you thought about the consequences?

291
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,200
Are you that confident?

292
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,279
Dear.

293
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,119
What a coincidence.

294
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,119
You didn't know I had a meeting here today, did you?

295
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,146
There are a lot of acquaintances inside.

296
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,359
Let's go in and say hello.

297
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,719
I have something urgent to do.

298
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,758
I can't do this. I have to go.

299
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,759
Dear.

300
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,279
Dear.

301
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,359
Haven't you told her yet?

302
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,759
Zhou Bin.

303
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,320
What do you want to tell me?

304
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,038
You should go.

305
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,359
Let's meet next time.

306
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,479
What do you mean?

307
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,519
Just go.

308
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,079
I'm begging you.

309
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
- I'll get going then. - Stop right there.

310
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,410
I'm going to make you tell the truth...

311
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,559
in front of me and her.

312
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,759
Zhou Bin.

313
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,650
Tell us.

314
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,410
Zeng Cheng and I...

315
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,960
got back together.

316
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,170
Let's go.

317
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,920
There's someone I want to introduce you.

318
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,839
Are you sad?

319
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,559
No.

320
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,920
Don't misunderstand, Zeng Cheng.

321
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,000
I called her here to make things clear.

322
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,919
She overestimates herself...

323
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,560
and ends up shooting herself in the foot.

324
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,039
Who can do anything about it?

325
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,319
Ms. Zeng and Mr. Zhou, you are here.

326
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,359
It has been a while.

327
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,359
Han Su.

328
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,440
To you,

329
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,960
what's the perfect love?

330
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,880
The perfect love...

331
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,119
probably only exists in my imagination.

332
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,880
It's like two people...

333
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,278
appreciating and attracting each other...

334
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,599
under a certain vacuum condition.

335
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,200
It seems perfect.

336
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,519
However, once they come into contact with the air,

337
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,880
everything changes.

338
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,359
Fresh braised duck...

339
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,038

Fresh braised duck...

351
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,079
They may find themselves scheming and fighting...

352
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,559
due to the instability of the relationship...

353
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,758
and conversely,

354
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,680
become bored...

355
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,039
when the relationship feels overly secure.

356
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Either way, it'll go against what they originally wanted.

357
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,279
That's right.

358
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,680
So the purest and most beautiful love...

359
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,200
is love that hasn't started yet.

360
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,680
How so?

361
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,279
When I was in high school,

362
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,319
my school was quite a distance from home,

363
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,160
so I often arrived early.

364
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,440
Often, the school gate wasn't even open yet.

365
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
At that time,

366
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,720
I'd always run into a boy.

367
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,440
(Jiangzhou Yi'an High School)

368
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:31,599
He didn't have a good reputation in our school...

369
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,280
because he was a bit of a troublemaker...

370
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,839
and his grades were just average.

371
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,440
We would often stand at the school gate,

372
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,920
one on each side.

373
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,558
We were too shy to look at each other.

374
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,160
We were like two stone lions.

375
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,759
Later on,

376
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,559
he started bringing me breakfast.

377
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,640
It was really cold in winter.

378
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,920
He took a bun from his pocket...

379
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,400
and tossed it to me.

380
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:10,640
It was steaming hot.

381
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,559
Sometimes,

382
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,359
he'd pass by our classroom...

383
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,680
and secretly glance at me.

384
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,680
He'd leave a few candies on my locker.

385
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,799
I also heard...

386
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,319
that he went to warn those who liked to chat with me,

387
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,519
telling them not to disturb my studies.

388
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,839
Do you like him?

389
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,279
He and I...

390
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,759
never spoke to each other...

391
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,079
the whole time.

392
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,440
Why?

393
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,200
I don't know.

394
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,279
It was like some kind of unspoken understanding.

395
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,639
Until we graduated,

396
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,200
we never really got to know each other.

397
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,160
However,

398
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,960
the steam of the bun...

399
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,360
and the texture of the chocolate...

400
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,039
still feels fresh when I think about it.

401
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,359
Love is like life.

402
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,440
As long as it never starts,

403
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,480
it will never end.

404
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,359
Why are you so pessimistic?

405
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,559
Love is still beautiful.

406
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,160
Are those your parents?

407
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,200
Your mom is so pretty.

408
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,519
You look like your mom.

409
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,799
Your dad is handsome too.

410
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,599
You can tell?

411
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,880
In my memory,

412
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,640
that man...

413
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,599
is nothing more than a blurry image.

414
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,599
In my family,

415
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,799
my dad doesn't exist...

416
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,559
and my mom never talked about him.

417
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,359
I found that photo by accident...

418
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,960
and my mom doesn't know I've seen it.

419
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,079
Thank you.

420
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,639
There's a gray hair.

421
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,719
Really?

422
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Where?

423
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,359
Here.

424
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,960
You have good eyesight.

425
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,559
That day, you fell asleep at the hospital.

426
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,598
I woke up in the middle of the night...

427
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,880
and just watched you.

428
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,920
I didn't want to wake you, so I didn't pull it out.

429
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,279
When you first get...

430
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,720
a few strands of gray hair,

431
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,519
it can make you feel anxious.

432
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,440
But when you start getting more,

433
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,119
it doesn't matter as much.

434
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,519
When a flaw...

435
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
becomes something you can no longer avoid,

436
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,879
it eventually turns into a habit you simply accept.

437
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,599
(Fidelity agreement)

438
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,000
Is it necessary?

439
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,319
Yes.

440
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:36,039
I'll feel more at ease if you sign it.

441
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,000
I got it drafted by a lawyer you don't know.

442
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,055
You can still make any necessary changes...

443
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,240
if you have concerns.

444
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,279
(Zhou Bin)

445
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,599
I must emphasize once again the urgency of time at this stage.

446
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,159
Before we enter the printing phase,

447
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,439
starting tomorrow,

448
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,558
all of us...

449
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,960
including the company, all intermediaries,

450
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,959
underwriters, underwriters' lawyers,

451
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,119
and the company's lawyers...

452
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,559
will come together...

453
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,279
to thoroughly review, discuss, and revise...

454
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,719
the prospectus for the company's IPO,

455
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,118
as well as the documents we'll be submitting...

456
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,598
to the stock exchange.

457
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,199
The final materials will then be handled by the printing company.

458
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,880
(North Point)

459
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,440
One moment.

460
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,799
Okay.

461
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,400
Take it first.

462
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,559
Okay, thank you.

463
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:54,960
Okay, thank you.

464
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,481
(What they mean by saying goodbye to the wrong person...)

465
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,680
Hey.

466
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,439
Is this how you announce being single on social media?

467
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,558
Your intentions for finding a partner...

468
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,798
are way too obvious, Sun Han Han.

469
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,880
Indeed,

470
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,559
young men are flocking to me like fish,

471
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:30,879
sending private messages, likes, and comfort.

472
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,080
My schedule is fully booked until at least the weekend.

473
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:34,839
You're not really planning...

474
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,600
to go on dates with so many people, are you?

475
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,959
It's not really a date.

476
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,079
It's just to unwind.

477
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,960
I can't be alone right now.

478
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,799
What about Zhou Bin's things?

479
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,080
Did you give them back to him?

480
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,639
That jerk can just die.

481
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,279
Why should I return his gifts?

482
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,679
Is it good?

483
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,240
Yes, it's good.

484
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,759
The taste is identical...

485
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,719
to that of the small stall across the overpass...

486
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,839
from my home.

487
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
It'd be even better with some peanuts and edamame.

488
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,400
No problem.

489
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,240
Nan Nan, why did you call me back so urgently?

490
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,000
You're finally back. Here.

491
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,119
What's this?

492
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,400
Skewers.

493
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,439
You've been so busy lately,

494
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,000
so I made your favourite to reward you.

495
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:29,358
I recently got to know a girl who enjoys researching food...

496
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,640
and we hit it off.

497
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,920
I asked her to teach me.

498
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,799
Try it.

499
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,160
Is it good?

500
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,039
Is the meat too tough?

501
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,319
It's okay. Wait for a while.

502
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,278
It's good.

503
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,519
Leave it here.

504
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,120
Did you ask me to come back so urgently...

505
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,519
just to eat this?

506
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,679
I'm so busy with the company's IPO.

507
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,769
You didn't have to call me back just for a bite.

508
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,000
I've been busy all day.

509
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,360
You don't have to be so mean.

510
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,960
If you feel wronged, then don't do it anymore.

511
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:28,009
I'm going back to the office for a meeting.

512
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,519
Gao Peng.

513
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:30,920
Gao Peng.

514
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:35,329
You've changed.

515
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,000
You're ridiculous.

516
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,999
I'm now in charge of a company with thousands of employees.

517
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,960
I can't be at your beck and call.

518
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:45,328
Also, I'm not that interested in playing house with you.

519
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:46,329
I'm leaving.

520
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,809
How long do you think...

521
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,039
the printing process will take?

522
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,480
Usually, we work over 18 hours a day...

523
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,769
for about a week straight.

524
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,960
Eighteen hours?

525
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:14,598
Actually,

526
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,328
it feels like crossing into the gates of the underworld...

527
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:18,329
for us.

528
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,718
Only the most physically and mentally fit lawyers...

529
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,719
can withstand it.

530
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,519
It sounds like...

531
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,519
a complete transformation.

532
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,639
I'm looking forward to it.

533
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,769
Really?

534
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:37,079
Do you think...

535
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,769
I'm the kind of person...

536
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
who only knows how to have fun?

537
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,880
I didn't mean that.

538
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,559
Well,

539
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:49,329
it was fun at first.

540
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,919
However, after having too much fun,

541
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,400
I realized...

542
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,400
that happiness became light...

543
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:57,360
and bland.

544
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,480
Then it became boring.

545
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,360
Happiness is actually quite fair.

546
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,558
No matter who it is,

547
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:08,000
it's not that easy to get it.

548
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,239
Actually, to many people,

549
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:17,840
I'm just a rich, silly guy.

550
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,519
However, I still want...

551
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,265
to learn more things as soon as possible...

552
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:24,440
and manage the company well.

553
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,680
At the very least, I don't want to let my parents down.

554
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,159
I hope you can help me.

555
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:40,840
I'll do my best.

556
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:43,840
Thank you.

557
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,840
I should thank you.

558
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,480
Ms. Hu took a screenshot of the email you sent...

559
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,519
and shared it in our firm's WeChat group,

560
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,239
earnestly complimenting me.

561
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
She said...

562
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,920
that receiving such recognition from a client...

563
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,159
is a great honour for our profession.

564
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:02,679
Your work has been impressive and you deserve all of this.

565
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,880
I still owe you a favour for this.

566
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,239
Thank you so much.

567
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:16,238
- Look up there. - I see it.

568
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,919
(Am I Pretty?)

569
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,199
Did you see the clouds?

570
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:23,360
Do you like me because I'm pretty?

571
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,400
It's because you're cute.

572
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:40,399
Honey.

573
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,480
Am I pretty?

574
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,920
You?

575
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:46,039
You look normal.

576
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,808
What do you mean by normal?

577
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:55,920
What do you mean by that?

578
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,919
- What? - Why do I look normal?

579
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,078
Who looks normal?

580
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:01,078
I'm asking if I'm pretty.

581
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,599
- You're pretty. - You said I'm normal-looking.

582
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:23,729
Do you like pretty girls that much?

583
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,238
It's not that I want to see them.

584
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,599
They pop up on my feed.

585
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,480
Can't you look at me then?

586
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,239
Am I ugly?

587
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,769
Let's eat.

588
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,600
You talk about this every day.

589
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
It's annoying.

590
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,199
I'm leaving.

591
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Take care.

592
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:56,769
So...

593
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:00,039
ugly people...

594
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,079
don't deserve to be happy?

595
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,718
Don't you know what you look like?

596
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,119
Of course I do.

597
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,840
I know I'm ugly.

598
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,800
There are many things in this world that are more important than looks.

599
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,809
You're pretty.

600
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:30,079
After I'm gone,

601
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:31,799
you can go out and look around.

602
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,039
They'll all like you.

603
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,480
Gao Peng has changed.

604
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,329
He used to be very patient.

605
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,400
If you love him enough,

606
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,289
you'll be able to accept all his changes.

607
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,440
What does it mean...

608
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:20,000
to love enough?
