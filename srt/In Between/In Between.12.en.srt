1
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 12)

3
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,239
This way, please.

4
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,530
Sun Han Han.

5
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,639
Ms. Zeng.

6
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,090
Have a seat.

7
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,000
Have some tea.

8
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,960
This is authentic Pu'er tea.

9
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,599
It's very good.

10
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,560
Although it's a bit awkward,

11
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,080
I'd still like to find a quiet place...

12
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,599
and have a good talk with you.

13
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
Ms. Zeng, I know what you want to tell me.

14
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,280
My boyfriend...

15
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,438
is your ex-husband.

16
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,520
It's just a coincidence.

17
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,160
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

18
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,319
How did you know...

19
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,000
about my situation with Zhou Bin?

20
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,479
Zhou Bin showed me your divorce certificate.

21
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,759
However, he has never made the divorce public...

22
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,039
or openly acknowledged having a girlfriend.

23
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,719
It's a private matter.

24
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,919
As long as we know, that's enough.

25
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,759
Don't you think this is far from normal?

26
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,920
What do you think is normal?

27
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,639
"Every couple in the world has their own unique relationship."

28
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,360
"Everyone is different..."

29
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,039
"and so is every relationship."

30
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,240
That's what Mr. Zhou said.

31
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,039
Did he also mention that I used to have bipolar disorder...

32
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,895
and that the divorce triggered it,

33
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,479
so I could have an episode at any time?

34
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,959
That's why he has to frequently be by my side and soothe me.

35
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,759
He's a gentleman...

36
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,399
who's nostalgic for the past.

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,439
Even after the divorce,

38
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,240
he still takes care of his ex-wife.

39
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
As for me,

40
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,279
I'm the madwoman in the attic.

41
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,000
He's the enduring Mr. Rochester,

42
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,079
while you're...

43
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,680
the independent, rational,

44
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,240
and understanding heroine,

45
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,000
the modern lady,

46
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,639
Ms. Jane Eyre.

47
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,050
Sun Han Han.

48
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,170
I think you're quite smart.

49
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,439
Don't you think...

50
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,729
Zhou Bin's story...

51
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,879
is bizarre and pretentious?

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,480
Did he tell you all this?

53
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,050
He didn't have to.

54
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,120
I can guess what's going on.

55
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,050
I just didn't expect...

56
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,170
you'd actually believe it.

57
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,639
What do you mean?

58
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,360
We did get a divorce,

59
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,120
but it was to invest in another property.

60
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,839
The truth is,

61
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,959
Zhou Bin and I are still married.

62
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,879
We'll get back together soon.

63
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,318
Zeng Cheng and I are officially divorced.

64
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,415
(Zhou Bin, Divorce registration)

65
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,039
When are you going to make her face reality?

66
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,799
It can only be made public when she feels it's appropriate.

67
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,839
This was our agreement during the divorce.

68
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,000
Three months.

69
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,480
I'll take care of everything.

70
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,959
Since the misunderstanding has been clarified now,

71
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,199
it's not an issue anymore.

72
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,879
I won't bring up past issues.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,079
However,

74
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,439
I hope that after you learn the truth,

75
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,320
you can keep your distance from Zhou Bin.

76
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,959
What if Zhou Bin doesn't want to keep his distance from me?

77
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Ms. Zeng.

78
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,160
Do you really think that when a man and a woman are together,

79
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,040
the woman must be a seductress enticing the man,

80
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,480
while the man is just an innocent victim of temptation?

81
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,120
How long have you known Zhou Bin?

82
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,560
I've known Zhou Bin for 20 years.

83
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,599
We've been married for 13 years.

84
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,120
I know what kind of person he is.

85
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,040
You young girls always have a delusion...

86
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,560
that love can conquer everything.

87
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,839
A month, a day,

88
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,839
or even just an hour of so-called love...

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,959
can conquer all reality.

90
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,199
Yet all you have...

91
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,720
is youth.

92
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,560
Youth?

93
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,879
Everyone has it.

94
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,799
Yet everyone will lose it.

95
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,000
But I have it now...

96
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,720
and you have lost yours.

97
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,000
You're still young.

98
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,959
You still can't distinguish...

99
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,199
between sexual desire and love.

100
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,160
Ms. Zeng.

101
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
The way you speak and the tone of your voice...

102
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
is just like my mom's.

103
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,040
As expected of you, Ms. Zeng,

104
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,879
you handle everything...

105
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,560
with such grace and decorum.

106
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,959
I thought you'd bring people...

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,519
to City Hua...

108
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,079
to put on a dramatic show.

109
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,719
City Hua?

110
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,920
Zhou Bin's house.

111
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,159
He arranged a place for me to stay.

112
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,720
Don't tell me you don't know about City Hua.

113
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,360
The laws in our country protect marriages,

114
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,720
but don't protect fake marriages.

115
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,480
Ms. Zeng.

116
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,600
Emotionally...

117
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,360
and morally,

118
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,519
I have nothing to feel guilty about.

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,089
Sun Han Han.

120
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,240
I think you're quite smart.

121
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,798
Don't you think...

122
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,000
Zhou Bin's story...

123
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,090
is bizarre and pretentious?

124
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,279
The divorce has hit her hard.

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,960
She was crying on the phone just now...

126
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,450
and she was very emotional.

127
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,278
So I promised her I'd go back to visit her.

128
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,279
Last night,

129
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,040
I wanted to tell her about our relationship.

130
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,158
She dashed into the kitchen,

131
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,159
took a knife,

132
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,210
and hurt herself like this.

133
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:54,531
We have a house under renovation.

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,680
The temporary power at the site was out...

135
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,800
and it was completely dark.

136
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,216
I accidentally tripped and fell.

137
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,840
For her, it's about responsibility.

138
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,279
For you, it's about feelings.

139
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,399
You know I love you.

140
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,879
Here's to you.

141
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,879
I've seen all your movies.

142
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,960
I've always been a big fan of yours.

143
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,399
It's my honour to be able to serve you.

144
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,399
Mr. Zhou.

145
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,639
You're too polite.

146
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm counting on you...

147
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,919
for my troubles now.

148
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,720
It's what I should do.

149
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,639
I've already prepared a proposal for the lawsuit.

150
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,840
Allow me to brief you.

151
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Okay.

152
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,600
I've done a thorough investigation on this movie investor.

153
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,240
(Zeng Cheng)

154
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,240
Please take a look.

155
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,840
Also, I had someone to look into its financial status...

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
and the details are all there.

157
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,480
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,519
It's my wife.

159
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,919
If it's your wife,

160
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,279
just answer it.

161
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,798
It's probably nothing important.

162
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,839
Let's start the meeting.

163
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,878
(Zeng Cheng)

164
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,255
Even the biggest matters are insignificant...

165
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,559
compared to the wife.

166
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,600
Thank you.

167
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,519
Zhou Bin.

168
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,359
I don't care where you are.

169
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,480
Come home right now.

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,039
Zeng Cheng.

171
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,159
I'm discussing something with Mr. Xu.

172
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,799
It's a big deal.

173
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,038
Whatever it is, can we settle it at home later?

174
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,319
Which home are you referring to?

175
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,440
City Hua?

176
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,119
- What are you talking about? - Who are you trying to fool?

177
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,679
Do you think I'm an idiot?

178
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,919
Zeng Cheng, listen to me.

179
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,375
It wasn't easy for me to get this appointment with Mr. Xu.

180
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,839
To me, this deal is very important.

181
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,839
I'll explain when I get back, okay?

182
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,600
A big deal with the director?

183
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,279
Zhou Bin,

184
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,199
you think you're something just because you can earn a bit now.

185
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,439
The money you used to start your business...

186
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,518
came from my family.

187
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,959
I introduced you to the connections.

188
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,359
Now, with a little money,

189
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,320
you secretly buy houses and keep a mistress?

190
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,976
Back when you were just a small-time lawyer,

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,680
did you have the ability to pull this off?

192
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,758
You can go home first.

193
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,799
All right.

194
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,599
(Sun Han Han)

195
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,159
(Calling Sun Han Han)

196
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,679
Hello.

197
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,480
The number you've dialled is busy.

198
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,120
Please try again later.

199
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,320
The number you've dialled is busy.

200
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,320
I'm home.

201
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,720
Why are you drinking?

202
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,119
Didn't the doctor tell you not to drink?

203
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Zhou Bin.

204
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,080
Have you been planning...

205
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,559
to divorce me all along?

206
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,720
Have you had too much to drink and started talking nonsense?

207
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,599
You're the one who wanted a divorce.

208
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,679
Also,

209
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,559
it wasn't easy for me...

210
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,239
to arrange the appointment with Mr. Xu.

211
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,200
It's a huge deal and really important to me.

212
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,719
Aren't you going to explain...

213
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,960
the situation with City Hua to me?

214
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,720
Well...

215
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,399
Yes.

216
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,200
I admit it was my fault...

217
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,640
for not telling you about the house I bought.

218
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,039
But this house was meant to be an investment.

219
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,176
When Zhou Chao mentioned it to me,

220
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,120
I didn't even hesitate and bought it right away.

221
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,799
Investment?

222
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,879
Yes.

223
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,000
Was Sun Han Han...

224
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,000
one of your investments at City Hua?

225
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,200
Didn't I explain it to you before?

226
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,200
Girls throwing themselves...

227
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,080
at someone like me...

228
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
is pretty normal, right?

229
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,399
But what I heard...

230
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,640
It wasn't just throwing herself at you.

231
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,840
It was mutual affection...

232
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,840
and she's the only one for you.

233
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,480
Well, of course,

234
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,679
you're single now,

235
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,799
so dating a girl...

236
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
makes perfect sense.

237
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:38,000
Who told you all this nonsense?

238
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,640
- What do you take me for? - What did you tell others about me?

239
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,679
Bipolar?

240
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,759
- Madwoman? - Do you actually believe that?

241
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,638
Don't you see what her game is?

242
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,200
Don't use those lawyer tactics on me.

243
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,360
They don't work on me.

244
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,040
You told me it was an investment.

245
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,360
Back then, if I didn't help you start your business...

246
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,839
and gave you all my resources,

247
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,918
would you be where you are today?

248
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:00,959
Come on. It has been over a decade.

249
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,639
Why do you always bring this up?

250
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,640
You helped me get ahead once.

251
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,158
Do you think...

252
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,895
that gives you the right to control me forever?

253
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,759
Have you ever thought about your own problems?

254
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Let's talk nicely.

255
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,159
What's with the smashing?

256
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,240
Zhou Bin.

257
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,360
We're divorced.

258
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,279
Everything in this house belongs to me.

259
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,919
I can do whatever I want.

260
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,879
This house is mine.

261
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,519
Now,

262
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,240
get out of here!

263
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,559
Han Han.

264
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,279
Listen to me, Han Han.

265
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,679
Did you meet with Zeng Cheng?

266
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,279
Did she tell you...

267
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,679
that we're getting a fake divorce because we want to buy a house?

268
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Han Han.

269
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Han Han.

270
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,679
No matter what Zeng Cheng told you,

271
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,039
she did it to provoke you.

272
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,239
Let me explain, okay?

273
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,440
Open the door first.

274
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,410
- What are you doing? - It's yours. Take it.

275
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Zeng Cheng kicked me out.

276
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:23,801
Where do you want me to go?

277
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Fine.

278
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,890
This is your house.

279
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
I'll leave.

280
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Han Han.

281
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,519
No. Let me explain.

282
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,200
- Han Han. - Go away.

283
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
I'll leave.

284
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,680
This is your house.

285
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,319
I'll leave.

286
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,279
Hello, sir. Please blow on it.

287
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,319
Please blow on it again.

288
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,560
Please blow on the centre of this device, okay?

289
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,169
I've cooperated with you and blown into it twice.

290
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,479
Is there something wrong with this device?

291
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,055
You didn't blow on it. If you blow on it, it'll ring.

292
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,278
What do you mean by that?

293
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,359
I blew into it twice following your instructions.

294
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,598
You have to aim for the centre, okay?

295
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,649
What's the rush?

296
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,050
You've caused a traffic jam behind.

297
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,720
Please calm down.

298
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:56,999
- Calm down. - Calm down.

299
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,199
- Stop rushing me! - Please calm down.

300
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,295
- Do you hear me? - Please calm down.

301
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,680
I'm calm. Stop honking!

302
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,318
- Control your emotions. - No, he's honking.

303
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,735
- Why didn't you stop him? - Stop overreacting.

304
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,279
Why are you staring at me?

305
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,479
No. Don't touch me.

306
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,519
I'm a lawyer.

307
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,959
- So what if you're a lawyer? - I know the law too.

308
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,999
Just cooperate with us.

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,279
- Okay? - I'm cooperating.

310
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,920
I haven't even had dinner yet.

311
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,279
Why would I go to drink?

312
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,078
Please control your emotions.

313
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,410
- Don't do anything rash. - I'm controlling myself.

314
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,279
Sit over there.

315
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,519
(August 5, 2023)

316
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,919
If he harasses you again,

317
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,039
will you call the police?

318
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,679
Why call the police?

319
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
I don't even know how to explain it to the police.

320
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,118
Just stay with me.

321
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,169
As long as you're here,

322
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,839
he won't sulk his way into the house.

323
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm looking for a place.

324
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,440
I'll move out when I find one.

325
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,919
That doesn't taste good.

326
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,000
Han Han.

327
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,279
Hello.

328
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,200
Nan Nan.

329
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,720
Han Han.

330
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,130
Why didn't you tell me that you changed the lock?

331
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,240
Listen to me.

332
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,999
Even if you don't let me in, you have to let me explain.

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,360
I don't have a home to go back to.

334
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,170
Tonight,

335
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
I'll be downstairs.

336
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,119
Han Han.

337
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,559
At this point,

338
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,120
you can think of me however you want.

339
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,120
However, these misunderstandings...

340
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,759
have stayed in your heart...

341
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,359
and will only bring you sadness.

342
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,480
Just thinking about how upset you are...

343
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,319
makes me feel even worse.

344
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,240
Let me explain, okay?

345
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,359
Go ahead.

346
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,680
Put yourself in my shoes.

347
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:18,759
All of this...

348
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,319
happened so quickly.

349
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,480
I've been asking myself how to handle it.

350
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,880
Before I figure it out,

351
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,519
I don't know how to tell Zeng Cheng the best way.

352
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:28,959
The truth is...

353
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
The truth is you lied to me.

354
00:23:29,961 --> 00:23:31,039
The truth is...

355
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,559
I encountered a beautiful mishap.

356
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,240
Han Han.

357
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,839
The truth is,

358
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,239
firstly, there's no marital relationship...

359
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,440
or love between Zeng Cheng...

360
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,640
and me right now.

361
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,640
This situation won't change with or without you.

362
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,119
Secondly, I've fallen in love with you.

363
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,279
I can't help it.

364
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,400
Han Han.

365
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,039
Give me some time and space.

366
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,400
I'll take care of everything.

367
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,160
(Zeng Cheng)

368
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,680
- Hello? - Zhou Bin.

369
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,160
Where are you?

370
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:24,799
Is there anything?

371
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,920
Where are you?

372
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,680
Why do you care?

373
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,239
Pack your things as soon as possible.

374
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,879
Okay.

375
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,919
When?

376
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,720
I'll be there when the time comes.

377
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,400
Zhou Bin, watch your attitude.

378
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm not the one who made a mistake.

379
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:41,880
Zeng Cheng, listen to me.

380
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,400
If you want to talk, let's talk.

381
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,079
If not, let's leave it as it is.

382
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,240
It's up to you whether you come back or not.

383
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,319
I'm not going back.

384
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,440
You should go back.

385
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,000
If things are really as you say,

386
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,359
then take care of everything and come back to me.

387
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,799
When I used to pass by this place,

388
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,559
I would often stop and look up.

389
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,960
I thought that...

390
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
those who live here...

391
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,279
wouldn't have any worries.

392
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,319
Now that I'm standing here,

393
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,799
I realize...

394
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,519
this place doesn't belong to me.

395
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,240
However, if I leave this place,

396
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,480
I won't have anywhere to return to.

397
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,440
Han Han,

398
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,519
do you believe what Zhou Bin said?

399
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,079
I don't know.

400
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,680
I saw Zhou Bin's reaction...

401
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,640
when he answered Zeng Cheng's call,

402
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,720
but I can't tell...

403
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,000
if it was real or fake.

404
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
Zhou Bin said...

405
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,839
he treats Zeng Cheng...

406
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,920
like a difficult client.

407
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,799
Over the phone,

408
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,319
I could feel the suffocation.

409
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,480
Zhou Bin also said...

410
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,799
that there is currently...

411
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,119
no marital relationship...

412
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,000
or love between them.

413
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,759
Even if...

414
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,759
what Zhou Bin said is true,

415
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,839
don't you find this...

416
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,519
to be strange?

417
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Of course I do.

418
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,519
Just now downstairs,

419
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,359
I told him to handle everything before coming back.

420
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,319
If he's telling the truth,

421
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,599
he'll naturally return.

422
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,039
You're insisting on not coming back, right?

423
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:21,319
(I'm on my way. Please calm down.)

424
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,440
Sir.

425
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,079
Please make a U-turn back to City Hua.

426
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,519
Do you love Zhou Bin?

427
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,320
The most straightforward...

428
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,519
and purest kind of love.

429
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,480
What's pure love?

430
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,800
Take you and Gao Peng for example.

431
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:09,239
You dated when you were 18.

432
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,840
You didn't have to worry about anything.

433
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,359
I really envy you.

434
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,680
I just hope Zhou Bin...

435
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,359
won't lie to me again.

436
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,999
(Rucheng Group)

437
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,680
I gave him a chance to admit his mistakes,

438
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,759
but he's getting arrogant with me.

439
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,216
He has really come into his own...

440
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,399
and has guts now.

441
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,440
I respect him.

442
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,961
If it comes to the worst, I'll just let him have his way.

443
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,559
Zeng Cheng, can I ask you a question?

444
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,400
Go ahead.

445
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,119
Is Zhou Bin your son?

446
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,038
You won't give him an allowance.

447
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,319
You won't let him come home.

448
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,319
This is how you deal with a 14-year-old boy.

449
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,679
If he really has nowhere to go, that's another story.

450
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,359
You may push him as hard as you want.

451
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,000
But the key issue is...

452
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,200
that some people are waiting to take him in.

453
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,279
Zeng Cheng.

454
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,720
Let's consider it from another angle.

455
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,000
I think Zhou Bin...

456
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,000
doesn't actually want a divorce.

457
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,839
He's probably just playing around...

458
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,479
and getting caught up in the moment.

459
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,599
I won't forgive him either.

460
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,760
You can certainly choose not to forgive him.

461
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,279
In fact, until now,

462
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,480
the decision to forgive him is in your hands.

463
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,559
However, if you keep pushing him,

464
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,120
you might end up in a disadvantageous position.

465
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,640
Zeng Cheng,

466
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,640
I know you hate that woman.

467
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,799
However, what you're doing now...

468
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,400
is sending Zhou Bin to someone else.

469
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,038
You're basically helping her.

470
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,119
Are you willing to do that?

471
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,879
Where are we going?

472
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,279
Let's sit and wait over there.

473
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,400
Sure.

474
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,318
Where are you?

475
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,400
It's so noisy.

476
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
I'm at the barbershop.

477
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,839
I want to cut my hair shorter.

478
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,400
You've had it for so many years.

479
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,400
Why do you suddenly want to cut it short?

480
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,119
I want a change of mood.

481
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
What's wrong?

482
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,079
Well, this may sound strange.

483
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,160
Do you remember...

484
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,760
I told you about the girl...

485
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,959
that Qu Yi Peng had an affair with in Jiangzhou?

486
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,640
She's Gao Peng's girlfriend.

487
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,856
She's coming to Hong Kong in a couple of days...

488
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
to see Gao Peng.

489
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,200
She's the one...

490
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,559
who called you Su Su...

491
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,359
in a teasing manner over the phone.

492
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,759
It's her.

493
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:09,359
What kind of ridiculous relationship is this?

494
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,000
I think so too.

495
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,640
It's like a TV drama.

496
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,719
Do you know that Gao Peng,

497
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,798
who got cheated on,

498
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,680
is still thinking about her positively?

499
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,240
I can't take it.

500
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,759
I can't stand people who play both sides.

501
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,640
You were just upset from the phone call...

502
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,240
and looking to release your anger now.

503
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:28,799
I guess so.

504
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm trying to uphold justice here.

505
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,480
Let me tell you.

506
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,799
They've been together for so long...

507
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,559
for a reason.

508
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,720
Qu Yi Peng is part of your past.

509
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,359
You don't need to be upset because of him.

510
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,000
Your main goal now...

511
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,680
is to get Gao Peng as a client.

512
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Be cautious.

513
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,279
Don't let your emotions get in the way.

514
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,480
I know.

515
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,119
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

516
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,039
Your hair is so long.

517
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,400
Don't you feel bad cutting it?

518
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,559
Out with the old,

519
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
in with the new.

520
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,200
What's there to feel bad about?

521
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,359
You're right.

522
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,960
The first time...

523
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,480
I saw you wearing it seven years ago...

524
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,880
feels like just yesterday.

525
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,439
In three months and five days,

526
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,840
it will be our seventh anniversary.

527
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,518
We agreed last year...

528
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,078
that we'd celebrate it in Hong Kong this year.

529
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,119
Did you forget?

530
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,480
You didn't forget.

531
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,960
Right?

532
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,359
Keep this medicine.

533
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,119
It's okay.

534
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,615
You'll be away for so long this time.

535
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,639
You have to be prepared.

536
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,198
The temperature difference between indoors and outdoors...

537
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,288
in Hong Kong is significant.

538
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:13,328
Take care of yourself.

539
00:34:13,329 --> 00:34:15,529
If you don't feel well, remember to take your medicine.

540
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,679
I will.

541
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,440
Are you still obsessing over it?

542
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,976
You should try thinking about it from another perspective.

543
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Qu Yi Peng is just a stone you tossed into still water.

544
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:33,376
The most amazing thing is that...

545
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,519
it has somehow revived your feelings for Gao Peng.

546
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,289
Looking at it another way,

547
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,360
if someone on Gao Peng's side...

548
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,880
also threw a stone into that water,

549
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:47,609
I wouldn't be able to accept it.

550
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,809
There are many problems that can't be delved into.

551
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,239
You said it yourself.

552
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,639
You need Gao Peng.

553
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,360
Love is essentially about necessity.

554
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,599
But I need to confirm...

555
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,809
whether we both need each other.

556
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,039
Hello, sir.

557
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,400
These slippers are for you.

558
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:37,679
Thank you.

559
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:44,599
Hasn't Gao Peng replied yet?

560
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,289
The trip to Hong Kong...

561
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,440
didn't start well.

562
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:57,209
I thought about it for a long time.

563
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,880
I realize that...

564
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,769
I would get drunk...

565
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,720
because of Qu Yi Peng's neglect...

566
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,440
and my vanity would be satisfied...

567
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,960
when he treated me well.

568
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,039
But now that he's gone,

569
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:16,159
I slow down and realize that...

570
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,599
Gao Peng is different for me.

571
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:33,400
Gao Peng and I...

572
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:36,639
fell in love with each other...

573
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,279
when we both didn't know what love was.

574
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:41,089
He and the memories he gave me...

575
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,400
accompanied me throughout my entire youth.

576
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,809
My first hand-holding was with him...

577
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,440
and my first kiss was with him.

578
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,880
In my life,

579
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:54,809
Gao Peng...

580
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,599
has become an inseparable part.

581
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,239
I believe that in Gao Peng's life,

582
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,440
I hold the same place.

583
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,080
I used to think that time couldn't compare to novelty.

584
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,519
But now I understand...

585
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,719
that the time we spent together...

586
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,239
is what makes us irreplaceable to each other.

587
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:45,920
Nan Nan.

588
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,518
I have a very important meeting at the last minute.

589
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:48,519
I can't pick you up.

590
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,769
Take a taxi here.

591
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,038
I've sent you the location.

592
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,360
(Little Peng)

593
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,600
- Here's your luggage. - Okay.

594
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,719
Thank you.

595
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,599
Gao Peng, I'm here. Where are you?

596
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,960
Hello. Are you Ms. He?

597
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,599
Mr. Gao asked me to welcome your arrival.

598
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:58,809
This way. Come on.

599
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
Give me your luggage.

600
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,559
Thank you.

601
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,639
This way.

602
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:05,679
Be careful.

603
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,920
Come on.

604
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,289
The elevator is this way.

605
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,920
Ms. He, would you like me to escort you upstairs?

606
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:26,329
No, thank you.

607
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,159
Have a good day.

608
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Gao Peng.

609
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:46,041
I'm in front of your house.

610
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,239
Where are you?

611
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,679
(Little Peng: Enter the password to get inside. I'm in a meeting.)

612
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:53,809
What the heck?

613
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,118
I'll drink.

614
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,199
- Okay. - Okay.
