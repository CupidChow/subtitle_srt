00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Hello.

4
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,855
Miss, who are you looking for?

5
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,958
I'm looking for Zhou Bin.

6
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,959
Do you have an appointment?

7
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,718
(Senior Partner)

8
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,040
Miss, you can't go in without an appointment.

9
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Miss, you can't go in without an appointment.

10
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,479
Miss.

11
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,529
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

12
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,758
I couldn't stop her.

13
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,479
She said she needs to have a word with you.

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,920
I do have an appointment with Ms. Sun.

15
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,280
I forgot to tell you.

16
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,816
It's fine. You may leave us alone.

17
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Yes, Mr. Zhou.

18
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,560
Tell me.

19
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,720
Where were you last night?

20
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,919
Didn't I send you a photo?

21
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,135
It's a victory party for the client's successful lawsuit.

22
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,199
She was there too.

23
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,360
You two were inseparable, holding hands, all lovey-dovey...

24
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,479
and she even posted it on her Moments.

25
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,919
What's that supposed to mean?

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,960
I'm openly dating you,

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,960
yet we have to keep it a secret from everyone.

28
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,319
This is ridiculous.

29
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,639
Why do I feel like I'm some sort of homewrecker?

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
You care about her...

31
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:58,559
and you have family ties and business connections.

32
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,639
I can't argue with that.

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,879
But could you make sure she's fully settled...

34
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,960
before coming to me?

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,999
Why do you keep me hanging like this?

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,080
Are you done?

37
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,039
It's my turn now.

38
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,680
I only have one request.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,319
When I'm talking, please don't interrupt me.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Here.

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,919
The client yesterday was Zhu Yun Jie.

42
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,879
He's good friends with Zeng Cheng.

43
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,359
It was Zeng Cheng who introduced him to me...

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,439
as my client.

45
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,719
It was also him...

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,919
who invited Zeng Cheng yesterday.

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,919
Let's take a step back.

48
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,039
In this kind of situation,

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,159
I must be in the same frame as her.

50
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,960
You just said...

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
that you saw us holding hands.

52
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,840
If I remember correctly,

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
my hand wasn't even open at that time.

54
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,039
She was the one gripping my hand tightly.

55
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,400
In front of so many people,

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,920
I couldn't just shake her hand off.

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,159
Besides,

58
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,919
this is a group photo.

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,400
Isn't it normal for people to stand close to each other?

60
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,521
Those who are in her Moments are all her social networks.

61
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,599
She must have her reasons for posting this photo.

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,399
When are you going to make her face reality?

63
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,570
What makes you think I didn't make any effort?

64
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,839
Last night,

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
when I sent her home.

66
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:24,521
I wanted to take the opportunity...

67
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,399
to tell her about our relationship.

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,920
I hadn't even gotten...

69
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,730
to the main point yet.

70
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,439
She suddenly dashed into the kitchen,

71
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,839
took a knife,

72
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,320
and hurt herself like this.

73
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,290
Do you want to see her medical records?

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,079
Because of this,

75
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,799
I didn't sleep a wink all night.

76
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,359
However, come to think of it,

77
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
you're right.

78
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,439
All this trouble is because of me.

79
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,519
It's my fault.

80
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,560
I was hoping...

81
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,170
to get some understanding...

82
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,399
and comfort from you,

83
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,730
but looking at it now,

84
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,839
I was wrong.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's unfair to you.

86
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Go home.

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
I'm sorry, Zhou Zhou.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,399
I was too willful.

89
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,360
Don't be angry.

90
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,799
Do I have the right to be angry?

91
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,279
I don't.

92
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm just a little tired.

93
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,120
Good news.

94
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,720
What is it?

95
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,480
Haven't you always wanted to learn from Ms. Zeng?

96
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,879
Here's your chance.

97
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,759
What chance?

98
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Ms. Zeng has secured...

99
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,016
the full series of ads for Biyuzan beauty products.

100
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,360
She aims to collaborate with us on the strategic aspects.

101
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,560
She's leading the formation of a new team...

102
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,640
and specifically inviting you to join.

103
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,920
Me?

104
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,160
Why?

105
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,480
What do you mean why?

106
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,879
She thinks you're doing well.

107
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,120
By the way,

108
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,638
we have to go to Ms. Zeng's company now...

109
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,719
for a meeting with the client.

110
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,800
Hurry up and get ready.

111
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,720
Now?

112
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,879
Yes.

113
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,839
We'll showcase the history of the Biyuzan brand...

114
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,199
and its evolving products...

115
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,199
since the 1970s,

116
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,360
ultimately focusing on the newly launched toner.

117
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Last night,

118
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,319
when I sent her home.

119
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,600
I wanted to take the opportunity...

120
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,560
to tell her about our relationship.

121
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,760
I hadn't even gotten to the main point yet.

122
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
She dashed into the kitchen,

123
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:02,879
took a knife,

124
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,399
and hurt herself like this.

125
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,360
It conveys the concept...

126
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,560
that everything in the past is merely a prologue.

127
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,040
What do you think?

128
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,439
The product...

129
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,720
is closely related to its value.

130
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,919
The direction is very clear.

131
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

132
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,318
I want to hear everyone's opinions.

133
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,319
Yes.

134
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,720
What do you think?

135
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,519
Sun Han Han.

136
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,679
What do you think?

137
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,399
Let me introduce you.

138
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,719
Sun Han Han...

139
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,798
is a very talented advertising creative...

140
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,799
in our company.

141
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,799
I think this proposal...

142
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,279
has a strong classical vibe in its historical presentation.

143
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,639
It's very good.

144
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,799
However, I feel that...

145
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,399
it comes off as a bit aloof...

146
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,919
and pretentious.

147
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,360
I don't know why,

148
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,759
but it gives off an older vibe.

149
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,399
This is just my immediate impression.

150
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,720
It's still not quite polished.

151
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,919
Bosses.

152
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,159
What do you think?

153
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,879
Does it give off an older vibe?

154
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,720
How about this?

155
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,426
Let's hear the young people's opinions...

156
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,239
from our team.

157
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
(Thank you for watching)

158
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,330
What do you think?

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,039
What do you think?

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,600
It seems a bit old-fashioned.

161
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,879
Well, Ms. Zeng,

162
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,159
what do you think?

163
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,200
I think Sun Han Han's opinion can be used as a reference.

164
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,210
Her instincts are usually pretty spot-on.

165
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,159
As an old brand facing new challenges,

166
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,210
why don't we take a completely different approach?

167
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,890
We can drop the pretentiousness of being an established brand...

168
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,720
and focus on highlighting warmth and companionship...

169
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
to connect with the emotions...

170
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,135
and feelings of the younger generation.

171
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,159
For example,

172
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,759
we could create...

173
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,640
a character of an unnoticed office worker.

174
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,450
That way, it's easier to interact with young people...

175
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,759
and get them to embrace the new brand and product.

176
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,639
That's why young people's opinions should be taken into account.

177
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,480
(Rucheng Group)

178
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,359
Ms. Zeng.

179
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,399
Ms. Zeng.

180
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,600
There's a budget report that needs your signature.

181
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Okay.

182
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,240
I'm sorry about just now.

183
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
I didn't think it through and blurted it out.

184
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,079
I shouldn't have done it in front of the client.

185
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,800
You don't have to apologize to me.

186
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,440
Work with me once and you'll know.

187
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,000
I love disruptive ideas the most.

188
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,976
The most important thing in our line of work...

189
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,280
is to have your own perspective.

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,720
If you think it's right, stick to it.

191
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,360
Don't worry about the client...

192
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,039
and the boss.

193
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,959
But you can't just be the one who cuts ideas...

194
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,080
without providing solutions.

195
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,200
You need to offer more ideas for the unnoticed worker proposal.

196
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,279
I will.

197
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,039
Ms. Zeng, what happened to your hand?

198
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,960
We have a house under renovation.

199
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,920
On a whim, I wanted to check out the construction site.

200
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,000
The temporary power at the site was out...

201
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,160
and it was completely dark.

202
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,639
I accidentally tripped and fell.

203
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Last night,

204
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,879
when I sent her home.

205
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,440
I wanted to take the opportunity...

206
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,159
to tell her about our relationship.

207
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,416
I hadn't even gotten to the main point yet.

208
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,518
She dashed into the kitchen,

209
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,639
took a knife,

210
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,559
and hurt herself like this.

211
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,799
When Zeng Cheng was in college,

212
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,056
she suffered from bipolar disorder.

213
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,480
She got better after treatment.

214
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,159
I'm worried that the divorce will provoke her.

215
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,960
That sounds painful.

216
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,839
You're seriously injured.

217
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,200
Why are you still working so hard?

218
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,879
I'm fine.

219
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,360
To me, this injury is nothing.

220
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
I'll get going then.

221
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,440
What are you so focused on listening to?

222
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,559
Schumann.

223
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,679
You know it.

224
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,080
Come, I'll show you something.

225
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,600
Look.

226
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,680
It's the renovation plan for our new house.

227
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,440
This is the bedroom.

228
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,439
- It's nice. - Yes.

229
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,559
I want the whole space to feel cleaner...

230
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,039
and have a warmer tone.

231
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,240
This is the kitchen.

232
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,038
I'm in charge of the kitchen.

233
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,039
No problem.

234
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,840
I'll choose the biggest fridge.

235
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,278
Look at the stove and the sink.

236
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,559
They're all my favourites.

237
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,240
Let me show you the living room.

238
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,918
This way, the whole space is bright.

239
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,000
Right?

240
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,200
I've been thinking lately...

241
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,720
about the gym in our new house.

242
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,240
Why don't we get rid of it?

243
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,399
Don't.

244
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,799
Do you want to expand your dressing room?

245
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,440
No.

246
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,319
I want to reserve a room for our kids.

247
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,120
Are you kidding me?

248
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,919
Are you being spontaneous again?

249
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,720
I'm serious.

250
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,440
We're talking about a kid here.

251
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,639
Have you thought it through?

252
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,320
I've always been curious.

253
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,360
If there were someone in the world...

254
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,799
who looked like me...

255
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,120
and also looked like you,

256
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,759
what would they be like?

257
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,360
All right.

258
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,080
Stop tempting me.

259
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,399
You're the one who wants to be a dink.

260
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,999
You're the one who wants a child.

261
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,039
In the end, you're the one who doesn't want it.

262
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,359
I won't believe you anymore.

263
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Stop mentioning it.

264
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,960
I really won't change my mind this time.

265
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,360
I can still have kids at my age,

266
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,480
but it's almost the last chance.

267
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,519
Perhaps it's this urgency...

268
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,759
that makes me want a child.

269
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,160
Have you really thought about it?

270
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,120
Are you sure you're serious?

271
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,080
Let me tell you.

272
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,159
Someone once told me...

273
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,320
that women reach a certain point...

274
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,519
when they feel an ancient calling.

275
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,279
It's a call...

276
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,120
that no one can resist.

277
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,799
At that time, I thought,

278
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,678
"How could that be?"

279
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,919
"Isn't that just brainwashing?"

280
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,519
But now I realize...

281
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,840
it's actually an instinct...

282
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,360
to want to be a mother.

283
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,240
Dear.

284
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,000
I really want to be a mother.

285
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,200
Shall we go see the doctor...

286
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,960
for a checkup next week?

287
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,399
Okay.

288
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,840
I'll listen to you.

289
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,559
(Energy City)

290
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,360
Energy City is so beautiful.

291
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,759
Those who live there have their own drivers.

292
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,919
They look gorgeous every day...

293
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,319
as they frequent various high-end hotels and restaurants.

294
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,918
(Agency information)

295
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,879
Their biggest problem...

296
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,679
is that they have no worries.

297
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm so envious.

298
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,440
Do you like Energy City?

299
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,278
I do.

300
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,360
I love it.

301
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,280
Do you want to rent or buy it?

302
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,240
Rent it.

303
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,839
Aside from renting and buying,

304
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,450
we also offer other sales methods here.

305
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,559
Do you want to try it?

306
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,359
Sure.

307
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,680
First, throw away your books.

308
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,410
Any girl with a mind...

309
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,599
and ideals...

310
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,119
can't live in Energy City.

311
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,359
That's easy.

312
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,119
Second, you need to learn to disguise your feelings.

313
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,079
You can't let joy or anger be visible on your face.

314
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,170
How about this?

315
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,720
That's not enough.

316
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,200
Not enough?

317
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,839
Wearing a mask is really uncomfortable.

318
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,519
Focus on the key point.

319
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,200
You're not smiling.

320
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,519
You have to smile all the time.

321
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,039
You have to know how to make someone happy.

322
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
How about this?

323
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:19,279
(Energy City)

324
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,000
You have to sit still.

325
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,119
Don't move.

326
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,890
You have to turn a blind eye.

327
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,720
You have to stop thinking.

328
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,200
Congratulations, Sun Xiao Han.

329
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,410
You've successfully checked into Energy City.

330
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,200
Enjoy your stay.

331
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,079
(Anji Beef Restaurant)

332
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,409
This place is newly opened.

333
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,480
We haven't tried it yet.

334
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,839
He made the choice,

335
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,095
so if the food is bad, we can hold him accountable.

336
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,890
I recently read a new study.

337
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:19,240
It claims that attractive people are also good eaters.

338
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,519
I have faith in your boyfriend.

339
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Here.

340
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Why are you smiling?

341
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,039
She's praising you.

342
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,359
Say thank you.

343
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,890
Thank you, Han Han.

344
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,170
Nan Nan told me that you're her best friend,

345
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,850
so I picked this hot pot restaurant.

346
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,959
We can chat while eating.

347
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Okay.

348
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,480
I'll make the condiments for you.

349
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,439
What do you think?

350
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,480
Tell me honestly.

351
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,559
Not bad.

352
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,519
I'll go too.

353
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,039
By the way, can I ask you out alone?

354
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,079
It's for Nan Nan.

355
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,890
I want to know...

356
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,079
about the guy...

357
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,079
she was with for seven years.

358
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,170
What is he like?

359
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,079
I don't know him well.

360
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,575
We only had dinner a few times.

361
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,775
He didn't even add me on WeChat.

362
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,440
We're just friends on Weibo.

363
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,600
I don't know much about him.

364
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,720
Can you tell me his Weibo?

365
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,599
Why do you need his Weibo?

366
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:31,839
To love her.

367
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,480
Nowadays,

368
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,610
there aren't as many pure-hearted lovers anymore.

369
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,240
You're doing this for your greed and caution.

370
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,480
Love is also a kind of greed.

371
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,799
Right?

372
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,680
I'll go ahead.

373
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,200
Why are you taking so long?

374
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,559
It's nothing. We were just chatting.

375
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,599
This won't do.

376
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,119
I'm so full.

377
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,959
I've decided that starting tomorrow,

378
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,000
I won't have dinner.

379
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,240
The Internet says...

380
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,976
that having a cheat meal occasionally...

381
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
can help with weight loss.

382
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:20,240
(Nothing I Can Do About You)

383
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,279
Every meal you have is a cheat meal.

384
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,519
If you never feel full,

385
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,055
how can you have the energy to lose weight?

386
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,480
Nothing I Can Do About You.

387
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,799
Is it your Weibo?

388
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,650
How did you find it?

389
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,039
We just played a small game.

390
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,799
She told me her Weibo and asked if I could find yours.

391
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,200
He's just bored.

392
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
Are you still on Weibo?

393
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,439
I haven't used it in a while.

394
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,480
It's just for fun.

395
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,319
Here.

396
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,039
You should eat too. Have one.

397
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Beef ball.

398
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:52,519
Thank you.

399
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,200
(Nothing I Can Do About You)

400
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,679
(What do you think of him?)

401
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,278
(Nan Nan: What do you think of him?)

402
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:25,200
(He treats you well, seems smart, and looks good too.)

403
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,159
(There's something I need to tell you.)

404
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,518
(He asked me about Gao Peng privately, )

405
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,359
(but I didn't say anything.)

406
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,959
By the way,

407
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,480
how about we visit the nearby old town this weekend?

408
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Sure.

409
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,136
Do you want to join us, Han Han?

410
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,479
I don't want to be a third wheel.

411
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,000
- I'm not going. - Are you sure?

412
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,519
It's just the two of us then.

413
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,519
Okay.

414
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,400
Looks like it's just us two.

415
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,200
Look at the little petal.

416
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,078
What should we eat later?

417
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,159
I want to eat rice noodles.

418
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,400
Rice noodles.

419
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,799
It's so beautiful here.

420
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,319
Here, let me take a photo of you.

421
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,039
It's nice.

422
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,359
They think I'm too fat.

423
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,279
You're fat?

424
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,400
This one.

425
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,799
Look at the nostrils.

426
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
It's obviously you.

427
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,640
Which one do you like?

428
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
They're all good.

429
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,079
You have to pick one.

430
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,200
This one then.

431
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,799
We both look good.

432
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,720
All right.

433
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,160
Now, whenever my phone gets a notification,

434
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,440
the first thing that pops up is our photo.

435
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,720
Should I also do the same?

436
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,119
Well. It's up to you.

437
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:35,960
Is this your new Weibo account?

438
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,838
I thought only college students use this.

439
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:39,920
(Yi Loves Zhi Nan)

440
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,920
Just think of it as a diary.

441
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,079
If you run away one day,

442
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,000
there's still something to reminisce about.

443
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,159
Sorry to keep you waiting.

444
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
It's okay.

445
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,720
Thank you.

446
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,119
It smells so good.

447
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Thank you.

448
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:02,480
It's okay.

449
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,159
(Su Su: I'll come back tomorrow.)

450
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,839
(Okay. I'll go pick you up.)

451
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,079
By the way, I have to work overtime tomorrow night.

452
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,559
It's okay.

453
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,199
It just so happens that one of my colleagues...

454
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
is leaving soon.

455
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:29,079
She invited me to her house.

456
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,598
I'll pick you up after dinner.

457
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,680
Sure.

458
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,079
(Huanking Business Building)

459
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:59,519
The groom from the Ming Dynasty is looking at the bride

460
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:06,759
He's peeping at her in the middle of the night

461
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:10,759
It's the end of the world

462
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,119
May the lovers will forever be together

463
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,960
I'll bow to my husband

464
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,839
Cross our arms and raise our cups

465
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,960
Working overtime again?

466
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,359
How much money do you actually want to make?

467
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,719
Don't you need to rest at all?

468
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,078
That's amazing.

469
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,160
Stop teasing me.

470
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,400
Ren Jianhui and Bai Xuexian can sing better than me.

471
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,079
Ren Jianhui.

472
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,079
Do you know him?

473
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,239
Of course.

474
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,456
He's the first Cantonese opera singer.

475
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
- Yes. - Before I came to Hong Kong,

476
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,519
I did some research.

477
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,759
I've even heard them sing "Princess Cheung Ping".

478
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,176
Although I didn't understand all of it,

479
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,598
but I still think it's nice.

480
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,880
You have a good taste.

481
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,279
I made some milk tea. Do you want to try it?

482
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,440
- Sure. - Come on.

483
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,319
It shows how much you love your daughter

484
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,759
The prince consort kept refusing to express his feelings

485
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,960
It shows how much he loves his wife...

486
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,119
Mr. Zhong.

487
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,519
How many children do you have?

488
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,359
Three daughters.

489
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,359
They have been married to places all over the world.

490
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,119
None of them stayed in Hong Kong.

491
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,720
Here.

492
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,680
Let me pour you some milk.

493
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,599
This is the legendary Hong Kong-style milk tea.

494
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,799
Here.

495
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,559
This is called Mr. Zhong's milk tea.

496
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,559
After you try it,

497
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,880
you won't drink any other milk tea.

498
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,359
It's good.

499
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,039
My daughters like it too.

500
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,960
They must be very happy to be your daughters.

501
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,240
As long as they're happy.

502
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,200
Are you not happy?

503
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,319
Had a fight with your boyfriend?

504
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,519
We broke up.

505
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,240
It's fated...

506
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,160
that he doesn't have this luck.

507
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,440
I'm the one without luck.

508
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,160
He's actually a nice guy.

509
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
Maybe...

510
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,119
I'm not content.

511
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,440
I left him behind...

512
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,160
and came to Hong Kong alone.

513
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,920
So you didn't like him for a long time.

514
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,199
He didn't like me for a long time either.

515
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
He probably...

516
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,119
He probably has a new girlfriend.

517
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,240
Do you want a pineapple bun?

518
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
Sure.

519
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,759
You'll have to wait.

520
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,680
The pineapple bun needs to be warmed up to taste good.

521
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,240
Actually,

522
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,640
in life,

523
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,200
we should cry hard...

524
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,119
and laugh hard.

525
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,440
After crying and laughing,

526
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,000
everything will be fine.

527
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,799
Mr. Zhong.

528
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,039
I'm going back to Jiangzhou tomorrow to see him one last time.

529
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,279
What's wrong?

530
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,160
Is he very sick?

531
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,078
I'm going back to pack my things.

532
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,439
Then I'm coming back to Hong Kong.

533
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,160
You scared me.

534
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,079
When I come back this time,

535
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,318
I'll bring you good food.

536
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,359
Sure.

537
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,880
I can't bring crayfish.

538
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,000
Don't bring them even if you can.

539
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,599
I prefer big lobsters.

540
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,319
Here you go.

541
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,480
I'll put some butter...

542
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,599
for you.

543
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:40,999
That's what makes it delicious.

544
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,400
It smells so good.

545
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,240
Okay.

546
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,999
Eating this late at night is fattening.

547
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,038
No, it won't.

548
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,720
This butter is famous.

549
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,079
Free-fat butter.

550
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,160
Here, try it.

551
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,640
Here.

552
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,359
Mr. Zhong's pineapple bun is the best in Hong Kong.

553
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,559
Well said.

554
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,079
The best in Hong Kong.

555
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,839
How's the food there?

556
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,519
It's quite good.

557
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,000
The food is good.

558
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:52,839
It's not expensive either.

559
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,720
Stop eating out.

560
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,839
Learn how to cook.

561
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,319
I'm learning.

562
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,359
I learned two new dishes.

563
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,839
I'll make them for you tonight.

564
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
No.

565
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,839
Let me cook tonight.

566
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,759
The dishes and everything are all ready.

567
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,759
Thank you.

568
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:10,440
The soup is fresh.

569
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,440
I bought beef bones and boiled them all afternoon.

570
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,199
Thank you.

571
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,655
Thinking that you're leaving just like that...

572
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,769
makes me sad.

573
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Is that girl...

574
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,199
your new girlfriend?

575
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:40,519
She's quite cute.

576
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,440
Actually, I already knew.

577
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,769
The night before I called you to break up,

578
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,769
I called to ask you for the Youku verification code.

579
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:59,639
She answered the call.

580
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,480
But she didn't sound very nice.

581
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,879
What did she say?

582
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Nothing.

583
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,039
I don't care anymore.

584
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,519
(He Zhi Nan)

585
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,199
Yi Peng, are you coming to pick me up?

586
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:27,769
I'm in a meeting.

587
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,079
He Zhi Nan.

588
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,079
Is that her name?

589
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,159
To be honest, the first time...

590
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,239
I heard another woman's voice on your phone,

591
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,239
the anger and sadness I felt...

592
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,400
were much stronger...

593
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:04,199
than I expected.

594
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,400
I felt...

595
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:10,920
so humiliated.

596
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,680
I initially wanted to call and confront you,

597
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:17,679
but then I thought there was nothing to say.

598
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:20,856
That's why you broke up with me the next day.

599
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,719
Didn't you prepare for this?

600
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,960
Han Su.

601
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,239
You know I love you, right?

602
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,400
But I'm aware that...

603
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:34,480
I can't provide what you want.

604
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:35,969
Perhaps it's better to let go.

605
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,039
Let go?

606
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,360
Aren't you already looking for someone new?

607
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,520
What about your relocation to Hong Kong?

608
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,319
It wasn't the firm that transferred you there, right?

609
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,400
You applied on your own...

610
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:49,920
and secured it through fierce competition, right?

611
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,239
So...

612
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,840
when it comes to planning ahead,

613
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,289
we're pretty much even.

614
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,400
That girl comes from a rich family, right?

615
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:11,519
She's a low-profile rich heiress.

616
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,719
She definitely won't have to worry...

617
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,840
about saving up for a house like we do.

618
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,119
You can now take care...

619
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,518
of your parents and siblings.

620
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,999
You can leave all your money to them.

621
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:24,360
She might also...

622
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,360
be able to provide you with good resources.

623
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:30,159
Your thoughts make a lot of sense.

624
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,239
For someone like you and me to start from scratch,

625
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,079
it's not practical.

626
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,239
It'd be a waste of your great looks and impressive resume.

627
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,519
Han Su.

628
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,360
Do you need to be so harsh?

629
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,400
You know I love you, right?

630
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,159
Then do you know why...

631
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,079
I didn't struggle at all before giving you up?

632
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,679
Is it because I don't love you enough?

633
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,599
It's because I love you too much!

634
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,119
I know you too well,

635
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,840
just as I know myself.

636
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,640
My nature prevents me from being someone...

637
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,038
who goes with the flow.

638
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,079
It's the same for you.

639
00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:05,880
Our lives...

640
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,960
are tied down by practicality.

641
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:10,289
There's nothing to be ashamed of in admitting it.

642
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,119
So we're the same.

643
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:15,360
The same kind of people.

644
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,039
Do you love her?

645
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,679
I mean, your new girlfriend.

646
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,960
I only love you.

647
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
Since...

648
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:42,840
I can't be with you,

649
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:45,769
it doesn't matter.

650
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:48,808
Is this something you think I love to hear...

651
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,079
or is it just flattery?

652
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,159
It's the truth.

653
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,440
Qu Yi Peng, I'm so disappointed in you.

654
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
You're wrong.

655
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,000
We're not the same.

656
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,239
I do have ambitions and desires,

657
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:05,329
but I'm not as mundane as you.

658
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,199
You're too rational and smart.

659
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:12,558
You can always assess the best benefit combinations...

660
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,679
and discard unnecessary emotions.

661
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,599
I believe you love me,

662
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,769
but that love is only one of the parameters.

663
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,239
When the expected return on that love...

664
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,480
isn't promising,

665
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,440
you gave me up.

666
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,919
You did so more decisively than anyone else.

667
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,159
Bye.

668
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:17,079
(Ideal Type)

669
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:23,599
Hi.

670
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,679
Hello.

671
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,079
You're beautiful,

672
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,639
but you're not the one I'm looking for.

673
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,599
(Blind date)

674
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,280
Sit down.

675
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,000
You're virtuous,

676
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,400
but you're not the one I'm looking for.

677
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,399
You've been here all day. I'm closing the shop.

678
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,480
Get lost.

679
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,400
You're the true love I've been looking for.

680
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:54,439
I've been watching you all day.

681
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,598
- My true love. - Someone like you...

682
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,678
doesn't deserve true love.

683
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:57,679
Get out of my way.
