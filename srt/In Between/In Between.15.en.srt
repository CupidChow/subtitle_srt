00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,560
Are you asking me to remarry you?

4
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,879
No.

5
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,519
I'm not asking you.

6
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,599
I'm just...

7
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,480
begging you...

8
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,640
to remarry me.

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,530
How much more
are you going to punish me?

10
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,039
You don't think...

11
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,560
I'm behind your trouble, do you?

12
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,810
I never thought of it that way,

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,439
but I know you're capable of it.

14
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,400
One side of the scale
is your most important client...

15
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,879
and on the other side...

16
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,840
is your love, Zhou Bin.

17
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,810
Are you willing to give up love...

18
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,560
for such trivial immediate gains?

19
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,960
These are two different matters.

20
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,280
You said you wanted to remarry,

21
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,479
so I thought it over carefully.

22
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,800
I've made up my mind.

23
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,360
I want to remarry.

24
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,438
As for those business matters,

25
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,400
you can manage them if you want
or you can ignore them if you don't.

26
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,759
You sound pretty assertive.

27
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,919
Zeng Cheng.

28
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,719
It's my fault.

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,479
It's all my fault.

31
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,479
I know I hurt you
and ruined our marriage.

32
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
You probably hold
a grudge against me.

33
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,159
That's why I'm asking
for your forgiveness.

34
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,159
The promises and vows
of you middle-aged men...

35
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,719
are just nonsense.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,959
Go ahead and scold me.

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,240
As long as you feel comfortable,

38
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,159
I can take whatever you say.

39
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
However, Zeng Cheng,

40
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,080
have you thought about it?

41
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,080
Is the unfaithful party...

42
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,800
really the only one at fault?

43
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,639
Is infidelity...

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,240
the only cause
of the marriage's destruction?

45
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,878
You used to want...

46
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,560
to hear me repeat "I love you",

47
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,319
but do you really need my love?

48
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,240
It seems like you just want me
to fulfill your desire for control.

49
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:57,159
Sometimes, I feel more like
your son than your husband.

50
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,560
What a spectacular court argument.

51
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,840
Mr. Zhou,

52
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,879
it would be a waste of your talent
not to take on a divorce case.

53
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,239
You perfectly argued...

54
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,120
that infidelity is the cause
rather than the result.

55
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,079
You're the one who made a mistake,

56
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,519
but I'm the one to take the blame.

57
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,679
Are you here
to discuss our remarriage...

58
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,240
or do you want a divorce?

59
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,050
You win.

60
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,610
Just like before.

61
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,360
I reflect on myself.

62
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,800
I admit my mistake.

63
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,839
You're always like this.

64
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,399
What I owe you,

65
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,610
I'll repay
with double the obedience.

66
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,680
Will that do?

67
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,800
Stop being so stubborn.

68
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,680
Don't start humiliating...

69
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,680
and belittling me like before...

70
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,480
until I give in.

71
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,958
It has been over a decade.

72
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,119
Aren't you tired of it?

73
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,279
I certainly am.

74
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,800
Can you please
give me a break today?

75
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,610
I'm begging you.

76
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,609
Can you hold off
on the routine of attacking me...

77
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,959
when I'm already down?

78
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,480
I would really appreciate it, okay?

79
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Have you been living...

80
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,638
in such hardship and unhappiness...

81
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,800
all these years?

82
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,920
From your perspective,

83
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,800
I've started to support you.

84
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,639
You're the victim here.

85
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,240
Can we stop bickering?

86
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,600
How about this?

87
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,958
It's my fault, okay?

88
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,959
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,959
I was wrong.

90
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,000
Please forgive me.

91
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,040
Can we settle this first?

92
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Let go of me.

93
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,479
Even if we remarry,

94
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,519
we can still get a divorce.

95
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,719
Getting a divorce...

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,319
means redistributing our assets.

97
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,359
At that time,

98
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,720
we'd turn into trivial
and calculating individuals.

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
You never wanted
to remarry me, did you?

100
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,000
You just wanted to see me
beg you for forgiveness.

101
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Zeng Cheng.

102
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,240
Zeng Cheng.

103
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,680
Let me take you home.

104
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,560
Zeng Cheng.

105
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,959
(Hong Kong)

106
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,279
Ms. He.

107
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,720
Mr. Gao is having a meeting
in the conference room.

108
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,759
I'll take you there.

109
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,839
This way.

110
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:33,920
Thank you.

111
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,600
I'll let him know that you're here.

112
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,079
There's no need.

113
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,799
I'll just wait here.

114
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,519
Okay. There's a lounge up ahead.

115
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,239
Help yourself.

116
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,680
- Thank you. Okay.
- I'll get back to work.

117
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,278
Regarding...

118
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,920
I think...

119
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,040
Why are you here?

120
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,800
I'm here to see
how our Mr. Gao shines at work.

121
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,279
How about this?

122
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,920
Wait for me at my office.

123
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,719
When I'm done,
I'll come to see you, okay?

124
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,600
I'm not here to see you.

125
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,120
I went shopping at the mall nearby.

126
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,360
I know Han Su
is having a meeting here.

127
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,840
I'm here to have lunch with her.

128
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,679
Han Su.

129
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,239
I have to go back
to the law firm later,

130
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,120
so I only have
half an hour for lunch.

131
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,600
I can't go out with you.

132
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,158
I knew you'd say that.

133
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,279
I brought it.

134
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's go.

135
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,999
I didn't bring yours.

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,090
Deal with it yourself.

137
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,120
Did you go shopping?

138
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,399
Yes. The mall nearby is quite nice.

139
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,519
I'm hungry too.

140
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,720
Emily asked Gao Peng out...

141
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,279
and he went out to see her.

142
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,519
When he came back,
he blocked her on WeChat.

143
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,759
That's great.

144
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,360
What are you thinking about?

145
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,799
I'm thinking if a woman...

146
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,960
wants to continue a relationship,

147
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,000
she'll find reasons to keep going...

148
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,450
no matter the circumstances.

149
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,159
However, if she decides to give up,

150
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,240
no reason will make her turn back.

151
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,360
You have a point.

152
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,678
I think you can consider this...

153
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,559
as your next article
for your public account.

154
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,039
- Really?
- Yes.

155
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,479
You can write it when you get back.

156
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,759
Can you finish it in two days?

157
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,450
Isn't that too rushed?

158
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,638
You need to understand
that many people...

159
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,480
have certain thoughts
and reflections,

160
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
but they fail to execute them fully.

161
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,600
So many things just slip away
as they are put off.

162
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,240
You sound like my boss
when you talk.

163
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,120
By the way,

164
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,089
I've spent some spare time...

165
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,519
over the past few days...

166
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,279
to look into
a few trending public accounts...

167
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,798
and conduct some basic analysis.

168
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,039
See if it's useful to you.

169
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,799
Audience demographic.

170
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,039
It's all related to marketing
and management.

171
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,120
Major reposts and keywords.

172
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,360
You've managed...

173
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,210
to compile so much
in your spare time.

174
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,398
As long as you put
your heart into it,

175
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,639
you can succeed.

176
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,090
You can do it too.

177
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,959
Write it when you get home.
Don't procrastinate.

178
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,210
If you can't do it
in two days, take three.

179
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,279
Send it to me when you're done.

180
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Three days it is.

181
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,480
You can do it.

182
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,600
By the way,

183
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,999
when I was shopping,

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,240
I saw this dress.

185
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,480
It suits you so well.

186
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,159
Moreover, it's on sale.

187
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,519
It makes me feel bad not to buy it.

188
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,080
I really like this brand.

189
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,559
How much is it?
I'll transfer it to you.

190
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,080
It's Gao Peng's money.

191
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,639
The thing is,

192
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,519
my horoscope forecast reminded me...

193
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,600
that I need to give someone a gift
to have good luck.

194
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,360
Just help me out.

195
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,440
Horoscope, my foot.

196
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,518
Thank you.

197
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,799
You're welcome.

198
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,679
Are you done with the demo?

199
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,679
Yes.

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,080
I've been working on it
since two days ago.

201
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,000
It took me about 40 hours.

202
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,559
Thank you, Han Han.

203
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Let's go to Ms. Zeng's office
this afternoon.

204
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,879
Do I have to go?

205
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,159
Of course.

206
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,559
Ms. Zeng specifically
asked you to be there.

207
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,798
Ms. Xin.

208
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,039
Is Ms. Zeng unhappy with me?

209
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,200
No.

210
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,399
What's wrong?

211
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:07,919
Nothing.

212
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,200
Bye.

213
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,439
Mr. Wang, please come in.

214
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Okay.

215
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,359
You'll be able to see
the demo in a moment.

216
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,279
The proposal last time
was pretty good.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,159
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

218
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,759
Sun Han Han.

219
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,440
Sun Han Han
is in charge of this project.

220
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,120
Come and sit over here.

221
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,919
Mr. Wang.

222
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,319
After watching the demo,

223
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,398
if you have any questions,

224
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,919
you can ask Han Han directly.

225
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,720
Okay.

226
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,600
All right then. Let's start now.

227
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,759
Are the meeting minutes ready?

228
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,320
Not yet.

229
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,480
Sort them out as soon as possible.

230
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,679
Okay.

231
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,199
I'll do it later
and email it to you tonight.

232
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,279
Okay.

233
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,439
Ms. Zeng.

234
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,559
Thank you.

235
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,200
For what?

236
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,558
There's a problem with the video,

237
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,878
but it's not about creativity.

238
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,319
It's the problem
with post-production.

239
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,519
Just a minor adjustment will do.

240
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,720
I didn't expect you
to stand up for me just now.

241
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,199
You're so funny.

242
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,919
This is my demo, not yours.

243
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,200
This is
a two-million-dollar commercial.

244
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
The commercial production alone
is worth hundreds of thousands.

245
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,199
Be it settling personal scores
or acting magnanimous,

246
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,320
I'm not going to waste
my money on this.

247
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,878
Please revise the demo
based on the client's feedback.

248
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,879
I will.

249
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,559
Try to submit the demo
as soon as possible.

250
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,159
Then I won't have to see you again.

251
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,999
(Rucheng Group)

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,079
She can give me a hard time.

253
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,439
She can publicly humiliate me.

254
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,960
She can even fire me.

255
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,399
I'm already prepared to fight back.

256
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,120
But do you know?

257
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,079
I don't even have
the chance to put up a fight.

258
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,638
I'm simply being crushed...

259
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,799
and completely outmatched.

260
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,278
This move of hers...

261
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,399
is flawless.

262
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,479
She's a real pro.

263
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,678
A true career woman...

264
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,439
can separate emotions from work...

265
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,320
at any moment.

266
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,519
She gave me a hard lesson...

267
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,360
and I admit defeat wholeheartedly.

268
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,879
Han Han.

269
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,000
Do you still trust Zhou Bin?

270
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,399
He's testing your limits.

271
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
I don't want to see him,

272
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:51,600
but he keeps texting and calling me.

273
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,279
No matter what,

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,839
the idea of remarrying
and then divorcing again...

275
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,919
is too strange and suspicious.

276
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,399
He knows that's my limit.

277
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,159
I don't think Zhou Bin
would go as far as...

278
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,440
to use Zeng Cheng
and marriage for personal gain.

279
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,000
If he really did that,

280
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,480
I'd be deeply disappointed.

281
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,878
Mr. Zhou,

282
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,480
this is the newly revised
lawyer's statement.

283
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,440
Okay. Go ahead and post it.

284
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,960
(Yi Ming's Manager)

285
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Hello?

286
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,080
Mr. Zhou,
we've received the statement.

287
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,799
We're still in discussions
with the artist.

288
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,038
Once we know exactly
what the other party has,

289
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,399
we'll decide how to respond.

290
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Okay.

291
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,319
I'll wait for your final decision.

292
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,440
My entire team
is waiting for your final decision.

293
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,039
I'm a top law school graduate,

294
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,960
yet I have to clean up
after your mess every day.

295
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,359
And this guy still has
people chasing him,

296
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,599
calling him "hubby".

297
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,650
The fans should see his real face!

298
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,920
No one goes home tonight.

299
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,279
Order supper.

300
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,719
Hello.

301
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
I've spoken to Yi Ming's team.

302
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,119
Wei also called me back.

303
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,170
He knows who did it
and put me in touch with them.

304
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,480
I'll talk to them personally.

305
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,839
Wait for my call.

306
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,759
Okay.

307
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,039
Thank you.

308
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,960
Hello, Han Su.

309
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,559
It has been three days.
Where's the draft?

310
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,759
I'm working on it.

311
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,440
My train of thought is stuck.

312
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,170
Don't make excuses.

313
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,960
Aren't you busy?

314
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,599
Why do you have time to rush me?

315
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,240
Are you watching TV?

316
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,839
Turn off the TV
and get on your computer to write.

317
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay.

318
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,358
If I can't write it,
I won't sleep tonight, okay?

319
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,359
It's okay.

320
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,480
I'll stay up all night anyway.

321
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,039
I'll keep you company.

322
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,319
Please get me
a serving of lily and sago.

323
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,480
Ms. Han, you don't have to do this.

324
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,038
The deadline for my proposal
is tomorrow morning.

325
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,240
I'll supervise your work too.

326
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,519
Okay. You're really something.

327
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,759
You're working for the client...

328
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,799
and urging his wife to work
at the same time.

329
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,170
Okay, I'm hanging up.

330
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:42,279
I'll wait for your draft.

331
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,279
Sorry.

332
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This part.

333
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:48,890
Revise it again.

334
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's do it.

335
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,890
- This one.
- Okay.

336
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,079
Give me strength, ladies.

337
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,559
All the best.

338
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,000
What are you doing?

339
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,170
What are you doing?

340
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,960
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

341
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,758
Let me see what you're looking at.

342
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:43,240
I'm chatting with them
to find some inspiration.

343
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,920
You interrupted my train of thought.

344
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,278
All right, my creative little one.

345
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,920
Since you can't write today anyway,

346
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,559
let's eat quickly
and head home to rest, okay?

347
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,078
I can't.

348
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,170
I promised Han Su
that I'd finish writing it today.

349
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,839
Their stories are interesting.

350
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,410
I feel like every single one
could be used as my material.

351
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,920
She forced you
to write an article...

352
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,319
and made me watch
a business seminar.

353
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,359
It's fine if she wants
to push herself,

354
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,759
but forcing the whole world
to join in is too much.

355
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,410
With such a responsible lawyer,
you should be grateful.

356
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,679
Han Su said the proposal
will be ready by tomorrow.

357
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,480
When do you plan
to sign the contract with her?

358
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,599
I'm not sure about that.

359
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,960
Didn't you mention...

360
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,278
that you were only searching
for other law firms...

361
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,240
as a show for your parents?

362
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,519
Yes.

363
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,598
I do support Han Su,

364
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,649
but in the end,

365
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,719
this matter
isn't solely my decision.

366
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,839
The board will decide.

367
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,959
What else does she want?

368
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,279
It's the seventh draft.

369
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,960
Is she trying to kill us?

370
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,839
It's her first time
handling such a big client.

371
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,119
It's understandable.

372
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,719
If we can't sign the contract,

373
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,119
all our hard work will be in vain.

374
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,759
It's just bad luck.

375
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,519
I heard she and Mr. Gao
have a special relationship.

376
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,359
Maybe they've finalized
the contract in private.

377
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,798
Yes. I think so too.

378
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:08,799
Seriously?

379
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,920
It's fake, right?

380
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,799
I think her attitude toward Mr. Gao
is quite normal.

381
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,160
Would she have to work so hard
if they had a special relationship?

382
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,039
She's putting on an act
in front of others.

383
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,240
Regarding the company's
future plans,

384
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,799
Hengliyan has provided new data.

385
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,000
Please make sure
to include that too.

386
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,879
It's just a bid.

387
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,960
There's no need
to go all out like this.

388
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,558
A bid is all about
being better than the others.

389
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,759
Otherwise, what's the point?

390
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,640
Do whatever you want.

391
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,759
The proposal
is already at this level.

392
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,200
If they don't want to choose you,

393
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,240
adding more data
won't make a difference.

394
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,960
We're all junior lawyers.

395
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,920
If you want to give orders,

396
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
get the contract first.

397
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:55,838
Come on.

398
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,000
You can do it.

399
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,799
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

400
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Miss.

401
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,319
Who are you looking for?

402
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,559
Han Su.

403
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,519
I see. Han Su is upstairs.

404
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,759
- Thank you.
- Okay.

405
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,839
Hurry up.

406
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,959
We'll be closed soon.

407
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,039
Okay.

408
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,799
Zhi Nan.

409
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,920
What are you doing here?

410
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,279
I'm here to deliver something.

411
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Your draft?

412
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,359
That's all you think about.

413
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,480
Gao Peng is asleep.

414
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:28,559
I took these from his desk.

415
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,640
I don't know
if they're useful to you.

416
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
(Hengliyan's IPO)

417
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,200
What did you bring them here?

418
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,839
To help you.

419
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,839
You have to know your enemy to win.

420
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,480
Gao Peng will be furious
when he finds out.

421
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,279
Why are you making such a dumb move
and siding with outsiders?

422
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,559
I'm helping him.

423
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,519
Han Su, you're the best lawyer.

424
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,279
He'd be a fool not to choose you.

425
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,720
Open it up and see what's useful.

426
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Zhi Nan.

427
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,240
I'm sure it's useful,

428
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,759
but I can't use it.

429
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,440
Anyway, thank you.

430
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
Thank you for helping me.

431
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,039
How should I express my gratitude?

432
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,440
Well,

433
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,720
showing gratitude is a must.

434
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
First,

435
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,119
stop rushing my work.

436
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,920
Second,

437
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,440
I'd like to have a glass of water.

438
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,839
I'm exhausted.

439
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,319
Han Su.

440
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,640
Her badge has fallen off.

441
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,519
How cool.

442
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,679
So many...

443
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,720
Here you go.

444
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,200
Thank you.

445
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,599
Have a seat.

446
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,960
I'm serious.

447
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,160
How should I repay you?

448
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,759
I'm serious too.

449
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,319
Zhi Nan.

450
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,519
Why are you helping me?

451
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,319
Because we're good friends.

452
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,240
You don't have to see me off.

453
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,118
- Did you call a taxi?
- Yes, I did.

454
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,240
Don't worry.

455
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,279
When you get home,
text me on WeChat.

456
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:20,799
Bye.

457
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,119
Han Su.

458
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
What are you doing here?

459
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Mr. Zhong.

460
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,559
Actually, I'm not a good person.

461
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,920
I'm greedy and demanding.

462
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,079
If anyone gets in
the way of my success,

463
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,119
I'll resent them...

464
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:00,839
including myself.

465
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,640
I still remember back in
my second year of high school,

466
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,920
there was a class placement exam.

467
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:11,640
I dropped from 1st place
in the grade to 80th.

468
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:14,920
I still remember...

469
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,039
staring at the ranking board...

470
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,880
as if I were staring...

471
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,000
at my death sentence.

472
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
That night, I cried for hours.

473
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
The next day,
I made a deal with my mom.

474
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,559
Until I climbed back to first place,

475
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,160
I wouldn't waste my time
talking to anyone.

476
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,400
When I returned to school,

477
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,880
aside from answering
teachers' questions,

478
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,880
I didn't speak at all.

479
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,759
My classmates didn't like me.

480
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,359
They thought I was...

481
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,880
arrogant...

482
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,359
and distant.

483
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,079
My deskmate at that time
was named Yuan Yuan.

484
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,359
She seemed completely oblivious...

485
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,440
to my cold attitude...

486
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,480
and kept talking to me nonstop.

487
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,079
You're back.

488
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,839
Let me tell you.

489
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,279
I've been thinking
about this for a while.

490
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,680
I really feel sorry for Do Min Joon.

491
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,839
I mean,

492
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,199
he has been living on Earth...

493
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,640
all alone for so long.

494
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,480
Do you want some chocolate?

495
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,559
I have a lot more.

496
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,240
Think about it.

497
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,558
If it were me,

498
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,519
I don't think
I could last even a week.

499
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,319
Luckily,

500
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,200
he met Cheon Song Yi.

501
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,160
That's what you call...

502
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,519
destiny.

503
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,200
Let's eat.

504
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,359
Let's eat.

505
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,920
I'll tell you the gossip in a bit.

506
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,559
My mom's cola chicken wings.

507
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:56,278
They're the best in the world.

508
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,519
You have to try one.

509
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,839
Okay. I'll tell you the gossip now.

510
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,039
Liu Qiang and Sun Yi Yi...

511
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,279
are going head-to-head again
in this mock exam.

512
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,519
Guess what?

513
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:10,079
Everyone is betting on
who'll come in second.

514
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,680
They all say...

515
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,039
Liu Qiang will be first.

516
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,359
He's always burning
the midnight oil.

517
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,960
I didn't like her at that time.

518
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,799
I thought she was...

519
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,519
a bit slow...

520
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,079
and foolish.

521
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,880
Hey, wait for me.

522
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,160
I have the latest intel.

523
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,319
Let me tell you.

524
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,119
"Mr. Bodyguard"...

525
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,119
is now known
by everyone in the class.

526
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,278
If you want to read it,

527
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,480
you don't have to wait in line.

528
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,880
I can borrow it for you.

529
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,400
The teacher who teaches us politics
is getting married soon.

530
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,480
They say her boyfriend
is quite handsome.

531
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:45,039
But our teacher
is also very beautiful.

532
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,559
Will she maybe have a baby...

533
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,839
in a couple of years...

534
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,920
and stop teaching us?

535
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,720
A new steamed bun shop
just opened up in front...

536
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,519
and their buns
with preserved vegetables...

537
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,640
and braised pork
are especially delicious.

538
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,319
Let's have buns today.

539
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,079
I don't like preserved vegetables.

540
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,279
Do they have cabbage filling?

541
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,599
You talked.

542
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,599
Okay. Let's eat the ones
with cabbage filling today.

543
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,559
However,
upon thinking about it later,

544
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,039
I realized how much
I depended on her.

545
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,519
If it weren't for her constant noise
and laughter beside me,

546
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,279
the tension in my heart
might have snapped long ago.

547
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,160
One day, I asked her,

548
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,480
"I don't even talk to you."

549
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
"Why do you keep talking to me?"

550
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,559
She said...

551
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,319
She said...

552
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,759
"Because we're good friends."

553
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:47,920
Zhi Nan.

554
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,119
Why are you helping me?

555
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,519
Because we're good friends.

556
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:54,839
That day,

557
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,680
I said so many things.

558
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,799
I felt like...

559
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,519
I had never been that happy before.

560
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
It was so relaxed...

561
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
and joyful.

562
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,519
I'm so happy today.

563
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:43,759
Later on,

564
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,640
she didn't do well in school.

565
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,000
She didn't get
into a good university.

566
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,839
I fulfilled my wishes...

567
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,440
and continued on my path.

568
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,000
I didn't contact her anymore.

569
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,880
She also made new friends.

570
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,119
I didn't think about her...

571
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,359
because...

572
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,440
Because thinking about her
makes me feel...

573
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,880
ashamed.

574
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,000
I regret it so much.

575
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,880
Today, all of a sudden,
I miss her so much.

576
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,880
I miss her so much.

577
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:32,880
Mr. Zhong.

578
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,319
I've lost my only good friend.

579
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:56,880
I'm sorry.

580
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,359
Everyone makes mistakes
when they‘re young,

581
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,319
but when we...

582
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,480
remember those mistakes...

583
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,719
and feel ashamed,

584
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,440
that's when you grow up.

585
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,719
Han Su.

586
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,840
You've grown up.

587
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,000
You will never lose
your good friend again.

588
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,119
Come on.

589
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,519
Zeng Cheng.

590
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,519
I'm back.

591
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Zeng Cheng.

592
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,639
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Zhou.

593
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,199
We're from
Nian'an International Hospital.

594
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,839
Ms. Zeng just fainted.

595
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,038
She's undergoing an examination.

596
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,599
Please come over
as soon as possible.

597
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:31,769
I'll be right there.

598
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,639
(Thank you, my dear wife)

599
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:10,960
Based on my preliminary findings,

600
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,158
it's related
to her adverse reactions...

601
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,639
to the ovulation injection
she received some time ago.

602
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,519
The coma is due to
a coagulation dysfunction.

603
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,959
Of course,

604
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,199
we still need to wait...

605
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:21,440
for the results
of several other tests...

606
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:22,960
before making a final judgment.

607
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,440
What's the worst-case scenario?

608
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,519
Well, it's hard to say.

609
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,119
It depends on the location
and severity of her blood clot.

610
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
The worst-case scenario is that
she could end up with paralysis.

611
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,960
Here.

612
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:12,809
Thank you.

613
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,039
I blame myself...

614
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:22,159
for whimsically wanting
to have a child with you.

615
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,039
Once that idea popped into my head,

616
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,769
I couldn't hold it back.

617
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,719
Now that I think about it,

618
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,719
it's really ridiculous.

619
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,880
Zeng Cheng.

620
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,239
What do you want for dinner?

621
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,000
I've booked a caregiver.

622
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:00,519
Xiao Li will come later.

623
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,559
You don't have to stay here.

624
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,719
Whether to go to work...

625
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,960
or spend time with someone else,

626
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:10,639
you should go do
what you have to do.

627
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,809
The doctor said
you can't get out of bed now.

628
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:19,880
You can't go to the bathroom...

629
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,329
to take a shower.

630
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,559
I'll help you wash up later.

631
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,809
Zeng Cheng.

632
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,599
Until when are you going
to hold this grudge against me?

633
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:38,519
Even enemies...

634
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:40,159
have times of truce.

635
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,289
Whatever issues you have with me,

636
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,039
can we discuss them
after you recover?

637
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:09,440
I don't feel like...

638
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,440
going home.

639
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,519
Is there a sentence...

640
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:19,239
longer than marriage in this world?

641
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,559
A woman...

642
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:26,480
legally traps and controls you...

643
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:29,119
for a full 20 years.

644
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,960
In this stagnant world,

645
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,119
I long for...

646
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,480
even the slightest bit...

647
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
of freshness.

648
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,239
I know.

649
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,239
If I open the door...

650
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,679
and take a step,

651
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,329
I'll be able to feel...

652
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,039
something new and beautiful.

653
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,679
However, I can't do that.

654
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,559
Because I'm stuck in a cage.

655
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:21,769
"Let's get a divorce."

656
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,078
I've thought about this
countless times.

657
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,639
Because I firmly believe
that once I say it,

658
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,078
all that's waiting for me...

659
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,519
is a bright future.

660
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,840
Dear.

661
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,399
(Let’s Get a Divorce)

662
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,480
You're back.

663
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,920
Perfect.

664
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,559
I have something to tell you.

665
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,960
Let's...

666
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:50,360
I...

667
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,599
What is it?

668
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,809
Please help me.

669
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:59,360
There's a sale at the mall today.

670
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,559
I bought you beef ribs.

671
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,769
It's your favourite.

672
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:04,118
I also bought you new clothes...

673
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,159
and some socks.

674
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:07,840
Your feet don't stink anymore.

675
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:10,960
Why did you buy so much?

676
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:12,400
Do you think I wanted to?

677
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
It's all because of you.

678
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,960
You're always pulling a long face.

679
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:17,840
It's as if the whole world owes you.

680
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,239
I know.

681
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:24,960
It must be because of work.

682
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,960
That's why I'm trying
to cheer you up.

683
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,199
By the way, what did you
want to tell me just now?

684
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,809
Let's go home.
