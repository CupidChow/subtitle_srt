00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 8)

3
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,000
Why are you here?

4
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,280
I didn't expect you
to work overtime, lazy bum.

5
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,840
My boss has been in meetings
with the client all day.

6
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,400
Why didn't you call me?

7
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,159
I figured you were working
and didn't want to disturb you,

8
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,599
so I waited for you here.

9
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,039
At least I know
you're not with someone else.

10
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,530
My ex-boyfriend has left.

11
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,000
It's true.

12
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,159
Don't mention him again.

13
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,240
Let's not talk
about him anymore, okay?

14
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,359
Everyone says women...

15
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,758
have a strong sense of jealousy.

16
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,759
But let me tell you.

17
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,038
Men are way,

18
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,280
way more jealous than women.

19
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,439
Got it?

20
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,199
How's everything at work?

21
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,918
It's okay.

22
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,120
The client is a bit long-winded.

23
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,919
By the way,

24
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,719
let's find a day
to meet your friend.

25
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,360
Why did you suddenly think
of meeting my friend?

26
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,639
I hope to have
more mutual friends with you.

27
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,279
I'm worried that
if I make you angry one day,

28
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,359
you'll delete my contact.

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
How will I be able
to reach you then?

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
How is that possible?

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
What to do?

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,159
I want you more and more

33
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,759
He Zhi Nan.

34
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,199
You're doomed.

35
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,479
What you find...

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,080
hardest to resist...

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,800
is the occasional
childlike behaviour...

38
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,120
displayed by
a typically domineering man.

39
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,519
Sure.

40
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,560
I'll take you to her.

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
What do you want to eat for dinner?

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,719
I want...

43
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,198
noodles with soybean paste.

44
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,639
Noodles with soybean paste? Okay.

45
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,879
It's almost done.
This is the last dish.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,079
Just wait for a while more.

47
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
It smells so good.

48
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
I know, right?

49
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,170
Yi Peng, you have a message.

50
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,399
(Incoming call, Su Su)

51
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Hey, Qu Yi Peng.

52
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,838
I just realized today...

53
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,839
that my Youku membership...

54
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,279
is registered
with your phone number.

55
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,000
Can you send me
the verification code?

56
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,879
I guess you've already received
the message.

57
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,279
Hey, Qu Yi Peng.

58
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,800
Can you hear me?

59
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,240
Hey.

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,079
Qu Yi Peng?

61
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,759
Stop messing around. Hurry up.

62
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,318
You should have received
the message.

63
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,319
Send it to me now.

64
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,680
I'm finally not in the mood
for overtime today...

65
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,839
and just want
to binge-watch some series.

66
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,519
Qu Yi Peng.

67
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,279
Hello?

68
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,759
Are you looking for Qu...

69
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,480
Are you looking for Yi Peng?

70
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,319
Who are you?

71
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,120
I'm his friend.

72
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,759
Friend?

73
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,720
I'm his friend too.

74
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,160
I'm his girlfriend.

75
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,518
Are you free today? Let's go today.

76
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,680
I'm not free.
Do you have a girlfriend?

77
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Yes.

78
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,920
But I used to.

79
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,199
Did you break up?

80
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,638
Yesterday.

81
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,639
Why?

82
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,680
Because of you.

83
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,319
I know you.

84
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,079
Su Su.

85
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,959
What kind of friend are you?

86
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,199
I can't disclose that to you.

87
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,759
I'll tell him for you.

88
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Bye,

89
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,279
Su Su.

90
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,359
(Su Su)

91
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,480
(Delete)

92
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,599
(Youku Tudou.
Your verification code is...)

93
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,638
(Delete)

94
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,120
(Delete this message?)

95
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Dinner is ready.

96
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,399
It smells good. Does it smell good?

97
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,079
It smells so good.

98
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,720
I'm going to answer the call.

99
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,960
Ladle out the soup.

100
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,399
Hello.

101
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,679
I'm about to eat.

102
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,000
Go ahead.

103
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,639
The subscriber you've dialled
is currently busy.

104
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,758
Please hold on.

105
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,210
The subscriber you've dialled
is currently busy.

106
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,919
Su Su?

107
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,120
She's good.

108
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,919
As you know,

109
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,450
she's very diligent at work.

110
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,279
I couldn't persuade her before,

111
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,679
let alone now.

112
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,679
Okay, I got it.

113
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,919
I'll find a chance to talk to her.

114
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Take care.

115
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,639
Bye.

116
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,559
Let's eat.

117
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,329
Let me do it.

118
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,450
It's okay.

119
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,240
I'll do it. Go sit down.

120
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,840
Eat more meat.

121
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
You've lost weight lately.

122
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,080
What's wrong?

123
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,559
Does it taste bad?

124
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,399
It's good.

125
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,159
Eat more.

126
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,480
(Su Su)

127
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,360
(Su Su)

128
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,199
The subscriber you've dialled
is currently busy.

129
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,758
Please dial again later.

130
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,799
Sorry. The...

131
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,480
Would you like something to drink?

132
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,919
I want a sugar-free one.

133
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,279
(Su Su)

134
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,679
The subscriber you've dialled
is currently busy.

135
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Why didn't you pick up the call?

136
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,679
It's my boss.

137
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
He's so annoying.

138
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,840
He wants to talk about work
after office hours.

139
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,279
Well, I can't spoil him.

140
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,600
He just told me...

141
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,120
that a client...

142
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,159
terminated the contract.

143
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,799
I used to worry...

144
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,480
every day,

145
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,479
but now that...

146
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,639
I overheard your phone conversation.

147
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,559
Your phone had a sound leak.

148
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,720
I heard...

149
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,360
a woman's voice...

150
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,279
and she mentioned...

151
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Su Su.

152
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,519
Is she your ex-girlfriend?

153
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,039
Yes.

154
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,799
It's Su Su's mom.

155
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,199
She doesn't know we broke up.

156
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,240
So have you broken up?

157
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,440
- What do you mean?
- What?

158
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,440
Can't you just tell me directly
if you've broken up?

159
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,119
Her mom can call you.

160
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,200
But what about her?

161
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,119
Can she order you around
as she likes,

162
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
- Qu Yi Peng?
- Yes.

163
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,320
We're together now.

164
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,840
I hope
you won't bring this up again.

165
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
What do you mean?

166
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,440
What do I mean?

167
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
He Zhi Nan.

168
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,960
When you came back from the mall,

169
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,879
you said you wouldn't see
your ex-boyfriend anymore,

170
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
right?

171
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,559
Did you do that?

172
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,320
The two of us are together now,

173
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,360
but we both have a past, right?

174
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,879
Our past is not a blank slate.

175
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,240
It was filled with
genuine feelings and efforts.

176
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,440
How can we possibly erase everything
from our past in an instant?

177
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,320
So...

178
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,559
please trust me, okay?

179
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,919
I'll take care of this matter,

180
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,320
but...

181
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,799
But not in the way
and standards you think are right.

182
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
I also believe that
you can take care of your matter...

183
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,679
in your own way and standards.

184
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Let's not talk...

185
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,279
about them anymore, okay?

186
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,799
Nan Nan.

187
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,410
We are human after all.

188
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,440
We have feelings.

189
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,920
If you value the future,

190
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,759
you'll surely honour the past.

191
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,039
Right?

192
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,799
When I'm with you,

193
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,759
I feel calm...

194
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,480
and relaxed.

195
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,960
That's why I don't want us...

196
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,960
to get caught up
in meaningless arguments,

197
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,000
doubts,

198
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,650
and defensiveness.

199
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,759
Otherwise, in the end,

200
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,319
we'll both be exhausted...

201
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,440
and our hearts will grow cold
from all the fighting.

202
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,319
I'm sorry.

203
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,799
I'm sorry.

204
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,440
Don't be angry, okay?

205
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,359
Let me hug you.

206
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,039
I'm sorry.

207
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,599
I like you.

208
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm serious.

209
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,599
Hello, Su Su.

210
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,000
I worked overtime last night.

211
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
I called you when I got home,
but your phone was off.

212
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,279
What's the matter?

213
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,440
Are you angry with me?

214
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,039
Qu Yi Peng.

215
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,799
Let's break up.

216
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,759
Okay.

217
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,890
So you neither want
to hear the reasons...

218
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,890
nor try to hold on, right?

219
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,200
There's nothing worth holding on to.

220
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,599
You...

221
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,440
don't like me anyway.

222
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,720
Han Su.

223
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,890
I know you too well.

224
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,559
I know...

225
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,839
you're ambitious.

226
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,000
You want to climb up the ladder.

227
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,480
I can't keep up with you.

228
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm...

229
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,200
not good enough...

230
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,799
for you.

231
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,359
By going to Hong Kong,
aren‘t you making it clear...

232
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,279
that you want to break up with me?

233
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,480
Hello?

234
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,720
I can hear you.

235
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,880
Actually,

236
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,079
many things aren't as you think,

237
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,279
but it doesn't really matter.

238
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,839
Why is your voice hoarse?

239
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,000
Did you stay up late again
last night?

240
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,359
Anyway, from now on,

241
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,000
take good care of yourself.

242
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,880
All right then.

243
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,200
Next week,

244
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,680
I'll go back to Jiangzhou
for a business trip.

245
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,680
I'll go home...

246
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,720
and get my belongings.

247
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,880
We're both adults.

248
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,960
Let's part on good terms.

249
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,680
When you come back,

250
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:48,839
I'll make you...

251
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:50,880
your favourite...

252
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,640
sweet and sour pork ribs.

253
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:08,960
By the way,
let me ask you something.

254
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,359
Is my caller's name on your phone...

255
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,119
still the same as before?

256
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:14,838
It's Su Su.

257
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,839
What's the matter?

258
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,920
Will you change it
since we broke up?

259
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,559
No.

260
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,119
Han Han, can you do me a favour?

261
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,960
Why are you being so polite
all of a sudden?

262
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,160
What is it? Tell me.

263
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
Here's the thing.

264
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:37,279
I've been managing
my friend's house...

265
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,480
while he's overseas.

266
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,359
He plans to rent it out...

267
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,880
and a new set of furniture
is being delivered today.

268
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:44,758
However,
I'm currently out in the suburbs...

269
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,839
and can't make it back.

270
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,880
Can you help me receive
the furniture?

271
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,640
That place is very close
to your company.

272
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,599
It's about a 10-minute walk.

273
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,640
I'll send you the keys
via courier later.

274
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,480
I thought it was something serious.

275
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,598
No problem.

276
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,920
I'll go there at noon.

277
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,200
Ask the furniture delivery guy
to contact me directly.

278
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,599
Why do you live so far away?

279
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,039
You must spend a lot of time
commuting every day.

280
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,758
I can't afford to rent
a place closer to the company.

281
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,960
I'll rent it for you.

282
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,999
I've been managing
my friend's house.

283
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,640
He plans to rent it out...

284
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,920
and a new set of furniture
is being delivered today.

285
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,640
That place is very close
to your company.

286
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
Can you help me
receive the furniture?

287
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,679
I just want to rent...

288
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,279
a place near your office.

289
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,359
I really can't bear to see
the woman I love...

290
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,880
suffer and go through this hardship.

291
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:57,799
You're here.

292
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,160
What do you think of this house?

293
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,480
It's quite nice.

294
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,160
This house...

295
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,839
has been vacant for years.

296
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,119
Before this,

297
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,000
I couldn't find a suitable tenant.

298
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,599
What does that have to do with me?

299
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,640
How about...

300
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,160
I rent it to you?

301
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,680
You rent it to me?

302
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,599
Is this your house?

303
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
That's right.

304
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,039
You still have to pay the rent,

305
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,720
but I'll give you a discount.

306
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,759
Just a little.

307
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,960
Let's sign a contract then,

308
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,279
Mr. Zhou.

309
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,640
No problem.

310
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,440
Zeng Cheng.

311
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,159
Su Su, are you tired?

312
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,240
No.

313
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,079
- Let me do it.
- The traffic isn't too congested.

314
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,160
It's all right. I'll do it.

315
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,799
I forgot to tell you.

316
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,079
It's a bit of a hassle
to wear high heels.

317
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,319
It's all right.

318
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,720
Don't tell me...

319
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,119
you live in
such an expensive neighbourhood...

320
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,960
just to bump into him.

321
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,440
I did run into him by chance.

322
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,599
You met Sun Xu in person?

323
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,799
While jogging in the morning.

324
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,599
Did you two talk?

325
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:17,200
He greeted me good morning
and I responded to him.

326
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,519
I'm fine.

327
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,279
Really.

328
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,160
At first, I also thought...

329
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,519
that when I saw him,

330
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,759
I'd lose control of my emotions.

331
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
But it turned out okay.

332
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
It's really okay.

333
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,799
He seems fine.

334
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,559
He has this polite...

335
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,240
and gentle appearance.

336
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,559
All the way, I kept thinking...

337
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,279
about what his calm face
would look like...

338
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,680
if I couldn't hold back...

339
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,719
and confronted him saying,

340
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,839
"I'm your biological daughter."

341
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,200
He must think I'm a lunatic.

342
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,240
I'm fine.

343
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:59,160
He looks quite different
from the photo,

344
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,920
but I still recognized him
at a glance.

345
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,599
Su Su.

346
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,240
I've been wanting
to ask you a question.

347
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,000
When you took
the college entrance exam back then,

348
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,880
you insisted on majoring in law.

349
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,720
Was it because of him?

350
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,519
As you know,

351
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,079
the word "dad"
is a taboo in our family.

352
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,160
My mom hid everything about him.

353
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,680
When I was 16,

354
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,519
I accidentally found this photo.

355
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,599
Thanks to the Internet,
I was able to search for him.

356
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:45,960
I didn't expect him
to be such a famous lawyer.

357
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,720
Maybe that's why...

358
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,920
I have a particular interest
in studying law.

359
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,359
That's why...

360
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,000
you chose to work at his law firm,

361
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,799
successfully moved to Hong Kong,

362
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,359
and even live here.

363
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,759
Are you really ready
to reunite with him?

364
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,319
I just want
to achieve something great.

365
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,480
Then I'll stand...

366
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,279
in front of him...

367
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,640
with pride...

368
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,558
and casually mention...

369
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,000
my mom's name.

370
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:35,880
I'm curious how he will react.

371
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,519
I'm curious.

372
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,920
I'm really curious.

373
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,960
This is too dramatic.

374
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,920
It's not just dramatic.

375
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,039
It's downright melodramatic...

376
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,160
than a drama.

377
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:56,440
But it's precisely because
of this melodramatic thought...

378
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,160
that it has helped me...

379
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,559
get through
countless sleepless nights.

380
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,720
It gave me endless energy.

381
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,640
I want to excel...

382
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,329
in his field,

383
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,119
to do better than him,

384
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,079
and then let him know...

385
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,719
just how wrong he was.

386
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,199
Han Han.

387
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,400
I'm going to work.

388
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,559
Wait for me.

389
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,639
What is it?

390
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,840
Hurry up. I'm going to be late.

391
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,639
This is for you.

392
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:02,079
These cufflinks
come with a matching tie clip.

393
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,880
It's a limited edition.

394
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:06,960
This set isn't cheap.

395
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,199
The entire set...

396
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:11,440
would take up a good part
of your monthly salary.

397
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,960
I don't want to owe you too much.

398
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,679
I understand.

399
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,519
You want equality in love.

400
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,639
But our relationship itself
is equal.

401
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,289
You don't have to match
every gift I give you...

402
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:27,000
with something of equal value.

403
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,719
I just want you to know...

404
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,679
that I love you.

405
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,039
I love you too.

406
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,039
I forgot to tell you.

407
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,599
I'm divorced.

408
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,289
Look.

409
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,360
(Divorce certificate)

410
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,119
Zeng Cheng.

411
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,769
Actually...

412
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,809
Let me show you something.

413
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:28,078
If one doesn't have
some inside ties,

414
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,289
he or she won‘t be able
to grab this big house.

415
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,769
So you got divorced
to buy this house.

416
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,400
But the divorce certificate is real.

417
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,480
We even went through
the cooling-off period.

418
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,039
Don't tell anyone about this.

419
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,559
Including my mom and your mom.

420
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,289
Apart from you,
no one else in our family knows.

421
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,159
Then no one will know.

422
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:55,039
You're being ridiculous.

423
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,809
That's what Zhou Bin said at first,

424
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,198
but when he saw the house,

425
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,329
he was tempted too.

426
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,519
I told myself not to be so greedy,

427
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,289
but I couldn't help it.

428
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:09,679
I shall reflect on myself.

429
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,599
Aren't you worried at all?

430
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,769
About what?

431
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:15,880
That he cheated on me?

432
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,839
We talked it over.

433
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,559
After the divorce was finalized,

434
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,639
I even joked with him about it.

435
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,159
He said, "Look."

436
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,119
"All the assets in our family
are under your name."

437
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,289
"The one who should
be worried is me, okay?"

438
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:32,079
I really envy you.

439
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,360
You both trust each other so much.

440
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,880
I trust him
more than I trust myself.

441
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,239
You know what?

442
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,239
In our company,

443
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,440
there really are...

444
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,079
a few good-looking guys.

445
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,039
The day we got divorced,
I was thinking,

446
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,960
"Since we're both single now,"

447
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:49,440
"can't I do some little bad things?"

448
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,638
Sure. Give it a try.

449
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,679
I support you.

450
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,039
Okay, I'm leaving.

451
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,400
- Have a safe trip.
- Take care of yourself.

452
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,769
- I'm leaving. Bye.
- Bye.

453
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,809
(City Hua)

454
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,199
Over here.

455
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,519
Nan Nan.

456
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,769
Please hold on.

457
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,329
Visitor for 1706.

458
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,360
- How is it?
- It's nice.

459
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,329
By the way,
this is your housewarming gift.

460
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,440
A beauty device.

461
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:26,639
Thank you, Nan Nan.

462
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,719
You have a nice neighbourhood.

463
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:33,809
You know what?

464
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,880
When I first started working here,

465
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,480
my monthly salary was 8,000 yuan.

466
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,920
I wanted to find a place
that's close to the office,

467
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,599
but I overestimated myself
and ended up here.

468
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:44,118
The agent was very friendly.

469
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,480
He recommended
a lot of properties to me.

470
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:46,599
Guess how much they are.

471
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,000
The cheapest one
is exactly 8,000 yuan.

472
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,119
I straightaway remove the agent.

473
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,769
Sun Han Han.

474
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,880
Right now,

475
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,039
you have the vibe...

476
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,599
Wang Baochuan.

477
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,519
What do you mean?

478
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:01,880
"Enduring the cold and lonely wait,"

479
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,840
"only to see the clouds part
and the moon shine."

480
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,880
How dare you tease me.

481
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,440
Having two households
on one floor is fantastic.

482
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,400
A house with a view of the river.

483
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,559
Sun Han Han, you...

484
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:40,679
You're so lucky.

485
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:44,639
This living room...

486
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,960
This living room is big enough
for me to play badminton.

487
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,679
I'll be here, and you'll be there.

488
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,079
You can come whenever you want.

489
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Thank you.

490
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,360
Do Zhou Bin and his crazy wife
still see each other?

491
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:08,809
Maybe they do.

492
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,809
You're so magnanimous.

493
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,079
I try to empathize with him.

494
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:17,920
Zhou Bin knows very well...

495
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,960
that this is my goodwill
and trust in him.

496
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,079
Naturally, he has reciprocated
everything to me.

497
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,329
The question is,

498
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,199
can you trust him forever?

499
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,679
This is nice.

500
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,599
This situation won't last long.

501
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,000
Let me show you...

502
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,769
Zeng Cheng's social media.

503
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,920
It's filled with
a high-spirited work attitude.

504
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,879
I used to admire her.

505
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
She's so energetic.

506
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,159
Thinking about it now,

507
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,159
don't you find it frightening?

508
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,159
Is this Zhou Bin and his ex-wife?

509
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,880
He looks familiar.

510
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,919
Isn't he that singer?

511
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,000
He sings really well.

512
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,809
So he's Zhou Bin's client.

513
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,599
Zhou Bin is quite outstanding.

514
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,769
I heard he's having
a concert next month.

515
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:26,239
Can you get me two tickets?

516
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,239
How's the patient?

517
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:33,480
It's an emergency.

518
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:35,000
Her family and friends said
she just had a breakup.

519
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,118
As a result,
her dopamine, endorphins,

520
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,239
and oxytocin levels plummeted.

521
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,920
She can no longer function normally.

522
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,079
In the ambulance,
we did a blood test on her.

523
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,400
According to the indicators,

524
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,679
the patient
is severely love-starved.

525
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:47,719
Give her a dose of romance novels.

526
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,039
I did, but it didn't work.

527
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:51,840
What about romance dramas?

528
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,239
I tried that too.

529
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:54,289
It didn't work at all.

530
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,479
What about the cat?

531
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,079
Let her sniff it
for some urgent healing.

532
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,239
What should we do?

533
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,558
If the patient
doesn't get enough love,

534
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,769
her life will be in danger.

535
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,769
Handsome guys?

536
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:06,159
Where are the handsome guys?

537
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,920
The supply of handsome guys
is running low.

538
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,440
The remaining ones
just don‘t match her type at all.

539
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:12,360
I'm going to seek help
from other provinces.

540
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,639
I got it.

541
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:28,329
I got it.

542
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,639
Inject the salary and bonuses now.

543
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,960
(As long as there's food and water,
one will be satisfied.)

544
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:52,769
- She made it.
- She made it.

545
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:53,809
- She made it.
- She made it.

546
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
- To heal from a heartbreak,
- To heal from a heartbreak,

547
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,440
- savings are the real remedy.
- savings are the real remedy.
