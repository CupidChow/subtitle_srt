1
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 19)

3
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,000
Jojo.

4
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,799
I'm leaving.

5
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,159
Tickle, tickle.

6
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,560
Tickle, tickle.

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,120
Where do I start?

8
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,318
I think it's going to peck at me.

9
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,400
It's okay.

10
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,370
Tickle, tickle.

11
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,280
How is it?

12
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,810
Its fur is so soft.

13
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,599
There are so many fruits up ahead.

14
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,810
They're not ripe yet.

15
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,758
When they're ripe in July,
I'll bring you here to pick them.

16
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,810
Sure.

17
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,239
I planted some in here too.

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,559
- Over there.
- Where?

19
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,598
Over there.

20
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,639
Let's take a look.

21
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,039
Babe.

22
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,120
This is the last time...

23
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,198
I'll call you this.

24
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,919
(Little Peng)

25
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,439
Gao Peng.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,039
Let's break up.

27
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,598
(I have to work late tonight,)

28
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,800
(so I won't be able to send you off
for your early flight.)

29
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,840
You want to break up.

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,159
Shouldn't you meet...

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
to say a proper goodbye?

32
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,520
I don't think it's necessary.

33
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,159
It's too awkward.

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,680
Just letting things
fade away like this is fine.

35
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,840
No matter how passionate
things were before,

36
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,479
now that I've packed my things,

37
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,000
there's no trace of me...

38
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,800
left in...

39
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,000
this house.

40
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,639
Soon,

41
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,560
there will be no trace of me...

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,120
in his life.

43
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,759
Then you should erase
all traces of him too.

44
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,000
There's nothing to be afraid of.

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,599
It's a memento.

46
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,050
If I erase Gao Peng...

47
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,079
from my life,

48
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,000
what's left...

49
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,170
of my seven years?

50
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,279
It's pretty near your office.

51
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,639
I'm leaving tomorrow.

52
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,560
Are you really that heartless?

53
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,079
I really have
a lot of work to do today.

54
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
How about this?

55
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:02,560
I'll try my best, okay?

56
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,920
Then me and Han Han
will wait for you here.

57
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,959
Forget it. Don't wait for me.

58
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,079
I'll probably
be working late tonight.

59
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,279
Zhi Nan.

60
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,199
I'll go back to Jiangzhou
in a few days.

61
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,360
I'll visit you then, okay?

62
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,879
That works too.

63
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Bye.

64
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,160
Okay.

65
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,879
Let's finalize the draft.

66
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,399
I'll send it to the group chat.

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,159
(Heng's project discussion group)

68
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,720
(Send)

69
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,160
Okay.

70
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,600
Do you want to get some air?

71
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,800
Sure.

72
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,160
To be honest, Mr. Gao,

73
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,160
I originally thought...

74
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,078
that you were just
showing your face here every day.

75
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,318
I didn't expect
that you could work...

76
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,360
until midnight every day.

77
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,759
I hope I can be of some use here.

78
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,839
You're extremely helpful.

79
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,560
For instance, when I was in
that dispute with the underwriters,

80
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,959
if you hadn't made
the decisive call,

81
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,519
we would still
be going back and forth.

82
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,920
Zhi Nan is going back
to Jiangzhou early in the morning.

83
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,040
Aren't you going to see her off?

84
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,120
He Zhi Nan and I...

85
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,560
are like two rodents...

86
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,199
huddled together for warmth.

87
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,800
Rodents?

88
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,438
Like squirrels...

89
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,439
or hamsters.

90
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,480
And He Zhi Nan has
that chinchilla at her place.

91
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,599
That's good.

92
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
It's cute.

93
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:32,920
Yes. It's clumsy and cute.

94
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,639
It never grows up.

95
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,399
We both really enjoyed...

96
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,439
this childish feelings...

97
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,279
and won't pressure
each other to grow.

98
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,720
When will Zhi Nan return
to Hong Kong?

99
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,879
I don't know.

100
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,160
She probably won't come back.

101
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,199
In this regard, we're quite aligned.

102
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,319
Neither of us
is brave enough to say breakup.

103
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,330
(Gao Peng, I'm leaving. Take care.)

104
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,240
Nan Nan!

105
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,600
The traffic was really bad today.

106
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,879
I rushed to see you,
fearing I wouldn't see you,

107
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,720
but thankfully, you haven't left.

108
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,120
I thought I'd never see you again.

109
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,039
What are you talking about?

110
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,000
Gao Peng.

111
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,840
Let's break up.

112
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,279
You...

113
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,519
See?

114
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,759
I said it first.

115
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,210
It shows that I'm more mature.

116
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,960
I'm sorry, Nan Nan.

117
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,279
Why are you apologizing?

118
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,279
Are you silly?

119
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm leaving.

120
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,320
Take care of yourself.

121
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,039
Nan Nan.

122
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,960
Bye.

123
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,559
I dumped the rich guy.

124
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,440
Aren't I good?

125
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,639
You're awesome.

126
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,119
You must be tired.

127
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,320
Go get some rest.

128
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
I'll get you some water.

129
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Okay.

130
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,559
Why are you reading sci-fi now?

131
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,600
He's a sci-fi fanatic.

132
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
He suits you pretty well.

133
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,960
"2001: A Space Odyssey"?

134
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,240
Are you reading this?

135
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,879
It's the best sci-fi ever.

136
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,559
Really?

137
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm only halfway through.

138
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,639
There's so much I don't understand.

139
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,240
You've come to the right person.

140
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,279
I'm a die-hard fan.

141
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,039
What a coincidence.

142
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,679
Mr. Zhou Bin just landed too.

143
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,000
Zhou Bin?

144
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,879
Yes. You know him too.

145
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,679
Have you forgotten?

146
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,440
We met for the first time
at his gathering.

147
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,440
How do you know Zhou Bin landed too?

148
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,039
He posted it on Moments.

149
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,839
Didn't you say he doesn't know you?

150
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,240
He didn't at first.

151
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,159
I was just a nobody at the company.

152
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,638
Last time, I was caught
playing on my phone...

153
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,879
during a meeting...

154
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,559
and I thought I'd get scolded.

155
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,960
Instead, it caught
his attention more.

156
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,159
We added each other on WeChat.

157
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,080
He even gave me a ride.

158
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,960
He came to the meeting in Hong Kong.

159
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,039
We must be on the same flight.

160
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,798
How strange.

161
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,039
Where is he?

162
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,678
I'm going to the restroom.

163
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,799
Help me with my luggage.

164
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,638
She went to the restroom.

165
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,639
She'll be back soon.

166
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,159
Han Han.

167
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,159
Well, Han Han,
I need to talk to you.

168
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,039
You purposely seek out Andy.

169
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,159
What do you want?

170
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,679
He's not right for you.

171
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,559
Listen. I still love you.

172
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,720
What you owe me,

173
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,279
you have to repay me with your love.

174
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,799
You're disgusting.

175
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,519
Do you think that
if Andy saw your true colours,

176
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,559
he'd still be with you?

177
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,200
It's none of your business.

178
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,799
You...

179
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Han Han.

180
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,159
Mr. Zhou Bin.

181
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
Andy. What a coincidence.

182
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,518
Let me introduce you.

183
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,600
This is my girlfriend.

184
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,239
We had a small quarrel earlier.

185
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,559
I hope it didn't amuse you too much.

186
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,919
I'm sorry.

187
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,480
I can't give you a ride.

188
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,599
I told you.

189
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,518
There's no man...

190
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,680
who wouldn't mind that.

191
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,720
- I'll give you a ride.
- There's no need.

192
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,359
Hello. Your pizza is here.

193
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,479
Enjoy your meal.

194
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Thank you.

195
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,599
Dear Ms. Sun Han Han,

196
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,839
please have a seat.

197
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,480
I've prepared dinner for you today.

198
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,799
It's all your favourites.

199
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,279
Look at this.

200
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,799
It's your favourite pizza.

201
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,720
This is what Ms. Sun Han Han
loves to eat when she's on a diet.

202
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,599
I don't like it.

203
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,319
Look at this.

204
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,799
French fries.

205
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,079
There are two big ones.

206
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:21,799
This one.

207
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,079
Eat this.

208
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,719
This has two servings of cheese...

209
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,758
and ham.

210
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,839
Here.

211
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,680
I added two servings of cheese.

212
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,359
Are you feeling a bit happier now?

213
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,079
Sun Han Han.

214
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,599
Han Han.

215
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
All right?

216
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,679
Come on.

217
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,758
You've been crying for so long.

218
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,839
That's enough.

219
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,650
Nan Nan.

220
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,920
Do you know what we have in common?

221
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,200
In what way?

222
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,200
When it comes to food,

223
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,680
we both like milk tea and pizza.

224
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,440
What we have in common...

225
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,519
is that when it comes to men,

226
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,170
we never let ourselves
be at a disadvantage.

227
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,649
Have you watched
"Gone with the Wind"?

228
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,720
Of course.

229
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,200
Scarlett O'Hara once said,

230
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,839
"Tomorrow is another day."

231
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,410
Tomorrow is a new day.

232
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,410
Tomorrow, I'll look for a new job...

233
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:30,650
and a new house...

234
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,650
and start my new life.

235
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,799
Cheers to tomorrow.

236
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,240
To tomorrow.

237
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,599
What's under my armpit?

238
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,200
It tickles.

239
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,119
Here's a beating heart
for Ms. Sun Han Han.

240
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,440
It's mine.

241
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,599
Sun Han Han.

242
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,160
(REDT)

243
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,319
Next, Wang Hong.

244
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,720
Han Han.

245
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,079
- Hey.
- How are you?

246
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,920
Han Han,
did you offend some big shot?

247
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,319
What's wrong?

248
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,519
When I submitted
your resume to the HR,

249
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,640
she was very satisfied
with your work and your resume.

250
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,720
However, I don't know why
her attitude suddenly changed.

251
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,720
It's really strange.

252
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,200
Maybe I'm experiencing
some bad luck lately.

253
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,759
Hey.

254
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,960
Are you still sleeping?

255
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,200
Yes.

256
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,440
How long have you been doing this?

257
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,519
I'm a three-no person.

258
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,920
Besides sleeping,
what else can I do?

259
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,720
What's a three-no person?

260
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,279
No prospects,

261
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,079
no job,

262
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,240
and no relationship.

263
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,079
That's me and Sun Han Han.

264
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,599
We're either
slacking off together...

265
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,400
or slacking off apart.

266
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,440
How did that article
for my friend's public account go?

267
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,920
My friend mentioned
that your topics were really good.

268
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,519
What happened?

269
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,119
A breakup is a trivial matter.

270
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
It's no big deal.

271
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,719
Take some time to think
about your earlier manifesto...

272
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,839
about independent women.

273
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,359
I just...

274
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,680
mentioned it casually.

275
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,278
You don't have
to take it so seriously.

276
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,759
Who could really write
something like that...

277
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,319
in such a short time?

278
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,959
Writing itself is hard.

279
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,078
You need to push yourself a little.

280
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,160
Come on.

281
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,240
I'm in a state
of laziness right now.

282
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
State of laziness.

283
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,000
Do you understand?

284
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,640
It doesn't work on me.

285
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,640
Don't give me any motivational talk.

286
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,599
My mom is calling.

287
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,919
I have to go.

288
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,000
Hello?

289
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:47,200
Hey, you're here.

290
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,279
Hurry up.

291
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,720
I've been waiting for you.

292
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:51,839
I'm sorry.

293
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,119
It has been a while.
You're getting prettier.

294
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,640
- Thank you.
- Let's go inside and take a look.

295
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,079
Come in and take a look.

296
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,200
The previous tenant...

297
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,880
gave me a headache.

298
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,200
Look at what he did to my house.

299
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,599
Even if it means losing the rent,

300
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,200
I have to get my house back.

301
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,359
What a coincidence.

302
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,400
I think we're fated to meet...

303
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,319
and you ended up back here.

304
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,680
I feel so relieved
to rent this house to you.

305
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,079
It really is a full circle.

306
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,599
Going from the city centre
to the suburban areas...

307
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,000
and now I'm back to square one.

308
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,119
Hello.

309
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,400
Two tofu skins and two noodles.

310
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,519
Eat here for takeaway?

311
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,640
Eat here.

312
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,759
Thank you.

313
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,680
It smells so good.

314
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,519
Has Gao Peng not been
in touch with you at all?

315
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,319
We did contact each other.

316
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,920
I let him know I arrived safely
when I got off the plane...

317
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
and he replied.

318
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:45,920
I haven't heard from him since.

319
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,039
However, last night,
I was unable to sleep,

320
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,879
so I looked through
my photos with Gao Peng...

321
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,960
and ended up crying.

322
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,440
I couldn't help but call him.

323
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,880
You still couldn't hold back?

324
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,200
Luckily, he didn't pick up.

325
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,359
Otherwise,

326
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,759
that would have been
so embarrassing.

327
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,358
(Gao Peng)

328
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,519
I'll answer it.

329
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,399
Hello, Gao Peng.

330
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,439
Hello?

331
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,479
You called me yesterday.

332
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,640
I didn't see it. What's up?

333
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:27,759
Nothing.

334
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,920
I left my silver bracelet...

335
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,400
in your nightstand drawer.

336
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,160
Okay. I'll find it for you.

337
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,279
Wait for me.

338
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,240
I found the bracelet.

339
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,519
Should I send it to you?

340
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,240
No.

341
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,920
I don't wear it often.

342
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,480
I'll bring it to you
when I go back to Jiangzhou.

343
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,319
How are you doing?

344
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,079
Good.

345
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,559
Everything is going well.

346
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,279
My parents are so happy
that I'm back.

347
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,880
That's good.

348
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,680
Why?

349
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,720
Do you want to hear...

350
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,720
that I can't live without you?

351
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,400
I don't.

352
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,920
Nan Nan, I really...

353
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,758
want you to be well.

354
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,039
I'm doing well.

355
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,160
Really.

356
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,400
That's good then.

357
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,640
What about you?

358
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,799
How are you?

359
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,039
I'm fine.

360
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,640
That's good.

361
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,920
We'll both be fine.

362
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,519
That's for sure.

363
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,079
We're still good friends, right?

364
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:56,960
Of course.

365
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,719
I have something to do.
I have to go now.

366
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,798
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

367
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,319
Okay. Bye.

368
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,758
You could play this kind of game...

369
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:19,798
a thousand times...

370
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:20,799
and never get bored.

371
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,440
If I don't remind him,

372
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,559
he won't even notice.

373
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,920
Gao Peng has grown up,

374
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,839
but I haven't.

375
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,480
It's not fair.

376
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,559
You have to grow up.

377
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,479
You can't stay 18 forever.

378
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
So what?

379
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,798
So what if I've grown up?

380
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,559
So what if I've become
a better person?

381
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,599
No one will love me.

382
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,079
Nan Nan.

383
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,559
Passengers,

384
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,160
you are on Flight 1835.

385
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,119
You are now arriving
at your destination, Kangding.

386
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,519
Please straighten your seat back
and fold away your tray table.

387
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,200
The weather in Kangding
is clear right now...

388
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,799
with a ground temperature
of 15 degrees Celsius.

389
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,319
The temperature difference between
day and night is considerable,

390
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,279
so please stay warm.

391
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,359
Have a nice trip.

392
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,160
That year in Kangding,

393
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,720
I buried a small flower
to symbolize my love with Gao Peng.

394
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,279
Legend has it...

395
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,480
that the flower
representing true love...

396
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,599
never wilts once buried.

397
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,000
Now, as we part ways,

398
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,159
I can see that...

399
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,519
the flower has long withered.

400
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,039
If the love we shared...

401
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,920
started to grow from this place,

402
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,559
then today,

403
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,679
I want to say my final goodbye...

404
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,119
to it here.

405
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,119
Goodbye, Gao Peng.

406
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,159
Goodbye,

407
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:39,809
our clumsy...

408
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,960
but sincere seven years.

409
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,119
Mr. Gao.

410
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:25,000
What are you doing here?

411
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,199
Midnight snack.

412
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:31,360
By the way,

413
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,599
I want to talk to you
about the share incentive tomorrow.

414
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:34,679
If I hear the word "share" again,

415
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:35,769
I'm going to throw up.

416
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,079
Why don't we...

417
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,519
have something first?

418
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:47,360
Thank you.

419
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,000
Osmanthus cake.

420
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,360
I didn't know there was
Suzhou cuisine in Hong Kong.

421
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,960
Just to find this place,
I really dug deep.

422
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,400
Try and see if it's authentic.

423
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,960
It's quite authentic.

424
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,769
What's the name of this place?

425
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,329
I can go there next time.

426
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,559
I'll take you there next time.

427
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,480
This is good too.

428
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,920
Have some.

429
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,639
Well, I suddenly thought of a joke.

430
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,239
Let me tell you.

431
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,199
Ant A asked Ant B,

432
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,840
"We're working ourselves
to the bone every day,"

433
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,440
"so why aren't we
getting anything out of it?"

434
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:06,598
Ant B said,

435
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,638
"Cut the crap and get to work."

436
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,719
"We're the underdog."

437
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:50,119
I remember the first time we met
was the day I got this car.

438
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,559
Yes.

439
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:56,360
You drove this car
around Causeway Bay that day.

440
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,199
It was so cool.

441
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,199
"In The Mood for Love"
is quite interesting.

442
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,079
The old movie you recommended to me.

443
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:22,880
I watched it at home.

444
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,198
Tony Leung
and Maggie Cheung's story...

445
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,400
was pretty sad.

446
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,960
By the way,

447
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,599
I broke up with He Zhi Nan,

448
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,039
but it's not because of Emily.

449
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,719
There's really nothing between us.

450
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,000
You should tell this to He Zhi Nan.

451
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,920
- Good night.
- Good night.

452
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,719
Mr. Gao.

453
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,960
I think He Zhi Nan...

454
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,639
is really stupid...

455
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:07,119
to miss out on someone like you.
