1
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 11)

3
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,530
Even a first-year lawyer...

4
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,529
can have the chance...

5
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,878
to lead a project...

6
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,039
if they successfully land a client.

7
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,159
Keep it up.

8
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,240
I believe you'll win
the Best Lawyer award this year.

9
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,370
Gao Peng.

10
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,439
I happen to have a friend
who's perfect for you.

11
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,318
He's my classmate
from when I studied in the UK.

12
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,370
He's from Jiangzhou.

13
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,599
Being professional is secondary.

14
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Most importantly,

15
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,370
you have to be friends
with Gao Peng...

16
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,559
and make him...

17
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,680
interested in you.

18
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,530
I've heard
the name He Zhi Nan before.

19
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,120
I know...

20
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,159
the man in the photo.

21
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,080
They say art comes from life.

22
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,560
I really believe it now.

23
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,919
How could there be...

24
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
such a coincidence...

25
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,120
and such a dramatic situation
in this world?

26
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
What do you mean?

27
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,360
He Zhi Nan lives
in Baiyujia Residence, right?

28
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,560
What's happening
between us right now...

29
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,038
is just like what Tony Leung
and Maggie Cheung...

30
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,159
portrayed in "In the Mood for Love".

31
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,000
- Can I borrow your phone?
- My phone?

32
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,319
Show me the Weibo account just now.

33
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
This one?

34
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,879
This person is my ex-boyfriend.

35
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,360
When I found out
about her existence,

36
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,400
we hadn't completely broken up.

37
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,960
We're in the same boat then.

38
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,960
Tell me about your ex-boyfriend.

39
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,480
He's quite good.

40
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,920
He graduated
from a prestigious school.

41
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,639
He's gentle and considerate...

42
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,439
and he knows how to sweet-talk.

43
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,759
Tell me about her too.

44
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,399
We have been on the verge
of breaking up lately.

45
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,240
However, I didn't take it seriously.

46
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,199
Why would she leave me?

47
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,169
I thought it was just like before.

48
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,759
She was just making
a scene for attention.

49
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,560
It sounds like...

50
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,759
you're more sad than angry.

51
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,560
She looks so happy...

52
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,170
in those photos.

53
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,560
I haven't seen her
that happy in a long time.

54
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't think
I have any grounds to be angry.

55
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,560
We've been together
since before college.

56
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,720
She's the kindest...

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and most ethical girl...

58
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,800
I've ever met.

59
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
Without me by her side,

60
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,560
she might be tempted.

61
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,319
No wonder she was so determined
to break up with me.

62
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,680
She still cares about me.

63
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,000
Perhaps she's...

64
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,040
struggling internally as well.

65
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,800
I can feel it.

66
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
You love her very much.

67
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,879
She just doesn't cherish
what she has.

68
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
It's already 12:30am.

69
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,160
You have to work tomorrow, right?

70
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,720
It's okay.
I'm used to staying up late.

71
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,959
Lately,

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,360
several of my projects...

73
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,800
are actually
in the negotiation stage.

74
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,278
A few companies
are looking to go public...

75
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,318
and are searching for lawyers,

76
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,600
so things have been pretty good.

77
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,680
I almost forgot about our business.

78
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,438
My company
is also going public soon.

79
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,959
Are you interested?

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Of course.

81
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,959
When are you free, Mr. Gao?

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,879
I'll invite my colleague
to join the discussion.

83
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,399
How about tomorrow?

84
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,639
Tomorrow afternoon.

85
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,040
We'll have a nice long sleep.

86
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,439
We can meet directly
at the company in the afternoon.

87
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,240
Okay. I'll call you tomorrow.

88
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,519
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

89
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,040
- Bye.
- Bye.

90
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Mr. Gao.

91
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,839
I think He Zhi Nan...

92
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,480
is really stupid...

93
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,680
to miss out on someone like you.

94
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Bye.

95
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,639
You're out getting drunk
in the middle of the day?

96
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,158
What's going on?

97
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,960
Wait. What exactly is going on?

98
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,639
I got dumped.

99
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,360
He disappeared.

100
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,000
What do you mean he disappeared?

101
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,039
I texted him on WeChat
and he said he was busy.

102
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,638
When I called him,
either the line was busy...

103
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,720
or he didn't answer.

104
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,399
I even went to his office
but couldn't find him.

105
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,480
I couldn't reach him at all.

106
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
This is what they call...

107
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,039
a sudden breakup.

108
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,600
She's not in a good mood today.

109
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,360
Don't drink too much.

110
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,000
These days,

111
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,799
I feel like...

112
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,840
I'm not dating Qu Yi Peng.

113
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,399
Instead, I'm dating...

114
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,879
I'm dating that part of myself
that loves Qu Yi Peng.

115
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,799
Okay.

116
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Do I love him?

117
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,519
Or do I love the idea
of myself loving him?

118
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,799
Do I love him?

119
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,000
Or do I love the idea
of myself loving him?

120
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,399
Is he eavesdropping
on our conversation?

121
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,440
It's in the lyrics.

122
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,639
Find a way to love myself

123
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,960
Find a way to love myself

124
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,279
Find a way to love myself

125
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,519
Forget who I am

126
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,840
Find a way to love myself

127
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,960
- Find a way to love myself!
- Find a way to love myself!

128
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,200
- Find a way to love myself!
- Find a way to love myself!

129
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,359
It's nice!

130
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,960
Find a way to love myself

131
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
- Find a way to love myself
- Find a way to love myself

132
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,518
He's a genuine rising star.

133
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,558
He attends various music events...

134
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,559
and his online popularity
is outstanding.

135
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,039
Find a way to love myself

136
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,360
Find a way to love myself

137
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,600
Find a way to love myself

138
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,918
(Qu)

139
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,000
(Block the contact)

140
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Jerk.

141
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Thank you.

142
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,799
Thank you.

143
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,279
I'll be here for two nights.

144
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Thank you.

145
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
What do you think?

146
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
It's not bad.

147
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,918
I overheard you talking just now...

148
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,919
and thought you
expressed yourself really well,

149
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,879
so I wanted
to include it in the lyrics.

150
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Also,

151
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,000
I think you're really talented.

152
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,759
Your thoughts are unique.

153
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,080
Your singing is unique too.

154
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,679
Your contact info.

155
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Add me.

156
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,440
(Add to contacts)

157
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,559
(Sending..)

158
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,720
Come on. Let's do it again.

159
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,240
Let's start all over again.

160
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Come on.

161
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,039
He Zhi Nan.

162
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,120
(Every detail...)

163
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,559
He Zhi Nan.

164
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,480
Someone at the front desk
is looking for you.

165
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,519
Coming.

166
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,599
(...and then exclaim in wonder.)

167
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,039
(Post)

168
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,039
Hello.

169
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,799
You...

170
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,759
I read all the articles
on your public account.

171
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,039
They're not really articles.

172
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,159
They're just...

173
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,279
some mood-sharing snippets...

174
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,559
I casually wrote.

175
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,799
Anyway, there's
one thing I'm sure of.

176
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,360
You're amazing...

177
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
and you're even better
than I imagined.

178
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,879
How about we go
to the café downstairs?

179
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,278
I'll buy you coffee.

180
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,279
It's okay.

181
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,919
I have to go
to the recording studio later.

182
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
Anyway,
I have said what I want to say.

183
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,240
Did you come over
just to tell me this?

184
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,360
Yes. Just to tell you that.

185
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,200
This kind of thing
should be said face-to-face.

186
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,639
It doesn't have the same feel...

187
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,159
if said over the phone.

188
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,839
It has been a while...

189
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
since I've come across
someone so gifted,

190
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,480
so getting to know you
makes me very excited.

191
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,799
By the way,

192
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
speaking of which,

193
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,799
this is the demo
of all my new songs.

194
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,639
Listen to it when you have time...

195
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,799
and give me some feedback.

196
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,840
But I don't know much about music.

197
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
You don't have to.

198
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,080
Just trust your first instinct
and that's all you need.

199
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,879
I'm leaving. Bye.

200
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,360
Bye.

201
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,080
Let's go eat.

202
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,720
Nan Nan, I'm going to eat too.

203
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Okay.

204
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,759
(My music)

205
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,480
Mr. Zhang values my opinion.

206
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,759
He insisted that I go
to the recording studio with him...

207
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
to write and revise the lyrics.

208
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,679
He said my writing style
is quite impressive...

209
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,840
and that we should work together
if there's a chance.

210
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,639
I know...

211
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,320
you're probably
looking for someone...

212
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,960
to occupy your time,

213
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,679
but you and Mr. Zhang have only
just gotten to know each other.

214
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,879
Why not get
to know him better first?

215
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,679
There's nothing between us.

216
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,039
He simply values my talent.

217
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Slowly.

218
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,039
I never thought...

219
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,080
the ovulation injections
would be so painful.

220
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,720
This half of my body
is as hard as a rock.

221
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,279
Maybe we should just forget it.

222
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,799
Don't put yourself
through this torture.

223
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,720
I've already suffered enough.

224
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,559
It's a loss to give up now.

225
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Hurry up...

226
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:42,919
and rest on the bed for a bit.

227
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,919
Be careful.

228
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,279
Be careful. Slowly.

229
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,650
I'll cook something for you.

230
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,759
Lie down and get some rest.

231
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,409
This latest product
is newly launched.

232
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,118
People nowadays use technology...

233
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,279
Her gaze drifted

234
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,839
But she always had clear insight
at crucial moments

235
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,170
Why are you suddenly listening
to this kind of song?

236
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,890
Lately, a few of the young folks
at the company...

237
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,119
have been making fun of me
for listening to classical music.

238
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,200
I think I should catch up a bit.

239
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
I'll get going then.

240
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,480
Han Han, listen to this.

241
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,839
Have you heard of
"The One and Only"?

242
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,890
This song is really good.

243
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,319
(Following)

244
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,279
(Accusefive)

245
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,999
What's wrong?

246
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,079
Why are you up?

247
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,480
I came to check on you.

248
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,599
Why did you lock the door?

249
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,079
I didn't.

250
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,279
The lock must have
fallen off on its own.

251
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,839
Are you on the phone?

252
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,890
I'm scheduling some work.

253
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,200
The cake is ready.
I'll go take a look.

254
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,170
Do you know about the music app
that allows you to share playlists?

255
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,119
Zhou Bin has always
listened to classical music.

256
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,200
But recently, his music taste
has changed strangely.

257
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,200
What's even stranger...

258
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,680
is that he has been listening
to a girl's playlist.

259
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,000
Do you know that girl?

260
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,599
She works at
one of my subsidiary companies,

261
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,519
and we've had
some minor interactions.

262
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,200
But you can't suspect her
just because of a playlist.

263
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Lately,

264
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,720
Zhou Bin has been deliberately
keeping his phone face down...

265
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,920
and today, I noticed...

266
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,919
- he was speaking in the study...
- I didn't.

267
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,960
with his voice
intentionally lowered.

268
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,480
He hung up after a few words.

269
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,759
The cake is ready.
I'll go take a look.

270
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,039
I took a peek at his phone...

271
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,279
and discovered
there were no call logs.

272
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
Why would he delete
all his call logs...

273
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,559
if everything was fine?

274
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,559
This is really suspicious.

275
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,079
I found that girl's WeChat
in Zhou Bin's contacts.

276
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,318
I used Zhou Bin's account
to send her a flirty message.

277
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,319
(Message)

278
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,599
And?

279
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,359
And that...

280
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
confirmed all my doubts.

281
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Zhou Bin...

282
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
is indeed having an affair.

283
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,880
Seriously?

284
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,559
It's like we're in
some undercover spy meeting.

285
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,880
She has been
causing a scene all night.

286
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,160
I can't afford more drama.

287
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,278
She used your phone
to pretend to be you...

288
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,358
and she still thinks
she's justified?

289
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,359
She's clearly not.

290
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,000
Then why did you block me
for no reason?

291
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,879
I had previously promised her...

292
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,759
that I'd tell her immediately
if I got into a new relationship.

293
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,200
However, her health and emotions
have been in bad shape,

294
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,440
so telling her would only upset her.

295
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,959
You're already divorced.

296
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,200
Do you need her permission
to be in a new relationship?

297
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,279
What's going on...

298
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,920
between you two?

299
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,479
Are you hiding something from me?

300
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,559
You've seen my divorce certificate,

301
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,079
haven't you?

302
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,799
I've shared everything
about us with you, haven't I?

303
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,199
What else could I hide from you?

304
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,960
But the way you two interact
is far from normal.

305
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What's normal then?

306
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,599
What do you think is normal?

307
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,279
Every couple in the world
has their own unique relationship.

308
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,799
Everyone is different...

309
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,279
and so is every relationship.

310
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
You told me before...

311
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,559
that you'd stand by me
and we'd be in this together.

312
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,599
Have you forgotten that?

313
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,079
You have to understand.

314
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,359
My willingness to be understanding
has its limits.

315
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,920
Zeng Cheng
is the woman I once loved.

316
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,880
Everything I do now...

317
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,319
is to safeguard our love...

318
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,839
and avoid hurting her.

319
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,920
I don't want to hurt anyone.

320
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,119
In this world,

321
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,920
many women enjoy
watching men hurt their own kind,

322
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,359
as if the pain...

323
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,279
somehow proves the depth of love.

324
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,920
But I believe you're not
that type of person, Han Han.

325
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,920
What if she wants to hurt me?

326
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,880
Or maybe she wants you to hurt me.

327
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,279
If she hurts you,

328
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,680
then the last bit of affection...

329
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
between her and me...

330
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
will cease to exist.

331
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Add me back on WeChat.

332
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
What's that?

333
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,079
A gift card from the mall.

334
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,559
It's a gift from a client.

335
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,519
You can buy whatever you like.

336
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,200
Enjoy watching men hurt
their own kind?

337
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,200
How could he use that label on me?

338
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,599
Am I that kind of person?

339
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,079
If you want to prove you're not,
then you'd better stay silent.

340
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,000
Why does
every critique of Zhou Bin...

341
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,200
always end up
with me criticizing myself?

342
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
You're right.

343
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,960
Dating that old lawyer
really trains your eloquence.

344
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,799
All right. Let's go.

345
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,079
Sir, I paid you.

346
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,599
Let me ask you.

347
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:15,079
Recently, you and Zeng Cheng
have been working on a project.

348
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:16,759
Does Zhou Bin know?

349
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
He doesn't.

350
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,519
Didn't you tell him?

351
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,200
He never cared about my work anyway.

352
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,759
Looks like Zeng Cheng
didn't tell him either.

353
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
Don't you think this kind
of relationship is strange?

354
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,480
At work,

355
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,160
she can easily
wipe me out in no time.

356
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
The world
where you find your footing...

357
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,640
just so happens
to have her as a big boss.

358
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,039
What bad luck.

359
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,880
Actually, it's good
to come to terms with it.

360
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,480
I should just do my job properly...

361
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,319
and if I want
to be in a relationship,

362
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,399
I'll just do it openly.

363
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,519
There's nothing strange about that.

364
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
Look.

365
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,640
Who gave it to you?

366
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,799
Zhou Bin.

367
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,599
I thought you didn't want
to accept his money.

368
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,599
I didn't want
to spend his money before...

369
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,160
because I was worried he'd think
I loved money more than him.

370
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,439
But now, the situation is different.

371
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,559
How is it different?

372
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,000
Since we're together now,

373
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,799
I find it quite pretentious...

374
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,279
to refuse gifts from my boyfriend...

375
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:18,200
just to emphasize...

376
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,160
my independence as a woman.

377
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,399
Besides,

378
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,440
he gave me this
out of a bit of guilt.

379
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,640
If I don't accept it,
it would suggest I'm angry.

380
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Aren't you angry?

381
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,119
If I get angry now,

382
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:31,160
it'd make me seem small-minded.

383
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
How magnanimous.

384
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,559
Are you mocking me?

385
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,359
Ms. Xin.

386
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,599
Do you want me
to revise the presentation?

387
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,799
Okay.
I'll revise it when I get home.

388
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,640
Bye.

389
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,799
You're really magnanimous.

390
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,519
Are you mocking me?

391
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,558
- I wouldn't dare.
- Very well.

392
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,920
Say that again.

393
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,199
You're all high and mighty.

394
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,119
- Don't run.
- I'm sorry.

395
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,399
- Say that again.
- I'm sorry.

396
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
He Zhi Nan.

397
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,400
Over there
is a photography studio...

398
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,640
where many celebrities
come to take photos.

399
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,240
Next to it
is a new media artist's studio.

400
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,839
That means this is a prime location.

401
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
You will also achieve fame.

402
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,000
The greatest misfortune in life...

403
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,319
is being famous
alongside a bunch of fools.

404
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,999
When you're not popular,
you long for fame,

405
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,400
hoping for gigs and performances.

406
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,880
What's the point of being famous...

407
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,640
if you're surrounded by people...

408
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
who don't get it?

409
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
It's here.

410
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,279
What do you think?

411
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,880
- Hello.
- Gao Peng.

412
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,719
I'm Alex's cousin, Emily.

413
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,960
Hello.

414
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,039
Have a seat.

415
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,240
My cousin went out to make a call.

416
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,440
He said he'd be right back.

417
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,440
Your cousin used to talk
about you all the time.

418
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,799
He didn't say
anything bad about me, did he?

419
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yes, he did.

420
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,960
He said you were a tennis pro,

421
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,160
the champion at your university.

422
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,079
What?

423
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,440
I'm the champion...

424
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,640
of the intercollegiate league...

425
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,078
for all universities
in Ontario, Canada,

426
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,079
okay?

427
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,318
I'm sorry.

428
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,358
The champion.

429
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,400
Here's to you.

430
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
You're here.

431
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,240
What took you so long?

432
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,759
Han Su said she'd be late.

433
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,118
By the way,

434
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,199
- I'll introduce you.
- There's no need.

435
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,319
We already know each other.

436
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,318
I'll drink as a punishment then.

437
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,319
As a punishment.

438
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Pour it yourself.

439
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,039
Have you ever
participated in cheerleading?

440
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,559
Our team won
the school league championship...

441
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,039
and I was the captain.

442
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,039
Your cousin seems
quite interested in Gao Peng.

443
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,680
My cousin has been outgoing
since she was young.

444
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,599
A lot of boys like her
and spoiled her,

445
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,640
so she's always all over the place.

446
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,119
She has never
settled down for anyone.

447
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,319
She won't take things seriously.

448
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,400
I honestly wanted
to introduce Gao Peng to you.

449
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,119
Didn't you already do that?

450
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,079
Don't overthink it.

451
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,720
To me,

452
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,400
finding clients is more important
than finding a boyfriend.

453
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,920
Cheers.

454
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:51,640
I can only choke up silently

455
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,799
You've forgotten me so many times

456
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,920
The rainstorm in the city
lasted for several nights

457
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,799
It washed away everything

458
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,079
When can we start recording?

459
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,599
We have to wait
for the sound engineer.

460
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,759
Actually, I haven't been
very happy lately.

461
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,519
I'm a little lost.

462
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:41,160
I've been sticking to the niche
for a long time...

463
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,720
and I'm not young anymore.

464
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,680
The temptation
to leave the industry is huge.

465
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,759
I can make a lot of money,

466
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,680
have so many fans,

467
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,960
and even have young girls
throwing themselves at me.

468
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,680
Well, isn't that great?

469
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
What's so great about it?

470
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,480
Tell me what's so great about it.

471
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,599
They're all brainless.

472
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,720
When an idol is popular,
they all go crazy for the idol.

473
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
When rap is trending,

474
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
suddenly everyone is an expert,

475
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
claiming to be hardcore Tupac fans.

476
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,880
They follow whatever is popular.

477
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,960
That's why I feel like
I'm losing myself.

478
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,039
I've become their trophy and prey.

479
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,039
They're shallow
and I'm shallow just like them.

480
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,079
That's why I need someone like you.

481
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,880
Someone who really understands me.

482
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,559
If you're not recording today,

483
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:51,919
I'm going home.

484
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,319
Wait. What are you doing?

485
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Well...

486
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,719
Well, the atmosphere
is so nice here.

487
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,599
- I thought...
- You might have misunderstood.

488
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Misunderstood?

489
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,279
Why are you here then?

490
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
I...

491
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,960
I'm here...

492
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,440
because you asked me
to help revise the lyrics.

493
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,119
Okay. Fine.

494
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,239
Maybe I was too impatient.

495
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
I'm sorry.

496
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:17,319
Since you're here, have a seat.

497
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,720
- Don't be nervous.
- Don't touch me.

498
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,240
- Don't touch me!
- Have a seat.

499
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Don't touch me!

500
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,319
I'll call the police
if you come any closer.

501
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,118
I didn't force you to do anything.

502
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,440
Why do you want to call the police?

503
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Because of you,

504
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:31,039
I cancelled
all my other appointments.

505
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,919
No.

506
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,959
You came all the way here.

507
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,000
You even accepted my gift.

508
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,319
If you're not here for that,

509
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,720
are you just messing with me?

510
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,400
Just because I came all this way
and accepted your gift...

511
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,399
doesn't mean
I want anything to happen.

512
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
No.

513
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,519
You do enjoy a bit of fun,
don't you?

514
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,960
We're all adults here, right?

515
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,720
Are you really not getting it
or just pretending?

516
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,440
Even if I love to have fun,

517
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,079
it doesn't mean
I want something to happen with you.

518
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,680
Do you think I'm a pervert...

519
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,480
who can't control myself?

520
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:04,079
I promise I won't touch you tonight.

521
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,358
But come on. Think about it.

522
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:07,518
Put yourself in my shoes.

523
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,639
You came all the way here,

524
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,839
took my gift, had a few drinks,

525
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
and I even poured my heart out.

526
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,119
What's this all for?
To sit here and talk about writing?

527
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:16,329
Come on. Do you really think
you have no feminine charm at all?

528
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:17,840
Besides,

529
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,289
out of politeness,

530
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,960
I didn't want you to feel inferior.

531
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,439
It'd be rude
if I didn't make a move on you.

532
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,480
Well, thank you for your politeness.

533
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,920
I wasn't exactly trying
to show any feminine charm.

534
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:30,079
Why? Can't you tell
I'm not interested in you at all?

535
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,880
Are you that clueless
or just pretending?

536
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,199
Either way, I can't tell. Leave.

537
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:41,809
Go.

538
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,039
Go!

539
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,039
Are you crazy?

540
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,840
Why are you being so pretentious?

541
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:06,480
(Seventh anniversary,
Three days later)

542
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,769
In three months and five days,

543
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,000
it will be our seventh anniversary.

544
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,559
We agreed last year...

545
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,000
that we'd celebrate it
in Hong Kong this year.

546
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,559
Don't forget.

547
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,079
So did you guys break up or not?

548
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,639
I intended to use this trip
to Hong Kong...

549
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:53,719
to sort things out
and break up with him.

550
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,159
Do you still love him?

551
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,719
I guess so.

552
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,159
Do you think it's possible
for me to go to Hong Kong and...

553
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,199
Do you even have the right?

554
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,289
I already broke up with Qu Yi Peng.

555
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,519
Then you're lying to him.

556
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:18,599
How could you do this to Gao Peng?

557
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,599
If I don't lie to him,

558
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,719
he won't forgive me.

559
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,079
If you love him,

560
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,959
you can't lie to him.

561
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,000
If I don't lie to him,
I'll lose him.

562
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,599
I can't tell him the truth.

563
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,239
I won't tell him anything...

564
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,329
during this trip to Hong Kong.

565
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:46,328
Liar.

566
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:47,329
Jerk.

567
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Why are you here?

568
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,119
I've been looking for you.

569
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,000
It's too noisy in there.

570
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,599
I came out to take a call from work.

571
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,239
What's wrong?

572
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,519
He Zhi Nan is coming
to Hong Kong next week.

573
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,199
I had everything planned...

574
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
and the tickets booked,

575
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
but I completely forgot.

576
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,880
I don't know how to face her now.

577
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,360
Do you still have feelings for her?

578
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:51,289
To be honest,

579
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,239
when I went back
to Jiangzhou last time,

580
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,119
she sincerely helped me.

581
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:57,559
Hypothetically speaking,

582
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,199
she might be facing...

583
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,239
some difficulties.

584
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,000
If she's honest with you,

585
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:09,809
will you forgive her?

586
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,769
If she lies to you,

587
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:47,719
will you give up completely?

588
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:51,840
Just pretend it didn't happen...

589
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,719
and wait until she arrives.

590
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,039
(Have you received
the flight booking confirmation?)

591
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:35,769
It shouldn't be a problem.

592
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,079
- Go print it out.
- Okay.

593
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,159
I'll do it now.

594
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
Han Han.

595
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:45,119
Ms. Zeng is looking for you.

596
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
What's wrong with you?

597
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:50,329
Things have been going badly lately.

598
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,519
I even get choked drinking water.

599
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:53,679
Where is she?

600
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:55,119
I've sent you the time and address.

601
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,769
She said you can go alone.

602
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
Ms. Xin.

603
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Has Ms. Zeng said...

604
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:04,960
anything unpleasant about me lately?

605
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,679
No.

606
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:08,440
She was praising you
to the client just now.

607
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:09,519
She said you're smart.

608
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:11,079
You know what to do
and how to behave.

609
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,519
Right.

610
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,769
(Standard logarithmic vision chart)

611
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:25,809
Left.

612
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,480
Red.

613
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,960
Green.

614
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,440
Come on.

615
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,328
Choose the most handsome one.

616
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:50,399
(Love-struck Brain)

617
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,360
My boyfriend...

618
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,199
is the most handsome.

619
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Come on.

620
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,920
Doctor.

621
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,159
Let's stop the test.

622
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:08,719
We've been testing all morning...

623
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,360
and she only has eyes for that toad.

624
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,599
She must be blind.

625
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,920
No.

626
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,119
There's nothing wrong with her eyes.

627
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
She is...

628
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
Here.

629
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,119
Could she be...

630
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,639
Yes.

631
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:27,329
A love-struck brain.

632
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,159
It's confirmed.

633
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,880
Prepare for it with your family.

634
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,480
I don't want it.

635
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,559
I don't want it.

636
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,769
I don't want a love-struck brain.

637
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:39,809
I don't want it.

638
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:47,809
Doctor.

639
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,289
Is there really no cure for it?

640
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,199
It's a terminal illness.

641
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:53,769
A terminal illness.
