1
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,400
(In Between)

2
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,319
There are many girls in our company...

3
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,560
who carry the most expensive bags...

4
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,400
and drink the best afternoon tea,

5
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,439
yet they have the most leisurely job.

6
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,439
(Manager)

7
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,360
Print out the email I sent you.

8
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,536
And have you booked the hotel and flight for my business trip?

9
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
I have a meeting at noon.

10
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,800
Make a reservation for that as well.

11
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,079
Yes, ma'am.

12
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,639
(Admin secretary)

13
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,680
Don't overestimate all managers...

14
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,000
and don't underestimate all secretaries either.

15
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,879
(The secret of CBD)

16
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,879
(Episode 5)

17
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,730
You're back.

18
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,839
Did you cook?

19
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,399
You made them?

20
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,639
Of course.

21
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,839
What occasion is it?

22
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,680
Go wash your hands.

23
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,920
Try my cooking.

24
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,050
- Don't tell me if it's not good. - Okay.

25
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
I have to try it today.

26
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,079
It's your first time making so much food.

27
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,240
Let's eat.

28
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,720
Let me try it.

29
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
It's still hot.

30
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,679
I'll try the braised pork first.

31
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,959
- Is it good? - Yes.

32
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,680
It's well-seasoned.

33
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,879
The broccoli is good too.

34
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,199
It's seasoned just right.

35
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,160
Why do I think it's still a bit salty?

36
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,000
Cooking...

37
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,839
depends on your interest.

38
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,295
If you don't like to cook, you don't have to force yourself.

39
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,639
I'll do it from now on.

40
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,439
What should I do?

41
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,638
Let him be the one to say it.

42
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,078
Going to Hong Kong and breaking up are two different things.

43
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,399
If he really loves you,

44
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,480
he'll make his intention clear to you.

45
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,080
The only thing that can defeat love...

46
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,399
is not enough love.

47
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,480
I have to go to Hong Kong.

48
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,319
For how long?

49
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,759
At least six months.

50
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,680
Maybe a year.

51
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,560
Or maybe even longer.

52
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,560
(Amy: Have you sent the application for going to Hong Kong?)

53
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,800
Did the firm transfer you?

54
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,319
Initially,

55
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,160
it was supposed to be Ms. Shan who speaks Cantonese.

56
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,759
But due to personal reasons, she couldn't go, so...

57
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,519
They transferred me at the last minute.

58
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,959
That's good news.

59
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,680
What's the pay like?

60
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,160
Double.

61
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,360
Double?

62
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,120
That's higher than mine.

63
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
That's great.

64
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,079
Do you support me going?

65
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,879
Of course.

66
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,560
It's double the pay...

67
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,800
and a better opportunity.

68
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,079
Why wouldn't I?

69
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,800
I do support you.

70
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,279
If I go to Hong Kong,

71
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,800
what about you?

72
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,199
I'll be fine.

73
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,399
It's just that it'll be too much...

74
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,040
for one person...

75
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,600
to pay the remaining rent.

76
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,319
I remember we signed a one-year contract back then.

77
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,776
I don't think we can get the deposit back...

78
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
if we move out early.

79
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,240
When are you leaving?

80
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,279
Tomorrow.

81
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
What's the rush?

82
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,560
Because of the last minute decision.

83
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,879
I'm in a rush too.

84
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,799
There's a lot of paperwork to do.

85
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Ms. Xu said...

86
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,639
to take it as a business trip...

87
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,920
and take my time with the paperwork.

88
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,960
But Ms. Xu also said...

89
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,090
I'll have plenty of chances to come back.

90
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,679
- We... - It's okay.

91
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,480
Let's text often.

92
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,840
Okay.

93
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,399
Let's text often.

94
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,559
Just put your winter clothes in the wardrobe.

95
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,039
I'll put them together.

96
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,519
It's more convenient.

97
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,919
Is it so that...

98
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,610
you can leave easier in the future?

99
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,200
What's wrong?

100
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,519
Aren't you taking the shoes?

101
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,559
I bought a pair myself.

102
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,279
Is that so?

103
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,279
When?

104
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,120
Two days ago.

105
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,440
I went shopping during my lunch break.

106
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,679
I still liked it when I saw it.

107
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,360
I couldn't help but buy them.

108
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,799
I felt bad about wearing them back, so...

109
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,480
I never told you.

110
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,439
It's brand new. I've never worn it.

111
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,638
I called and asked.

112
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,879
It can still be returned.

113
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,960
Return it.

114
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,399
Okay.

115
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,679
I'll return it.

116
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,480
It's quite expensive.

117
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,759
Don't let it be a waste.

118
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,480
Do you still have the receipt?

119
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,440
Yes.

120
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,080
Eat the beef tongue in the fridge while it's fresh.

121
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,759
I also bought your favorite noodles for you.

122
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,080
They're on the first shelf in the kitchen cabinet.

123
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,039
And you always forget to take the liver supplements.

124
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Time to go.

125
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,360
Next month,

126
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,080
I have another project here.

127
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,159
I'll be right back.

128
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,840
Okay. I'll wait for you.

129
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,600
After you come back,

130
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,320
you still have to leave anyway.

131
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,440
What did you say?

132
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Nothing.

133
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,000
Let me know before you come back.

134
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,015
The rent is paid by the quarter.

135
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,639
It's due on the tenth of next month.

136
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,600
I talked to the landlord.

137
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,655
I'll cancel the lease after it expires,

138
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,799
so you should come back before that.

139
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,120
Okay.

140
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
I'm leaving.

141
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:49,919
Do you want some bread?

142
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,480
No, you eat it. I'm not hungry.

143
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,320
(Where are you?)

144
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,879
Why are so many people calling for a cab?

145
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,519
There are over 20 waiting in line.

146
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,216
We won't get to see the end of the show.

147
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,519
There's no need to call a cab.

148
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,440
I've already asked my driver to pick us up.

149
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,919
Your driver?

150
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,320
Ms. Nan, I didn't mean to hide it from you.

151
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,200
But please don't tell the others.

152
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,240
No problem.

153
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,960
He should be over there.

154
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,638
She's just an heiress experiencing the workplace.

155
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,639
What do you call this?

156
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,840
Incognito visiting, okay?

157
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,360
- Really? - Yes.

158
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,879
You should go for it.

159
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,146
She's a young lady. I'm sure she has plenty of suitors.

160
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,518
I don't stand a chance.

161
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,119
But not many people know about that.

162
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,920
I'm already taken.

163
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,575
Show off your prestigious school background.

164
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,000
With your looks and EQ, it'll be a piece of cake.

165
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,759
It has been a while.

166
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,279
You see, I just got back.

167
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,480
Things at home are finally done.

168
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,775
Last time, I asked you out for tiramisu.

169
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,095
It was wrong of me to stand you up.

170
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,319
You have every right to be mad. I apologize. I'm sorry.

171
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,759
Why should I be angry?

172
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,440
We have nothing to do with each other.

173
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,839
Are you free today? Let's go today.

174
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,720
I'm not free. Do you have a girlfriend?

175
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,359
Yes.

176
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,279
But I used to.

177
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,680
Did you break up?

178
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,890
Yesterday.

179
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,279
Why?

180
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,799
Because of you.

181
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,410
I missed you so much.

182
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,170
So...

183
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,599
why did you break up?

184
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,559
Lost feelings.

185
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,119
Did she cheat on you?

186
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,519
It's the other way around.

187
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm the one who has done wrong.

188
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,799
How so?

189
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,279
Well, how should I put it?

190
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,410
I thought about it.

191
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,170
It's not entirely...

192
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:58,920
my fault.

193
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,079
It's mostly...

194
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,200
your fault.

195
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,650
I heard...

196
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,480
that she's really pretty.

197
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,599
How can I compare to her?

198
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,000
Who did you hear that from?

199
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,119
Don't worry about it.

200
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,799
Is she really pretty?

201
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,480
She's quite pretty.

202
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,720
Then I can't compare to her all the more.

203
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,650
But you're different.

204
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:41,200
How are we different?

205
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,039
You're cute.

206
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Cute?

207
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,440
That's a good review.

208
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,920
But that's not love.

209
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,650
Someone who loves you...

210
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,119
would say you're beautiful or charming.

211
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,890
You can see through a person with just one sentence.

212
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,079
He Zhi Nan.

213
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,170
Don't get ahead of yourself.

214
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,240
No. What?

215
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,680
Why are you mad?

216
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,890
The word "cute" has always been...

217
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,759
a positive word in my dictionary.

218
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,410
I don't know why, but in today's social interactions,

219
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,890
it has become not a very good word.

220
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,799
You don't have to explain.

221
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,680
I know what I look like.

222
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,370
- Listen to me. - You're so annoying.

223
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,479
What are you doing? Put me down.

224
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,720
There are many people...

225
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,480
Are you still leaving?

226
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,599
Why is it so hard just to talk to you?

227
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,000
You keep walking forward.

228
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,440
I've been telling the truth.

229
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,719
Even if I say you're cute...

230
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,400
or not as pretty as my ex-girlfriend,

231
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,920
it's all true. But...

232
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,079
But when I see you,

233
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,055
I feel like I'm bathing in the spring breeze.

234
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,680
It's electrifying.

235
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,799
Anyway, this feeling is like...

236
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,119
I can't let you go.

237
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,440
Why are you looking at me?

238
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,960
Because you're cute.

239
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,759
We're here.

240
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,920
Do you want to go up for some tea?

241
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,160
Are you sure?

242
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,599
It's just drinking a cup of tea.

243
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,039
What about after that?

244
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,440
I know what you're thinking.

245
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,160
You think everything is moving too fast.

246
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,039
I think so too.

247
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,680
We're moving too fast.

248
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,799
I'm quite happy today.

249
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,399
I haven't been this happy in a long time.

250
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,119
So I want...

251
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,440
to extend this wonderful moment...

252
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,160
and savor it.

253
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Go up. Stop dawdling.

254
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,359
Bye.

255
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,359
Hurry and go up.

256
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,480
What are you smiling for?

257
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,319
What are you smiling for?

258
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,480
We're here.

259
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,199
What are you waiting for?

260
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,640
Go upstairs.

261
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,798
Do you want to go up for some tea?

262
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,079
Are you crazy?

263
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,000
This is moving too fast.

264
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,160
What do you know?

265
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,640
This is called testing the waters.

266
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,480
Are you sure?

267
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,079
It's just drinking a cup of tea.

268
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
What about after that?

269
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,240
What if I don't leave?

270
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,000
I know what you're thinking.

271
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,079
You think everything is moving too fast.

272
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,319
I think so too.

273
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,920
We're moving too fast.

274
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,960
I'm quite happy today.

275
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,560
I haven't been this happy in a long time.

276
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,319
So I want...

277
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,599
to extend this wonderful moment...

278
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,880
and savor it.

279
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,640
He's a pro.

280
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,720
Go up. Stop dawdling.

281
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,720
Bye.

282
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,640
Hurry and go up.

283
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,200
I know what you're thinking.

284
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,880
You think everything is moving too fast.

285
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,519
I think so too.

286
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,279
We're moving too fast.

287
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,839
Ms. Gu.

288
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:17,200
Thank you, Xiao Qu.

289
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,440
Ms. Gu, you got a lot today.

290
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,319
These?

291
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,399
They're from your neighbor from across the hallway.

292
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,278
That girl is quite generous.

293
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,640
She gave them all to me.

294
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,400
Look at this.

295
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,799
There's a logo on it.

296
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,518
At the recycling point,

297
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,279
I can get 20 yuan for each.

298
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,440
This one doesn't have a logo.

299
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,400
The price difference is over ten yuan.

300
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,119
I really don't get you city people.

301
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,839
These are all luxury goods.

302
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,240
I don't really get it either.

303
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,535
Carry on, Ms. Gu. I'm going upstairs.

304
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,640
Okay.

305
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,039
Han Han, I'm here.

306
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,519
Your launch event is so classy and impressive.

307
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,440
I'll take good photos, post them online,

308
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,640
and spread the news for you.

309
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,119
This scarf is this year's collaboration.

310
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,399
It's really good.

311
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,680
Take a look first.

312
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,160
You're here.

313
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,559
I think those influencer bloggers look ordinary.

314
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,559
I showed their photos to my Yi Peng.

315
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,359
He thought they were so-so too.

316
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,279
Just one date, and he's already yours?

317
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,599
Even if not now, he will be sooner or later.

318
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:06,960
I've noticed.

319
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,119
Men give you just a little bit of candy...

320
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,400
and you're already all smiles.

321
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,599
I just think...

322
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:16,759
that a relationship is the best in the beginning.

323
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,839
Hypocritical and mysterious.

324
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,119
Passionate and romantic.

325
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:30,839
Han Han.

326
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,039
Long time no see.

327
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,240
You're still the same.

328
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,920
- You've changed a lot. - Have I?

329
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,079
I can't make up my mind.

330
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,119
I can't decide between two scarves.

331
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,079
Can you give me some advice?

332
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,880
What's there to advise?

333
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,359
Take them all if you like them.

334
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,920
They're all limited editions.

335
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,239
If you miss them, you'll regret it...

336
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,000
when you see they look good on someone else.

337
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,200
Good idea. I'll place the order then.

338
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,960
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

339
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,559
- Take your time. - Okay.

340
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,039
They say money makes cowards brave.

341
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,400
I think money gets you love.

342
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,680
It'll make anyone bold.

343
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,758
When she came to the office last time,

344
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,416
she said she wanted to thank me, the matchmaker.

345
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,239
From a former subordinate to the client's wife.

346
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,479
- Do you regret it? - The Melon Seed King?

347
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,639
No way.

348
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,400
You can't? But she can.

349
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:29,696
I think the ones that can make you fall for them...

350
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,000
are a rare species.

351
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,000
Don't you think when she looks at people,

352
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,079
there's a rating machine in her gaze?

353
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,559
In the past, her criteria...

354
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,960
were looks, body,

355
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,160
taste, family, and her boyfriend.

356
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,640
Now that she's married,

357
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,559
her criteria have become jewelry,

358
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,159
bags, shoes, aesthetics,

359
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,920
cars, houses, and her husband.

360
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,840
Yes, now that you mention it.

361
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,999
And I saw it just now.

362
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,599
Her rating machine scanned you all over.

363
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,640
From top to bottom,

364
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,320
you're only worth a fraction of someone else's Birkin bag.

365
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,559
I have a nice figure.

366
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,959
But you look too pale.

367
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,200
What are you doing? You're so annoying.

368
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,000
See? Instant reply.

369
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,960
What did he say?

370
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,000
Awesome. So rich.

371
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,400
Han Han.

372
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,720
Why do you think...

373
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,295
(Uncle: I want to see you. There's something I want to tell you.)

374
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,160
(Please don't refuse me.)

375
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,920
Why did he show up again?

376
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
I don't know.

377
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:18,599
Sun Han Han, wake up.

378
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,119
You said it yourself.

379
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,839
You won't give him another chance.

380
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,440
I didn't say I'd give him a chance.

381
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,320
Whether I regret it or not, he doesn't have the right.

382
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Good morning.

383
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,039
Good morning.

384
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,720
Good morning.

385
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,920
Good morning.

386
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:15,839
(The first bag for you. Zhou Bin.)

387
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,735
(I have lots to say. Duonian Restaurant, Wednesday 7pm.)

388
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:25,640
(See you there. I'll be waiting.)

389
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,479
Just get an express courier to return the scarf.

390
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,440
To ask for his address,

391
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,359
I have to add him back as a friend first.

392
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,040
Won't that give him the wrong idea?

393
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,440
If you go to the appointment,

394
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,839
won't he also get the wrong idea?

395
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,559
I, Sun Han Han...

396
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,599
am an independent woman with dignity.

397
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:54,359
I'll never take a single penny from a jerk.

398
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,440
Most importantly,

399
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:00,680
I really want to see what kind of performance he will put on.

400
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
If necessary,

401
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,400
I'll give him the Best Actor award.

402
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,599
Okay.

403
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,240
Sexy, casual, or professional. Which one are you going to wear?

404
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,838
Welcome, miss. Do you have a reservation?

405
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,079
I'm looking for someone.

406
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,440
I'm here to give this back to you.

407
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,240
- You don't like it? - It doesn't matter if I do or not.

408
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,440
I won't accept something that doesn't belong to me.

409
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,519
Since you're here,

410
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,400
sit down and listen to what I have to say.

411
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,880
What is there to say between us?

412
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,320
I still owe you an apology.

413
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,639
I don't see what you have to apologize for, Mr. Zhou.

414
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,480
Sit down first.

415
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,480
Hear me out, okay?

416
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,679
I want to apologize for my selfishness.

417
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:30,809
What selfishness?

418
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,039
I didn't want you to know that I have a wife.

419
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,920
But my bottom line is not telling lies.

420
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:41,559
You don't lie completely or say the whole truth.

421
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,000
That's the most hypocritical.

422
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,200
You're almost within my reach.

423
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,118
My feelings are clearly there,

424
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,840
but I can't express anything.

425
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,809
I can only endure it.

426
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,480
This feeling is very tormenting.

427
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,599
Mr. Zhou.

428
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,289
Please stop saying things that will cause misunderstandings.

429
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,718
You know it very well.

430
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,999
You have someone you need to care for according to the law.

431
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,480
It's because I know that very well...

432
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,199
that I've been enduring that torment.

433
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,559
But there's no law that says one can't express their feelings.

434
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,519
It's meaningless.

435
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,079
You're right.

436
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,680
I didn't have the right before.

437
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,159
But I have the right now.

438
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,039
The day before yesterday,

439
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:37,238
Zeng Cheng and I are officially divorced.

440
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:40,329
(Zhou Bin, Divorce registration)

441
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,159
I can finally...

442
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,840
look at you...

443
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,199
without hesitation, just like right now.

444
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:52,809
This feeling...

445
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,000
is kind of surreal.

446
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:10,840
Don't look at me like that. I'm a bit nervous.

447
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,638
Is it because of me?

448
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,000
You mean the divorce?

449
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,920
Of course not.

450
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,718
This is between Zeng Cheng and me.

451
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,960
It has nothing to do with you.

452
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:33,960
Can we order now?

453
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,360
I'm hungry.

454
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,719
Okay.

455
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,289
(Hong Kong)

456
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,095
Everyone knows that Mid-Levels is the best area...

457
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,289
for the wealthy in Hong Kong.

458
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,360
It's surrounded by luxury homes.

459
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:06,599
Bumping into celebrities is a normal occurrence here.

460
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,199
Come in.

461
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:11,360
Take a look.

462
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,840
The view is spectacular.

463
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,480
Miss, you work in Central, right?

464
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,719
Yes.

465
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,655
With the Central-Mid-Levels Escalators,

466
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,360
it's only 20 minutes to Cityplaza.

467
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,559
It's very convenient.

468
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,239
Give us a discount.

469
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:35,000
Sir.

470
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:37,519
I specially requested the low price from the company.

471
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,039
I can't lower it anymore.

472
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,960
But I'm a regular client.

473
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:42,535
It's precisely because you're a regular client...

474
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,360
that we can get this price.

475
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,679
Look. The view is spectacular.

476
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:47,880
The location is good.

477
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,360
It's a great house.

478
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:53,289
Okay.

479
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,809
Su Su.

480
00:37:56,289 --> 00:37:57,519
Let's look at other places.

481
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,799
This place is a bit expensive.

482
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:00,360
I'll take it.

483
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:03,809
I really like this house.

484
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,960
I'll settle on it.

485
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,519
Okay.

486
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,856
It has been a few years. You're still the same.

487
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,920
What do you mean?

488
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,329
Once you make up your mind,

489
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,840
you're unyielding.

490
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:15,519
You haven't changed at all.

491
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:17,049
Actually, renting this place...

492
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,880
has a special meaning to me.

493
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,559
What meaning?

494
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,000
I'll tell you later.

495
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:24,768
You know, when I signed the contract,

496
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:25,880
my heart was really hurt.

497
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,289
This is the maximum I can afford.

498
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,159
That's you.

499
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,999
But I believe with your capability, you'll move up soon.

500
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,360
In a few years,

501
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,118
you'll become a partner.

502
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,400
By then, it won't be a problem to even buy the house.

503
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,719
I'll take your blessing.

504
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:42,678
Thank you, Alex.

505
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,809
You're taking me house-hunting despite being busy.

506
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,399
If it weren't for you, I would've been so lost.

507
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,808
Don't be so courteous with me.

508
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:51,199
You helped me a lot too when I studied in Beijing.

509
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:53,479
By the way, where's your handsome boyfriend?

510
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,599
What is he doing now?

511
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,329
Did you break up?

512
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,199
I don't know.

513
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:05,719
I get it.

514
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,038
Both of you...

515
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,329
are the best of the best.

516
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,199
You have a lot of admirers.

517
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,439
You're leaving some space for each other...

518
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,840
to attack or defend.

519
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,000
- Right? - Sounds like you really know it.

520
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,329
You should start by getting used to the pace of work here.

521
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,289
If you get bored, give me a call.

522
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,856
I'll introduce you to some new friends.

523
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,960
Okay, thank you.

524
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,360
Do you need a potential boyfriend?

525
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,519
Gao Peng.

526
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,559
I happen to have a friend who's perfect for you.

527
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:40,360
He's my classmate from when I studied in the UK.

528
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,519
He's from Jiangzhou.

529
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,559
His family is quite rich and he's honest.

530
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,769
He just broke up too.

531
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,360
I'll set up an appointment for you.

532
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,959
Sorry, Alex.

533
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,719
You don't have to be so enthusiastic.

534
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,158
No. Life is very fast-paced here.

535
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,639
You have to act immediately.

536
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,480
Alex, I really...

537
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,159
For now, I'm not in the mood to date.

538
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,518
Go upstairs.

539
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,329
You have work tomorrow. Get some rest.

540
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:40,289
You too.

541
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,440
I'll watch you go upstairs.

542
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,480
I'm going then.

543
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:00,599
Is my signal not obvious enough?

544
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:02,719
We had dinner,

545
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,480
went to the movies, and went shopping.

546
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:06,159
And I let him take me home.

547
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,560
There's another possibility.

548
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,639
He doesn't like you at all.

549
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,599
It's obvious he's pretending not to know.

550
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,800
Could it be that I have to make the first move?

551
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,200
You posted on the public account yesterday.

552
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
Just because a girl...

553
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:30,601
is willing to have dinner and watch movies with a guy,

554
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,839
it doesn't mean she has agreed to anything.

555
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,479
You even said that girls...

556
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,329
like gentlemen who are modest...

557
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,159
and polite.

558
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,638
Don't be so hypocritical.

559
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:43,289
Anyhow, you wore your new set of sexy underwear...

560
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,679
for nothing.

561
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,808
Ms. Gu, let me help you.

562
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:06,879
- No need. - It's okay.

563
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,719
It's dirty. Leave it.

564
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,960
Look at my hands.

565
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
Xiao Qu.

566
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:16,360
Why haven't I seen your pretty girlfriend lately?

567
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,399
Is she on a business trip again?

568
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,839
- Let me help you. - It's okay, really.

569
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,000
No need. I can do it myself.

570
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,199
- I'll get going. - Thank you.

571
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:40,840
Hello.

572
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,198
Hi, I'd like to make a complaint...

573
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,679
about our building manager.

574
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,559
I'm from building two. Yes.

575
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,239
She has been going door-to-door to collect junk...

576
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,440
and leaving her post without permission.

577
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,079
Okay, thank you.

578
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,000
Come on.

579
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:14,480
Come and get it.

580
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,769
Look at them. They're so silly.

581
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:26,319
They're attracted to me without knowing their place.

582
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:29,559
Then they're getting played by me.

583
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,078
Who says hunters...

584
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,769
always appear as prey?

585
00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:38,719
Prey...

586
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,760
will always be the prey.

587
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,598
(The hunter and the hunted)

588
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:57,880
(The hunter and the hunted)
