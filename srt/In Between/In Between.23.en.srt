00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 23)

3
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,959
Zhou Bin will be detained
for three days for assault.

4
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,400
Just three days?

5
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,159
(Document
for Administrative Punishment)

6
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,840
(Offender: Zhou Bin)

7
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,119
I'll go
to the police station later...

8
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,239
and request to access
Zhou Bin's statement...

9
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,719
as evidence
of his extramarital affair.

10
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,370
No.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,120
There's no need for that.

12
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,280
Why not?

13
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,198
We already have the evidence.

14
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,199
Why don't we use it?

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,759
Sun Han Han wants me...

16
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,719
to get rid of Zhou Bin for her.

17
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,120
We might as well...

18
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,599
let her testify in court.

19
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,080
I think I know what you mean.

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,039
You want her to appear in court.

21
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,120
I want to hear her...

22
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,199
confess in court.

23
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,280
Why are you doing this?

24
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,718
Ms. Wang told you, didn't she?

25
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,680
When I was with Zhou Bin,
you were divorced.

26
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,759
I didn't do anything wrong.

27
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,438
Besides, I have no idea
when you two got remarried.

28
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,639
I was deceived.

29
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,039
I know very well now
that Zhou Bin lied to both of us.

30
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,280
However, at this point,

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,159
that's not important.

32
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,400
You should know
what's most important.

33
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,280
What do you mean?

34
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,598
Have you thought about it?

35
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,559
Three days from now,
Zhou Bin will be released.

36
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
What will he do to you?

37
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,598
The only thing
that can truly unsettle a man...

38
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,840
is his career.

39
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,479
As long as
you're willing to testify,

40
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,280
I can bring
his career crashing down.

41
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,680
By then, let alone controlling you,

42
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,360
he won't even be able
to find his footing in Jiangzhou.

43
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,039
Even if you don't go to court,

44
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,680
my confrontation with Zhou Bin...

45
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,279
will still involve you.

46
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,319
Rumors will spread everywhere.

47
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,639
You'll be as disgraced...

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,879
as he is.

49
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,680
Are you really willing to help me?

50
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,279
I'm merely letting you know
the consequences.

51
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,879
Whether you come or not,

52
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,399
it's your choice.

53
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,050
If a person does something wrong,

54
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,560
he has to pay the price.

55
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,399
We can work together.

56
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,839
Mr. Gao.

57
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,480
Ms. Hu has told me...

58
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,638
that the compliant
cooperation agreement is ready...

59
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,759
and has been forwarded
to your secretary.

60
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,759
Here's the hard copy.

61
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,240
You can take a look.

62
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,360
I'm going to the conference room.

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,638
- Please check for me.
- Do you remember...

64
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,639
Mr. Gao from Hong Kong?

65
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,879
Gao Peng?

66
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,639
He's here to see Ms. Han again.

67
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,720
Thank you.

68
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,040
Mr. Gao.

69
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,399
Is there anything else?

70
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,560
It might not be a bad thing
that He Zhi Nan saw it.

71
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,160
The invisible barrier between us...

72
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,519
has finally been broken.

73
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,000
Did you call Zhi Nan?

74
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,279
She didn't answer my calls.

75
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,519
Han Su.

76
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,680
I like you.

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,959
That's why I'm willing
to use everything I have...

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
to support your passion.

79
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,959
No matter
what happens in the future,

80
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,360
please believe
that I'll always have your back.

81
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,319
Are you really going to ignore me
because of He Zhi Nan?

82
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,679
The three of us will get hurt.

83
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,759
What's the point?

84
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,800
Mr. Gao.

85
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,399
You're my...

86
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,360
Sorry to interrupt.

87
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,600
Ms. Han.

88
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,279
Ms. Hu is will be waiting for you
in the conference room one.

89
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,600
Okay.

90
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,560
Excuse me.

91
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,519
Excuse me.

92
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,079
Are you fooling me?

93
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,399
He likes you.

94
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,600
You sure put on quite the act.

95
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,919
Faking orders is one thing,

96
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
but you're still holding
on to that laptop.

97
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:57,759
I don't think he's suitable for you.

98
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,799
What?

99
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,920
Trying to pin me against the wall?

100
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,079
I really like you.

101
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,480
You might not really like me.

102
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,639
Don't be fooled by yourself.

103
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,560
By the way,

104
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,120
I read the report
you sent over today.

105
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,960
The details are on point.

106
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,600
You're way sharper
than I was during my internship.

107
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,000
When I was your age,
I didn't know anything.

108
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,519
At that time,

109
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
did you like anyone?

110
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,840
What I figured out
earlier than you...

111
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,720
is that projects
and work matter most.

112
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,519
Men...

113
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,090
always come and go.

114
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,450
It's Ms. Hu.

115
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,480
Hello, Molina.

116
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,639
What's up?

117
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,090
Yes, I'm here.

118
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,719
After their company went public,

119
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,879
I casually quoted a price...

120
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,279
for legal support
in compliance business with Mr. Gao,

121
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,480
thinking he would negotiate.

122
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,799
To my surprise,
he agreed immediately.

123
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,519
You'll be in charge...

124
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,600
of this project.

125
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,039
I heard Gao Peng confess to you.

126
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,399
Why?

127
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Don't you like him?

128
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,799
Molina, I'll be honest with you.

129
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,559
I don't have any expectations...

130
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,090
for love anymore.

131
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,450
I don't think...

132
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,919
I'll fall in love again.

133
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,480
Men can't provide me
with enough sense of security.

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,879
I want to rely on myself
for everything.

135
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,600
You know that a woman's instinct...

136
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,480
is to habitually invest
in love and family.

137
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,330
The reason there are fewer women...

138
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,759
at the top in various fields...

139
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,878
is that once they encounter love,

140
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,399
they no longer want
to conquer the world.

141
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,559
Instead, they start focusing...

142
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,399
on serving men.

143
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,330
That's why...

144
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,240
I don't want to get married.

145
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,600
I want to use my time
to conquer the world.

146
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,360
Can I ask you a question?

147
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,840
Imagine there is a certificate...

148
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,918
that can give you access...

149
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,360
to top-notch networks,

150
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,200
resources, and support.

151
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,878
Would you pursue it?

152
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,120
Of course.

153
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,319
What if...

154
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,679
it's the most prestigious
marriage certificate...

155
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,120
and Gao Peng...

156
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,840
is the certifier?

157
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,480
"The partner, Zhou Bin..."

158
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,599
"withdrew 10 million US dollars
from his personal account..."

159
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,319
"for Australian
investment immigration."

160
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,559
Immigration?

161
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,359
"This money was transferred..."

162
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,519
"through the law firm's
London office..."

163
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,600
"and eventually sent to Australia."

164
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,840
"Is that illegal?"

165
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,919
What does that mean?

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,159
Someone reported Zhou Bin
for illegal immigration.

167
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,239
Isn't that jerk at the law firm?

168
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,399
Why is he emigrating?

169
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,638
This should be
Zeng Cheng's second move.

170
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,798
Ruin his career...

171
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,679
and ensure he can't make
a living in Jiangzhou.

172
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,759
This woman...

173
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,440
is like the protagonist.

174
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Come on.

175
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
Can you put yourself in my shoes?

176
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,919
I'm the fish on the chopping board.

177
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,919
You still think
this is a revenge film.

178
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
How about...

179
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,639
I ask Han Su to talk to her for you?

180
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,320
Han Su?

181
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,759
She...

182
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,480
She's Zeng Cheng's cousin.

183
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,799
Zeng Cheng's cousin?

184
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,240
The lawyer in Hong Kong?

185
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,879
She told me recently.

186
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,919
She said she understands you,

187
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,440
but because her relationship
with Zeng Cheng is close,

188
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,679
she can't get too close to you.

189
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,279
Will she speak up for me?

190
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,679
Let's give it a try.

191
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,639
Sure.

192
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,559
Zeng Cheng.

193
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Is it true that Zhou Bin
wants to immigrate?

194
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,879
I saw the screenshot of the report.

195
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,399
It has been circulating
in several groups.

196
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,960
It's basically true.

197
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,879
That's the effect I wanted.

198
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,720
Aren't you afraid...

199
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,600
he'll find out it was you
who leaked it?

200
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,158
As long as he clarifies
such a report promptly,

201
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,440
it doesn't count for much.

202
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,600
However, he's now in custody...

203
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,919
and has already missed
the best time to clarify.

204
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,679
This move of yours
is really ruthless.

205
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,440
The senior partner
of the law firm...

206
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,519
just called me.

207
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,879
I used the opportunity...

208
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,320
to inform them about the truth...

209
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,840
regarding Mr. Zhou's detention.

210
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,759
Photos of Zhou Bin being arrested...

211
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,519
are all over the Internet.

212
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,360
For those senior partners,

213
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,600
even if they don't care
about Zhou Bin's private life,

214
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,879
they will still worry
about how this situation...

215
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,919
affects the firm's reputation...

216
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,360
and the trust clients place in them.

217
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
I think these senior partners...

218
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,600
are currently holding
an urgent meeting...

219
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,879
to decide whether
to issue an official statement...

220
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,879
distancing themselves from Zhou Bin.

221
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,840
You're aiming to cut off
his source of support.

222
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,600
This is just the appetizer.

223
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,480
The main dish isn't here yet.

224
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,320
(Nan Nan)

225
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,159
I have to take this call.

226
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,639
Hello?

227
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,759
I have a favour...

228
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,279
to ask of you.

229
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,360
It's fine.

230
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,039
I'm at my cousin's place.

231
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,600
Don't worry.

232
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,279
I know what to do about this.

233
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,200
Nan Nan, how did it go?

234
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,159
She agreed.

235
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,639
However,

236
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,440
she can't ensure
how it will turn out.

237
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,240
What's the matter?

238
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,200
Actually, I'm a little scared.

239
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,080
When Zhou Bin gets out,

240
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,480
he'll surely come to me.

241
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,120
You can stay at my place.

242
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,399
There's no need.

243
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,518
Even if I come to your house,

244
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,039
it's just a temporary way to escape.

245
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,480
What needs to be faced
must still be faced alone.

246
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,879
If a relationship...

247
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
is wrong from the very beginning,

248
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,159
no matter how hard we try,

249
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,720
we will only stray further down
the wrong path.

250
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,679
It won't end well.

251
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,039
Zeng Cheng.

252
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,480
Do you still want
Sun Han Han to go to court?

253
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,799
She's young and pretty.

254
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,799
When she has the upper hand,

255
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,170
she's aggressive and merciless.

256
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,279
When she can't win,

257
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,960
she claims innocence.

258
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,000
That doesn't work for me.

259
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,279
However, we both know...

260
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,039
that when Sun Han Han
and Zhou Bin were together,

261
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,960
you were indeed divorced.

262
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,599
Zhou Bin...

263
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,039
has the ability
to distort right from wrong.

264
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's a piece of cake for him
to deal with a woman like her.

265
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,359
What do you mean?

266
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,440
Do you want to plead for her?

267
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,000
I just think...

268
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,890
Zeng Cheng, you're so smart.

269
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,319
You should know deep down...

270
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,240
that continuing this struggle
with Zhou Bin...

271
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:02,440
won't lead to anyone truly winning.

272
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,079
Love can't be reclaimed,

273
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,559
but you can choose to move on.

274
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,440
Speaking of love,

275
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,410
I've lost it all a long time ago.

276
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,170
I admit defeat.

277
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,119
However,

278
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,519
everyone is equal
in the face of pain.

279
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,759
Regardless of whether
you're independent, successful,

280
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,759
rich or poor,

281
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,000
beautiful or ugly,

282
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,999
all women feel the same sadness...

283
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,680
when faced with heartbreak.

284
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,119
Zeng Cheng.

285
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,440
You're the strongest woman
I've ever met.

286
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,720
I believe you'll be able
to let go of this matter.

287
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,319
Su Su.

288
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,960
Being strong doesn't mean
you won't be hurt,

289
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,650
but being strong can guarantee
that you won't be defeated by harm.

290
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,720
How long it takes...

291
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,440
to heal this wound...

292
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,799
is a personal choice.

293
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,440
Some people choose to forgive...

294
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,960
and empathize with their enemies.

295
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,000
That, of course,
is a form of strength.

296
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,890
However, I'm...

297
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,200
not that kind of person.

298
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,480
So you want to strike back?

299
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,960
Only by retaliating...

300
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,519
and seeing them accept punishment...

301
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,599
and pay the price...

302
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,240
can I start...

303
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,039
to heal my wounds swiftly.

304
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,039
Here.

305
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Thank you.

306
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,119
Han Su.

307
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,169
I told you.

308
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,839
Call me Ms. Han at work.

309
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,170
What are you doing?

310
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,479
The desk won't go up.

311
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,759
Here, let me help you.

312
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,079
Here.

313
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,170
This should be here.

314
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,279
Well...

315
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,440
I've been granted the qualification
to conduct my defence.

316
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:51,890
Congratulations.

317
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,118
Is that all?

318
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,119
What else?

319
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,119
Do you want me to pull strings
and leak the questions for you?

320
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,119
How is that possible?

321
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,358
If you do so,

322
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,799
how can I pursue you in the future?

323
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,519
What I mean is,

324
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,000
I'd like to treat you
to dinner tonight...

325
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,960
to thank you for your help.

326
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,559
Hello?

327
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,170
Han Su.

328
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,200
Can I have dinner at your place?

329
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,519
Sure.

330
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,359
I already ordered hot pot delivery.

331
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,890
They have your favourite dishes.

332
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,480
You can't say no...

333
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:46,890
and you can't work overtime.

334
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,650
Okay, see you tonight.

335
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,359
I'm sorry.

336
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,039
I have plans tonight.

337
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,559
By the way,
remember to check your email.

338
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,720
You have work to do.

339
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,799
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me anytime.

340
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,359
Submit it by tomorrow morning.

341
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,079
But...

342
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,079
I'm leaving. Bye.

343
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,319
Please fix the table
before you leave.

344
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,758
But I...

345
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:19,798
I got...

346
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:20,839
Wait.

347
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,879
Fix the table.

348
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,920
Seriously?

349
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,039
Han Han.

350
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,400
My cousin has a message for you.

351
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,880
She said...

352
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:02,960
instead of forgiveness,

353
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,759
what suits you better...

354
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,559
is punishment.

355
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,359
Thank you, Han Su.

356
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,160
Please tell Zeng Cheng...

357
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,279
that I'll see her in court.

358
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,720
It's okay.

359
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,640
Whatever they say,

360
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,000
it's their business.

361
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,680
We all know...

362
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,199
what the truth is.

363
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,319
That's all that matters.

364
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,759
If we're wrong, we admit it.

365
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,000
If you didn't do anything wrong,

366
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,240
no one can hurt you.

367
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,799
Well said.

368
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,519
I was worried
that you would hate me...

369
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,839
and not want to help me.

370
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,279
Actually,

371
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,799
I've never seen
this side of my cousin.

372
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,480
So rather than helping you,

373
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,519
I want to help her more.

374
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,400
Han Han.

375
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,640
We're friends.

376
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,359
You don't have to keep thanking me.

377
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,039
Besides,

378
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,480
there's no hatred between us.

379
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,880
Zhi Nan.

380
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,480
About Gao Peng,

381
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,960
- I...
- You don't have to say anything.

382
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,000
I trust you.

383
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,319
Thank you.

384
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,880
Who said...

385
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,200
friends don't have
to thank each other?

386
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,839
Come on, my friends.

387
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,240
Let's have a toast.

388
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,119
Think of it
the three of us are sworn sisters.

389
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,839
Cheers, my friends.

390
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,680
What are you laughing at?

391
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,880
Actually, since I was little,

392
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,599
I've never had many friends.

393
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,759
I've been convincing myself...

394
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,960
that people
don't have to have friends.

395
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,559
But you know what, Zhi Nan?

396
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,519
Do you still remember...

397
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,799
when we were
at the law firm in Hong Kong?

398
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,480
You told me...

399
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,319
that we are good friends.

400
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,160
It really shocked me.

401
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,960
Zhi Nan.

402
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,440
Thank you.

403
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,480
I finally have a friend.

404
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,599
That's so cheesy.

405
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,039
It's good to have friends.

406
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,680
There sure is a lot of material.

407
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,559
What do you mean?

408
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,960
Based on what you said,

409
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,480
I know you don't follow me.

410
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,440
Lately,

411
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,440
I've been working hard
to update my public account.

412
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,160
However, it didn't turn out well.

413
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,200
I think life is the best material,

414
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,440
but my life alone
isn't exciting enough.

415
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,240
With both of you,

416
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,039
it'll be a hit.

417
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,279
Sure.

418
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,000
For your career and dream,

419
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,319
I can authorize it for you.

420
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,038
I agree too.

421
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,039
However, you have
to make me look pretty.

422
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,720
The ending has to be happy.

423
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,559
It's best if I'm paired
with two handsome guys.

424
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,200
You're so pretty.

425
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,599
Wouldn't it be a pity...

426
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,960
if you don't get
to be the evil mistress?

427
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,319
How dare you, He Zhi Nan.

428
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,799
All right then. Tell me.

429
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,960
How many male secretaries
do you want?

430
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,319
Can I have as many as I want?

431
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,599
Don't you think
your version is too pessimistic?

432
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,000
Look. Let me read it for you.

433
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,759
"After countless times
of wandering,"

434
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,799
"the cutie is back to square one."

435
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,039
"After countless goodbyes,"

436
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,598
"she no longer expects anyone
to love her..."

437
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,999
"nor does she anticipate
loving anyone."

438
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,200
"She doesn't want
any more mistakes about love."

439
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,160
You're the one who told me
to be more sincere.

440
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,920
You can be more proactive
and more hopeful.

441
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,959
When I write that
she's being pursued and loved,

442
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,559
you think that's too much.

443
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,039
When I write that she's dejected,

444
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,559
you think it's too pessimistic.

445
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,799
What exactly do you want?

446
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,119
Hold on.

447
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,278
- Hello?
- Hello.

448
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,599
Are you Mr. Wang, the lock picker?

449
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm sorry.
You have the wrong number.

450
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,559
I'll revise it.

451
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,278
We have Member's Day
coming up in a couple of days.

452
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,440
Would you like to join us?

453
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,318
This way, you can engage directly...

454
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,359
with our customers...

455
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,318
and understand better
what they prefer...

456
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,359
and look forward to it.

457
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,880
If you think it might be boring
to come alone,

458
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,119
you can invite your friends to join.

459
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,359
They can help us promote it
by sharing it on social media.

460
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,960
I'll see you then.

461
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:54,279
By the way, I have another matter
I want to talk to you about.

462
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,759
Go ahead.

463
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,279
It's about your script fee.

464
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,680
Can we pay you
on a commission basis?

465
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,799
What do you mean?

466
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Well,

467
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:09,519
we really don't have money now.

468
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,559
All our funds are currently
tied up in the factory.

469
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,919
If you want cash,

470
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,000
could you wait
until we receive our salaries?

471
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,480
Is that okay?

472
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,960
You guys are so pitiful.

473
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,880
Don't worry.

474
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,480
I won't lie to you.

475
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,759
Okay?

476
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,200
This meal is on me today.

477
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,679
Think of it as a way
to wish our cutie great popularity,

478
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
okay?

479
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,240
Maybe next time we visit,

480
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,799
we'll get to try
a co-branded meal featuring it.

481
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,880
(Freshly prepared upon order)

482
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
How is it?

483
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,359
It's not good.

484
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,880
When it comes to
the two luckiest things in life,

485
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,559
one is doing what you love...

486
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,759
and making a ton of money from it...

487
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,960
and the other...

488
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,720
is meeting someone you like...

489
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,559
who likes you back.

490
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,359
The cutie clearly wants everything,

491
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,519
so why force her to choose?

492
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,480
That's the truth of life.

493
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,119
Luck is always scarce.

494
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,799
However,

495
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,798
if she keeps being so conflicted...

496
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:58,839
and unlucky,

497
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,680
who would want to have her?

498
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,119
You're right.

499
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
I'll revise it.

500
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,640
My cutie...

501
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,960
deserves a happy ending.

502
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,640
Being able to see such a sunrise...

503
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,519
is truly a benefit
for us hardworking night owls.

504
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,599
He Zhi Nan.

505
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,240
You're a genius.

506
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,039
(Cutie)

507
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,519
The little girl in the snow.

508
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Are you okay?

509
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,160
I'm okay.

510
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:29,839
Look.

511
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,559
My freckles are still on my face.

512
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,400
My dimples are still there.

513
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm still that girl
who easily falls for someone.

514
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,799
When I do,
I really get caught up in it.

515
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,039
I know...

516
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,559
many compliment me on being cute...

517
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,400
because I'm not pretty enough.

518
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,240
But that's fine.

519
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,359
Even if I'm not pretty,

520
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,559
even if no one loves me,

521
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,759
I'll still love myself.

522
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,279
I know...

523
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,119
some think I deserve it.

524
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,798
Letting go of
a decent rich boyfriend...

525
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,039
to pursue a handsome guy...

526
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,759
and then getting dumped.

527
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,039
I really do deserve it,

528
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,359
but that's all right.

529
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,319
I don't want
to suppress my feelings...

530
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,759
or calm my disappointment.

531
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,079
I want to be honest with myself.

532
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,960
If there's a next time,

533
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,039
I think I'd still choose
to stumble into the same pit.

534
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,680
That little girl in the past...

535
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,519
always felt...

536
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,160
she wasn't pretty enough...

537
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,279
and was constantly dissatisfied
with her imperfections.

538
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,160
However, so many years have passed.

539
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,039
Look.

540
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,359
I didn't turn
into someone beautiful...

541
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,960
or perfect,

542
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,960
but I've come to embrace
my imperfections.

543
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,239
Now, I have a new name.

544
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,719
My name is...

545
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,159
Cutie.

546
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,638
It's time to pay the rent!

547
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,679
Is anyone there? Open the door!

548
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,400
The door is locked.

549
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:38,519
Call him.

550
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:41,809
There's no one here.

551
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:44,920
How is it? Is the call connected?

552
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,038
Is it connected? Hurry up.

553
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,238
It can't get through.

554
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,678
How do we handle this?

555
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,718
- We fail to collect the rent.
- Call a locksmith.

556
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,719
Hurry up.

557
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,920
It's 306. Hurry up.

558
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,599
Call a locksmith.

559
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,079
It's unit 306. We need a locksmith.

560
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,119
Where did they go?

561
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,558
Hello.

562
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,719
The user you called...

563
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,159
Hello.

564
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:09,440
The user you called...

565
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,559
Come on.

566
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,559
It hurts so much.

567
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,440
Seriously. How much do you owe them?

568
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,679
A lot.

569
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,519
Do you know what the worst part is?

570
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,360
It's like misfortunes
never come alone.

571
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,119
My boss fired me.

572
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,559
You lost your job as a modeller?

573
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,718
I don't know
what's wrong with me lately.

574
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,840
Why am I so unlucky?

575
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,239
The endless phone calls
haven't stopped..

576
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,289
and now the investor
has suddenly backed out.

577
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,399
I don't even know...

578
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,809
how much longer
Toys Universe can survive.

579
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,079
You won't give up, right?

580
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:51,119
You once said you liked it.

581
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,719
Liked it?

582
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,238
Doing something
just because you like it?

583
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,119
Isn't that something
only young people can afford to do?

584
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,480
I'm almost 30...

585
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,809
and all I talk about
is what I like and my dreams.

586
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:02,679
Don't you think that's immature?

587
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,360
But a lot of people like Cutie.

588
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,519
Everyone is looking forward to it.

589
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,239
Besides,

590
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,880
Member's Day is coming up.

591
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,880
Hang in there.

592
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,400
"Hang in there"?

593
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,238
Chu Yi, Liu Fu, and I...

594
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,479
have repeated these words
over and over again.

595
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,559
It's true.

596
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,719
After saying it so many times,
it just feels like a joke.

597
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,400
It's quite laughable.

598
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,960
I'm done with the story.

599
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,880
She went through many setbacks,

600
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,079
much heartbreak...

601
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,199
and countless breakdowns.

602
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:57,639
After endless wandering,

603
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,360
she came to understand...

604
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,599
how hard...

605
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:05,000
love can be.

606
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,840
But despite the difficulties,

607
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,289
she still held onto hope.

608
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,039
At the end of the story,

609
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:16,679
she didn't become a perfect girl,

610
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:21,000
but she saw her own charm and worth.

611
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:24,289
Instead of
feeling sorry for herself,

612
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:27,480
she set out on a journey...

613
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,679
toward a larger world
without looking back.

614
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,000
As for me,

615
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm someone...

616
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,329
who is pretty careless...

617
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,289
and muddles through most things.

618
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:44,360
Well,

619
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,079
except when it comes to love.

620
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,039
But this time,
writing the cutie's story...

621
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,599
feels very different.

622
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,879
Why are you laughing?

623
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
It's really different.

624
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:58,559
What's different? Tell me.

625
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,480
I think I'm happy.

626
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,599
It seems like...

627
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:14,880
I've found what I like to do.

628
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,239
It's my dream job.

629
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,159
So I've decided...

630
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,360
to use all my savings
to help the cutie.

631
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,519
I want to be a shareholder
in Toys Universe.

632
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:40,519
I didn't expect that.

633
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,289
You're quite chivalrous.

634
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,559
Ms. He Zhi Nan, tell me.

635
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,679
How much do you plan to invest?

636
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,199
It's 30,000 yuan.

637
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,039
I haven't saved up any money.

638
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,519
I only have 34,000 yuan
left in my account.

639
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Let me keep 4,000 yuan
as living expenses, okay?

640
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:02,329
Okay.

641
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,159
All my life,

642
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,678
I've never met...

643
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,440
anyone as straightforward as you.

644
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,719
He Zhi Nan.

645
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:14,079
Thank you.

646
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,360
Wang Zi Lu.

647
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:21,840
Happy to collaborate with you.

648
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,199
Happy to collaborate with you.

649
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:41,880
(Detention Center
of Jianan District, Jiangzhou City)

650
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:09,880
(Armed police on duty)

651
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,840
This is the court summons.

652
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,480
Our divorce case
is scheduled for trial...

653
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,679
next week.

654
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,039
(Court summons)

655
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,039
You're the one
who's behind all this, right?

656
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,440
I want a divorce.

657
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,519
We can discuss the divorce properly.

658
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,840
You don't have
to go to such extremes.

659
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:10,000
You used
these underhanded tactics...

660
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:12,809
to ruin my reputation
and take away my career.

661
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
Do you have to be so ruthless?

662
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,559
The reason
I can destroy your career now...

663
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,518
is that it was originally built...

664
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,960
on my support.

665
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:26,920
I'm just taking back
what I gave you before.

666
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,519
By the way,

667
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:36,039
Sun Han Han will be in court too.

668
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,679
What did you say?

669
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,078
Zeng Cheng.

670
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:42,329
Zeng Cheng!

671
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:55,400
Good morning.

672
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,199
Morning.

673
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,159
Morning.

674
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,440
Morning.

675
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:10,289
Mr. Zhou is back.

676
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,329
Mr. Zhou.

677
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:21,519
This is Mr. Zhu's office.

678
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,599
You can't come in.

679
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,599
Your belongings
are at the front desk.

680
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:42,809
Mr. Zhou.

681
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,769
Your primary business
is in the entertainment industry.

682
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,679
Your name is always associated
with celebrities.

683
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:51,360
In this industry,
reputation is everything.

684
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,959
Once your reputation is tarnished,

685
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,360
everything is over.

686
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,158
According to Article 27...

687
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,960
of the partnership agreement
of the law firm,

688
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,808
your actions constitute...

689
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:03,329
a significant loss to the firm's
reputation and finances...

690
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:06,480
due to intentional
or gross negligence,

691
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,359
fulfilling the conditions...

692
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,769
for mandatory withdrawal
from the partnership.
