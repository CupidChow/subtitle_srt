00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 27)

3
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,530
Mom.

4
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,759
Su Su.

5
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,280
You're back.

6
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,759
Why are you...

7
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,439
I saw you that night...

8
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,439
Well, I'm a bit worried about you.

9
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
I'm fine.

10
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:48,719
That day, I was just...

11
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,719
a bit moody.

12
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,080
I'm fine now.

13
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,598
Let's go upstairs.

14
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,318
No. Well...

15
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,520
Actually,

16
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,280
your dad is worried about you too.

17
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,158
Originally, I wanted to bring him to Jiangzhou to see you.

18
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,520
However, he's afraid...

19
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,759
I know.

20
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,319
Our family has been broken for so many years.

21
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,240
It's not that easy...

22
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,720
to return to the way things were.

23
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,520
It's all my fault.

24
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,560
At that time,

25
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,959
I was too young and impulsive.

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,159
I was very willful.

27
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
I didn't realize...

28
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,800
that all of this...

29
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,879
had to be borne by my beloved daughter.

30
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,560
I really made a mistake.

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,599
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,039
All right, Mom.

33
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,800
Don't say anything anymore.

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,439
Why are your hands so cold?

35
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,560
Let's go upstairs.

36
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
Let's go.

37
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,759
And this.

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,639
Why did you make so much?

39
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,919
Did you make them all?

40
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,399
They're all your favorites.

41
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,730
He made them himself.

42
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,480
When he dropped me off,

43
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,560
he specifically asked me to tell you this.

44
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,319
After all these years,

45
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,079
he owes you an apology.

46
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,399
He doesn't expect...

47
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,879
your forgiveness...

48
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,680
after so long,

49
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,959
but he begs you...

50
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,079
to give him a chance...

51
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,560
to take care of us...

52
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,800
in the future.

53
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,730
It's strange.

54
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,680
I think...

55
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,680
I remember this smell.

56
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,040
It's from when I was little.

57
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,480
However,

58
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,600
I don't remember...

59
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,959
his face at all.

60
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,399
- Mom. - Yes.

61
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,000
You both must live well from now on.

62
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,319
We definitely will.

63
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,160
We all have to be well.

64
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,839
Here, eat more.

65
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,360
This is your favorite shrimp.

66
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,519
And this.

67
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,439
Eat up.

68
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,280
You should gain a bit of weight.

69
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,240
Good morning, Ms. Han.

70
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,696
Ms. Han, you're back to work.

71
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,799
- Ms. Han. - Ms. Han.

72
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,839
Ms. Han, you're back.

73
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,360
You're finally back.

74
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,799
Today, Hengliyan rang the bell for its IPO.

75
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,040
- Congratulations. - There are so many flowers.

76
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,560
The highlight is this one.

77
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,398
Sun Xu, the senior partner from headquarters,

78
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,039
sent flowers to the senior legal advisor.

79
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,359
This is the first time I've seen this...

80
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,839
in all my years at the firm.

81
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,479
Han Su.

82
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
Congratulations.

83
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,838
You're impressive...

84
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,278
and your future is full of potential.

85
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,319
Keep it up.

86
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,639
Sun Xu.

87
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,920
Welcome back.

88
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,279
Come to my office.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,079
I'll talk to you later.

90
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:35,119
Usually, I only drink in the office...

91
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,799
when I'm either extremely happy...

92
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240
or extremely upset.

93
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,839
Today, it's because...

94
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,839
I'm really happy for you.

95
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,600
Thank you, Molina.

96
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,920
I should be thanking you.

97
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,638
The big boss complimented you.

98
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,839
I'm proud of you too.

99
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,016
Actually, what I want to thank you for...

100
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,199
is something personal.

101
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,040
Let me guess.

102
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,518
Did Gao Peng propose to you?

103
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,600
No.

104
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,600
I officially turned him down.

105
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,039
It's actually because...

106
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,480
of your brilliant metaphor.

107
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,959
It helped me see my goals and dilemmas more clearly.

108
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,198
Once someone chooses a shortcut,

109
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,240
it means...

110
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,078
giving up on seeing more of the world...

111
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,319
and having more freedom.

112
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,319
The world is vast...

113
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,759
and I'm still young.

114
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,360
Why should I force myself?

115
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,279
I totally understand.

116
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,209
No matter what you decide,

117
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,399
I'll support you.

118
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,240
Do I need to remove you from the Hengliyan project?

119
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,840
If you don't want to see Gao Peng again...

120
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,090
There's no need.

121
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,615
I can handle work and personal matters...

122
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,679
as two separate things.

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,240
I think you've changed...

124
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,679
and it's a big change.

125
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,759
But I can't quite pinpoint exactly what has changed.

126
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,600
Actually, I think I've changed too.

127
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,210
I seem to have gained a bit of strength.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,039
A strength that allows me to face myself.

129
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,759
You're amazing.

130
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,639
I remember when I was your age.

131
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,399
My inner world was like a battleground...

132
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,159
and I struggled with myself every day.

133
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,210
So?

134
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,480
Did you rest well during your break?

135
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,759
Honestly,

136
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,330
I feel pretty exhausted.

137
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,758
Don't tell me...

138
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,240
as soon as you take a break and completely relax,

139
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,678
you feel unwell all over.

140
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,759
Yes.

141
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
My goodness.

142
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,840
We're the same kind.

143
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:57,919
The type that can't be happy unless we're exhausted.

144
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,960
- Cheers. - Cheers.

145
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,678
Let's celebrate.

146
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,959
I'll take you somewhere at noon.

147
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,479
You sure have a lot of tricks up your sleeve, kiddo.

148
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,959
I told you. Stop calling me kiddo.

149
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,600
What should I call you then? Big brother?

150
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,799
That works too.

151
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,879
Why did you bring me here?

152
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,799
It's the brand's anniversary today.

153
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,240
They have displayed many classic...

154
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,720
and limited edition items.

155
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,519
I happen to have a classmate working here...

156
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,839
and he helped me schedule a fitting appointment.

157
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,759
What do you mean?

158
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,330
Nothing.

159
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,518
I think the gowns are pretty...

160
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,798
and it's a rare opportunity,

161
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,240
so I want you to try them on.

162
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,799
If there's something you like,

163
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,080
I'd like to gift it to you.

164
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,080
Stop kidding.

165
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,919
Even if I were to get married,

166
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,798
I wouldn't buy these things.

167
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,840
Because...

168
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,518
Do you know?

169
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,976
The cheapest wedding gown in this store...

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,639
costs over a hundred thousand.

171
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,759
After buying it, I only wear it for a little while.

172
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,799
Isn't that just a waste of money?

173
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,399
It's a wonderful experience,

174
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,479
the highlight of your life.

175
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,639
Nothing else matters.

176
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,399
Young man, wake up.

177
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,720
You're not a millionaire.

178
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,799
You're right.

179
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,200
However, for you,

180
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,440
I'm willing to spend it all...

181
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,799
without hesitation.

182
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,840
Spend it all?

183
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,879
Use all your money...

184
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,840
to buy a gaudy and impractical wedding gown.

185
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,480
Then what?

186
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,440
Are you going to share a life of hardship with the bride?

187
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,840
I thought this was something every woman would love to hear.

188
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,559
Luo Ma.

189
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,039
I believe...

190
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,200
there will be women...

191
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,840
who feel touched and happy...

192
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,639
after hearing you say this.

193
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,480
But unfortunately,

194
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,039
I'm not the woman you think I am.

195
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,240
What do you mean?

196
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,279
The game is over.

197
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,640
Sorry. I have to take this call.

198
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,279
Hello, Molina.

199
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hello, Sophie.

200
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,760
There's an urgent project that I need you to follow up on.

201
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,799
I've emailed the relevant documents to you.

202
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,239
When you're ready,

203
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,720
let's have an online meeting with their legal representatives.

204
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,359
Okay, but I'm outside right now.

205
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,600
I probably need about half an hour.

206
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,798
Hurry up.

207
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,840
No problem.

208
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,559
I have to go home now.

209
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,558
Hello, Molina.

210
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,840
I've read all the documents.

211
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Yes.

212
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,959
Actually, Mr. Huang's main problem is still related to financing.

213
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,159
Yes.

214
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,519
The equity transfer is also a major problem for them.

215
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,559
I've compiled the key points...

216
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,679
and we can discuss them in an online meeting later.

217
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,240
Sure.

218
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,960
Five minutes is fine. No problem.

219
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,759
Okay.

220
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,440
Before I leave,

221
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,120
I have something to tell you.

222
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,879
Go ahead.

223
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,320
What's our relationship?

224
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,519
I know...

225
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,960
you won't consider marrying me for now.

226
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,119
However, we need to agree on some rules.

227
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,759
First,

228
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,600
while we're together,

229
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,399
you can't date anyone else.

230
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,119
Second,

231
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,360
you don't have to love me,

232
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,080
but you can't like someone else.

233
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,519
Lastly,

234
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,240
we should go out twice a week.

235
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,639
Is that all right?

236
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,159
Are you listening?

237
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,918
I'm sorry. It's a client's message.

238
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,816
- I have to reply. - I'm confessing my love to you.

239
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,399
Can you listen to me seriously?

240
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,518
Luo Ma, is your world just about love?

241
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,639
Of course not.

242
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,600
But it is now, Han Su.

243
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,799
I wish I could take my heart out and show it to you,

244
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,320
but your attitude has shattered it into pieces.

245
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,200
After you shattered it last time,

246
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,119
I quietly set it aside and began to heal.

247
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,279
But this time,

248
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,759
I didn't expect it to shatter so fast.

249
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,840
I'm running out of time.

250
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:52,799
You can go back first.

252
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Hello?

253
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,519
Can you hear me?

254
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,679
Hi, Sophie. I can hear you.

255
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,120
Hello?

256
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,038
Let's wait for a while.

257
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,119
Mr. Huang isn't online yet.

258
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,720
Okay, no problem.

259
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,559
(I’m leaving.)

260
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,798
Hello, Mr. Huang. It has been a while.

261
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,169
Let me introduce you.

262
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,000
This is our law firm's Ms. Han Su.

263
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,039
She will be in charge of this project.

264
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,598
Good afternoon, Mr. Huang and everyone.

265
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,679
I'm Han Su from Yingtian Law Firm.

266
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,920
You can call me Sophie.

267
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,039
Hello, Han Su.

268
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,200
Are you busy?

269
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,650
I want to ask you a question.

270
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,079
Go ahead.

271
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,039
When you see a guy...

272
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,359
standing in front of you...

273
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,759
with red eyes,

274
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,319
at that moment,

275
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,170
all you want to do is wipe away his tears.

276
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,039
What kind of emotion is that?

277
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,519
It's maternal love.

278
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,920
Okay.

279
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,559
You're talking about Luo Ma, right?

280
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,720
I hurt him today.

281
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,319
I don't know...

282
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,960
if I should tell you this.

283
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,480
Go ahead.

284
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,920
Luo Ma is not suitable for you.

285
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,359
To put it simply,

286
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,720
dating right now isn't part of your plan.

287
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:23,200
What you feel for him is just compassion and guilt,

288
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:24,799
not romantic feelings.

289
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,039
There's no shame in admitting that.

290
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,440
It's better for both of you...

291
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,040
if you just say it directly.

292
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,799
Wouldn't that hurt him?

293
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,839
You don't have to take responsibility for his feelings.

294
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,680
You're right.

295
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,890
Think about it yourself.

296
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:54,920
I'm hanging up.

297
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,960
Good night.

298
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,079
Ms. Zeng.

299
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,119
Do you want to try it?

300
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,480
This is my favorite mochi.

301
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,319
Thank you.

302
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
It's good.

303
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:54,319
Right?

304
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,319
Has the court made its decision yet?

305
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,359
Soon.

306
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,359
You'll win, right?

307
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,079
Actually, I don't care anymore.

308
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,960
I did what I wanted to do,

309
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,079
so I can...

310
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,599
You can let it go.

311
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,799
By the way,

312
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,039
Zhou Bin left Jiangzhou.

313
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,240
He probably went to Shenzhen.

314
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,279
You've really managed...

315
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,216
to ensure he has no foothold in Jiangzhou.

316
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,839
He'll make a comeback.

317
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,519
Because he only lives for himself.

318
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,200
No matter what he does in the future,

319
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,240
it has nothing to do with us.

320
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,359
Let's celebrate together.

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,480
After all, we got rid of that jerk.

322
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,000
Together?

323
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,200
Isn't this my portfolio...

324
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,680
from when I applied for the Jiaoying advertisement?

325
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,279
I know.

326
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:15,920
They want you.

327
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Our group will acquire this company soon,

328
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,599
so we'll be working together.

329
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,039
I just want to get a job based on my own abilities.

330
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,680
- I hope you don't... - I value your abilities.

331
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,880
Even if we never met,

332
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,680
I'd say the same thing.

333
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Thank you.

334
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,039
Do you want to go to Shanghai?

335
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,519
For work purposes?

336
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,759
The group wants to set up a branch there.

337
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,680
I want you to go there and be the person in charge.

338
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,359
I hope...

339
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,279
we can be not only the best partners,

340
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,440
but also friends moving forward.

341
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,599
It was the previous article on love tips...

342
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,559
that brought me a lot of followers...

343
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,199
and many people said...

344
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,760
they switched from hating to liking me.

345
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,159
Given your update frequency and lack of promotion,

346
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,440
having over 10,000 followers is quite impressive.

347
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,118
I bought 2,000 of them.

348
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,879
(Interviewer)

349
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,240
One holiday,

350
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,119
I didn't know what to gift myself,

351
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,520
so I bought 2,000 followers as a present for myself.

352
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:02,839
Just to boost my numbers.

353
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,720
I see. I get it.

354
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,680
Lately, we've been doing a topic on independent women's freedom.

355
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,200
I'd like to hear your opinion.

356
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Let me think about it.

357
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,759
I think...

358
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,559
not all women...

359
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,599
are born to be independent.

360
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Okay.

361
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:34,759
I'll get going then.

362
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,400
Their independence...

363
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,440
is forced.

364
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,519
However,

365
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,559
only when you truly achieve independence...

366
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,359
can you enjoy the freedom that comes with it.

367
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,519
This kind of freedom isn't about being carefree...

368
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,919
nor is it about doing whatever you want.

369
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,760
It certainly isn't about being pampered.

370
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,400
It's about having a grounded sense of control over your life.

371
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,039
This groundedness provides a feeling of tranquility,

372
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,078
empowerment,

373
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,160
and enthusiasm.

374
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:34,480
(Shop for rent)

375
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,879
(Transferred 30000.00 yuan.)

376
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,079
(Sorry, I’ve disappointed you.)

377
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,160
It smells so good.

378
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,279
Did your dad make all this?

379
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
That's amazing.

380
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,799
It's amazing.

381
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
Do your parents still need a daughter?

382
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,359
When are our parents leaving?

383
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,599
Since when did they become your parents?

384
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,679
They're leaving tomorrow morning.

385
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,136
They said they're going on a honeymoon.

386
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,240
That's so nice.

387
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,039
I'm envious.

388
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
By the way,

389
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,480
there's something...

390
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,880
I want to officially announce.

391
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,376
I'm going to New York next month for advanced studies.

392
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,640
Did you see that?

393
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,559
The whole world can't stop Han Su from wanting to improve herself.

394
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,799
You're going to Shanghai...

395
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,720
and she's going to New York.

396
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,279
Fine. Leave me here alone.

397
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,680
Didn't you find a job?

398
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Focus on your work.

399
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:01,321
That's more important than anything.

400
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,440
Did you get an offer?

401
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,640
I interviewed with three media companies...

402
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,319
and all of them accepted me.

403
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,758
One of them...

404
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,559
had my favorite painting hanging on the wall.

405
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,118
I chose that one.

406
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,640
That's too random.

407
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,640
It's better than being indecisive.

408
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,055
There will always be something...

409
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,759
that serves as a trigger for your actions.

410
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,519
That painting really brought me good luck.

411
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,720
What good luck?

412
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,039
My article...

413
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,640
reached over 100,000 views...

414
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,079
for the first time!

415
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,680
Plus, I received an additional bonus.

416
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,480
- Not bad. - This is the first time...

417
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,759
I've earned money...

418
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,119
doing something I love.

419
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,720
Impressive, our queen of 100,000 reads.

420
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,200
So when's your next article coming out?

421
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,799
Don't mention it.

422
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,839
I spent the entire night thinking...

423
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,440
and I only managed to write two lines.

424
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,759
A rising star in the literary world...

425
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,319
is about to fall.

426
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Why did you say so?

427
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:09,239
You're just getting started.

428
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,318
Show us.

429
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,679
We'll help you come up with ideas.

430
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,160
Let's talk after dinner.

431
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,759
I can eat and read at the same time.

432
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,559
Be a human, okay?

433
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,880
- Okay. I'll shut up. - Be a human, okay?

434
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Eat more then.

435
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,039
Does anyone want this meatball?

436
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,358
You can have it.

437
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,798
We know you like it.

438
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,039
You can have it, okay?

439
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,799
Your parents are so nice.

440
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,279
Ask them to stay longer.

441
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,559
They can go on a honeymoon anytime.

442
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,599
"For a person,"

443
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,119
"for a childhood obsession,"

444
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,920
"or for all sorts of strange reasons,"

445
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:44,160
"we will have a dream."

446
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:48,240
"The journey of pursuing that dream..."

447
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,599
"is like opening a mystery box."

448
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,519
Even though we hold back emotionally,

449
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,119
time passes by like water.

450
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,599
We don't know...

451
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,839
when our dreams will come true,

452
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,680
but that doesn't mean...

453
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,839
the time...

454
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,559
is wasted.

455
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,400
The meaning of life...

456
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,119
lies in understanding life,

457
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,880
both the good...

458
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,920
and the bad,

459
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,640
without intentionally defining what is good or bad.

460
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,720
When one has this realization,

461
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,800
that's when he or she has truly grown up.

462
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:33,359
The next 10 or 20 years...

463
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,319
might be even tougher,

464
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,240
but we shouldn't lose our drive to face challenges.

465
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,400
We shouldn't be tamed...

466
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,680
into passively accepting reality...

467
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,119
or slip into that gentle night.

468
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,039
I once...

469
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,240
loved blindly out of fear of loneliness...

470
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,319
and held back from love...

471
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,920
because I feared getting hurt.

472
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,519
When you realize your abilities...

473
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,439
don't match your desires,

474
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,599
what can you do?

475
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,359
You can only work hard...

476
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,920
and wait patiently.

477
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,799
Trust me.

478
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,200
Money will come.

479
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,799
So will love.

480
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,440
What really matters...

481
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:24,079
is to be someone who can get easily moved...

482
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,119
and when that happens,

483
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,480
you revive...

484
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,000
with full energy.

485
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,839
That's the kind of person I like to be.

486
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,200
- Good morning. - Good morning.

487
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,798
Sir, the size of the ceiling light in the entryway...

488
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,880
doesn't seem quite right.

489
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,079
Measure it for me later.

490
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,480
All right. I'll measure it again.

491
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,640
I'll leave it to you.

492
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,519
Coming.

493
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,278
Hello.

494
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,239
I just moved in next door.

495
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,358
Just call me Bei.

496
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,039
Hello, I'm He Zhi Nan.

497
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,720
It just so happens our layout is also north-south facing.

498
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,720
What a coincidence.

499
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,838
My house will be under renovation for the next few months...

500
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,839
and it might disturb you,

501
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,920
so I'm really sorry.

502
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,119
I bought some fruit for you as a small gesture.

503
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Thank you.

504
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:05,400
You're welcome.

505
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:07,200
Well, are you a local?

506
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,199
Me too.

507
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,000
Let's add each other on WeChat.

508
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,329
I'll scan your QR.

509
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,439
You can add my official account.

510
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,360
Han Han.

511
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:31,879
You have to remember this moment.

512
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,159
What's wrong?

513
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,808
I just witnessed...

514
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,609
the shortest lifespan of a potential romance.

515
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:38,519
How short?

516
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:39,769
About 10 seconds.

517
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,079
I killed it before it even had a chance to bloom.

518
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:48,598
However, I lost a guy and gained a follower.

519
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,599
Not bad, right?

520
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
How about this?

521
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,856
I'll send you the location...

522
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,120
and you can go there tonight...

523
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,880
to heal your wounded heart.

524
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
Really?

525
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Of course.

526
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,439
I won't cook then.

527
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,480
Don't cook.

528
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:07,809
I'll wait for your text.

529
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,679
Where is Sun Han Han?

530
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:57,679
You scoundrel!

531
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Why did you come back?

532
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,920
Why did you come back?

533
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,239
You scoundrel!

534
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:02,519
Where did you go?

535
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:03,769
You're shameless!

536
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,960
Why did you come back?

537
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,199
I went back to my hometown.

538
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,158
- Stop it. I was wrong. - Who cares?

539
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,328
- Who cares? - I was wrong.

540
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:10,329
Go die.

541
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,078
I came back to apologize to you.

542
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,359
I was wrong. I shouldn't have blocked you.

543
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,239
Who wants to talk to you?

544
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,559
I got a new job. Do you know?

545
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,879
I'm about to start making money and pay back what I owe.

546
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,159
Are you really giving up on Toys Universe?

547
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,769
From the age of 20 to 29,

548
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,960
I was doing what I loved every single day.

549
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,119
I had friends and hope.

550
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,329
It was hard work but very rewarding.

551
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,808
I dedicated the best years of my life...

552
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:37,809
to my dream.

553
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:41,039
It wasn't the easiest path,

554
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,769
but it was worth it.

555
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,679
Maybe failure is the norm in life.

556
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,920
All this time, I've been thinking to myself.

557
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:51,289
I'm thinking...

558
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,719
that I have to face my failure honestly...

559
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
and learn to give up.

560
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,159
After giving up,

561
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,720
how can I make peace with myself?

562
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,199
I've thought it through.

563
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,119
I can't leave Jiangzhou.

564
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:06,079
Why?

565
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,159
Because of you.

566
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:14,809
He Zhi Nan.

567
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,960
Despite your foolishness,

568
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,239
there are times when you shine like the sun.

569
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:26,159
Without realizing it,

570
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:29,239
you bring light...

571
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,360
to my dark world.

572
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,959
Cut the crap.

573
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,000
What exactly do you mean?

574
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,559
If one day, I start a business...

575
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,559
and I fail,

576
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,119
will you invest in my life?

577
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,440
Will you?

578
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:48,440
What's wrong? Why the long face?

579
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,518
Let's first send Han Su to the international terminal...

580
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,479
and then you can drop me off at the domestic one, okay?

581
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,880
Are you even human?

582
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,288
In one day,

583
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:59,159
I have to send off two best friends.

584
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,809
Who would be happy about that?

585
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,840
Don't laugh. Hold it in.

586
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,960
I know you yearn for the outside world.

587
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:11,809
But I can't bear to leave you either.

588
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,440
Then why are you laughing?

589
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,718
Because I've been brooding.

590
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,239
I realized I really couldn't cry.

591
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,039
Remember to bring me a gift.

592
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,920
Are they college students?

593
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,159
They are so young.

594
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:53,400
They are really young.

595
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,678
I'm so envious.

596
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,289
Every time I think about being 26,

597
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,639
I get a little scared.

598
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:00,399
There's nothing to be envious of.

599
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,360
Besides, we haven't wasted a single second of our prime time.

600
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,559
That's right.

601
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:08,329
Aren't we just halfway there?

602
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,840
Not you. You're already there.

603
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,768
- Let's go. - Let's go.

604
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:15,840
Why are you so happy?

605
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:17,960
What else can I do?

606
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,519
Why do you still look sad?

607
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,198
I'm not going then. I won't see you off.

608
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,199
You should go.

609
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,559
- No. - No.

610
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,960
- Let's go. - I'm not going.

611
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,289
I'm not going.

612
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:31,480
Hey, you two.

613
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,079
He Zhi Nan.

614
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,639
You're up so early.

615
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,599
I'm going to work.

616
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:02,719
What do you think?

617
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,480
Does your boyfriend look handsome in a suit?

618
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,840
I still think...

619
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,079
your previous carefree style was cooler.

620
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,769
I think that's cooler too.

621
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:16,329
Who says you have to be a worker for life?

622
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:17,809
Maybe one day,

623
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,329
I'll quit and start my own business.

624
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,329
Whether or not I'll invest in it is still uncertain.

625
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,559
