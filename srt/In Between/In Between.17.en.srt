1
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,679
(In Between)

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 17)

3
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,878
(Trendy gentleman)

4
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,959
(Muscular fitness guy)

5
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,758
(Business elite)

6
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,199
(IT tech guy)

7
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,759
Sun Han Han.

8
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,718
What is this?

9
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,560
Is this how you do
an advertisement proposal?

10
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,359
And take a look at these.

11
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,840
What are you doing?

12
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,479
Is this how you handle your job?

13
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,560
I need this and these today.

14
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,039
A little to the left.

15
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,359
Don't rush to drop the hook.

16
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
Try moving
the joystick in all directions.

17
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,079
Up, down, left, and right.

18
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,879
That will reset it
to its factory settings.

19
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,359
The grip will then be
at its strongest.

20
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,400
Try it again.

21
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,199
Ms. Sun, where are you?

22
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,919
Ms. Sun.

23
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,599
Are you Andy?

24
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,279
I told you.

25
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,638
I have a common face.

26
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,680
You wouldn't remember,

27
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,318
but you insisted on trying
to prove a point.

28
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,479
See? I knew it.

29
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,199
I'm face-blind.

30
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,170
I'm seriously impressed...

31
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,679
that you can date someone...

32
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,610
whose face you can't even remember.

33
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,398
If I add someone on WeChat,

34
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,479
they're definitely not bad-looking.

35
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,609
I do have some standards.

36
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,610
Okay.

37
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:26,800
I'll take that as a compliment.

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,920
To thank you for your kindness,

39
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,120
I've prepared a gift for you.

40
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,319
These are what you just...

41
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,729
Actually, playing claw machines...

42
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,360
also comes down
to strategy and technique.

43
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,839
It's all about collecting tips...

44
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,879
and trying them out.

45
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,319
If once isn't enough, try again.

46
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,959
To put it simply,

47
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,759
play more.

48
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Thank you.

49
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,438
- Let's get our tickets.
- Let's go.

50
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,610
Let me test you again.

51
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,839
Do you remember when we
added each other on WeChat?

52
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,680
Last time on the advertising forum.

53
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,050
Pretty girls are indeed forgetful.

54
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,479
I remember
when I added you on WeChat,

55
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,609
I couldn't sleep for days.

56
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,610
But you seem
to have forgotten all of it.

57
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,920
Then tell me.
What was the situation like?

58
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,079
Half a year ago,

59
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,800
at a dinner gathering...

60
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,480
with Zhou Bin,
the lawyer, in Hangzhou.

61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,360
That day, you appeared in
the private room out of nowhere...

62
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,519
and it was like
a ray of light broke through.

63
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,160
I sat right across from you.

64
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,759
To be honest, I really wanted
to get your attention.

65
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,039
But in the end, I failed.

66
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,318
Well, it's not your fault.

67
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,838
All of us young lawyers
at that table...

68
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,600
were wearing
pretty much the same suits.

69
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,119
If it weren't for my colleagues...

70
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,160
who shamelessly insisted on
adding you on WeChat,

71
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,360
I wouldn't have known
how to approach you myself.

72
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,959
Are you familiar with Mr. Zhou?

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,079
I know him,

74
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,040
but he doesn't know me.

75
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,560
What a small world.

76
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,639
That's right.

77
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,839
That's why I always say,

78
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,639
as long as I can add someone
on WeChat,

79
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,079
no matter what, there will always be
a chance in the end.

80
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,120
It's about to start. Let's go in.

81
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Ms. Sun.

82
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Are you close with Mr. Zhou?

83
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,399
Our company has
some business dealings with him.

84
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,559
To him, I'm probably
just as insignificant as you.

85
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,919
Just a small, invisible presence.

86
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,518
You must be kidding me.

87
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,999
It's fine
if he thinks I'm invisible,

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,318
but if he thinks you're invisible,

89
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,759
then he must be blind.

90
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,439
Which one is better?

91
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,600
For these two pieces,
I'll pick this one.

92
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,959
It's more appropriate
for a charity event.

93
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,240
I hate this kind of dress...

94
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,160
and business networking the most.

95
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,560
Just the thought makes me nervous.

96
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,120
Gao Peng used to...

97
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,079
avoid these social events
just like I did,

98
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,120
but this time,
he's taking it very seriously.

99
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,199
He's preparing while complaining...

100
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,759
and he wants me to get acquainted
with the guest list.

101
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,199
On top of that,

102
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,839
he has even got jokes ready
for when the conversation dies down.

103
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,680
Honestly, it makes me feel
a bit sympathetic.

104
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,879
Do you know that
these people on the list...

105
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,160
are those that many
would be eager to meet?

106
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,399
I don't need to do business.

107
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,680
Actually, socializing...

108
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,800
is a part of
a businessperson's life.

109
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,079
This could also be seen as...

110
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,560
Gao Peng's way
of showing his drive for progress.

111
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,439
Would that make you feel better?

112
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,879
I understand.

113
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,519
He's a businessman.

114
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,079
However,

115
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,319
I still miss the old Gao Peng.

116
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,079
What do you think?

117
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,399
I think the previous one
looked better.

118
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,319
Han Su.

119
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,040
Will you change yourself...

120
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,480
for the one you love?

121
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,079
Sometimes,

122
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,199
change isn't always a bad thing.

123
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,399
I've tried my best,

124
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,920
but some things...

125
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,480
just can't be changed.

126
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,240
Do you want to try this on?

127
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,450
It looks nice.

128
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,600
I have an idea.

129
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,039
What is it?

130
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,360
You can be Gao Peng's partner.

131
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,999
Are you crazy?

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If I stand next to him,

133
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,398
others will think
I'm his girlfriend.

134
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,840
Who cares what others say?

135
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,159
You, Han Su, have to be
the youngest senior partner.

136
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,960
Getting to know some connections...

137
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,639
will benefit you.

138
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Plus,

139
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,210
there's one more invitation,

140
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,919
so I can enjoy the food and drinks.

141
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,759
We both get what we want.

142
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,519
I'll give your face
a good treatment in a bit...

143
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,759
to moisturize and brighten it up.

144
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,919
It'll definitely be fine.

145
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,480
Okay.

146
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,329
I think Zhi Nan is here.

147
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,399
Right?

148
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,239
I'll introduce you...

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,158
to a few senior figures
in the industry...

150
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,209
so you can get to know each other.

151
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,210
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

152
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,329
If you can't drink tonight,
just let me know.

153
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,398
I'm fine.

154
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,450
Thank you.

155
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,759
- Mr. Zhou, it has been a while.
- Hello.

156
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,090
- It has been a while.
- Eat and drink well.

157
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,120
Thank you.

158
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,278
- Mr. Ren, it has been a while.
- Hello. It has been a while.

159
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,330
Hi.

160
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,450
Mr. Li.

161
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,839
It has been a while.

162
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,919
Mr. Gao.

163
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,399
It has been a while.

164
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,639
Your girlfriend is very pretty.

165
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,720
Let me introduce you.
This is Han Su. She's a lawyer.

166
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,450
A lawyer?

167
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,159
Young and promising.

168
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,519
She's working on our company's IPO.

169
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,399
Just call me Sophie.

170
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,519
- Sophie.
- Okay.

171
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,758
Let's work together in the future.

172
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:13,839
- Sure.
- Let's talk later.

173
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,919
Okay.

174
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,519
Talk to you later.

175
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,600
Talk to you again.

176
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,639
Talk to you again.

177
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,879
What did you get?

178
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,359
You're so pretty tonight.

179
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,449
You're so pretty.

180
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,600
Hi.

181
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,450
I'll go say hi. You guys talk.

182
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,919
- Okay.
- Bye.

183
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,449
Excuse me.

184
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,639
Hi.

185
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,879
Hi.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,638
- Molina.
- Hi, Mr. Gao.

187
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,719
Hi.

188
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,359
- This is...
- Let me introduce you.

189
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,559
This is He Zhi Nan.

190
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,840
She's Mr. Gao's girlfriend.

191
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,330
This is the head
of my law firm in Hong Kong,

192
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,399
Molina Hu.

193
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

194
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,440
Can I borrow Sophie for a bit?

195
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,519
I want to introduce you to someone.

196
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,599
- Sure.
- Excuse me.

197
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,639
Go ahead.

198
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,720
See you later.

199
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,679
I think you and Mr. Gao
are a good match.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,080
Molina.

201
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,239
By the way,
who are you introducing me to?

202
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,279
Mr. Sun.

203
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,519
Sun Xu?

204
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,799
Yes. I told him about you.

205
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,639
I don't think it's appropriate
for tonight's occasion.

206
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,678
This is the perfect occasion.

207
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,720
Let's go.

208
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,519
He's sitting over there.

209
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,399
If there's a possibility,

210
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,919
I'm still fighting for a chance
to go to Hong Kong.

211
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,279
Is there a personal reason?

212
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,759
Ever since I found out
he's in Hong Kong,

213
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,960
everything I've done
is to get close to him.

214
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,840
I just want
to achieve something great.

215
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,919
Then I'll stand...

216
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,879
in front of him...

217
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,360
with pride.

218
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,399
I'm curious how he will react.

219
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
- Molina.
- It has been a while.

220
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,120
Do you remember
the new employee I told you about?

221
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,159
I'd like to introduce you
to each other.

222
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,759
Maybe she went to the restroom.

223
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Sorry about that.

224
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,960
Mrs. Sun, it has been a while.

225
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,759
Working 18 hours a day?

226
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,519
That's terrifying.

227
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,480
Once we get to the printing phase,

228
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,159
I won't have time to be with you.

229
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,080
It's okay. Work comes first.

230
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,840
Actually,
I can go back to Jiangzhou.

231
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,158
That sounds good.

232
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,399
You can visit your parents then.

233
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:28,840
Mr. Gao.

234
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,119
Mr. Pan, it has been a while.

235
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,439
It has been a while.

236
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,518
What have you been up to?

237
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,600
I'm busy with the IPO.

238
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,799
You have dark circles
under your eyes.

239
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Don't drink too much.

240
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,720
I'm going over there.

241
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,799
I'm going to look for Han Su.

242
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,279
Han Su.

243
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,919
What's wrong?

244
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Nothing.

245
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,279
What do you mean by that?

246
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,600
What's wrong?

247
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
I...

248
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,600
I saw...

249
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,840
my dad just now.

250
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,320
Did you talk to him?

251
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,399
Ms. Hu wanted
to introduce me to him,

252
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,679
but I ran away.

253
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,159
What are you doing?

254
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,919
I'm keeping you company.

255
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,519
I look quite terrible, right?

256
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,159
I...

257
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,000
Since I was 16,

258
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,679
I've set a goal for myself.

259
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,360
I'm going to work hard
to get close to him.

260
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:05,440
However, I didn't expect
that the way to get close to him...

261
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,960
to be so long.

262
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,440
It's too hard.

263
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,679
The photo you saw at my house,

264
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,000
I've looked at it...

265
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,638
thousands of times.

266
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,720
I look at it every day.

267
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,240
I thought I'd be pretty calm
when I saw him.

268
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,679
I thought so.

269
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,279
Do you still hate him?

270
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,960
I...

271
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,440
I...

272
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,679
I've practised the moment...

273
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,399
of meeting him in my mind...

274
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,559
countless times.

275
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,440
I've planned it all out
that I want...

276
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,759
I want to stand
in front of him confidently...

277
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
and...

278
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,960
And with my head...

279
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,039
held high...

280
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:19,410
because I believe
I'm doing pretty well right now.

281
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,239
I want to ask him,

282
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,650
"Do you regret it?"

283
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,559
"Have you ever regretted it?"

284
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,759
I want him...

285
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,920
to regret it to the core.

286
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,960
However,

287
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,319
I just saw him...

288
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,559
and his wife...

289
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,599
sitting nearby...

290
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,720
and they look really happy.

291
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,039
His wife must be
quite a gentle person.

292
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,039
At that moment,
I didn't know what I was doing.

293
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,079
I think I've been very childish...

294
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
for the past 10 years.

295
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,410
So I...

296
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,279
I ran away.

297
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,720
Thank you.

298
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,759
- Thank you.
- Watch your head.

299
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,519
Take us back
to Han Su's house first.

300
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,759
What's wrong with her?

301
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,799
Don't ask.

302
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,890
I'm not going home tonight.

303
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,799
Let's go.

304
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,440
Good morning.

305
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,279
You're awake.

306
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,599
With all that noise,
how could I not be awake?

307
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,559
You know
your juicer is noisy, right?

308
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,200
Thank you.

309
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,240
Why did you order so much?

310
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,719
After a hangover,

311
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,919
one usually loses his appetite.

312
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,358
I didn't know what you like,

313
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,720
so I ordered some of everything.

314
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
These are rice noodle rolls.

315
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,920
Those are buns.

316
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,039
These are rice cakes and egg tarts.

317
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,720
These are shrimp dumplings.

318
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,680
These two are sweet.

319
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,440
Some people like them sweet
after they drink.

320
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,170
And this medicine.

321
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,119
You probably
caught a cold last night.

322
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,599
Remember to take it.

323
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,039
It's delicious.

324
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,799
It's fresh.

325
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,839
Thank you.

326
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,479
How is it?

327
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,200
I haven't brushed my teeth.

328
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,759
Come in.

329
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,720
Mr. Gao, Sophie is here to see you.

330
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,440
Thank you.

331
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
Have a seat.

332
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,239
I'm really sorry.

333
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,400
I lost my composure a bit
at the banquet.

334
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,799
You women are amazing.

335
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,959
I always thought
that you and He Zhi Nan...

336
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,078
weren't on the same wavelength...

337
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,319
and wouldn't get along,

338
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,759
but now,

339
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,799
the whole company knows
that you two are best friends.

340
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,440
To be honest,

341
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,119
I haven't met someone...

342
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,160
as straightforward, warm,
and courageous as her...

343
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,680
in a long time.

344
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,079
She's amazing.

345
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,440
You're quite lucky.

346
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,799
Make sure you cherish her.

347
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,319
Yes.

348
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,440
I know.

349
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,759
Is there a problem?

350
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,519
Perhaps the biggest problem
between us...

351
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,079
is that there doesn't seem
to be any problem.

352
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,599
Ms. He, you have a guest.

353
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,240
Don't worry.

354
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,798
I'm not here for Gao Peng.

355
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,039
I'm here for you.

356
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:17,919
Come in.

357
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
It's okay.

358
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,079
We don't have
that much to talk about.

359
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,159
Had my cousin
not told me yesterday...

360
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,279
that you've gotten close to Han Su,

361
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,599
I wouldn't have come to remind you.

362
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,240
What do you mean?

363
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,400
I admit...

364
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,039
I had a thing for Gao Peng.

365
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,519
I have always been upfront about it.

366
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,640
Han Su has always
been helping me out.

367
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,039
To be honest,

368
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,720
I never even
considered you a threat.

369
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,160
My real rival is Han Su.

370
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,160
Su Su.

371
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,559
Are you familiar with this name?

372
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,519
Yi Peng, you have a message.

373
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,159
(Incoming call, Su Su)

374
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,240
I know you.

375
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,000
Su Su.

376
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,960
Su Su explained to me...

377
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,039
why she hates you.

378
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Han Su.

379
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,279
You're from a famous university.

380
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,359
Then your ex-boyfriend must be
from the same university too, right?

381
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,279
He's from a famous university too.

382
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
The three of you
might even know each other.

383
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:43,079
Why did you break up?

384
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,200
When I came to Hong Kong,

385
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,559
he had someone else.

386
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,240
That guy actually has a girlfriend.

387
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,400
He broke up with her...

388
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,038
to pursue me.

389
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,039
Stop it.

390
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,920
(Huanking Business Building)

391
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,039
Who are you looking for?

392
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,199
I'm looking for Han Su.

393
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,240
Sophie?

394
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,518
Sophie is out for work.

395
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,599
Do you need her for something?

396
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,519
Thank you.

397
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,000
Zhi Nan.

398
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,720
Why are you here?

399
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,039
I'd like to have a word with you.

400
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,519
What's wrong?

401
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,160
Did you have a fight with Gao Peng?

402
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,759
Zhi Nan.

403
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,519
Your ex-boyfriend is Qu Yi Peng.

404
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,759
You're Su Su.

405
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,240
You knew who I was
before I came to Hong Kong.

406
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,558
Zhi Nan.

407
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,680
When did you...

408
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,319
and how did you find out
about me and Qu Yi Peng?

409
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,119
The day Alex
introduced me to Gao Peng.

410
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,640
Before you came to Hong Kong.

411
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,159
This is Qu Yi Peng's
Weibo account, right?

412
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,359
(Yi Loves Zhi Nan)

413
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,078
When Gao Peng and I first met,

414
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,000
he accidentally
discovered this account.

415
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,838
Actually,

416
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,799
I already knew your name...

417
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,240
when I went to Jiangzhou
to get my things.

418
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,319
Then you...

419
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,640
You and Gao Peng teamed up...

420
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,960
to make a fool of me...

421
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,959
on my first day in Hong Kong.

422
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,119
Was that your way of punishing me?

423
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,798
No.

424
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,960
Han Su, did you approach me
just to get back at me?

425
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:41,920
I...

426
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,240
No. Actually...

427
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,279
Actually, at first...

428
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,359
At first, I wanted
to get back at you.

429
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,720
I admit it.

430
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,959
I did want to get back at you.

431
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,160
However, later...

432
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,799
I really didn't.

433
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,639
That day when you were at my place,
I wanted to explain things to you.

434
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,799
I wanted to tell you...

435
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,440
I wanted to tell you the truth,

436
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,359
but I couldn't bring myself
to say it.

437
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,640
Zhi Nan.

438
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,519
I'm sorry, Zhi Nan.

439
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:14,079
The past doesn't matter.

440
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,839
We're good friends now.

441
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,759
Zhi Nan.

442
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,799
Good friends?

443
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,359
Good friends.

444
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,160
Han Su, I'm telling you.

445
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,399
I didn't seduce Qu Yi Peng.

446
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,519
He pursued me.

447
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,559
Also,

448
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,359
I don't want...

449
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,200
to see you again.

450
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,519
Miss, this is a yearly pass.

451
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,640
It can't be refunded.

452
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,240
Why can't it be refunded?

453
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,319
Yearly passes, multi-use passes,
and monthly passes...

454
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,720
are considered prepaid cards.

455
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,720
Users can definitely get refunds
if they haven't used any services.

456
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,640
The gym contract isn't
a mandatory contract either.

457
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,959
Businesses have an obligation...

458
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,039
to provide services
for refunds and exchanges.

459
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,119
If they refuse,

460
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,599
we can opt to sue.

461
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,160
By the way, I'm a lawyer.

462
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,400
Bring a lawyer just to get a refund?

463
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,279
Hold on.

464
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
Thank you.

465
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,400
Do lawyers
have nothing better to do?

466
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,920
You've been
following me all morning.

467
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,319
Listen to yourself.

468
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,200
Things should have
their priorities, right?

469
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,279
Why do you want to cancel your card?

470
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,240
Well, I can't afford
such an expensive yearly pass.

471
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,400
I can't just waste it
on someone who isn't worth it.

472
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,480
It's mealtime.
Let's go eat together.

473
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,559
I can't.

474
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,799
I need to return
to the office for overtime.

475
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,720
Once I'm done with this project,

476
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:36,799
I can go on vacation.

477
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,480
That's great.

478
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,400
I'm going to Hong Kong on Monday.

479
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,720
You're on leave too.

480
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:42,839
Let's go together.

481
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,039
Didn't you say you have
a friend in Hong Kong...

482
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,960
who's feeling down
and you want to accompany her?

483
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,639
I happen to have some points,

484
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,480
so I can help you
get a flight for free.

485
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,400
I think it's better
to make things clear now.

486
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,480
Thank you for liking me,

487
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:07,160
but you're not my type.

488
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,119
You don't have to waste
your time on me.

489
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,240
I tend to speak quite frankly,

490
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,598
which is better
than us continuing...

491
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,319
this uncertain relationship.

492
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,079
It's fine.

493
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,319
You don't have to feel pressured.

494
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,879
We can be friends...

495
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
and get to know each other slowly.

496
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,480
We can only be friends
if we get to know each other.

497
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,599
I'm sure of it.

498
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
Besides, there are
different kinds of friends.

499
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,960
Just think of me...

500
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,799
as a distant friend.

501
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,319
All right.

502
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,118
Most of the cases...

503
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,239
we were entrusted with
in the last quarter...

504
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,559
focused on...

505
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,759
the termination
of entertainment agency contracts.

506
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,558
These types of contracts
typically include...

507
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,559
high penalty fees for breaches.

508
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,279
In disputes
regarding such contracts,

509
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,799
the main point of contention
usually revolves around...

510
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,038
whether the stipulated penalty fees
should be upheld.

511
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,118
Moving on,

512
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,479
if an agent or agency...

513
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,758
wants to receive
the agreed compensation,

514
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,319
they should make every effort
to provide evidence...

515
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,118
of their contributions
to the artist...

516
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,598
and the profits
they should have earned...

517
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,880
from fulfilling
the contract as intended.

518
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,640
As for the artists,

519
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,759
if they wish to exempt themselves
from the stipulated compensation,

520
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,799
it would be advantageous
for them to demonstrate...

521
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,960
that it was due to the agent
or agency's failure...

522
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,359
to fulfil
their contractual duties...

523
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,719
or their passive performance
of obligations...

524
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,318
that resulted in the contract's
inability to be executed.

525
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,839
Thus constituting a breach...

526
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,319
or a serious breach of contract.

527
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,440
Mr. Zhou.

528
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,920
Texting with your girlfriend?

529
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,599
We're in a meeting.

530
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,240
Turn it off.

531
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:01,880
- Let's continue.
- Okay.

532
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,959
If the agent or agency...

533
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,119
wants to obtain
the stipulated compensation,

534
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,400
they should do their best
to present evidence.

535
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,160
Let's look at this case.

536
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,118
The summary indicates that...

537
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,879
the evaluation of the contract's
content and effectiveness...

538
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,759
begins with defining
the nature of the contract.

539
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,279
There are more
and more people who do this.

540
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,559
As long as you can endure it.

541
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,399
I used to think
that having children...

542
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,439
was simply a matter
of wanting to or not.

543
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,160
I never thought of
the question of capability.

544
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:24,000
So you must find that quite unusual.

545
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,799
My aunt's hospital requires...

546
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,839
an appointment for this procedure.

547
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,720
Even Ms. Zeng
from our headquarters...

548
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,598
has asked me to book
an appointment with a specialist.

549
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,640
Ms. Zeng?

550
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,240
Does she also do IVF?

551
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,559
I've seen photos
of the egg retrieval needle online.

552
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,839
It's thin, long, and very sharp.

553
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,200
Just like the knitting needles
we used when we were kids.

554
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:56,839
Han Han.

555
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,960
Let me take you home.

556
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,079
It's okay. My car will be here soon.

557
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Han Han.

558
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,480
I went to the gym today...

559
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,278
and saw you chatting with someone.

560
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,360
Who was it?

561
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,599
What's wrong with you?

562
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,329
What right do you have
to ask me that?

563
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,439
Love?

564
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,479
Promises?

565
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,558
It's all nonsense.

566
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,599
I finally get it now.

567
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,289
On the surface, we remarried.

568
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,039
But behind my back,
she's messing with my finance team.

569
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,519
It's like pulling
the rug out from under me...

570
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,289
and treating me like a fool.

571
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,078
I'll divorce her sooner or later.

572
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,158
Don't worry. Wait for me.

573
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,199
Don't you have a conscience?

574
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,518
She's going through IVF for you...

575
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:31,879
and you're still thinking
about divorcing her?

576
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,479
She never discussed it with me.

577
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,808
She did it for herself.

578
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,719
How could you say she did it for me?

579
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,639
Because you're not worth it.

580
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,400
Han Han.

581
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,329
Who am I doing this for?

582
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,679
Isn't it all because of you?

583
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,919
You're disgusting.

584
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,519
I must have been blind.

585
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,559
What are you doing? Let go of me.

586
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,289
An independent woman?

587
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,920
Look at yourself.

588
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,119
Which piece
of clothing or accessory...

589
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,000
isn't something I bought for you?

590
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,480
The clothes on you,
the things in your hands,

591
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:11,479
the house you live in,

592
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,679
and the credit card you use.

593
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,920
Aren't they all gifts from me?

594
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,360
Who do you think you are?

595
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,289
Han Han.

596
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,880
I know you love me.

597
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,559
Don't you?

598
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:01,880
Sir, please stop the car.

599
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,440
Look at yourself.

600
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
Which piece
of clothing or accessory...

601
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,519
isn't something I bought for you?

602
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:43,880
The clothes on you,
the things in your hands,

603
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,960
the house you live in,

604
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,199
and the credit card you use.

605
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:51,519
Aren't they all gifts from me?

606
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,809
Who do you think you are?

607
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,718
I heard you're good at golf.

608
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,959
No, I'm just so-so.

609
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,000
You're too kind.

610
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:01,119
Let's play together one day.

611
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:02,329
No problem.

612
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,440
We should learn from each other.

613
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,119
What's your current score?

614
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:06,679
Probably around 70 to 80 strokes.

615
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:08,119
You're already at that level.

616
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
I'm really not up to par.

617
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,719
I heard you're better than me.

618
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,400
Mr. Zhou.

619
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:18,360
Wu.

620
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,039
Take Mr. Lin to the meeting room.

621
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,158
Okay. Mr. Lin, come with me.

622
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,159
- See you later.
- Okay.

623
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,239
Let's go to the meeting room.

624
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,519
Sun Han Han.

625
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,639
You didn't do anything wrong.

626
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,599
You did very well.

627
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,599
You're very brave.

628
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,440
Hello, sir.

629
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,480
Can you do me a favour?

630
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,480
Keep it up.

631
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:40,000
(Weapon)

632
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,920
There's still...

633
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,639
It's 750 now.

634
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,599
It's 750 now.

635
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,639
There's still...

636
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,079
130 left.

637
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,329
My lipstick is my weapon.

638
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
Every day,

639
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,559
I kiss the air...

640
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,000
with my gorgeous lips,

641
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,440
capturing the hearts
of every man that walks by.

642
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,400
This is my most precious lipstick.

643
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,719
Each time, it grants me good luck...

644
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:19,199
and aids me in winning over
the captives of love,

645
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,519
leaving no one unscathed.

646
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,769
Get a license and mortgage it.

647
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,769
Are you blind?

648
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:37,000
Why are you sneaking around?

649
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,360
Pay me back for my lipstick.

650
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,289
I'm sorry.

651
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:48,360
I'm copying messages.

652
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,480
I need a part-time job.

653
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,769
I didn't do it on purpose.

654
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:53,480
Part-time job?

655
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,639
Looking for a part-time job
in the restroom?

656
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:04,079
"High-paying part-time job
at the nightclub"?

657
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,920
"High-paying part-time job
at the hospital,"

658
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,199
"200,000 yuan for 10 days."

659
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,119
Do you want to do this?

660
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,000
How old are you?

661
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,360
Do you know
what kind of job this is?

662
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,999
Scram. Now!

663
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,078
Right now.

664
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,079
Don't come here again.

665
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:23,328
What about your lipstick?

666
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:24,809
Scram.

667
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,239
Go.

668
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,079
(Don't trust these.
Protect yourself)
