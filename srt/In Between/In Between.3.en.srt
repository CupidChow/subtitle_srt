(In Between)

00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,599
(Episode 3)

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,000
I think you want to say...

4
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,560
it's my existence that's a mistake.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,239
No. What do you mean?

6
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,599
Hello, Mom. What's up?

7
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,530
Ms. Han.

8
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,120
I've been calling you all day. Why didn't you pick up?

9
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,599
I was in a meeting. What's the matter?

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,240
Xiao Qu...

11
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,319
bought me a smart speaker...

12
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,039
called Tmall Genie.

13
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,000
But I don't know how to use it.

14
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,319
Teach me.

15
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,758
Isn't there a manual?

16
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,680
If you really don't know how, I'll find you a video tutorial.

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,680
If I understood the manual,

18
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,400
why would I look for you?

19
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,090
It said something...

20
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,038
About connecting Bluetooth. What's Bluetooth?

21
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,639
- Mom, I have to work overtime. - Ma'am.

22
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,719
Ma'am.

23
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,479
Su Su doesn't know either.

24
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,240
You can ask me. Yes.

25
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,680
Xiao Qu.

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,240
- You've lost weight. - Have I?

27
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,400
Well, I must be too tired lately.

28
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,878
By the way, ma'am,

29
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,879
go back to your phone's main page first.

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,000
Then find the icon for settings.

31
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,800
Did you find it?

32
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,479
Then look for Bluetooth.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,159
Yes. Then...

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,800
Then lots of options will pop up.

35
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,879
Just look for Tmall Genie.

36
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,359
Then press on it. See if you can connect to it.

37
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,599
It's okay.

39
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,759
I'm sorry too.

40
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,800
I forgot to tell you.

41
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,935
I'm going to Shanghai for a business trip tomorrow.

42
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,399
For three days.

43
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,560
Okay.

44
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,799
I'm going to Shanghai for a business trip tomorrow.

45
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,879
For three days.

46
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,680
(Four-year anniversary)

47
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,170
(Tiramisu)

48
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,438
This time, we're targeting the youth market...

49
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,519
in first-tier and quasi-first-tier cities.

50
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
In this new round of advertisements,

51
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,398
we'll mainly emphasize...

52
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,439
the product's appearance and social attributes.

53
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,438
How do we emphasize that?

54
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,800
First, build the socialization of the brand.

55
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,375
Second, we will use the hot spot to become the centre of attention.

56
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,839
This is a very crucial step.

57
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,920
Third, the customization of the product.

58
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,319
You can take a look at the information you have.

59
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,559
If there's anything you don't understand...

60
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,720
or you want to ask,

61
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,279
you can ask me directly.

62
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,680
The proposal is going well.

63
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,560
The project director is quite satisfied.

64
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,720
Now, it's up to the chairman.

65
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,680
That's great.

66
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,959
Thank you, Han Han.

67
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,319
Ms. Xin, can I go back tomorrow?

68
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,000
I can't take overnight flights anymore.

69
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No problem.

70
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,840
You've been working so hard these few days.

71
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,000
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

72
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't you admire Ms. Zeng?

73
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,638
She just gave a talk on insider creative techniques.

74
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,639
Do you want it?

75
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,720
Sure. Send it to me then. I want to study it.

76
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,120
Okay, I'll send it to you now.

77
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,319
(Uncle: This is Zhou Bin.)

78
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,656
(Mr. Zhou, you haven't returned to Jiangzhou yet, right?)

79
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,040
(I'm done with my work here. If you're free, )

80
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,320
(I'd like to treat you to a meal to thank you for your chivalry.)

81
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,720
(Haha, you flatter me. How about dinner?)

82
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,320
(Hangzhou Yuelai International Hotel.)

83
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,719
(Rucheng Advertising)

84
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,399
Last night, my mom nagged me.

85
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,918
She said my second aunt is worried.

86
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,079
She cries with her every day.

87
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,840
What is my mom worried about?

88
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,559
That you and Qu Yi Peng haven't gotten married.

89
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,160
She doesn't dare to rush you.

90
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,731
So she beat around the bush and asked me to persuade you.

91
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,639
Have you talked to Qu Yi Peng about going to Hong Kong?

92
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,690
I'm still fighting for the chance.

93
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,090
I'll talk to him after I get it.

94
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,119
You want to go to Hong Kong so badly.

95
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,760
Is it because of that person?

96
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,330
You know it.

97
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,880
Ever since I found out he's in Hong Kong,

98
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,210
everything I've done is to get close to him.

99
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,559
Is it for revenge?

100
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,360
Remember.

101
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,960
You're doing this for yourself.

102
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,039
To fight for a better future.

103
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,519
Whether this person exists or not, you'd do the same.

104
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,120
Don't think too much.

105
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,480
What about Qu Yi Peng?

106
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,450
What are you going to do?

107
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,919
When I first started dating him,

108
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,559
I looked up to him.

109
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,840
At that time,

110
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,279
just a glimpse of his attention,

111
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,799
his smile,

112
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,210
would make me excited.

113
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,919
I haven't had that feeling...

114
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,759
in a long time.

115
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,600
You were a young girl...

116
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,119
who had just started graduate school.

117
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,600
Su Su, you've grown up too fast.

118
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,879
Relatively speaking, he's still at a standstill.

119
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,480
You went from looking up to him,

120
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,799
to looking at him levelly,

121
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,279
or even scrutinizing him.

122
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,799
You just can't accept this kind of gap.

123
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,440
He...

124
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,879
disappoints me a little.

125
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,360
But you can't bear to part with him...

126
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,759
for real.

127
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,159
He's really nice to me.

128
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Su Su.

129
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,000
Actually, growing up requires learning...

130
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,320
how to live with disappointment.

131
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,120
You can ask yourself.

132
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,279
During the four years you were with him,

133
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,840
you were truly in love.

134
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,840
For the sake of this sincerity,

135
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,360
is hanging in there worth it?

136
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,400
Or putting in more effort?

137
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,879
- We'll get going then. - Bye.

138
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Let's get going too.

139
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:18,439
- Let's go. - Nan Nan, we're leaving.

140
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,120
- Okay, bye. - Let's go, Shi Shi.

141
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,360
- Ms. Nan, I'll get going. - Bye.

142
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,960
I've been waiting for Tiramisu and heard nothing from him all day.

143
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,799
It's almost time to get off work...

144
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,120
and he sent me a song, "Night Life, Take Us to the Light."

145
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,600
What do you think he means?

146
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,639
Yes. What is he hinting at?

147
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,320
He's just sending a love song to test you.

148
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,879
Don't reply. It's a trap.

149
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,320
I'm not going to reply.

150
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,759
Yes, for appointments that don't have a precise time,

151
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,960
it can only be considered courtesy or a trap.

152
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,639
Should I wait then?

153
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,159
Have a foot in both camps.

154
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,399
Do what you should do.

155
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,600
We should be steady and can't panic at first.

156
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,319
(Do you remember our tiramisu date?)

157
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,399
I'm back.

158
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,199
Aren't you on a business trip?

159
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,440
Why are you back?

160
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,799
I suddenly remembered this morning.

161
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,559
Today is our fourth anniversary.

162
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,038
I tried to use this excuse to tell Ms. Kai Xi...

163
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,679
to arrange for other colleagues to go.

164
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,840
A gift for you.

165
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,519
Every time we pass by this shop,

166
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,720
I can see that you're itching for this computer.

167
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,240
Su Su.

168
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,600
Thank you.

169
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,919
Time really flies.

170
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,440
It has been four years.

171
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,519
That's a whole university degree.

172
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,879
Yesterday,

173
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,480
I wanted to remind you.

174
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,799
I thought...

175
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,240
I'm sorry.

176
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,679
I didn't prepare a gift for you.

177
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,600
Just cook a meal for me.

178
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,399
No, go out with me. Let's go.

179
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,759
I really don't want to go out.

180
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,720
I just want to eat your cooking.

181
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,615
I'll cook for you when I come back.

182
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,759
Let's go out first. Come on.

183
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,518
- Let's go. - But...

184
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,878
Where are we going?

185
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,735
You'll know when we get there. Change your shoes. Hurry.

186
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,879
Where are we going?

187
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,560
I'm not telling you. You'll know when you get there.

188
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,559
It's this one, right?

189
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,799
I know you've liked this for a long time.

190
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,360
Try it on.

191
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Okay.

192
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,240
What do you think?

193
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
It looks good.

194
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,120
You look so elegant in it, miss.

195
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,919
It suits you.

196
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,080
- We'll take it. - Okay. I'll get you a new pair.

197
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,759
Thank you.

198
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,919
I have to take my sister's call.

199
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,480
- You can make the payment. - Okay.

200
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,679
Hello?

201
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,879
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

202
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,000
No, Dad just recovered.

203
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Didn't I tell you not to let him work?

204
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,759
Don't worry. Stop crying.

205
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,240
I'll transfer the money to you.

206
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,960
Miss, this is brand new.

207
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,399
Would you like to try it on again?

208
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,680
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

209
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,519
If you like it, you can come back anytime.

210
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:43,559
(Transfer 2,000 yuan)

211
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,200
What happened?

212
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,319
My dad got hurt.

213
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,920
It's nothing serious.

214
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,720
Where are your shoes?

215
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,038
I tried walking in them just now.

216
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,039
The heels are too high. I'm not used to them.

217
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,358
And I thought about it.

218
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,480
I can't find the right occasion to wear them.

219
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,416
I asked the clerk if they had a shorter heel.

220
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,480
But they're out of stock.

221
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,758
We'll buy them another day.

222
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,890
Let's go home. I'm hungry.

223
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,410
Are you really not buying it?

224
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,039
No. It's already on your tab anyway.

225
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,480
You can't run away. Let's go.

226
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,079
Besides, it's almost the end of the season.

227
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
These shoes will surely be on sale.

228
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,519
You should be buying me the latest design.

229
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,519
Let's go.

230
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,440
I'm starving.

231
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,000
Starving?

232
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,119
I'll make you your favourite...

233
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,480
- Sweet and sour... - Spareribs.

234
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,799
Okay.

235
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,039
I'm not late, am I?

236
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
You're just in time.

237
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,559
I'll take you in.

238
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,440
Hello, sir.

239
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,960
- Mr. Wu. - Mr. Zhou is here.

240
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,358
- Mr. Zhou. - Nice to meet you.

241
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,890
- Mr. Zhou. - Mr. Zhou.

242
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,318
- You're finally here. Come. - Well...

243
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,679
I've arranged your seat.

244
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,720
Come.

245
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,200
You're too kind.

246
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,015
- I've arranged everything. - Miss, come here.

247
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,920
Miss, sit here.

248
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,359
- Here. - Yes, sit here.

249
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,558
- From now on, our firm... - No, sit down first.

250
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,118
Sit down first. Can you let me breathe?

251
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,479
- Okay. - This is my fourth glass.

252
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,440
It's our local speciality.

253
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,890
You can't get it anywhere else.

254
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,239
Let's add each other on WeChat.

255
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,575
It's easier to contact each other.

256
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,759
And last time, we...

257
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,799
- I'll scan your code. - I'll drink to you.

258
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,679
The last case was handled so beautifully.

259
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
I have to learn from you.

260
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,039
You're too kind.

261
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,626
- Come on, let's drink together. - Let's drink.

262
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,535
- Come on, let's do it together. - Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

263
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,480
Which dish do you like? I'll get it for you.

264
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:26,240
Hey, miss. I'm from this firm too.

265
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,650
Stay out of it.

266
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:30,411
- Come on, let's drink. - Let's drink first.

267
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
Drink up and refill.

268
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,079
Let's stretch and massage each other.

269
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,439
This is just the first day.

270
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
I'm afraid it'll be even more intense from now on.

271
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,410
Here.

272
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,920
Bear with it.

273
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,358
When are your parents coming back?

274
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,440
My parents...

275
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,880
are at my second aunt's house.

276
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,010
They won't be back until after midnight.

277
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,240
Did you just eat a cherry?

278
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,240
Where's the pit?

279
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:37,920
I swallowed it.

280
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,519
No. You just...

281
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,650
I suddenly got attacked.

282
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,079
If I spit out the pit,

283
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,079
the mood will be ruined, so I just...

284
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,119
I just...

285
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,960
It was hard to swallow. It got stuck in my throat.

286
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,119
Babe.

287
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
Hello.

288
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,319
Just now,

289
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,758
I was eating a cherry...

290
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,200
and accidentally swallowed the pit.

291
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,079
Swallowing the cherry pit must be uncomfortable.

292
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,559
No.

293
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,640
Didn't you swallow it too?

294
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:38,839
Did I?

295
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,000
Yes.

296
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,880
When we were watching "Love Actually".

297
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,039
"Love Actually"?

298
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,960
Sounds familiar.

299
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,759
Have we watched it?

300
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Of course.

301
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,359
When we watched "Love Actually",

302
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,440
it was the first time...

303
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,079
The first time what?

304
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,480
No, tell me what the movie is about.

305
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,079
Gao Peng.

306
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,079
Do you remember...

307
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,319
the first time you kissed me?

308
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,359
What was it like?

309
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,358
Where was it?

310
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,559
It was at Kangting.

311
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Right?

312
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:29,519
Let me ask you another question.

313
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,839
When...

314
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,920
you first held my hand,

315
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:36,759
we were singing in a Tibetan friend's tent.

316
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:39,920
Was the song "Tibetan Plateau"...

317
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,960
or "Over the Golden Hill of Beijing"?

318
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,519
You even sang?

319
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,960
It has been so long. I can't remember at all.

320
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,400
When those images come to my mind,

321
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,279
there's even background music.

322
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,279
How could you forget?

323
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,440
I didn't forget.

324
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,278
It's just that it has been so long.

325
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,679
No matter how much time has passed,

326
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,080
those were the most important moments...

327
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,559
in our lives.

328
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,160
How could you forget them all?

329
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,359
Gao Peng.

330
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,079
Babe.

331
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:24,799
Do you still love me?

332
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,319
Yes.

333
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,400
You say you miss me every day.

334
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,359
When do you think of me?

335
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,319
Do you...

336
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,759
think of the beautiful memories we had together?

337
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,960
Think about the songs we listened to together,

338
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,160
the food we ate together,

339
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,720
or the paths we took?

340
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,200
Do you really miss me?

341
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,119
What's wrong with you today?

342
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,400
I do miss you. I really miss you.

343
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,759
Then why?

344
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,799
Why don't you remember...

345
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,640
such beautiful memories between us?

346
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,400
Okay, I was wrong.

347
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,599
I forgot the movie.

348
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
I'm heartless.

349
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,535
But it's not that I don't miss you.

350
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,720
You're pretending. You're just pretending to miss me.

351
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,160
No, what do you mean?

352
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,696
What do you mean by pretending to miss you?

353
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,359
I've never heard of that phrase.

354
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
I...

355
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,680
He doesn't care about me at all.

356
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,400
I must break up with him this time.

357
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,279
It'll be so lonely if you really break up.

358
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Can you imagine a life without love?

359
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,279
Gao Peng.

360
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,519
We met when we were 17.

361
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,839
We got together when we were 18.

362
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:44,880
It has been...

363
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,200
seven years now.

364
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,119
During the seven years we were together,

365
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,680
we experienced countless firsts.

366
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,440
But in these seven years,

367
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,680
the total time we actually spent together...

368
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,839
was only...

369
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,200
a little over 200 days.

370
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,920
You've never really known about my life.

371
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,480
I don't know about yours either.

372
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,079
But I've always lived on memories...

373
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,440
and greeting each other.

374
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,879
I thought you were the same as me.

375
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,320
That you've always been trying...

376
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,799
and treating every little detail of our relationship...

377
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,279
as proof of our love.

378
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,799
But you...

379
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
forgot all about it.

380
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,319
Are you really going to send it to him?

381
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,839
Should I?

382
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,400
Do you still love him?

383
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,559
Of course I love him.

384
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,759
He's the one who doesn't love me anymore.

385
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,680
If you love him,

386
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,279
why are you breaking up with him?

387
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm not breaking up with him.

388
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,600
I just want to write an essay and complain to him about it.

389
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,559
But you just swore that you'd break up.

390
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:55,160
(Let's break up!)

391
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,119
So are you two considered broken up?

392
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,880
He read my heartfelt essay...

393
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,440
and hasn't replied in 24 hours.

394
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,039
That means he agreed to it.

395
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,799
I now announce...

396
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:06,319
that I, He Zhi Nan, am completely single.

397
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
The good news is...

398
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,839
you can have a relationship with Qu Yi Peng without any burden.

399
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,880
The bad news is, there's no news from Qu Yi Peng.

400
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,359
You're lying.

401
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,400
You did a high-quality facial mask.

402
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,119
Would you be willing to do that if not for a date?

403
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:25,960
It's human nature. We need something to live for.

404
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,799
This melon doesn't seem ripe.

405
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,720
But it's sweet.

406
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,759
It's all right.

407
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,519
Be honest with me.

408
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,279
If Qu Yi Peng didn't exist,

409
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,761
would you still be so decisive to break up with Gao Peng?

410
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,240
Now I wish...

411
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,079
that Gao Peng would come back...

412
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,160
and have an argument with me.

413
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,119
A fight is fine too.

414
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:03,039
It's better than being stagnant like this every day.

415
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,039
If it doesn't work out, then focus more on work.

416
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,799
You're a city beauty, an independent woman.

417
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,959
But you don't care about work at all.

418
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,400
What's there to care about?

419
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,319
Folding bills into roses?

420
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,039
I can't be bothered with you.

421
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,119
Can you do me a favour?

422
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,159
A client wants to come to watch the revised advertisement.

423
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,880
I need to borrow a heavy weapon from you.

424
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:28,640
Got it.

425
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,880
Every bag here...

426
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,160
is proof that he stood me up.

427
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,599
I wish to be stood up like this too.

428
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,920
Who can buy them for me?

429
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,719
Aren't you an independent woman who's pursuing your career?

430
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,015
Why do you need someone to buy you a bag?

431
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,078
Being able to buy it myself...

432
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,960
is different from having a man willing to buy it for me.

433
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,440
Babe. Which one do you like?

434
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,279
Is it Gao Peng?

435
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,119
Did he send it wrongly?

436
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,000
Hello, are you Ms. He?

437
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,599
Please sign here.

438
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,239
(Mr. Gao Peng's purchase forwarding)

439
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,319
(Ms. He)

440
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,640
Gao Peng still loves you.

441
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,079
That's a lot.

442
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,239
Let me tell you.

443
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,279
How much is given is how much love there is.

444
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,079
He loves me?

445
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,240
But he doesn't even want to give me a call...

446
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
or talk it out.

447
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,519
Buying gifts is much better than calling.

448
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,039
Anyone can sweet-talk.

449
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,519
What Gao Peng has done is called sincerity.

450
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:16,159
What? What are you doing?

451
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,599
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

452
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,199
What are you doing?

453
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,615
- I know you're mad. - I've shed so many tears.

454
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,519
- Was it just to get these things? - Don't.

455
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,399
Don't be crazy.

456
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,039
The things are innocent.

457
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,809
Who cares?

458
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:34,119
You... My goodness.

459
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,400
Don't.

460
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,678
You're mad at Gao Peng.

461
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,809
Why are you mad at them?

462
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:43,360
My goodness.

463
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:45,078
They're such nice things.

464
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,559
Why throw them away?

465
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,639
Who cares about these things?

466
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,039
Okay.

467
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,679
Don't cry.

468
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:21,719
It's such a waste to sell these secondhand.

469
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,399
What's the point of keeping them?

470
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,200
The money from the sale will all be donated.

471
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:37,920
He wasn't like this before.

472
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,719
Now that he has money,

473
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,289
the things he bought become more expensive.

474
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:46,288
(I'm annoyed and tired! I'm getting rid of these.)

475
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:47,559
(What do you guys think?)

476
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,239
He gave me less and less affection.

477
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,400
Also...

478
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,055
(What happened? Did you break up?)

479
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,215
(Sometimes, what's missing is not a bag, but a word. Cheer up.)

480
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,376
(I get you! I've gone through a similar experience.)

481
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,456
(Must a problem that can't be solved with bags. Sell them!)

482
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,535
(He missed out on you and has nothing, )

483
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,615
(but you have yourself and these bags.)

484
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,119
(Be grateful because it's the last bit of wealth he left you.)

485
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,809
Are you selling this too?

486
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,289
I remember you told me...

487
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,159
in order to buy this for you,

488
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,679
Gao Peng starved for half a semester.

489
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,679
Gao Peng's family used to be poor.

490
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,799
When his house hadn't been demolished yet,

491
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,519
his parents tightened their belts...

492
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,000
and cobbled together money...

493
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,809
to send him abroad to attend university.

494
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,679
When I was a sophomore,

495
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:15,119
there was a girl in my dorm.

496
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,559
Her boyfriend...

497
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,239
Her boyfriend bought her a pendant of the same brand.

498
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,920
I was so envious.

499
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,639
I brought it up...

500
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,960
to Gao Peng casually.

501
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,679
Gao Peng.

502
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:40,199
Who told you to buy me this bracelet?

503
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,119
What will you eat now?

504
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:46,239
Working after school is hard enough.

505
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:48,839
You should save some money to buy yourself good food.

506
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,119
You're driving me crazy.

507
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,519
Babe.

508
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,559
You're so cute when you're mad.

509
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,079
I'm not joking with you.

510
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:58,000
No. Don't you always say that I'm fat?

511
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:00,199
I'll take not eating as a diet.

512
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:02,559
Who told you to go on a diet?

513
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,559
I don't want you to skip meals because of me.

514
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,959
But I don't want you to be envious of others.

515
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,000
I just don't want you to suffer.

516
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,720
You must have what others have.

517
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,399
When I make money,

518
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,199
I'll let you have what others don't have.

519
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,719
We won't be envious of others anymore.

520
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,000
Put the bracelet on and show me.

521
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,079
This is my most...

522
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,289
most favourite thing during those years.

523
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,809
I often couldn't bear to wear it.

524
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:06,960
Later on, Gao Peng gave me more and more gifts.

525
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:13,599
But only this bracelet contains his love.

526
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,360
We won't sell it no matter what.

527
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,599
Qu Yi Peng, help me get the pyjamas on the bed.

528
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,880
Okay.

529
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,039
Coming.

530
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,439
You're pricing them randomly.

531
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,960
People will think they're fake items.

532
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,440
What does he mean by this?

533
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:55,785
(Qu Yi Peng: I'm really sorry.)

534
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:56,809
(I wanted to invite you to tiramisu last week.)

535
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,880
(Are you free these two days?)

536
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,376
(I didn't mean to stand you up. My dad got injured suddenly last week,

537
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,039
(so I had to rush back to my hometown, )

538
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:13,039
(to arrange for his hospitalization and surgery.)

539
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,199
Will you go?

540
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,039
What say you?

541
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,329
I don't know.

542
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,120
Then let's not think about it.

543
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,679
Do you really want to sell it?

544
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,440
We've come this far.

545
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,329
Can we turn back?

546
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,880
If you don't want to sell it, then don't.

547
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,360
Why make it so hard?

548
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,519
If I sell the love of He Zhi Nan...

549
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,960
for only 499 yuan,

550
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,880
it'd be too cheap.

551
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,960

552
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:07,329
I don't understand why women always want a promise.

553
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,519
He never knows what I want.

554
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:11,769
She never tells me. It's always me guessing.

555
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Guessing and guessing.

556
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,519
Then she gets mad if I guess wrong.

557
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,360
He never makes me feel safe.

558
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,519
I don't know why.

559
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,559
No matter what I do,

560
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,440
she never feels safe.

561
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:27,840
In the beginning,

562
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,440
he would comfort me.

563
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,519
But now...

564
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,519
I'm tired.

565
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:37,079
Let her be.

566
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,999
The next one might be better behaved.

567
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,360
It has been three months since we broke up.

568
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:43,769
Every month,

569
00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:45,719
he would text me to scold me.

570
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:49,039
So be it and break up.

571
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:50,679
Back then,

572
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,840
I bought her a new phone by instalments.

573
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:56,559
My money is still being deducted.

574
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Deduction is successful.

575
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,639
The bank card you used on April 10...

576
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,119
has automatically repaid...

577
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,840
- Look. - the amount of 1,233 yuan.

578
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,519
It's deducted again.

579
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,769
(Bad woman)

580
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:25,840
(Bad woman)

581
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:35,679
(Missed out on a lover)
