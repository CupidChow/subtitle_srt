00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,460
The food here is simple,

195
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,490
and it might not be to your taste.

196
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,820
Just head down the mountain.

197
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,180
Ping'an.

198
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,490
Ping'an.

199
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,530
Perfect timing,

200
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,940
I want to tell you something.

201
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,340
[Lease Agreement]
Isn't this the clinic's lease agreement?

202
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,010
Why are you showing it to me?

203
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,770
You've made plans for your future,

204
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,700
and I want a change as well.

205
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm closing the clinic

206
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,300
and handing

207
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,340
the lease over to you.

208
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,180
Where will you go then?

209
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,610
I'll journey across the land

210
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,300
and resume my life
as a wandering physician.

211
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,130
Seriously?

212
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,850
I just got back,

213
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,490
and now you're leaving?

214
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,220
You have your life,

215
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,130
and I have mine.

216
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,460
When you

217
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,820
visit Cailian

218
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,980
and Danxin's graves,

219
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,650
prepare an offering for me as well.

220
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,940
What about Yuan Shaocheng?

221
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,300
Are you not going to tell him?

222
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,820
We merely crossed paths by chance.

223
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,890
When are you leaving?

224
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,060
Today.

225
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,250
Why the rush?

226
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,650
The longer I wait,
the harder it is to say goodbye.

227
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,060
It's better to be decisive.

228
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,250
I've just written the song
"Late Coming Spring,"

229
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,980
and you haven't heard me sing it yet.

230
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,570
Then do it now.

231
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:56,250
♪I see you ascend the tall tower alone♪

232
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,370

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,770
visit Cailian

239
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,010
and Danxin's graves,

240
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,730
prepare an offering for me as well.

241
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,090
Why the rush?

242
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,460
The longer I wait,
the harder it is to say goodbye.

243
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,900
It's better to be decisive.

244
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,290
She didn't even take
the calming incense.

245
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,290
That person looks familiar.

246
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,810
I think I've seen her
at Wanguoxiang Tavern before.

247
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,660
As long as you behave

248
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,940
and treat Wanguoxiang Tavern

249
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,290
as your own home,

250
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,250
you'll be well-rewarded.

251
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:33,900
Now, keep up.

252
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,220
Be careful.

253
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:41,860
Madame Hua

254
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,050
has recruited a new group of talents,

255
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,500
all with unique abilities.

256
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,570
Why would she recruit people

257
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,900
with unique talents?

258
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,050
You probably don't know this.

259
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,050
I've been here

260
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,290
longer than you.

261
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,460
Madame Hua

262
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,940
has a secret crew

263
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,020
who rarely

264
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,290
show themselves.

265
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,500
What do you mean by "secret crew?"

266
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,730
This secret crew
is dedicated to catering

267
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,980
to the preferences
of influential figures.

268
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,770
Some are skilled in knife throwing,

269
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,810
fire-breathing performances,

270
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,010
and even disguise techniques.

271
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,260
Mastering these abilities

272
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,810
takes years of effort.

273
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,730
She said we merely crossed paths
by chance?

274
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,980
That's not the point.

275
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,330
She was perfectly fine before.

276
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,730
Why did she

277
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,090
suddenly decide to leave the capital

278
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,330
after treating a woman?

279
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,220
I've seen that woman before.

280
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,050
She's a new member
of the secret crew at Wanguoxiang.

281
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,460
I believe

282
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,530
Ping'an's departure

283
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
has something to do with her.

284
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
Do you know her name?

285
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,330
I don't,

286
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,980
but she has a mole on her left cheek.

287
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,700
Wenyu.

288
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,770
Head to Wanguoxiang right now

289
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,290
and investigate a woman

290
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,570
with a mole on her left cheek.

291
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,900
Make sure

292
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,770
to uncover her background.

293
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,570
Yes, sir.

294
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,810
Mr. Yuan,

295
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,700
you've been around Ping'an a lot.

296
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,940
Do you think she's facing
any mental distress?

297
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,050
Mental distress?

298
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,180
I've overlooked

299
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,180
something very important.

300
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,940
Ping'an's suffering

301
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,740
stems from the Censor case.

302
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,980
It's her obsession

303
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,490
with overturning the verdict
that has kept her going until now.

304
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,180
But now that the case is closed,

305
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,770
where does she go from here?

306
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,500
Are you suspecting something?

307
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,700
I suspect

308
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,420
she wants to end her life.

309
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,020
Why are you still alive?

310
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,780
Why don't you just die?

311
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,900
You are only using us

312
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,570
as a blade.

313
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,500
You are full of sins.

314
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,050
[Tomb of Lu Danxin. Tomb of Cailian]

315
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,820
That woman deceived you.

316
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
She's a member
of Wanguoxiang's secret crew,

317
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,540
not a victim

318
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,500
of the Censor case.

319
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,300
I was so blind.

320
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,340
How could I have forgotten?

321
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,900
You're the one who's suffered

322
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,660
the most from mental distress.

323
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,660
Ping'an,

324
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,020
tell me,

325
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,820
why did you choose to become

326
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,660
a psychiatrist in the first place?

327
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,540
I want to cure illnesses and save lives,

328
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,500
so that more people

329
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,660
can live happily.

330
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,740
Yes,

331
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,900
you've already achieved all of that.

332
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,260
With your heart-healing techniques,

333
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,580
you saved Guo Yi,

334
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:26,780
Cai Yun,

335
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,820
Li Ge,

336
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,060
and Chang Qing

337
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,740
from the depths of despair,

338
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,610
one after another.

339
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
You punished the wicked,

340
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,660
brought corrupt officials to justice,

341
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,020
and exposed the hypocrisy
of the salt merchants,

342
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,340
driving down the salt prices
in the capital.

343
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,820
You pursued justice and truth,

344
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,580
ensuring that Yu Qian's righteousness

345
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,660
would always be remembered.

346
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,900
You even gave Her Majesty

347
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,420
the opportunity to implement
the trial official system.

348
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,260
Isn't that exactly what you intended?

349
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,420
Up until now,

350
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,780
do you still believe
the meaning of your life

351
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,260
is solely tied to the Censor case?

352
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,580
Have you lost your mind?

353
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,220
You deceived everyone before,

354
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,820
facing death alone.

355
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,820
Now, you've gone

356
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,740
even further,

to end it all?

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,300

388
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,130
What Mrs. Gu wrote in her letter

389
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:12,810
is correct.

390
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,660
Only you have the power

391
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,980
to heal yourself.

392
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,570
You mentioned many people just now,

393
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,180
but you missed

394
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,290
the most important one.

395
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,700
Who did I miss?

396
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,850
You.

397
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,700
Then don't leave the person

398
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,020
who cares about you the most.

399
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,370
How did you know I was here?

400
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,420
Can you recall exactly

401
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,020
what Ping'an said to you

402
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,570
before she left?

403
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,810
She told me

404
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,940
she wanted to live a different life.

405
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,420
She gave me the lease agreement

406
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:51,810
and said

407
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,700
we each had our own life to live.

408
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,290
She asked me to take care

409
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,570
of Danxin and Cailian's graves.

410
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,810
She mentioned
that she had traveled far and wide,

411
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,940
wishing to go back
to being a wandering physician,

412
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,050
like in the past.

413
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,330
Like in the past.

414
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,900
Where will she go?

415
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,850
Maybe Wuxiang,

416
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,980
where she first met

417
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,290
Cailian and Danxin.

418
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,810
Ruan Qin, the person she cared about,

419
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,370
also jumped off a cliff in Wuxiang.

420
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,370
Who is the person behind that woman

421
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,050
from Wanguoxiang?

422
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,130
Want to know?

423
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,290
Return to the capital

424
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,290
and investigate yourself.

425
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,520
[Why did you harm me?]

426
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,610
I'm sorry.

427
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,290
It's my fault.

428
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,330
She forced me.

429
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:38,810
I didn't want to.

430
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,810
I didn't want to harm you.

431
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,740
I'm sorry.

432
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,570
I apologize.

433
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,050
I'm to blame.

434
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,130
Are you a person or a ghost?

435
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,530
People are scarier than ghosts,

436
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,260
aren't they?

437
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,740
Ye Ping'an?

438
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,220
You...

439
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,090
You are Yaozhen, aren't you?

440
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,020
A member of Wanguoxiang's secret crew.

441
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,180
You want me

442
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,370
to kill myself,

443
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,660
exploiting my mental distress

444
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,090
and weakness.

445
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,940
A clever move,

446
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,130
but too bad it didn't work.

447
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,020
Don't.

448
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,660
Don't kill me.

449
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,050
I beg you. Please don't kill me.

450
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:19,940
I beg of you.

451
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,260
Please don't.

452
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,500
So,

453
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,900
how does it feel to have almost lost

454
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,500
your life?

455
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,980
Now, tell me,

456
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,850
why did you deceive me
with disguise techniques?

457
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,530
As members of the secret crew,

458
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,220
we have no say in the matter.

459
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,180
She's used my little sister's life
to threaten me.

460
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,810
Who

461
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,130
is she?

462
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,770
It's Madame Hua,

463
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,020
the one from Wanguoxiang.

464
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,260
What will you do with me now?

465
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,290
Send me to the authorities?

466
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,740
Reprisal for a wrong should be directed
at the perpetrator.

467
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,900
If I am pleased,

468
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,460
your little sister might return.

469
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,660
It's a precious gift to stay beautiful

470
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,610
as you grow older.

471
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,740
Who can resist the temptation behind it?

472
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,650
[Wanguoxiang Tavern]

473
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,090
Fortunately,
I saved Yaozhen's little sister

474
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,660
and sent them out of the capital.

475
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,850
One moment late,

476
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,770
Yaozhen would have been killed.

477
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,900
Now,

478
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,810
we've lost the lead again.

479
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,900
Not necessarily.

480
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,330
The fact that someone's going
to such lengths to kill me

481
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,700
proves they're afraid of me.

482
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,420
As long as I'm alive,

483
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,770
they'll never find peace.

484
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:02,810
What do you want to do?

485
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,660
Look into the Censor's case again.

486
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,330
Are you hungry?

487
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,420
I bought you fried cakes.

488
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,130
Go get them from the cupboard.

489
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,460
What are you doing?

490
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,420
What am I doing?

491
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,460
I need to remember your face.

492
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,020
I almost didn't get to see you again.

493
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,660
I'm back, aren't I?

494
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,500
You'll see me every day from now on.

495
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,530
How does that sound?

496
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,090
You have dark circles under your eyes.

497
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,050
You didn't sleep at all
last night, did you?

498
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,530
Go get some rest.

499
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,570
I won't.

500
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,660
I'm afraid that if I do,

501
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,020
you'll be gone again

502
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,850
when I wake up.

503
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,090
I won't, Nichang.

504
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,090
I've carried this guilt
for over a decade.

505
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,500
Throughout these years,

506
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,460
I've helped many people
solve their emotional struggles

507
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,180
but I couldn't solve my own.

508
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,050
However, strangely,

509
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,420
when I came back

510
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,220
from the edge of the cliff,

511
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,660
the heavy weight on my chest

512
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,090
that had burdened me for years

513
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,810
suddenly seemed

514
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,770
to have disappeared.

515
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,980
Moreover,

516
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,660
just the thought

517
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,050
that someone would use
my mental distress

518
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,020
to try and kill me

519
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,940
fills me with rage.

520
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,290
I will never allow myself

521
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,420
to be controlled
by this mental distress again.

522
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,180
You've brought out
the grievance letter again.

523
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,940
We all know what Mr. Yu

524
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,340
was trying to convey.

525
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,380
Reading it again
won't reveal anything new.

526
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,420
See this line here.

527
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,820
"The three judicial departments have made
their decision and reported it today."

528
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,090
I've been through

529
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,250
this process as well.

530
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,020
The investigators need to verify

531
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,980
the evidence and testimonies.

532
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,820
Back then,

533
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,820
the most crucial pieces of evidence

534
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:31,940
were the planted silver

535
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:32,940
and the letter

536
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,130
forged by Hai Yiping.

537
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,860
But based on the letter,

538
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,690
Yu Qian never pleaded guilty.

539
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,780
All major cases
under the three judicial departments

540
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,570
were ultimately judged
by the late ruler.

541
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,900
Since Yu Qian denied the charges,
the case was submitted for review.

542
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,610
Only after the late ruler's verdict

543
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,130
was he sent to the imperial prison.

544
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,820
It all followed proper protocol,

545
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:52,980
there's nothing amiss.

546
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,980
[Today]

547
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,610
"Today."

548
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,820
It says "today."

549
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,530
Even when Hai Yiping pleaded guilty

550
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,540
right away this time,

551
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,210
the three judicial departments
still took three days

552
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,860
to process the case.

553
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,210
But when Yu Qian denied the charges,

554
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,460
why was the case reported and concluded

555
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,940
on the very same day?

556
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,050
That doesn't make sense.

557
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,460
If we push our speculation further,

558
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,900
could it be that someone

559
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,340
within the three judicial departments
was bribed?

560
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,500
Ping'an,

561
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,650
could it be
that we're overthinking this?

562
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,650
Maybe the three judicial departments
were truly deceived,

563
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,690
believing the assassination letter

564
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,860
was solid evidence,

565
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,050
so they simply reported
and settled the case right away.

566
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,570
You have a point,

567
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,540
but

568
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,530
we can't ignore

569
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,250
even the slightest cause for doubt.

570
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:43,940
Here's the plan.

571
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,540
We'll look into it tomorrow

572
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,340
and find out exactly
who the presiding judges

573
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,060
of the three judicial departments
were back then.

574
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,340
Yu Qian and the woman who died

575
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,060
have been exonerated.

576
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,540
Why are you still so concerned

577
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,760
about the presiding judges

578
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,340
of the case back then?

579
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,570
Although the verdict in the Censor case
has been overturned,

580
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,420
there are still unresolved issues.

581
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,530
Why did the three judicial departments

582
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,170
only take one day to investigate Yu Qian

583
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,860
before closing the case?

584
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,690
Miss Ye,

585
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,730
I truly admire your efforts

586
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,860
to seek justice for Yu Qian.

587
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,340
But if there were any issues

588
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,860
among the three judicial departments
back then,

589
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,050
why didn't the late ruler
do anything about it?

590
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,090
Have you thought about that?

591
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:38,730
Mr. Sun,

592
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,570
let me ask you this.

593
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,690
If Yu Qian

594
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,420
discovered that his friend

595
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,900
was involved in this case,

596
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,250
would he investigate?

597
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,940
He certainly would.

598
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,140
If this case involves
high-ranking officials,

599
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,730
would he investigate?

600
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:54,980
Yes.

601
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,250
Even if it involves the inner court,

602
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,420
would he dare to investigate?

603
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:57,860
You...

604
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,050
Ye Ping'an,

605
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,050
don't talk nonsense.

606
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:13,900
Mr. Sun,

607
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,210
just answer me this.

608
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,940
If it were Yu Qian,

609
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,980
would he dare to investigate?

610
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,820
I understand what you mean.

611
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,380
Two of the presiding judges

612
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,570
in the Censor case have passed away,

613
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,530
and now

614
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,340
only Lu Wei,

615
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,690
the Chief Censor is still alive.

616
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,570
I've heard

617
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,860
he's an upright man

618
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,090
who once helped Yu Qian,

619
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,020
but after retiring, he left the capital,

620
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,570
and I don't know where he went.

621
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,340
So,

622
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,500
even if that letter

623
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:56,980
fooled everyone,

624
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,210
Lu Wei, who knew Yu Qian well,

625
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,610
should still have his doubts
about this matter.

626
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:04,980
Mr. Sun,

627
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,500
if you were in his position,

628
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,060
what would you do?

629
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,940
Even if the physical evidence is solid,

630
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,530
I can still delay the verdict

631
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,180
and investigate further
under the pretext

632
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,090
that Yu Qian hasn't confessed yet.

633
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,900
Based solely on speculation,

634
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,610
you are saying

635
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,130
that some of the presiding judges

636
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,420
in the three judicial departments
aren't ethical?

637
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,940
That's why we must find Lu Wei,

638
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,210
the Chief Censor from back then.

639
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,940
After all, his attitude

640
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,170
was truly suspicious.

641
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,250
Ping'an,

642
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,690
the bureaucracy is complex.

643
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,170
Yu Qian was forthright

644
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,170
back then,

645
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,650
and he probably offended someone

646
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,420
without even knowing.

647
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,980
Perhaps Lu Wei thought

648
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,130
Yu Qian coveted

649
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:48,820
his position.

650
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,210
Or maybe

651
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:51,730
there were

652
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,020
factional power struggles

653
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:53,730
and interests at play,

654
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,090
which is why he didn't protect Yu Qian.

655
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,650
What you've said makes sense,

656
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,820
but only by finding him

657
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,460
can we get the answer.

658
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,250
The verdict of the Censor case
has been overturned,

659
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,650
those women's reputations are restored,

660
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,820
and Yu Qian's name is cleared.

661
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,420
You've got

662
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,420
everything you wanted.

663
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,380
Why continue

664
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,540
the investigation?

665
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:17,730
Maybe

666
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,690
you should retreat

667
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,540
to somewhere peaceful.

668
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,500
Once I wrap up...

669
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,090
Do you want me

670
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,940
to leave?

671
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,820
You've just gotten out of danger.

672
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,690
Why would you throw yourself

673

back into this mess?

674
