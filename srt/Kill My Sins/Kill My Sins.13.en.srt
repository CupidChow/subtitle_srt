[Kill My Sins]
[This is a work of fiction]

2
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,390
Take this.

3
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,440
At least now,

4
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,910
it's willing to eat what you feed it.

5
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,590
Actually,

6
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
training it is less difficult
than training an eagle.

7
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,760
We just don't have enough time.

8
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,960
But don't worry,

9
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,270
I won't rest for a moment.

10
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,920
I'll make sure it learns

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,670
the specific commands.

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,000
[Episode 13]
[The Storm Approaches]

13
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,990
Why can't you be

14
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,110
as obedient

15
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,920
as other dogs?

16
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,990
I'll give you another chance.

17
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,360
Don't let me down.

18
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,040
Go.

19
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,710
Did you see that?

20
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,110
Well done!

21
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:03,800
Mother!

22
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,150
My dear!

23
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,270
Sweetie!

24
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,110
Mother!

25
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,710
My dear!

26
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,270
Good job.

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,480
Let me see.

28
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,870
How could you let your dog hurt my kid?

29
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,360
I'll report you to the authorities!

30
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,200
Report me?

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Your child provoked my dog
and got bitten.

32
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,110
It's neither the dog's fault,

33
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,590
nor mine.

34
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,200
You!

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,960
The money is more than enough

36
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,830
to afford your son's whole life.

37
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,480
Good dog.

38
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,150
Good dog.

39
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,800
Like father,

40
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,760
like son.

41
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,200
Today, I saw Li Qianzhao

42
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,640
set his dog on a little boy.

43
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,920
I even wanted

44
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,920
to hack him into pieces.

45
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,640
Since his dog bites others,

46
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,200
I'll have Blackie go after him!

47
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:00,990
I have an idea.

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,480
I'll have Blackie

49
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,590
disguise as a spider demon

50
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,520
and scare him to death!

51
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,430
No.

52
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,390
Calm down.

53
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,270
Don't act without permission.

54
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,920
If you get caught...

55
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,920
I won't bring you all

56
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,520
into this.

57
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,320
Nichang

58
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,910
doesn't trust me enough.

59
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,520
And you,

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,640
you're not steady enough.

61
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,830
Only Danxin is reliable.

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,470
She does exactly as she's told,

63
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,790
and she never makes mistakes.

64
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,230
How could you praise and criticize

65
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,440
right in front of everyone?

66
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,440
Weren't you the one

67
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,910
who said I was the most thoughtful?

68
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,760
Exactly.

69
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,390
You can't play favorites.

70
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,230
Alright,

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,030
you are all acting like children.

72
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,640
So immature.

73
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,000
If you

74
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,470
really want to scare him,

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
you could just slip
some hallucinatory herb

76
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,320
into his food.

77
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
It can make him
hallucinate terrifying visions.

78
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,320
No need to do it yourself.

79
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,270
Got it.

80
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,030
I was just talking out of frustration.

81
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,830
Anyway, tomorrow,

82
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,790
Li Zongxu is doomed.

83
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,520
He will not.

84
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,520
What do you mean?

85
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,200
We've put so much effort into this.

86
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,710
Isn't tomorrow the perfect chance

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,390
to take his life?

88
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,590
His life will be taken,

89
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,120
but Li Zongxu is involved
in the censor case.

90
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,520
There's likely

91
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,590
more information on him

92
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,470
that we don't yet know.

93
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,710
That's right.

94
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,230
So after exposing him

95
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,830
as planned tomorrow,

96
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,960
we can interrogate him
while he's in custody

97
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,200
to uncover the details
of the censor case.

98
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,320
What if someone tries

99
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,150
to protect him after he's detained?

100
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,030
Then won't he...

101
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,150
Why take the risk?

102
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,590
I think Cailian is right.

103
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,880
Why bother with
those roundabout schemes?

104
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,120
Who are you drinking with?

105
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,230
Who else?

106
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,350
My aunt, of course.

107
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,440
She's really bad at drinking.

108
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,560
One drink, and she's out.

109
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,590
What brought you here?

110
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,200
Tomorrow is the banquet for the envoys.

111
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,200
My brother is

112
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,390
at the Martial Arts Examination Ground

113
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,230
selecting performers

114
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,640
for the King of Qin
Breaking Up Battle Array Tune.

115
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,120
So you're

116
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,760
inviting me to join the fun?

117
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,710
Nope.

118
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,960
This time,

119
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,080
I'm not inviting you,

120
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,350
but my brother is.

121
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,000
[Xian Guangping,
General of Left Yulin Royal Guard]

122
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,200
General Xian,

123
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,560
if one day,

124
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,790
the slack Yulin Royal Guards
in the capital,

125
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,000
are sent to the battlefield,

126
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,350
do you think

127
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,000
they can survive

128
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,230
with such performance?

129
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,200
I am ashamed.

130
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,120
I will ensure the Left Yulin Royal Guard

131
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,150
is trained to the highest standard.

132
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,120
Xian'er,

133
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,390
General Xian

134
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,150
was once under my command,

135
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,270
but it doesn't mean
you can push him around.

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,200
Winning and losing

137
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,080
in a match

138
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,760
is normal.

139
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,640
No.

140
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,880
Miss Wu's lecture is an eye-opener.

141
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,350
I have indeed become lax

142
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,270
in drilling my men

143
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,390
after staying in the capital
for too long.

144
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,590
I must stay vigilant.

145
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,080
For the next round,

146
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,350
fight me.

147
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,230
Performing

148
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,270
the King of Qin
Breaking Up Battle Array Tune

149
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,030
at the banquet is good.

150
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,960
This piece's spirit

151
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,830
is vast and unyielding,

152
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,120
and its power shakes the world.

153
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,390
It will showcase

154
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,230
Great Feng's might to all,

155
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,320
ensuring none dare to challenge us.

156
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,560
Shuodan's intention
to make you the prince consort

157
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,960
has already spread.

158
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,790
Have you

159
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,910
decided how to respond?

160
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,440
This is

161
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,880
indeed unexpected.

162
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,710
But fortunately,

163
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,150
nothing is set in stone yet.

164
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,640
If you hadn't returned,

165
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,830
you'd be living a carefree life now.

166
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,560
Even if Her Majesty

167
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,640
had not summoned me back,

168
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,200
I would have returned all the same.

169
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,470
Why?

170
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,880
Have you heard of the Battle of Jinyuan?

171
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,320
Five years ago,

172
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,030
Shuodan brought an army
and invaded our border.

173
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,320
You led your troops,
fought against overwhelming odds,

174
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,640
and achieved a great victory.

175
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,350
A great victory?

176
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,830
No.

177
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,230
That battle

178
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
was brutal,

179
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,560
like a nightmare.

180
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,000
We were

181
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,880
on the brink of total defeat.

182
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,350
Do you know why?

183
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,350
Because of a salt shortage.

184
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,200
Salt is a vital military supply.

185
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,630
Before the battle even ended,

186
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,400
we had already run out of salt.

187
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,110
Supplies never arrived.

188
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,080
Without salt for an extended period,

189
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,750
the body weakens.

190
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,040
That's a fatal condition
on the battlefield.

191
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,710
We kept retreating

192
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,680
and were forced into passive defense.

193
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,110
Who would have thought

194
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,830
that the siege

195
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,680
would last for months?

196
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
With our food and salt depleted,

197
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,350
the city was filled
with the dead and dying.

198
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,400
I slaughtered our warhorses

199
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,710
to feed the soldiers,

200
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,750
but in the end,

201
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,870
it was barely enough to keep us alive.

202
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,800
How did you

203
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,590
turn the tide?

204
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,110
I've been planning

205
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,590
a surprise attack on Shuodan,

206
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,110
but the scouting teams I sent

207
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,320
to survey

208
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,280
the enemy's camp

209
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,400
never returned.

210
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,750
But, one day,

211
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,470
Yuan Shaocheng

212
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,440
made it back alone,

213
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,560
covered in blood.

214
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,080
At the time,

215
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,470
he was merely a battalion commander,

216
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,110
but he was calm and astute.

217
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,590
He brought intelligence
of Shuodan's camp.

218
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,630
With that information,
we devised a fire attack

219
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,560
and held their 80,000 main force back

220
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,800
with only 5,000.

221
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,870
I still remember

222
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,110
a foreign proverb

223
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,040
I once heard

224
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,110
on the border.

225
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,080
"Bureaucrats start wars.

226
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,920
The rich provide the weapons.

227
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,040
The common folks

228
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,320
send their children."

229
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,830
But when the war is over,

230
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,870
the common folks

231
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,080
can only search

232
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,040
for their children's bodies.

233
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,560
A soldier will never regret

234
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,750
dying on the battlefield

235
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,470
for his homeland.

236
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,470
But to perish in a foreign land

237
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,230
simply due to food and salt shortages

238
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,870
is totally unbearable.

239
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,230
I have returned this time

240
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,040
to seek justice

241
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,080
for my fallen buddies

242
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,560
and for the people.

243
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,560
You must have investigated

244
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,320
all the granary magistrates

245
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,680
responsible for transporting
salt and grain, huh?

246
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,830
That's right.

247
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,710
After all,

248
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
the counties with official granaries
and relay stations

249
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,040
are easily counted.

250
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,200
Huayin,

251
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,200
Longmen,

252
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,040
Weinan,

253
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,960
and Tongquan.

254
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,160
Tongquan?

255
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,920
I heard about it when I assisted

256
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,440
in the military fund case.

257
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,630
There was a severe drought that year.

258
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,470
Using the drought as an excuse,

259
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,350
the granary magistrate
repeatedly delayed

260
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,160
salt and grain shipments to the border.

261
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,280
Xu Qing, currently working
in the Ministry of Revenue,

262
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,750
was one of those
granary magistrates back then.

263
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,590
There's more.

264
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,440
What else?

265
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,160
Xu Qing has deep ties

266
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,080
to the Li family.

267
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,510
Li Zongxu monopolizes
the capital's official salt trade,

268
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,630
but his reach

269
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,510
extends far beyond that.

270
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,160
So it was him.

271
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,200
I heard Zheng Yuan
once asked you to treat him.

272
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,400
Then, he died.

273
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,280
So

274
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,200
you've been treating Li Zongxu?

275
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,470
So that's why

276
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,200
you invited me here.

277
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:21,960
Relax.

278
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,280
I won't act recklessly

279
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,440
and alert them.

280
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,280
Good.

281
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,830
As long as you don't ask
about my affairs,

282
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,710
I can help you

283
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,990
find the answers you seek.

284
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,590
Father,

285
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,990
this is the Grand Peace of the Ages

286
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,400
drawn by a master painter at my request.

287
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,960
Look here.

288
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,750
I even had gold dust and leaf

289
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,080
embedded in the buildings

290
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,160
to showcase our dynasty's grandeur.

291
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,200
Truly a masterpiece.

292
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,470
I plan to present this painting

293
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,440
to Shuodan's envoys

294
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,800
at the banquet.

295
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,750
This way,

296
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,510
we can suppress the arrogance
of the Wu family.

297
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,590
Very well.

298
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,710
Keep this painting safe.

299
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,040
So, do you approve?

300
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,680
Yes.

301
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,680
Listen,

302
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,870
when the fireworks
light up the sky tomorrow,

303
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,280
you will present this gift.

304
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,990
Let them witness

305
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,400
the grand splendor

306
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,680
of our realm.

307
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,560
Got it.

308
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,630
Miss Wu,

309
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,200
was it the Li family who orchestrated

310
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,230
General Wu being included

311
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,750
in the prince consort selection?

312
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,320
If there's anything

313
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,110
I can do to help him,

314
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,320
I would risk my life

315
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,470
without hesitation.

316
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,680
I appreciate

317
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,870
your gratitude and loyalty.

318
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,920
But for now,

319
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,560
you don't need to concern yourself
with anything else.

320
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,830
Just focus on training
the Yulin Royal Guard.

321
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,750
By the way,

322
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,160
I've seen you practice both calligraphy

323
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,320
and swordsmanship,

324
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,440
and your hands have slight calluses,

325
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,920
so I made this based on Qianjin Yifang,
[*Name of a medical book]

326
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,710
using fangfeng,
[*Saposhnikovia divaricata]

327
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,400
baizhi,
[*Angelicae Dahuricae]

328
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,780
and pork fat,

329
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,950
which has a nourishing effect.

330
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,430
If you don't mind...

331
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,740
The thought of you,

332
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,660
a swordsman,

333
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,590
carefully brewing this for me

334
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,190
is quite amusing.

335
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,830
General Xian, you're not young anymore.

336
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,830
Recently,

337
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,590
the Vice Minister of Rites wanted

338
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,350
to marry his daughter to you,

339
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,780
but you have yet to agree.

340
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,310
Wouldn't it be a shame

341
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,860
to waste your prime years?

342
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,260
If you ask me to marry,

343
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,710
I will.

344
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,780
Follow your own heart.

345
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,140
You don't need my opinion.

346
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,950
The alchemist you found for me

347
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,780
wasn't to my liking.

348
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,710
Find me another one.

349
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,230
Understood.

350
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,020
The plan for the banquet
is of great importance.

351
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,830
If it succeeds,
all will be well.

352
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,230
But if it fails...

353
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,950
If it fails,

354
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,350
I will not implicate you.

355
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,900
Ye Ping'an was able to gather

356
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,350
such crucial intelligence.

357
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,830
She has her uses.

358
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,860
Once the banquet is over,

359
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,310
she'll be useless.

360
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,540
I want you

361
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,110
to kill her during the chaos

362
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,590
at the banquet.

363
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,710
In my opinion,

364
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,660
Ye Ping'an

365
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,380
may still be useful in the future.

366
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,110
I'm not asking for your opinion.

367
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,310
Understood.

368
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,740
I will play it by ear.

369
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,020
Since there's nothing else,

370
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,380
you can take your leave.

371
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,230
You brought me here

372
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,900
to talk about the banquet,

373
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,070
didn't you?

374
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Do you really think

375
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,140
it's the right time

376
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,350
to take action during the banquet?

377
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,110
I understand all your reasons,

378
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,860
but I just can't

379
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,990
let this go.

380
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,070
Because of him,

381
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,990
I haven't dared

382
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,900
to return home for years.

383
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,110
Because of me,

384
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,860
my father was criticized

385
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,350
and forced to abandon his life
as a teacher

386
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,470
to be a butcher.

387
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,380
I feared being recognized

388
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,990
would bring him further disgrace.

389
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,950
So all these years,

390
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,140
I'd rather be dead to the world.

391
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,020
Ping'an,

392
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,190
tell me,

393
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,710
how can I not

394
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,260
avenge this with my own hands?

395
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,260
Cailian,

396
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,140
I understand

397
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
what you suffered.

398
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,260
We will definitely

399
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,860
take Li Zongxu's life.

400
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,860
But if you act at the banquet,

401
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,780
you'll put yourself in grave danger.

402
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,780
For a beast like him,

403
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,620
is it worth it?

404
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,740
Cailian,

405
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,220
look at everything

406
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,940
around you.

407
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,900
You have us as your family.

408
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,300
You have Blackie.

409
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,500
And in the future,

410
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,300
there will be even more
good things waiting for you.

411
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,740
Trust me.

412
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,140
Together,

413
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,980
we will make sure Li Zongxu

414
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,860
gets the punishment he deserves.

415
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,580
Tonight's banquet
is under strict security.

416
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,020
Both Langyang Mansion
and the Ministry of Justice

417
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
have dispatched personnel

418
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,980
to ensure safety.

419
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,180
Hesheng,

420
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,140
Wenyu,

421
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,580
you guys

422
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,860
just set a fire near Yihua Street

423
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,540
to create a diversion.

424
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,780
OK.

425
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,380
If the disturbance gets too big,

426
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,820
how will we explain it to Her Majesty?

427
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,860
Her Majesty has gone to Wan'an Mountain

428
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,340
to listen to Master Qiuxuan's
sutra lecture.

429
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,100
Don't worry.

430
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,340
Stay alert

431
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,180
to this hidden alley

432
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,140
and the two surrounding streets.

433
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,260
Li Zongxu has stationed

434
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,020
covert guards here.

435
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,220
Leave the covert guards

436
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,900
to Jin and me.

437
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,500
The banquet begins with the King of Qin
Breaking Up Battle Array Tune,

438
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,060
followed by a performance
from the dancers.

439
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,150
Then,

440
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,710
Li Qianzhao and I

441
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,710
will present the painting.

442
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,710
Before that,

443
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,100
we must switch
the Bleeding Women painting,

444
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,870
the key evidence in the censor case,

445
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,820
with The Grand Peace of the Ages.

446
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,540
Let his son personally present

447
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,580
his crime for all to see.

448
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,990
I wonder how Li Zongxu will feel.

449
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,220
By then,

450
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,980
Cailian and I

451
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,580
will reveal Li Zongxu's crimes.

452
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,190
Once Li Zongxu leaves for the banquet,

453
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,500
I will enter his mansion
to get the evidence

454
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,340
and return it before the divine bird
offering the painting.

455
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,180
In that case,

456
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,300
Wenyu,

457
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,340
do not

458
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,390
go to Yihua Street tonight.

459
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,820
Wait outside the Langyang Mansion

460
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,870
to assist Danxin.

461
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,660
Got it.

462
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,820
This is a golden feather arrow

463
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,260
specially crafted by Langyang Mansion.

464
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,780
Since he wants to frame you,

465
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,500
we will turn his scheme

466
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,820
against him

467
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,260
and catch him red-handed.

468
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,100
Good.

469
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,500
I'll make the arrangements.

470
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,580
During the banquet,

471
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,060
I will patrol the hall

472
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,540
in case of any unexpected incidents.

473
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,630
Make sure

474
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,060
to be cautious.

475
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,540
Gu Wenyu.

476
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,670
That scoundrel!

477
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,710
I know what you're going to say.

478
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,870
I dare to show you my scars

479
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,150
because I've made up my mind.

480
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,710
Gu Wenyu,

481
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,020
I want to be with you.

482
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,710
Now that you've said it,

483
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,500
you can't take it back

484
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,910
or change your mind.

485
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,540
From now on,

486
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,180
you can't just

487
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,190
treat me well.

488
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:37,780
You have to take care of...

489
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,700
Blackie.

490
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,340
You always put

491
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,060
Blackie first.

492
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,470
Should I let it sleep on the bed

493
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,260
while I sleep on the floor?

494
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,670
Nonsense.

495
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:00,780
You don't like it?

496
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,300
That's not it.

497
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,190
I grew up

498
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,990
herding with my father

499
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,910
and learning to tame animals.

500
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,150
I'm used to being around animals.

501
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,710
They come and go freely,

502
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,950
meeting and parting as fate allows.

503
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,340
I never thought

504
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,870
I'd spend my life with a man.

505
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,060
Now that it's happening,

506
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,540
it feels a bit surreal.

507
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:24,990
You can think of me

508
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,870
as a pet.

509
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,260
You'll get used to it in time.

510
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,060
Cailian,

511
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,580
once the villains are taken down,

512
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,710
we'll go back to Tongquan County

513
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,500
to bring your father to the capital.

514
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,540
That way,

515
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,390
you won't feel homesick anymore.

516
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,020
It's a deal.

517
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,710
It's getting late.

518
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,710
I need to go make preparations.

519
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,540
Gu Wenyu,

520
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:54,740
I like it

521
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,190
very much.

522
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,670
Everyone, come here.

523
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,230
I have something to tell you.

524
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,060
It's from Gu Wenyu.

525
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,540
Looks like Cailian

526
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,580
finally finds

527
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,710
her happiness.

528
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,780
I heard from Ping'an too.

529
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,300
Gu Wenyu seems like a good guy.

530
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,430
He is kind and steady.

531
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,870
I'm truly happy for you.

532
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,430
Congratulations.

533
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,300
Thanks.

534
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,580
Xin Jun?

535
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,060
Why are you coming
from the gambling house?

536
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:58,950
Good timing.

537
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,100
I couldn't figure out

538
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,260
some of the accounts.

539
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,500
Zhao Yu isn't around,

540
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,820
so I came to ask you.

541
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,340
The accounts can wait.

542
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,630
Now,

543
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,340
put everything aside

544
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,630
and let's have a drink.

545
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,580
Any great things happened?

546
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,740
It's nothing particularly special.

547
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,430
We're about to do something big

548
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,580
to punish evil

549
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,670
and expose a hypocrite.

550
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,300
Wenyu.

551
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,950
Wait, Wenyu.

552
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,340
I used to be a night soil worker,

553
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,340
but I have many skills.

554
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,430
Didn't you say

555
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,500
we're family now?

556
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,100
I can help with any dirty

557
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,540
or tough work.

558
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,390
Alright then.

559
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,500
We need someone to start a fire tonight.

560
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,190
Come with us.

561
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,060
Got it.

562
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,580
Shaocheng,

563
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,230
you've

564
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,910
always wanted to rise to power.

565
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,740
If that day ever comes,

566
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,780
what kind of life

567
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,990
do you want to live?

568
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,230
I don't know.

569
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,580
I've never thought about it.

570
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,470
I just don't want
the people in Mang Gutter

571
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,910
to live like this anymore.

572
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,630
A month ago,

573
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,020
I saw...

574
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,500
Stop right there!

575
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,500

What are you doing?

577
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,990
She just picked up some books.

578
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,430
If she loves reading, let her.

579
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,630
Why are you burning them?

580
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,430
Books are only good

for making firewood, aren't they?

582
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,020
If she reads too much,

583
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,470
she'll have ambitions beyond her place.

584
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,670
She's too young

585
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,950
to understand

586
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,150
she's destined

587
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,150
to be a servant,

588
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,190
nothing more.

589
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,060
Better to crush her hope now

590
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,230
than let it grow.

591
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,150
No, don't.

592
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:29,990
Don't burn them.

593
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,430
Stay out of this!

594
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:31,820
Let go!

Mr. Gu,

596
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,150
I've heard of a grass

597
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,100
so resilient

598
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,340
that it can survive anywhere,

599
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,950
because it knows when to bend

600
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,150
and when to stand tall.

601
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,540
And sometimes, bending

602
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,910
is the harder choice.

603
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,500
I am willing to be the one
who bends when needed.

604
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,870
I hope one day,

605
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,630
the oppressed people in Mang Gutter

606
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,260
can finally stand tall.

607
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,670
I really hope

608
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,910

Remember,

616
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,630
as soon as you set the fire,

617
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,630
get away.

618
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:22,910

Isn't tonight for celebrating?

623
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,630
I thought I'd close up early

624
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,340
and take my child
to join the festivities.

625
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,910
That's too stinky.

Come on.

Welcoming guests with a military tune,

637
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,580
is this meant to show
that we are unwelcome?

638
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,820
Your Excellency, you got us wrong.

The marriage alliance
of Great Feng and Shuodan

640
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,260
is a bond between equals.

You won the favor
of the Princess from Shuodan.

Doesn't that

667
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,670
mean anything to you?

673
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,390

that Princess Jiayue
appreciates this dance.

687

without a true general leading it

Stepping onto the stage
to show his skills

707
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,470

nor any merits.

718

Her Majesty allowed me
to hold this banquet tonight

not only

727
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,020
to welcome the envoys

728
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,260
but also to provide an opportunity

729
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,540
for the brilliant talents of Great Feng

730
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,500

733
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,820
I noticed earlier

734
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,060
that Princess Jiayue

735
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,910
seems quite fond of General Wu.

736
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,260
Why not

737
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,580
start with him?

738
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,470
I am so flattered.

739
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,950
Many here today

740
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,710
are talented in both
civil and military arts.

741
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,300
I have no intention of competing.

742
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,150
Sounds like

you

744
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,580
haven't made any preparations.

745
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,630
Wouldn't that

746
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,150
be a disappointment
to Her Majesty's goodwill?

747
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:10,870
It looks like

748
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,540
Li Zongxu is deliberately

749
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,820
making things difficult for Wu Ankang.

750
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,950
Don't worry.

751
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,670
The Wu family wouldn't come unprepared.

752
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,260
They're Li Zongxu's covert guards.

753
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,630
Go around from the back.

754
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,020
Yes.

755
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,950
My brother has spent years

at war

757
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,740
and only returned
to the capital for days.

758
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,300
He hasn't had the time
to concern himself with formalities.

759
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,390
However, today,

760
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,100
I've taken the liberty

761
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,150
to prepare a gift

762

I have long heard that Princess Jiayue

765
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,060
is the brightest star of Shuodan.

766
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,260
And my brother

767
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,820
is often called the sun.

768
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,060
Both stars and the sun shine brightly.

769
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,620
Thus,

770
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,540
this jade carving

771
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,910
features a luminous pearl as the star

772
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,350
and gold-thread jade as the sun.

773
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,020
I hope you will like it.

774
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,750
Miss Wu,

775
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,220
it's such an impressive gift.

776
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,060
But it seems

777
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,830
that they do not shine together.

778
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,500
If Princess Jiayue is a star,

779
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,620
then only the moon

780
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,270
can be her true companion.

781
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,660
Your gift

782
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,700
may not be appropriate.

783
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,270
The candidates for prince consort

784
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,430
are not limited to me alone.

785
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,790
Prince of Langyang
showing such favor toward me

786
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:48,790
and the Wu family

787
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,750
would indeed go against

788
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,790
Her Majesty's true intentions.

789
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,950
General Wu makes a point.

790
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,660
Just now, a gentleman mentioned

791
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,790
he had also prepared a gift.

792
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:00,950
Why not

793
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,310
invite him

794
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,540
to show his gift?

795
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:09,830
Your Highness,

796
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,660
aside from
the Breaking Up Battle Array Tune,

797
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,990
I have also prepared other dances.

798
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,830
Shall we enjoy the performance first

799
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
and see the gifts afterward?

800
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,060
Come on,

801
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:18,950
play the music.

802
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,910
Once this dance ends,

803
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,020
Li Qianzhao will begin
his gift presentation.

804
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,060
We're running out of time.

805
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,870
I'll go out to meet Wenyu,

806
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,990
then take the painting

807
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,310
to the side hall for Cailian.

808
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:53,990
Stop!

809
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,310
Why is he here ahead of time?

810
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,910
The Bleeding Women painting
hasn't arrived yet.

811
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,950
Go get prepared.

812
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,910
Once the dance ends,

813
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,270
I will...

814
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:17,950
Here I am.

815
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,950
What are you still doing here?

816
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,180
I can't find my whistle.

817
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,660
What did you say?

818
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,660
Calm down.

819
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,910
I haven't left the room today,

820
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,020
so it must be here.

821
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,430
I won't delay your performance.

822
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,350
Listen,

823
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,540
if that little beast

824
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,580
doesn't bring my painting

825
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,430
and flies into the hall

826
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,180
right after the dance,

827
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,620
I'll throw both of you

828
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,620
into the mountains

829
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,220
to feed the wolves.

830
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,910
How did a night soil worker

831
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,830
end up in the inner courtyard

832
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,220
for no reason?

833
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,700
The previous night soil worker fell ill.

834
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,580
I was sent to take his place.

835
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,140
It's my first time at this mansion.

836
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,100
I was looking for a water source

837
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,830
and got lost.

838
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,100
Sneaking around like this,

839
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,390
you look more like a thief.

840
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,140
Sir,

841
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,470
you got me wrong!

842
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,310
I...

843
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,540
I'm just a humble worker.

844
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,870
No need to dirty your hands.

845
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,910
Seems you often do rough work.

846
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,540
Go ahead.

847
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,790
The water source is that way.

848
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,060
Thank you, sir.

849
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,100
Thank you.

850
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,020
Yuan Shaocheng?

851
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:01,910
Instead of patrolling

852
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,830
the banquet hall,

853
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,540
why are you here?

854
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,100
How do you know

855
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,540
I wasn't following you?

856
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,020
You left abruptly

857
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,540
and acted suspiciously.

858
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,060
Are you planning

859
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,430
something improper?

860
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,870
Don't try to accuse me.

861
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,470
Tonight's banquet

862
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,870
was organized entirely by my father.

863
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,220
Naturally, I can do as I please.

864
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,950
But you,

865
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,950
who skulk in the shadows,

866
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,470
have no right to question me.

867
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,580
Don't get in my way.

868
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,020
Move.

869
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,910
I just made a casual remark,

870
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,750
yet you're so worked up.

871
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,310
I don't even need to question you.

872
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,270
You!

873
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,910
Filthy rat.

874
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,700
I'll deal with you later.

875
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,700
Mr. Yuan.

876
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,350
Your Highness,

877
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,270
please

878
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,790
excuse me.

879
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,790
Please continue enjoying the dance.

880
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,910
I'll return soon.

881
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,580
Go ahead.

882
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,700
- Good.
- Great.

883
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,790
This dance
and the Breaking Up Battle Array Tune

884
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,620
represent strength and grace,

885
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,950
each with its own charm.

886
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,140
However,

887
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,220
I'm still curious about the gift

888
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,390
Qianzhao mentioned earlier.

889
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,470
What kind of exquisite treasure
could it be?

890
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,990
Princess Jiayue,

891
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,750
would you allow us

892
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:41,910
to feast our eyes with the treasure?

893
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,540
- Exactly.
- True.

894
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,270
Your Highness,

895
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,060
tonight's grand banquet

896
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,830
has already shown
the Prince of Langyang's generosity.

897
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,620
I bet Mr. Li's gift

898
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,700
must be just as extraordinary.

899
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,430
Let us see it, then.

900
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,870
Since Her Majesty unified the realm,

901
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,020
she has governed
with diligence and wisdom

902
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,950
to bring about an era
when all nations submit,

903
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,100
and envoys of each nation
pay their visits.

904
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:19,750
Today,

905
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,470
the peace between Great Feng and Shuodan

906
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,020
is the will of both parties.
