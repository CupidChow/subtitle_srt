3
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,240
Miss Ye,

4
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,740
the Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review

5
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,640
has summoned you for questioning.

6
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,550
Questioning?

7
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,200
I don't know the specifics either.

8
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,320
Please come with me.

[Court of Judicial Review]

10
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,960
Mr. Guo, my greetings.

11
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,710
The woman in front of you

12
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,800
claims to be a victim of the Censor case

13
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,590
and that this case is related to you.

14
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,640
Miss Ye,

15
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,200
what is your response?

16
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,390
In this case,

17
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,320
there were indeed three women

18
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,270
who were lured into the abandoned house

19
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,870
by my mesmerization technique.

20
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,640
Who were they

21
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,960
and are they still alive?

22
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,360
In recent years,

23
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,480
I have only seen two of them.

24
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,920
One named Ruan Qin,

25
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,110
has been gone for more than a decade.

26
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,830
The other

27
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,550
is the woman standing before you,

28
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,640
Lu Danxin.

29
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,710
If one

30
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,710
is the victim here,

31
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,960
doesn't that leave the other

32
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,680
as the responsible party?

33
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,390
At that time, Miss Ye was still a child

34
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,680
who was deceived,

35
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,200
so she could
be considered a victim, too.

36
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,910
The person who used you back then.

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,960
Was it Yu Qian

38
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,880
or Du Liang?

39
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,230
Du Liang.

40
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,520
Zheng Yuan took me to see Du Liang.

41
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,390
I saw with my own eyes that Qi Junshan

42
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,470
had the abandoned house burned down.

43
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,080
Du Liang, Zheng Yuan, Qi Junshan.

44
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,320
That's strange.

45
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,200
How could these three people

46
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,390
so coincidentally die

47
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,640
one after another this year?

48
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,030
I do remember Miss Ye

49
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,120
being imprisoned twice

50
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,390
because of Zheng Yuan and Du Liang,

51
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,150
which inevitably

52
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,320
makes people think.

53
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,910
They have committed numerous evil deeds

54
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,390
and are insatiable in their greed

55
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,150
for wealth,

56
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,270
power,

57
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,470
and fame.

58
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,520
They bled the people dry

59
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,910
and weakened the country.

60
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,790
I'm sure even heaven

61
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,910
couldn't bear to watch it anymore.

62
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,910
Your position was conferred
by Her Majesty,

63
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,790
and the Censor case involves
the previous dynasty.

64
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,200
Now there are witnesses,

65
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,520
but no physical evidence.

66
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,470
About your wish to overturn this case,

67
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,640
I cannot make a decision.

68
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,080

Leaf. Leave.
[*"Leaf" alludes to the Ye surname.]

78
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,000
Her Majesty has decreed that,

79
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,960
due to the deaths of Du Liang,

80
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,350
Zheng Yuan, and Qi Junshan,

81
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,270
whom you accused,

82
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,760
and the lack of corroborating evidence,

83
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,230
the Court of Judicial Review

84
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,710
must first verify your claims

85
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,790
and secure evidence

86
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,000
before the Censor case can be reopened.

87
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,520
Her Majesty has decreed that,

88
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,880
Ye Ping'an was previously involved
in the Zheng Yuan case,

89
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,790
and after taking up the position,

90
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
she concealed old matters.

91
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,680
Her intention is doubtful.

92
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,880
She cannot set an example for officials.

93
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,150
Therefore,

94
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,960
she is stripped of her position

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,880
and demoted to a civilian.

96
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,710

Mr. Guo, are you sure

99
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,470
that the meaning of this leaf

100
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,680
is just to demote her

101
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,710

102
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
I am not particularly astute.

103
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,000
This is my understanding

any further interpretations,

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,350
I would advise you
to seek clarification from Her Majesty.

108
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,760
No.

109

this is a significant case,

113
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,320

I volunteer to preside over the case.

120
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,150
This is an obvious trouble.

121
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,390
Why do you run towards it?

122
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,710
There is no evidence.

123
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,590
And it was many years ago.

124
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,120
People have long had a consensus.

125
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,030
And it's a case settled
by the late ruler.

126
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,080
What will you try to find?

127
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,230
How will you do it?

128
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,830
Will you make it a small case

129
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,160
or a large one?

130
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,080
Her Majesty hasn't instructed clearly.

131
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,630
Do you have a clear plan?

132
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,160
Mr. Guo, you know me.

133
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,510
I wouldn't have taken it on

134
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,870
if I didn't have a plan.

135
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,470
If there are any problems,

136
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,470
I will not implicate you.

for the case.

Do you think

143
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,280
there's anything inappropriate?

144
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,560
Fine.

there are no more incidents.

Mr. Hai had an old friendship
with Yu Qian.

193
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,750
Yu Qian died unjustly.

194
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,110
Mr. Hai endured humiliation

195
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,960
until he found the victim.

196
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,110
Only then did he work with the woman

197
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:08,960
to clear the name of Yu Qian.

198
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,160
This makes sense.

199
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,470
Mr. Hai is truly compassionate
and righteous.

200
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,510
If it weren't for him,

201
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,320
such a big injustice

202
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,080
would have been buried.

203
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,110
The most shameless one

204
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,630
is Ye Ping'an.

205
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,590
I kept quiet

206
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,710
when everyone was bashing him.

207
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,470
Me too.

208
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,960
Never said a bad word about him.

209
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,630
Your flatbreads are ready.

210
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,320
Thank you.

211
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,110
Goodbye.

212
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,280
[Anxin House]

213
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,350
What are you doing?

214
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,200
What do you think we are doing?

215
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,080
You all heard the announcement.

216
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,560
How many people
did Ye Ping'an harm back then?

217
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,080
It's a shame

218
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,040
to be neighbors with someone like her.

219
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,590
Yes.

220
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,230
No one is allowed to come

221
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,040
here for treatment.

222
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,920
We won't come.

223
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,990
But you damaged her property.

224
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,400
That's unreasonable.

225
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,710
What's that supposed to mean?

226
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,990
I saw that you came to see her

227
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,870
for treatment a while ago.

228
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,630
You must be mesmerized.

229
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,960
This woman

230
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,470
can't even be driven away.

231
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,870
If it weren't for the lack of money,

232
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,470
who would be willing
to live so close to her?

233
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,350
We are so unfortunate.

234
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,560
Let's go.

235
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,470
No one shall come here again.

236
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:26,960
Come on.

237
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,350
[Hai Mansion]

238
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,230
You volunteered to take on this case.

239
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,680
Have you decided on how to do it?

240
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,750
I thought you had

241
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,320
seen my loyalty.

242
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,800
I didn't expect you

243
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,800
to still have doubts about me.

244
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,510
No.

245
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,510
You are already my disciple.

246
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,160
In the future,

247
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,870
we will work together in all matters.

248
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,560
I have no doubts about you.

249
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,990
There's one thing

250
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,630
I haven't figured out yet.

251
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,870
Master, why did you

252
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
bring that Lu Danxin
to overturn the case?

253
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,990
The reinvestigation of the Censor case

254
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,630
is like this small flatbread.
Trivial as it is,

255
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,870
it attracts everyone's attention.

256
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,230
Wu Ankang

257
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,160
has been after Xu Qing and Gong Shao

258
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,320
for

259
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,630
this big one.

260
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,920
Even he is

261
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,400
paying attention relentlessly.

262
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,560
Do you think Her Majesty

263
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,920
hasn't noticed?

264
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,350
So you want to use this case

265
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,560
to cover up the salt granary incident.

266
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,920
You have always been

267
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,800
a good official
who sympathizes with the people.

268
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,080
Why do you have to go

269
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,350
to great lengths for these people

270
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,470
who exploit the people's livelihood?

271
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,960
The people need protection.

272
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,440
And the officials also need protection.

273
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,710
In every dynasty,

274
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,510
corruption is being punished.

275
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,750
Yet,

276
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,160
it never ceases.

277
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,280
Shaocheng,

278
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,560
success requires others.

279
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,870
If you choose to be alone,

280
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,710
you will eventually...

281
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,870
Eventually be

282
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,680
like Yu Qian.

283
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:17,870
Right?

284
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,200
But can the people really benefit

285
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,990
from you protecting these officials?

286
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,870
Without being fed first,

287
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,710
how many officials are willing to work?

288
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,160
And if they don't work,

289
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,160
how can

290
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,320
the realm prosper?

291
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,470
So,

292
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,870
one must have a long-term perspective.

293
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,440
Sometimes the people suffer

294
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,990
for the sake of the greater good.

295
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,160
Don't you agree?

296
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,040
Master, your insights

297
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,800
are truly illuminating.

298
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,510
I am also willing

299
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,680
to do things for the greater good.

300
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:55,800
Good.

301
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,960
You are intelligent.

302
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,800
Please excuse me, General Wu.

303
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,920
Do you want to ask
about the announcement?

304
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,870
I don't need to.

305
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,200
I make friends

306
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,870
based on my own feelings,

307
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,160
not what others say.

308
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,400
Do you know about the camp howls?

309
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,920
I've heard of it.

310
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,750
But has it really happened before?

311
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,990
Many years ago,

312
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,110
I encountered it once in the camp.

313
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,440
I remember

314
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,750
everyone was killing enemies
day and night.

315
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,200
The coldness made bones freeze.

316
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,440
And there was a shortage of food.

317
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,920
Everyone was

318
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,960
on the brink of collapse.

319
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,590
Even I gradually

320
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,560
felt despair.

321
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,680
One night,

322
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,510
soldiers' howls suddenly came

323
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,590
from around the camp.

324
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,870
They were tearing at their clothes

325
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,510
as if they had lost their mind.

326
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:04,990
The howls

327
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,350
spread like a plague.

328
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,750
I quickly pulled down a cloth strip

329
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,800
to block my ears,

330
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,440
trying to wake up more people,

331
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,800
but it was too late.

332
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,560
When it ends,

333
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,350
out of six thousand soldiers

334
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,110
only one thousand survived.

335
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,510
Who would have thought

336
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,400
that it could kill more

337
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,800
than the battle?

338
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,320
This incident will be unforgettable

339
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,590
to me for a lifetime.

340
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,080
So, Ye Ping'an,

341
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,400
if you want to fight a big battle,

342
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,280
your spirit

343
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,040
must never collapse.

344
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:41,960
Look.

345
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,710
This wild grass

346
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,040
will have different colors

347
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,110
in different seasons.

348
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,350
Green in spring

349
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,590
and yellow in autumn.

350
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,630
But...

351
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,870
But always,

352
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,400
it comes to persevering

353
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,470
and tenacious growth,

354
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,710
right?

355
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:00,960
Thank you.

356
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,360
If everyone's heart were

357
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,600
as pure

358
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,710
and flawless as a camellia,

359
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,230
wouldn't everything

360
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,880
be much simpler?

361
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,070
Who isn't born pure?

362
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,750
After going through the dirt
of the world,

363
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,790
people start to lose their innocence.

364
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,710
Yan knows nothing about the world.

365
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,470
I used to think it was unfortunate,

366
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,840
but every time

367
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,200
I saw the dirt,

368
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,030
when I returned home

369
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,070
and saw her

370
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,880
being so naive,

371
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,710
I felt like

372
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,710
I had been cleansed.

373
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,230
Mr. Hai, for the sake of fame,

374
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,230
you can really overturn right and wrong.

375
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,120
Already, even the maids are starting

376
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,120
to talk about

377
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,710
how you stepped forward

378
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,360
and helped me overturn the case.

379
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,600
I didn't do anything.

380
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,680
It's just
that there are too many people.

381
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,070
During the investigation,

382
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,070
news

383
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,120
inevitably leaked.

384
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,270
I have helped you

385
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,710
achieve what you requested.

386
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,960
As you can see,

387
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,510
without physical evidence,

388
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,200
based on a sudden confession,

389
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,640
it is difficult
for the Court of Judicial Review

390
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,270
to overturn a verdict.

391
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,200
However, with the letter from Yu Qian

392
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,120
as the evidence,

393
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,270
it will be much easier

394
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,230
to overturn the verdict.

395
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,600
Tell me,

396
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,880
Mr. Hai,

397
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,070
what do you want me to do next?

398
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,990
Her Majesty cherishes talent.

399
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,750
Even Guo Yu can tell

400
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,380
that what happened to Du Liang

401
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,250
is related to Ye Ping'an.

402
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
Her Majesty must have known that,

403
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,140
but didn't give her severe punishment.

404
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,620
But if Ye Ping'an's actions go too far,

405
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,860
maybe even against Her Majesty's will,

406
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,290
then her life

407
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,700
will not

408
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,810
be spared again.

409
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
Lian.

410
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
Lian.

411
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,770
Why did you come out?

412
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,620
Has Lian returned?

413
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,860
Go find her.

414
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,090
It's time for dinner.

415
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,570
There will be a big moon tonight.

416
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,620
It's only been a few good days.

417
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,730
You're confused again.

418
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,090
Hasn't your daughter...

419
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,250
Never mind.

420
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,420
I'll go find her now.

421
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,940
Go back to your room.

422
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,810
Don't wander around.

423
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,290
Be good.

424
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,380
Come on.

425
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,420
Take it easy. Careful.

426
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,220
Lian.

427
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:13,620
Mr. Hai.

428
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,770
Tonight, Her Majesty and the officials

429
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,620
will admire the moon
at the Eternal Pavilion.

430
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,250
So what is your plan?

431
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,420
Then,

432
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,290
all the soldiers
guarding Li Zongxu's mansion

433
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,770
will be mobilized.

434
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,980
I want you

435
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,490
to bring him
to the gate tower of Changxia Gate.

436
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,900
Holding hostage
of a royal member is a felony.

437
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,380
Why should I seek my own death?

438
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,220
Of course not.

439
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,660
I want you to invite Ye Ping'an

440
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,770
there as well.

441
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,940
When Her Majesty and I
arrive at the Changxia Gate,

442
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,220
you will take the opportunity

443
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,860
to kill Li Zongxu

444
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,330
and then frame Ye Ping'an.

445
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,090
This way,

446
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,660
the crime will have

447
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,730
nothing to do with you.

448
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,620
Ye Ping'an is eloquent.

449
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,090
I'm not entirely confident.

450
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,180
I'm afraid

451
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,860
she might even turn the tide.

452
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,180
Don't worry about that.

453
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,380
I will have the men
of the Court of Judicial Review

454
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,620
on standby in the gate tower.

455
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,090
Upon the death of Li Zongxu,

456
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,700
her guilt will be unforgivable.

457
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,860
She will be executed on the spot.

458
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,140
How can a person

459
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,010
defend herself?

460
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,090
In front of both Her Majesty

461
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,620
and the people,

462
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,460
Mr. Hai is about to

463
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,090
put on a really impressive show.

464
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,330
Miss Ye?

465
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,620
Miss Ye,

466
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,050
I've heard what happened.

467
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,490
Are you all right?

468
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,180
Mr. Cai,

469
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,570
am I still a friend to you?

470
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,620
I am a businessman

471
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,900
who is all about loyalty.

472
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,090
No matter what others say,

473
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:49,940
I have made up my mind

474
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:50,940
to be your friend.

475
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,090
Are you here to see Chang Qing?

476
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,900
Yeah.

477
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,980
How is he?

478
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:57,980
Well...

479
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,860
He's in

480
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,810
and out of it.

481
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,380
You know what? He knows today

482
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,730
is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

483
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,380
This is...

484
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,730
A friend of Miss Ye.

485
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,090
Then come together.

486
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,250
More people equals more joy.

487
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,620
Come on.

488
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,570
So when you saw

489
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,180
the no-word coins,

490
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,420
you actually knew

491
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,010
your true thoughts inside.

492
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,860
The Mei alliance
has not yet favored me.

493
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,490
The person who is highly valued

494
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,530
is still Hai Yiping.

495
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,810
To gain their favor,

496
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,250
I must first cut off
their right-hand man.

497
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,530
Is it that difficult
to say that you want

498
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,330
to take my side?

499
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,940
I think you have guessed it, too.

500
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,420
Lu Danxin made a deal

501
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,330
with Hai Yiping.

502
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,010
She plans to trade your life

503
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,460
for a chance

504
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,860
to overturn the verdict for Yu Qian.

505
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,940
So you guessed that they would go

506
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,570
to the Court of Judicial Review.

507
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,810
I also learned Hai Yiping's plan

508
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:14,730
through his words.

509
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,330
He planned to take action tonight.

510
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,140
I know.

511
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,330
How did you know?

512
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,660
Danxin sent me a message this morning,

513
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:22,900
inviting me

514
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,220
to meet at the Changxia Gate tonight.

515
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,010
She said she wanted to end everything.

516
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,940
Li Zongxu will also be here.

517
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,810
I must go.

518
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,050
Steamed pork.

519
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,700
Eggplants.

520
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,570
Black rice congee.

521
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,420
Qing,

522
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,050
they're your favorite.

523
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:00,810
Be patient.

524
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,900
Just a moment.

525
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:04,700
Come on.

526
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,380
Try the dishes I prepared.

527
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,460
See if they're good.

528
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,460
Here.

529
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,940
Try it.

530
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,810
See if I'm a good cook.

531
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,140
What's wrong?

532
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:23,860
Nothing.

533
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,810
I just feel a sense

534
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,140
of home now.

535
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:39,810
It tastes good.

536
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,810
Good.

537
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,620
Yiping,

538
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,900
you took the victimized woman
to file the lawsuit.

539
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,570
It finally gave hope for an overturn

540
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,530
of the Censor case.

541
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,810
The more I think about it,

542
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,380
the happier I get.

543
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,380
That is what I should do.

544
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,250
Ye Ping'an

545
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,980
is quite pitiful.

546
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,050
She was used

547
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,900
to create such a tragic thing.

548
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,660
How did she

549
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,250
get through all these years?

550
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,300
Mother,

551
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,810
this is such a joyous occasion.

552
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,340
Could we perhaps leave
the past behind us?

553
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,340
I wish you good health

554
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,700
and an endless life.

555
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,340
Good.

556
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,020
Yan.

557
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:29,980
Mother,

558
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,140
good health to you.

559
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,620
Okay. Yan, come on.

560
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,050
Careful.

561
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,940
Watch your step.

562
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:41,940
Take it easy.

563
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,180
Lian.

564
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,180
Lian,

565
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,700
why are you back so late?

566
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,220
I missed you so much.

567
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,620
Yeah, father,

568
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,330
I'm home.

569
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,810
Let's celebrate the festival

570
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,810
with something nice.

571
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,460
Okay.

572
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,900
Let's take a seat.

573
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:01,810
Here, come on.

574
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,330
Look how silly I am.

575
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,290
Tonight,

576
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,420
there are a few customers

577
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,530
that I need to socialize with.

578
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,090
I've completely forgotten about it.

579
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,380
You guys go ahead.

586
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:26,900
so you've found

587
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,620
someone you adore.

588
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,730
Why did you hide it from me?

589
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:35,570
Sir,

590
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,250
sorry for my fault.

591
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
I was planning to visit you

592
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,660
on a special day,

593
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,900
so I didn't let her tell you.

594
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:42,980
It's so good to have you here.

595
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,010

Lian,

598
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:47,940
look at how thin you are.

599
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,660
You need to eat more.

600
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,810
Eat more meat.

601
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
And more vegetables.

602
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,860
Only then can you be healthy.

603
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,330
Right?

604
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,380
Yes.

606
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,140
answer me.

607
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,940
Have you ever mistreated my daughter?

608
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:03,810
Sir,

609
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,140
how dare I?

610
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,010
Lian is so smart.

611
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,180
I would be glad

612
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,180
if she didn't mistreat me.

613
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,250
Lian

614
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,620
is both capable and intelligent.

615
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,940
She is sure to have great success
in the future.

Okay.

It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,220
Come on, let's drink.

627

629
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,220
I thought

630
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,660
I would be alone without my aunt

631
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,140
and Danxin by my side.

632
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,090

633
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,530
I even had a family dinner?

in the name of debt repayment.

00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,340
that you copied,

744
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,690
it appears that the money
taken by Xu Qing and others

745
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,420
is related to this trader.

746
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,210
Xu Qing has been using cheap items

747
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:19,900

the illicit money

751
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,610
from reselling
official salt is justified.

752
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,980
That's really cunning.

753
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,900

754
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,490

758
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,420

764
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,610
one of his recommended officials
violates the laws,

765
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,740
it opens the door

766
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,610
to investigating him.

767
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,300
We have no time.

768
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,820
Hai Yiping is going to take action

769
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,090
against Ye Ping'an tonight.

770
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:51,940
I can't let

771
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,900
the Mei alliance find out

772
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,340
that I am investigating it
behind their backs.

773
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,740
Hand over the evidence

774
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,780
to Wu Ankang as soon as possible.

775
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:57,900
So what do we do?

776
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,340
Tonight, you will sneak

777
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,380
into Hai Mansion

778
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,130
and copy everyone's

779
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:02,860
recommendation list.

780
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,170
Do not miss a single one.

781
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:05,820
Yes, sir.

782
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,340
- Great.
- Amazing.

783
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:17,610
- Wonderful.
- Splendid!

784
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,380
One more.

785
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:25,980
- Good!
- Excellent!

786
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:28,650
Amazing.

787
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:29,900
Excuse me.

788
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,340
Brother,

789
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,210
I didn't expect

790
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,170
so many novel things in the capital.

791
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,650
It's so lively.

792
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,300
Trust me.

793
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,420
Once I save enough money,

794
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,170
I will

795
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,170
bring you all over.

796
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,650
- Wonderful.
- Superb!

797
00:36:59,210 --> 00:36:59,610
Great.

798
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:17,940
Tonight,

799
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,740
the moon shines bright,

800
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,380
with no clouds in the sky,

801
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,900
symbolizing

802
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,980
a blessing upon the land.

803
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,340
When Her Majesty sees this,

804
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,610
she will be greatly pleased.

805
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,050
Mr. Guo, you are right.

806
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,380
All the wealth and prosperity

807
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,570
are a blessing of Her Majesty.

808
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,300
Mr. Hai.

809
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:35,980
What is it?

810
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,090
A servant reported

811
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,380
that Li Zongxu had been kidnapped.

812
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,940
Ye Ping'an showed up at Changxia Gate

813
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,420
and openly held
the Prince of Langyang hostage,

814
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,010
claiming

815
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,130
that he was involved in the Censor case

816
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,340
and she'd kill him in front of everyone

817
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,820
to vent her anger.

818
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,820
How dare Ye Ping'an do this?

819
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,610
Mr. Guo,

820
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,740
when urgency demands,
authority commands.

821
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,010
I think you need to deploy troops

822
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,170
to prevent any unforeseen situation.

823
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,090
You go ahead.

824
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,380
Mr. Yuan,

825
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,130
Mr. Hai has a message for you.

826
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,980
As soon as Li Zongxu dies,

827
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,860
shoot to kill Ye Ping'an

828
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,340
right away.

829
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,420
Regardless of the reason,

830
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,340
Ye Ping'an's

831
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,380
public kidnapping of the Li family

832
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,940
shows a complete disregard

833
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:36,980
for Great Feng's laws.

834
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,380
It is truly rebellious

835
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,250
and unforgivable.

836
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,090
Your Majesty,

837
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,530
to maintain order,

838
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,500
the Court of Judicial Review
should execute her

839
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,690
as a deterrent.

840
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,610
I want to see

841
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,690
if she dares to commit the crime

842
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,090
in front of me.

843
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,500
I shall proceed

844
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,900
to Changxia Gate.

845
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:55,610
Your Majesty,

846
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,530
the ministers are waiting...

847
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,730
With all this turmoil,

848
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,250
what is there to admire?

849
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,940
What are you looking at?

850
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,460
A dead rat.

851
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,340
What's so interesting about that?

852
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,980
That is the wisdom of mice.

853
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,780
Do you know the secret

854
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,780
of the best hunter?

855
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,730
They disguise themselves

856
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,170
as prey.

857
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,130
You have known Gui for many years,

858
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,380
so I can only

859
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,900
ask you to do this.

860
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:45,900
Ping'an,

861
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,170
I remember everything

862
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,500
you told me

863
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,820
to tell Hai Yiping.

864
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,460
But have you ever thought about it?

865
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,170
If you reveal yourself,

866
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,420
the world will turn against you.

867
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,820
Then, for this very reason,

868
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,380
Hai Yiping will take action.

869
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,730
His trap

870
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,170
will become his tomb.

871
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,530
Gui,

872
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,610
when I start this,

873
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,300
Danxin will have nowhere else to go,

874
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,610
but come for you.

875
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,500
I need you to instruct her

876
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,780
to pretend to assassinate Hai Yiping.

877
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,730
This is a dangerous plan.

878
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,940
Have you figured out a way out?

879
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,050
I have.

880
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,900
Exactly because it's dangerous,

881
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,820
I need you to leave

882
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,050
with my aunt.
