00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,830
that I didn't want to tell you.

198
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,870
I was afraid

199
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,990
of dragging you into it.

200
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,440
The military fund is a pretty big deal,

201
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,560
but you didn't tell me about it.

202
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,230
Do you

203
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,870
trust me at all?

I'm the elder brother,

205
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,110
but I can't protect you,

206
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,160

Is that what you mean?

it is confirmed.

Yes, sir.

of service to the Imperial Court,

have finally reached
this inevitable conclusion.

226
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,710
I've sent the administrator of Luozhou

227
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,080
a secret message about the fund.

That's why tomorrow,

301
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,190
is higher than Du Liang's?

302
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,590
Have you ever thought about

303

the price you are going to pay?

304
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,230
When you decided

305
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,620
to be part of the power struggle,

306
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,860
did you ask yourself

307
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,070
the same question?

308
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,380
After you bring Du Liang down
with Mr. Hai,

309
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,310
you will be on the side
of the Mei alliance,

All I know

314
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,710
is that it's not likely to be you.

After all,

316
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,590

without someone as crazy as you.

318
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,100

320
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,060

You can sleep better.

324

00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,100
A sleeping bell.

326

Its ringing sound

327
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,780
can make you drowsy.

328
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,580
You will know when you try it.

329
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:36,820

but in fact,

they are greedy and insatiable.

363

They even lay their hands
on the military fund.

something serious tonight.

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,430
All we need is to enjoy the tea.

388
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,390
Do you understand me?

389
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,580
The courtyard

390
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,020
will be fine?

391
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,430
Of course.

392
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,710
However,

393
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,190
I do need you to send Li Jun

394
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,260
a message.

395
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,020
The people of Mang Gutter

396
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,740
are born

397
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,910
with the lowest status.

398
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,670
We eat the leftovers

399
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,430
and do the least respected job.

400
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,100
I tried

401
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,300
to endure it

402
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,020
and be tolerant,

403
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,540
but when I took one step back,

404
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,100
others would push me further

405
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,390
and challenge my limits.

406
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,190
That's why

407
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,230
there is no step back.

408
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,710
In the eyes of people like Du Liang,

409
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,060
we are

410
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,540
the rats in the gutter,

411
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,430
as if anyone can spit

412
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,230
and step on us.

413
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,260
But tonight,

414
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,670
I'm going to

415
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,020
show them

416
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,500
how the meek

417
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,670
defeat the mighty.

418
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,060
Go!

419
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,910
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

422
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,990
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

423
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,990
Hesheng,

424
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,990
no one is in the backyard.

425
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,430
Thank you.

426
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,870
Go.

427
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:28,990
Let's go.

428
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:51,710
Go.

429
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:57,990
Fire!

430
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,430
Go. Notice Mr. Du.

431
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,020
Yes.

432
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,060
Help!

433
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,020

434
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,100
Help!

435
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,710
It's on fire!

436
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,060
- It's on fire!
- Go.

437
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:06,670
Go.

438
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,540
Hurry.

439
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,470
It's on fire!

440
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,470
The storeroom is on fire.

441
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,670
- Put out the fire.
- Go.

442
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,260
Hurry up!

444
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,150
Put out the fire!

445
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:47,740
Let's go.

446
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,500
Go.

447
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,060
Be careful.

448
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:53,910
Open it.

449
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:13,710

Master!

451
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:16,870
Master,

452
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,670
there is an accident.

453
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,990
The mansion is on fire.

[Du Mansion]

455
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,470
Master.

456
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,340
Yuan Shaocheng!

457
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,060
Who is that?

458
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,710
Ye Ping'an?

459
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,540
I see.

460
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,230
Yuan Shaocheng is with the Mei alliance.

461
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,230
You are working together

462
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,740
to frame me with the military fund.

463
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,150
Well done.

464
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,390
You did take

465
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,780
the 5,000 Liang

466
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,020
for yourself,

467
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,230
didn't you?

468
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,340
We didn't exactly frame you.

469
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,470
I see.

470
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,870
You sent the letter

471
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,710
to Zheng Yuan.

472
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,710
Du Liang,

473
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,710
the amount you took over the years

474
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,990
is even greater.

475
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,540
This is one of the books

476
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,340
from Qi Junshan's gambling houses.

477
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,100
You are only a commissioner.

478
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,870
How dare you

479
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,540
frame me

480
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,870
with some fake accounts?

481
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,630
Fake accounts?

482
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,950
People of the Court of Judicial Review

483
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,990
are now in Qi Junshan's gambling houses

484
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,260
to capture Qi Junshan and his men.

485
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,190
They will look into
each of the gambling houses

486
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,190
and interrogate everyone.

487
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,580
All your suspicious accounts

488
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,500
and all the money
you took from the people

489
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,470
will be revealed eventually.

490
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,340
They did it

491
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,340
without telling me.

492
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,470
I'm in the dark!

493
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,230
Mr. Du, you can

494
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,060
save it

495
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,150
for the Court.

496
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,100
By the way,

497
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,300
your sworn son Qi Junshan

498
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,230
has promised to be the witness

499
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,870
in order to keep his own life.

500
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,540
It must hurt worse

501
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,060
when he is turning against you.

502
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,260
Everyone can betray me,

503
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,710
but not Qi Junshan,

504
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,870
because if he does that,

505
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,990
he will die sooner.

506
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,340
He knows that!

507
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,540
Guard it well.

508
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,700
No one

509
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,850
can escape tonight.

510
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,700
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

511
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,330
Mr. Du, do you know

512
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,500
why I made such an effort

513
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,770
to put the military fund
in your mansion?

514
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,460
You want to get

515
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,130
conclusive evidence, right?

516
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,130
This is only half of the reason.

517
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
There's more to it.

518
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:44,900
How do you feel

519
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,290
about finding the embezzled money
at your own place?

520
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,740
Isn't it

521
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,090
surprising and familiar?

522
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,610
Let me remind you.

523
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,740
An eye for an eye.

524
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,290
A tooth for a tooth.

525
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:17,980
Are you...

526
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,330
Does it ring a bell?

527
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,460
The feeling of being framed

528
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,570
must be good, right?

529
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,090
Over a decade ago,

530
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,980
you took the lives
of more than one hundred people.

531
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,530
Now, it is your time to pay.

532
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,130
Who are you?

533
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,260
Who are you?

534
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,740
I heard

535
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,980
you could make people

536
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,220
listen to you.

537
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,090
I heard

538
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,500
you could make people

539
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,050
listen to you.

540
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,130
You are the girl from the Gu family.

541
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,900
No way.

542
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,660
She is dead.

543
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,260
She is dead!

544
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,260
Here.

545
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,090
Where did Qing go?

546
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,660
What happened in the abandoned house

547
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,900
has made a mess in the county.

548
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,180
She needs to stop wandering off.

549
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,460
That's true.

550
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,610
It's not safe out there.

551
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,290
It's troublesome.

552
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,570
Hey,

553
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,330
come here.

554
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:45,570
Come in.

555
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:45,940
Come.

556
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,420
You must be hungry.

557
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,220
Here you go.

558
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,420
Lots of homeless people

559
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,260
and orphans

560
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,050
out there.

561
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,330
That's right.

562
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,180
Father.

563
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,810
Mother!

564
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,530
Mother!

565
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,130
Mother!

566
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,260
Qing,

567
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,050
go to Wuxiang

568
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:25,130
and find your aunt.

569
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,370
Mother!

570
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,090
Mother.

571
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,980
Mother, wake up.

572
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,020
Don't leave me!

573
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,500
You are right.

574
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,500
Gu Qing is dead

575
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,850
forever.

576
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,660
The one in front of you

577
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,130
is Ye Ping'an,

578
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,570
an evil spirit

579
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,260
out from the Underworld.

580
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,660
Listen.

581
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
The wronged souls are whispering to me.

582
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,940
Stop bluffing with your tricks.

583
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,370
I don't believe you.

584
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,940
I don't believe you!

585
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,460
They said

586
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,850
that you should stay alive,

587
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,220
so that they could find you

588
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,290
in your dreams every night.

589
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,130
When you wake up in the morning,

590
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,020
you will get a new fester,

591
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,700
until it is

592
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,900
all over

593
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,940
your body.

594
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,420
Stop it.

595
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,290
Stop it.

596
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,020
Shut up!

597
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,810
Here they are.

598
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:45,850
Du Liang,

599
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,330
bring the lives of my family back to me.

600
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,330
Bring them back!

601
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:49,850
Yu Qian,

602
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,020
it was not my fault.

603
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,530
You were going after us.

604
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,570
It's your own fault!

605
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,220
Du Liang,

606
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,260
who were the people

607
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,260
with the masks?

608
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,500
Did you come up with the idea

609
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,740
to frame him

610
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,850
or you were told to do so?

611
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,530
It wasn't my idea!

612
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,370
It was him.

613
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,130
It was him.

614
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,130
He asked me to do it!

615
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,610
Who was he?

616
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,980
Mr. Li,

617
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,770
you are right on time.

618
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,530
Don't worry.

619
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,980
Everyone knows

620
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,740
that it is you who found

621
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,420
the military fund.

622
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,530
It's your credit.

623
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,940
[Du Mansion]

624
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,460
I'm not afraid of you.

625
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:01,810
I was the one

626
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,130
who put you under the blade.

627
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,570
Now you're dead,

628
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,260
and your soul is mine to destroy!

629
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,610
I'm going to kill you.

630
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,730
As long as you tell me

631
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,130
who else
was responsible for their death,

632
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,860
they will leave you alone.

633
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,420
You are also sinful.

634
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,530
See you in the Underworld!

635
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,530
Who was the one

636
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,940
behind everything
in Tongquan at the time?

637
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,050
Alright.

638
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,250
Okay.

639
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,460
I see.

640
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,380
Wenyu.

641
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,460
Follow me.

642
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,020
Sir.

643
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,460
All the 80,000 Liang Du Liang took

644
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,380
is in the mansion.

645
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,340
Right.

646
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,130
Du Liang took advantage of his position

647
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,500
and embezzled the military fund.

648
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,210
In this case,

649
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,690
he had an accomplice.

650
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:40,940
Ye Ping'an,

651
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,460
you have been reported

652
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,820
on suspicion
of transferring the military fund.

653
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:44,900
Somebody!

654
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,130
Grab her.

655
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:46,820
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

656
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,460
I can go by myself.

657
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,500
Do not get too close to anyone.

658
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,820
Including you?

659
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,460
Including me.
