Yes, sir.

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,150

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,670
that you coerced and manipulated

No.

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,590
I ask you one more time.

52
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
Is the testimony you provided

53
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,320
true or not?

54
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,710
I can testify

55
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,440
the Censor case

56
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,350

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,830
It was never
Monitor Censor Yu Qian's doing.

61
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,790

Explain every detail.

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,230
I will not

69
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,000
tell a single lie today.

70
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,120
At that time,

71
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,390
Du Liang wasn't content
with being a County Constable.

72
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,440
He wanted a transfer to the capital.

73
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,080
To bribe officials,

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,640
he conspired
with Zheng Yuan, his advisor,

75
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,520
and Qi Junshan

76
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,350
to abduct women and imprison them
in an abandoned house.

77
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,030
He also turned his own mansion

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,880
into a place of indulgence.

79
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,710
Our dynasty has always had

80
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,150
the tradition of recommending officials.

81
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,120
It was originally to select
the virtuous and capable.

82
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,710
Yet,

83
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,880
some exploit this system.

84
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,910
They went to Tongquan County

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,390
not just for women

86
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,830
but also

87
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,710
for buying and selling

88
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,790
official positions.

89
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,390

90
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,830
"Selling official positions

91

will lead to a nation's downfall
in ten years."

In the reign of Emperor Ling of Han,

93
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,270
those who traded ranks for wealth

94
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,230
caused great disaster.

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
If one can become an official
with mere silver,

98

Hai Yiping,

101
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,760
why did you go to Tongquan County?

102
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
What dealings

103
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,320
did you have with Du Liang?

104
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,960
I didn't go there

105
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,680
for women.

106
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,680
I never laid a hand on them.

107
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,230
I just made a mistake,

108
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,120
neither big nor small,

109
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,030
in my early official career.

110
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,640
That mistake

111
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,270
is called "compromising to fit in."

112
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,120
Back then,

113
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,350
I was a Vice Director
of the Bureau of Honor,

114
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,710
responsible for assessing

115
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,910
the performance and taxation records
of capital officials.

116
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,350
That is

117
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
how I became acquainted with Du Liang.

118
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,080
Your records state

119
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,230
that each man should pay
three dan of grain.

120
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,440
But I investigated among the people

121
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,830
and found
that they actually paid six dan.

122
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,640
That's double the recorded amount.

123
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,790
Where did the rest go?

124
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,590
The salt granary

125
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,760
is recorded to have 2,400 dan of salt

126
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,680
with 600 dan lost due to floods.

127
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,710
I checked the granary.

128
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,960
There were no traces of flooding.

129
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,590
Your pockets...

130
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,470
must be quite full.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,830
Mr. Hai,

132
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,270
you aren't aware of the situation
in Tongquan County.

133
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,440
The region is often plagued by bandits.

134
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,200
The court refuses to allocate funds.

135
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,150
I had to handle the bandits myself,

136
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,080
which required additional expenses.

137
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,560
Check the prison records.

138
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,030
So many bandits
were arrested in a year.

139
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,080
I suppose you raise bandits

140
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
and arrest them yourself.

141
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,000
Du Liang,

142
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,830
do you have a death wish?

143
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,080
All right.

144
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,270
If you want to convict me,

145
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,680
please stay the night.

146
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,350
Is that fine?

147
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,470
Help!

148
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,120
Stop there!

149
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,030
Get back.

150
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,880
Help.

151
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,270
Get in!

152
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,150
I suppose you recognized him.

153
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,000
Will you turn against
an old family friend...

154
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,910
and expose him?

155
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,230
Yes.

156
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,280
Exactly.

157
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,470
You're here too, Mr. Hai.

158
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,960
I need someone to manage
the county's salt granary.

159
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,830
I intend

160
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,990
to have Mr. Hai's people take over.

161
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,830
But I'm not sure

162
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,590
if Mr. Hai would be interested.

163
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,470
In front of those officials,

164
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,110
Du Liang bribed me.

165
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,830
I had discovered

166
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,630
their secret.

167
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,710
If I refused,

168
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,920
I would have made myself
an enemy of all.

169
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,560
Soon after,

170
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,750
Du Liang wanted me

171
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,960
to recommend him
for promotion to the capital.

172
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,750
Once this was done,

173
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,230
everything

174
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,990
would have been settled.

175
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,040
However...

176
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,590
Yu Qian

177
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,680
was an unexpected variable.

178
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,750
Why can Du Liang imprison

179
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,590
so many women?

180
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,630
Can't you see

181
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
how deep this conspiracy runs?

182
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,960
Don't bring disaster upon yourself.

183
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,920
Go back to the capital with me.

184
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,630
Pretend none of this ever happened.

185
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,680
Hai.

186
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,920
You and I passed
the same imperial examination.

187
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,710
We've known each other for years.

188
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,350
I never thought

189
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,440
you would say such words.

190
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,990
We are responsible for supervision.

191
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
If we turn a blind eye,

192
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
will the official robe

193
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,280
not weigh heavy upon you?

194
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,800
Will the oath you made as an official

195
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,990
not burden and ache you?

196
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,060
Why are you so stubborn?

197
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,560
Is it because you're about
to be promoted to Vice Minister?

198
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,230
Are you worried
about implicating yourself?

199
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,110
Fine.

200
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,470
No need to persuade me anymore.

201
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,200
I swear

202
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,940
I will investigate it to the end.

203
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,140
No matter

204
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,260
who is behind Du Liang,

205
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,830
I will not let a single one go.

206
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:11,870
You...

207
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,960
If Du Liang was exposed,

208
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,040
my bribery

209
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,160
would be uncovered too.

210
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,350
My career would be ruined.

211
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,440
My family's long-standing reputation
of integrity

212
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,830
would be tainted because of me.

213
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,800
One wrong decision

214
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,320
led to an endless downfall.

215
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,920
There was no turning back.

216
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,440
This is proof

217
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,110
of Yu Qian ordering
the women to be killed.

218
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,200
Hand it to Du Liang.

219
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:42,920
He knows

220
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,680
what to do.

221
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:45,960
Yes.

222
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,710
Yu Qian was an upright man.

223
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,590
He regarded you as a confidant.

224
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,110
He had such faith in you

225
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,750
that he even entrusted his last hope

226
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,960
in you.

227
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,920
But what did you do?

228
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,400
Just to protect your own career

229
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,560
and the so-called reputation,

230
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,560
you let Du Liang kill him

231
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,590
and frame him,

232
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,230
resulting in his entire family
being executed.

233
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,560
If Yu Qian knew this...

234
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,990
I have one more question.

235
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,470
You've always known

236
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,630
that Li Zongxu was involved
in the Censor case.

237
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,040
Then what did he do

238
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,400
in Tongquan County?

239
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,080
There,

240
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,990
Li Zongxu

241
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,750
did not only satisfy

242
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,750
his lust for women

243
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,280
and his sadistic tendencies

244
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,320
but also bribed high-ranking officials

245
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,080
and gained the right

246
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,750
to distribute official salt
in the capital.

247
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,750
I have another accusation

248
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,960
against Li Zongxu.

249
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,680
Speak.

250
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,280
After Li Zongxu obtained

251
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,680
the right
to distribute the official salt,

252
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,870
he exploited it for years

253
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,830
for his own profit.

254
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,160
I found out

255
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,230
that Li Zongxu

256
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,440
manipulated
the price of salt in the capital,

257
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,750
making it more expensive than meat.

258
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,680
The poor couldn't afford salt

259
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,830
and were even forced
to sell their children.

260
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,470
Mr. Guo,

261
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,870
Her Majesty ordered us

262
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,870
to investigate the Censor case,

263
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,300
[Zhang Quan, Minister of Justice]
not the salt case.

264
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,470
Do you think

265
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,320
maybe

266
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,510
we're going too far?

267
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,280
What if I insist

268
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,920
on going this far?

269
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,180
General Wu?

270
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,750
Mr. Zhang, you've long resided
in the capital.

271
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,040
Perhaps you have never seen

272
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,400
the tragedies at the border.

273
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,830
Five years ago

274
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,080
during the Battle of Jinyuan,

275
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,590
Li Zongxu colluded
with transport officials

276
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,960
because of factional fights,

277
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,510
causing salt and provisions
to be blocked.

278
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,920
The army was trapped in the city.

279
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,510
Countless soldiers

280
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
lost their lives because of this.

281
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,960
Corpses and blood
soaked the battlefield,

282
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,680
their armor cold.

283
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,960
Should we

284
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,510
investigate this case or not?

285
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,110
General Wu,

286
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,590
who else have you uncovered?

287
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
I have uncovered

288
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,080
the officials colluding with Li Zongxu

289
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,680
but also found

290
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,440
the Market Commissioner of Changping,

291
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,710
the County Constable of Huayin,

292
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,750
and the Granary Magistrate of Xinzhou

293
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,870
were all involved
in embezzlement and bribery.

294
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,560
And these people

295
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,830
were all recommended

296
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,590
by Hai Yiping.

297
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,440
Please be assured.

298
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,560
I will include the evidence

299
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,680
in my report on the Censor case

300
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,230
and present it to Her Majesty,

301
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,830
ensuring

302
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,510
that they're brought to justice.

303
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,080
Thank you, Mr. Guo.

304
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,350
Ye Ping'an,

305
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,350
we've finished questioning you.

306
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,200
We will handle

307
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,680
the remaining matters.

308
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:37,960
You may leave now.

309
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,440
Yes.

310
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,160
Write down

311
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,680
all the officials

312
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,960
in league with Du Liang.

313
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,230
Do not miss any of them.

314
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,470
[Court of Judicial Review]

315
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,230
Most of the people on this list

316
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,560
have died in the past decade or so.

317
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,440
Those still alive are Wang Yuanzhi,

318
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,590
Gao Fu, Zheng Xi, and Lu Fengyuan.

319
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,230
None of them is above the fifth rank.

320
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,280
He thinks he can just brush this aside.

321
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,560
Impossible.

322
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,590
This time,

323
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,510
we must dig out all the filth beneath.

324
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,280
Mr. Yang,

325
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,990
we're only responsible
for reviewing the case.

326
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,160
The verdict rests with Her Majesty.

327
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,560
The borders
have only recently stabilized.

328
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,750
The conflicts between the factions
still surge beneath the surface.

329
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,830
If we escalate a great conflict

330
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,080
and destabilize the court now,

331
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,800
we will put Her Majesty

332
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,750
in a difficult position.

333
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,960
Shaocheng,

334
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,470
what is your view?

335
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,560
In my humble opinion,

336
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,200
what Mr. Zhang said

337
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,560
is understandable.

338
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,350
Those who had the power
to sell official positions

339
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,510
were all from noble families.

340
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,560
I don't believe

341
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,510
there was only one Du Liang

342
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,800
and one Tongquan County.

343
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,590
The noble families
have dominated official positions.

344
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,280
The late ruler and Her Majesty

345
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,830
have wished to reform this flaw

346
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,590
and worked gradually for it.

347
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,440
It is the same

348
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,080
with this case.

349
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,830
You've finally come to meet me alone.

350
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,630
While this cell is too small,

351
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,710
you

352
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,200
have long imprisoned yourself

353
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,400
in a much larger cage.

354
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,470
I know what you are after.

355
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,560
You never allow yourself

356
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,400
to be controlled.

357
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
You think if I fall,

358
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,080
you will gain more favor

359
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,350
with the Mei alliance.

360
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,110
I seek not anyone's favor.

361
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,280
I only fight for Mang Gutter.

362
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,680
I have seen

363
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,920
many diligent reformers.

364
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,510
They had good intentions,

365
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,440
but the policies they proposed

366
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,280
were corrupted in execution.

367
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,710
Too many people

368
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,440
deceive their superiors

369
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,630
and oppress their subordinates.

370
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,870
Didn't you see it in the Censor case?

371
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,440
A local tyrant like Du Liang

372
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,510
could commit

373
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,400
something

374
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,920
that even Her Majesty never anticipated.

375
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,830
Where there are corrupt officials,

376
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,800
there are those
who serve with integrity.

377
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,710
For every official who stands

378
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,680
on the side of the people,

379
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,280
there will be

380
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,960
one less corrupt official like Du Liang.

381
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,870
Seeking integrity is easy.

382
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,230
Yet holding onto it is difficult.

383
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,230
You dream

384
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,880
of dominating the court

385
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,790
so you can erase class divisions.

386
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,710
You wish for the lowborn and the noble

387
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,120
to stand as equals.

388
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,030
You want the humble and the aristocratic

389
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,640
to share the same roots.

390
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,440
But you forget

391
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,880
the foundation

392
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,880
of this grand realm.

393
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,510
Without servants,

394
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,440
how would there be masters?

395
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,400
I do not seek

396
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,920
equality for all.

397
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,160
I only wish

398
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,550
to carve out a path for the people.

399
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,070
Her Majesty’s support of the commoners,
regardless of birth,

400
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,710
is proof of this.

401
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,360
And I am merely

402
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,880
following Her Majesty's will.

403
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,550
Even if the Empress

404
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,510
holds such a vision,

405
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,120
what will happen after her?

406
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,680
What about a century later?

407
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,030
If we elevate the commoners

408
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,710
and they become wealthy,

409
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,880
will they not become

410
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,990
the next aristocracy?

411
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,960
Won't the current noble families

412
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,470
be replaced

413
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,200
by the new ones?

414
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,400
Even if

415
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,360
I can only secure
peace during this time,

416
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,120
I will still strive for it.

417
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,960
Even if it lasts only for ten years,

418
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,710
I will protect those ten years.

419
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,880
Yuan Shaocheng.

420
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,640
What you seek today

421
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,270
will one day

422
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
become your cage.

423
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,470
The Empress has decreed

424
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,510
that the Censor case

425
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,880
has been proven a wrongful conviction.

426
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,920
Yu Qian is posthumously honored
as Duke of Ming,

427
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,200
titled Loyal and Righteous,
and a memorial hall shall be built

428
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,270
in his honor to inspire officials.

429
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,680
[Zhou Mansion]
All officials involved

430
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,960
shall be dismissed and investigated
without leniency.

431
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,070
Li Zongxu,

432
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,550
abusing his status as a prince,

433
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,880
has amassed wealth unchecked

434
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,200
and acted with cruelty beyond measure.

435
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,710
His title

436
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,070
and assets are forfeit.

437
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,470
[Official Proclamation]
The women involved in the case

438
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,640
were cruelly harmed by
the then County Constable of Tongquan

439
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,270
Du Liang

440
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,070
in collusion with bandits

441
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,710
and killed by Hai Yiping
to cover his tracks.

442
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,880
Now, this is proclaimed to all,

443
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,470
and each victim's family
will receive an annual pension

444
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,750
of a substantial amount

445
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,750
to honor their spirits.

446
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,400
Furthermore,

447
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,400
the imperial examination

448
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,200
and the recommendation system

449
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,920
are for talent selection

450
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,200
and the pillars of the realm.

451
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,920
Nepotism and autocracy

452
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,160
must not be tolerated.

453
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,750
All officials must take
the Censor case as a warning.

454
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,270
I hereby issue a new decree.

455
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,160
First,

456
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,960
one's family background shall not be
questioned in the imperial examination.

457
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,990
From now on, all exams will be following

458
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,200
an anonymous grading system

459
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,310
to uproot corruption and bribery.

460
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,160
The palace examination
shall serve as a final test,

461
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,120
and I shall personally
question candidates

462
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,470
to recruit the worthy.

463
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,550
Second,

464
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,880
the military examination
has shown great success.

465
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,840
Henceforth, the system shall be expanded

466
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,200
to select military leaders

467
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,230
and gather warriors
from across the land.

468
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,440
Third,

469
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,880
any person, including commoners,

470
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,440
may be recommended

471
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,550
or recommend themselves to me

472
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,920
if they believe they have talent.

473
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,360
They shall be tested

474
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,550
for their abilities,

475
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,840
and the wise and capable
shall be retained,

476
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,200
ensuring a society of integrity
for the generations to come.

477
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,360
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

478
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,720
[Yangzhou]

479
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,840
After all these years,

480
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,710
the Censor case is finally overturned.

481
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,310
I can't imagine

482
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,550
how Ye Ping'an survived.

483
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,310
It's such a pity that Lu Danxin

484
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,960
was driven to her death by Hai Yiping.

485
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,160
It is.

486
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,200
What a shame.

487
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:28,710
Nichang.

488
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:30,990
Nichang,

489
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,030
just the right time.

490
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,030
I have good news.

491
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,360
I'm returning to the capital.

492
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,160
Why so sudden?

493
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,510
Our song

494
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,600
has been chosen by the Xu family,

495
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
and they sent a formal invitation today,

496
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
asking us to perform

497
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,030
at Madam Xu's birthday banquet.

498
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,030
Won't that be a pity

499
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,310
if you leave now?

500
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,640
Zhao Zhen.

501
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,960
I have cherished the days

502
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,640
of composing songs with you.

503
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
Yet, whether our music

504
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,790
is chosen or not

505
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,640
does not concern me.

506
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,030
In the capital,

507
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,310
there are matters I can't let go of

508
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,260
and people I can't forget.

509
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,470
I must return.

510
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,020
I'm sorry.

511
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,020
You need not apologize.

512
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,500
I will explain it

513
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,500
to the Xu family.

514
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,580
Nichang,

515
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,910
I will wait for your return.

516
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,150
But what if...

517
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,710
I never return?

518
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,870
I will still be writing lyrics.

519
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,430
But...

520
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,990
without your music,

521
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,670
something

522
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,430
will always be missing.

523
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,300
Okay.

524
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,670
Since you see me as a kindred spirit,

525
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,150
if fate allows,

526
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,740
we shall meet again.

527
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:06,020
[Tomb of Lu Danxin. Tomb of Cailian]

528
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,820
Danxin,

529
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,100
Cailian,

530
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:10,950
we've won.

531
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,100
Would this news

532
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,230
bring you joy?

533
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,470
We've finally finished

534
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,990
what we fought for all these years.

535
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,580
Hurry.

536
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,910
Slow down, Cailian.

537
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,060
Mrs. Gu has rented

538
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,190
such a wonderful house.

539
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,710
I love this tree.

540
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,020
In this spot,

541
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,150
we should place a table

542
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,300
for chess

543
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,150
and fine liquor.

544
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,580
Ever since the Censor case,

545
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,950
we've been far away from the homeland,

546
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,670
unable to return.

547
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,740
But with you here,

548
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,390
I have once again felt

549
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,100
the warmth of home.

550
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:49,990
From this day forth,

551
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,300
this shall be my home.

552
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,910
Our home.

553
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,580
We can never return to Tongquan County.

554
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,580
So when one of us dies,

555
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,260
the others will bury her

556
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,710
in the bamboo forest east of the city.

557
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,630
What do you think?

558
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,260
Anywhere is fine.

559
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,710
Just don't weep

560
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,910
at my grave

561
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,020
and keep me from resting.

562
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,870
We've barely settled in.

563
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,870
Why talk about death already?

564
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Danxin,

565
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,390
stop speaking so ominously.

566
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,260
What kind of topic

567
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,390
have you brought up?

568
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,990
You're right, Aunt.

569
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,710
Danxin misspoke.

570
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,670
We must punish her...

571
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,430
with a flick to the forehead.

572
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,540
Stop there!

573
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,540
Great!

574
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,540
We have a home!

575
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,020
We have a home!

576
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,470
Hai Yiping...

577
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,710
hanged himself in prison.

578
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:33,950
For one

579
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,990
who valued his honor so much,

580
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,910
it was expected

581
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,500
he would end things this way.

582
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,910
You've

583
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,390
made your mark

584
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,340
on the capital.

585
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,870
Everyone respects your courage

586
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,060
in overturning the case
and eliminating the corrupt.

587
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,670
Your Anxin House

588
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,390
will soon be packed with people.

589
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,340
There was once dead.

590
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,990
People called me a witch.

591
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,470
Now,

592
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,670
they say I am brave.

593
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,990
Does it matter

594
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,150
whether it's a good or bad reputation

595
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,990
or if it's true or false?

596
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:11,710
By the way,

597
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,540
Hai Yiping's family...

598
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:14,670
Don't worry.

599
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,740
Her Majesty has not directed any anger

600
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,470
toward them.

601
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,820
I heard that Madam Hai

602
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,670
is taking Hai Yan to leave the capital.

603
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,740
What should we do?

604
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,260
Yeah.

605
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:25,910
We should go back to our hometown.

606
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:26,740
What do we do?

607
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,470
All right. Take care.

608
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,020
All right.

609
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:29,910
Let's go.

610
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:30,910
Take care.

611
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,700
[Hai Mansion]

612
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:07,990
Ping'an.

613
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,230
This is a rouge

614
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,190
I just bought in Yangzhou.

615
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,430
I haven't tried it yet.

616
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,710
Come on.

617
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,870
Put it on me.

618
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,150
Me?

619
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,260
I'm not very good at this.

620
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,060
Ping'an,

621
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,190
upon hearing of the overturning

622
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,580
of the Censor case in Yangzhou,

623
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,150
I rushed back at once.

624
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,710
I inquired along the way

625
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,500
and learned of all that had happened

626
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,630
since I left the capital.

627
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,230
It's all my fault.

628
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,580
I should never have left.

629
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,340
If I had stayed,

630
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,780
perhaps you and Danxin...

631
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,820
There is no "perhaps."

632
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,190
This matter

633
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,340
has nothing to do with you.

634
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,390
Fortunately, with the case overturned,

635
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,340
Danxin's name has been cleared.

636
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,780
Everyone now knows

637
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,230
that Danxin took that step

638
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,630
to expose

639
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,150
Hai Yiping's true nature.

640
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:55,910
Ping'an,

641
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,950
now that it's all over,

642
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,990
what is your plan?

643
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,470
I don't know why,

644
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,060
but these days,

645
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,300
I keep thinking of the past.

646
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,950
After the Censor case,

647
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,430
I despised everything about myself,

648
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,430
living in a daze.

649
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,470
Then, I met Ruan Qin.

650
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,150
Watching her,
tormented by mental anguish,

651
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,630
jump off the cliff before me.

652
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,500
It made me realize

653
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,150
that the pain of the heart

654
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,540
is no less than the pain of the body.

655
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,390
From then on,

656
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,910
I resolved to use my talents

657
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,780
to study the art of healing the mind.

658
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,260
Though I have healed many,

659
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,470
I have never been able
to forgive myself.

660
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,910
It was only upon meeting
Danxin and Cailian

661
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,990
that I found a chance at redemption.

662
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,060
From that moment,

663
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,990
I swore to devote my life

664
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,870
to the Censor case.

665
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,990
Until justice was served,

666
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,100
I would never stop.

667
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,580
Now,

668
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,710
the case has ended suddenly.

669
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,870
But Cailian and Danxin...

670
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,230
are gone.

671
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,230
Ping'an,

672
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,540
without you,

673
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,300
no one knows how many more years
it would have taken

674
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,300
to clear this injustice.

675
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,340
You, too, were a victim.

676
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,230
No one will blame you anymore.

677
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:34,670
What about you?

678
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,470
Will you stay at Wanguoxiang Tavern?

679
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,260
I haven't decided yet.

680
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,260
You've lost more weight

681
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,710
since I last saw you.

682
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,020
Stop worrying about treating others.

683
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,390
Take care of yourself first.

684
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,230
I plead guilty before Your Majesty.

685
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,990
You played a key role
in overturning the Censor case.

686
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,190
Why plead guilty?

687
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,340
I disobeyed Your Majesty's order

688
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,500
and took it upon myself
to investigate the case.

689
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,500
After discovering the gate incident,

690
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,950
I failed to report it in time.

691
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:15,990
Therefore,

692
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,390
I plead guilty.

693
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Was it

694
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,190
that you failed to report it in time

695
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,100
or that you deliberately withheld it?

696
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,630
First Li Zongxu,

697
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,910
then Hai Yiping.

698
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,390
You acted on your own accord,

699
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,580
defying my will.

700
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,390
I

701
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,870
have tolerated you again and again,

702
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,990
yet you keep pushing the limits.

703
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,060
Your Majesty is a wise ruler

704
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,540
who always speaks of
prioritizing the greater good.

705
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,470
I believe

706
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,100
that both the salt case
and the Censor case

707
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,390
concern the people

708
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,500
and thus the greater good.

709
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,820
Tell me,

710
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,020
do you still regard me

711
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,060
as your sovereign?

712
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,780
The people are Your Majesty's.

713
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,020
You love them, and so must I.

714
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,910
I believe

715
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:03,820
that loyalty to the people

716
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,950
is loyalty to the ruler.

717
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,540
How eloquent.

718
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,870
Hai Yiping often spoke before me

719
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,190
of how, in ancient governance,
love for the people was paramount

720
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,820
and the people came before the realm.

721
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,020
You were in contact often lately.

722
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,100
You even speak alike.

723
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,300
Your Majesty.

724
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,740
You need not concern yourself
with the salt matter any longer.

725
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,630
From now on,

726
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,390
unless summoned,

727
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,430
you need not report to me.

728
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,740
Simply focus

729
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,950
on your duties
at the Court of Judicial Review.

730
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,020
As you command,

731
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,340
Your Majesty.

732
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,190
Mr. Yuan,

733
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,870
after the Censor case,

734
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,470
did Her Majesty mention
any reward for you?

735
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,150
No.

736
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,390
The evaluation by the Department
of Merit Assessments is finished.

737
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:50,990
Many from humble backgrounds
were promoted.

738
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,100
You solved a great case
and rendered great service,

739
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,340
yet not a single reward for you.

740
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,780
Her Majesty is truly biased.

741
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,100
The capital

742
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,230
is a square grid,

743
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,990
much like a chessboard.

744
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,150
But I refuse to be

745
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,430
anyone's pawn.

746
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,300
Go ahead.

747
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,350
I have other matters to attend to.

748
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,270
Yes.

749
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:19,750
[Kangping Mansion]

750
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,310
Your Highness.

751
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,700
Minister Yuan,

752
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,580
what brings you here?

753
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,910
Regarding the Mang Gutter people's
tower construction task,

754
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:28,870
I have yet to thank

755
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,020
Your Highness.

756
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,100
I have come today

757
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,830
to express my gratitude

758
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:33,700
for Your Highness's assistance.

759
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,950
The Directorate for the Palace Buildings
is responsible for it.

760
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,220
It should not burden the people.

761
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,540
No need for thanks.

762
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,470
Last time, Kang brought
rock sugar cakes home.

763
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,100
Thank you.

764
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,020
It was nothing.

765
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,540
If Your Highness enjoys them,

766
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,430
it is

767
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,910
my honor.

768
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,060
Good timing.

769
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,180
Come with me
to Chancellor Mei's mansion.

770
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,500
[Mei Mansion]

771
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,700
Hai Yiping

772
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,140
took the wrong path.

773
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,790
His death was predestined.

774
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,140
Mr. Mei,

775
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,830
please do not grieve too much.

776
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,580
After all,

777
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,220
he was still my disciple.

778
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,140
He

779
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,430
understood caution and change

780
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,140
yet never learned the art of retreat.

781
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,470
Few people

782
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,310
can truly accept retreat.

783
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,270
During the trial,

784
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,060
I was unable to do anything

785
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,790
for you.

786
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,700
I apologize.

787
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,500
You handled the case with impartiality.

788
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,470
Why the apology?

789
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,620
What do you think of Ye Ping'an?

790
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,060
She is unpredictable.

791
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,500
Fortunately,

792
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,790
Her Majesty dismissed her

793
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,020
before granting her any real power.

794
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,350
You see,

795
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,180
Zhuangzi once said,

796
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,870
"When virtue is abandoned,

797
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,180
the path is cleared."

798
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,620
Ye Ping'an achieved it.

799
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,430
She discarded false reputation

800
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,750
and orchestrated plans,

801
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,310
understanding human nature.

802
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,390
She's a rare talent.

803
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,790
It's a pity

804
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,700
that Her Majesty won't employ her.

805
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,500
What a waste of talent.

806
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,100
If Her Majesty
truly did not wish to keep her,

807
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,910
she would have banished her
from the capital long ago.

808
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,580
Look

809
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,060
at this silk figurine I painted

810
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,620
and his furrowed brows
and drooping eyes.

811
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,220
Looks like Vice Minister Li.

812
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,430
Speaking of whom,

813
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,870
he's remained silent

814
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,540
since Her Majesty's new policies
were announced.

815
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,220
That is unlike him.

816
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,540
Had these policies

817
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,790
been issued earlier,

818
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,620
the noble families

819
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,580
would have fiercely opposed them.

820
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,580
Her Majesty has timed it well.

821
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,270
First, Her Majesty
reopened the Censor case,

822
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,270
striking fear into them,

823
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,580
before announcing the reforms,

824
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,060
leaving no room for opposition.

825
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,270
The Li family

826
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,660
is now focused on self-preservation.

827
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,660
They will remain quiet for a while.

828
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,180
Shaocheng

829
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,990
rendered great merit in the Censor case.

830
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,430
Yet in the recent evaluations,

831
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,870
he was given no promotion.

832
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,470
Mr. Mei.

833
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,580
Shall we jointly recommend Shaocheng

834
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,540
for the Right Aide
of the Department of State Affairs?

835
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,180
How does that sound?

836
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,580
My experience is still shallow.

837
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,500
I dare not deserve such recognition

838
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,540
from Your Highness

839
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,790
and Mr. Mei.

840
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:25,870
Why do you say that?

841
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,100
Wang Chongdao,

842
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,100
with no merit or virtue,

843
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,060
was appointed
as Vice Chamberlain for Ceremonials.

844
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,990
Why can't you?

845
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,470
Her Majesty has decreed

846
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,270
that appointments
shall not be based on birth.

847
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,310
Who would dare defy Her Majesty?

848
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,750
His Highness makes a valid point.

849
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,830
Shaocheng's background
is far from ordinary.

850
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,580
Then...

851
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,500
But the Right Aide position

852
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,750
is now a coveted position.

853
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,870
Recommending Shaocheng at this moment

854
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,470
may invite opposition.

855
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,350
What would be your opinion?

856
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,470
Give it to Xu Ling.

857
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,430
That's brilliant.

858
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,700
Xu Ling is the grandson
of the Chancellor of the past dynasty.

859
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,950
He has an excellent lineage

860
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,390
but is arrogant,

861
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,990
impatient,

862
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,620
and prone to mistakes.

863
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,270
Do you understand now, Shaocheng?

864
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,350
You'll have to endure another year.

865
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,990
I never dared to hope for such an honor.

866
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,830
There is no endurance to speak of.

867
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,750
You're thirty-four now, are you not?

868
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,430
Xian'er's temperament aligns with yours,

869
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,660
and you both serve in the court.

870
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:36,830
I think

871
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,580
you should...

872
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,700
interact more often.

873
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,350
Shaocheng,

874
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,700
it seems

875
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,100
you will soon have a father-in-law.

876
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,790
I'm grateful for Your Highness's regard.

877
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,270
Eggs!

878
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,430
Come and take a look!

879
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,350
Fengrao Salt Shop!

880
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,660
Reductions today!

881
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,350
Limited stock,

882
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,580
first come, first served!

883
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,910
The price of salt has suddenly
dropped by thirty percent.

884
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:15,950
Who knows

885
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,540
what it will be tomorrow?

886
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,750
Stock up while you can.

887
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,020
Don't worry.

888
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,910
The owner Mr. Wang

889
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,700
is nothing like

890
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,100
that hypocrite Li.

891
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,870
He swore
at the trade association yesterday

892
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,020
that the salt price

893
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,310
would only decrease, never rise.

894
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,620
So no need to hoard too much.

895
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,140
That's great.

896
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,390
Do you want to stock up?

897
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,910
I have some at home.

898
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,870
Be quick.

899
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,310
Yes.

900
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,540
Wu...

901
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,750
The right to distribute
official salt in the capital

902
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,430
no longer rests with the Li family.

903
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,350
With this change,

904
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,950
the price of salt should no longer rise.

905
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,140
Let us hope so.

906
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,950
The capital is now at peace.

907
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,390
Yet recently,

908
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,580
bandits have been causing trouble

909
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,620
in the Henan region.

910
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,910
They raid shops

911
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,790
and salt wells

912
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,870
and become

913
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,020
illegal salt smugglers.

914
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,830
For the moment,

915
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,620
no one in court
can bring them under control.

916
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,180
Ping'an,

917
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,830
I see that your thoughts are troubled.

918
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,180
You're in the capital,

919
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,100
but it is as if you're in a cage.

920
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,740
Have you considered

921
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,620
leaving for a while?

922
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,700
I will not leave.

923
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,740
To me,

924
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,790
everywhere is a cage.

925
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,580
Hai Yiping took his own life.

926
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,700
Yet I still feel

927
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,220
there is more behind this.

928
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,580
I want to continue investigating.

929
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,060
Are you deliberately

930
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,990
keeping yourself from stopping?

931
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,870
Or perhaps,

932
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,870
you simply cannot stop.

933
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,740
Listen to me.

934
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,430
Try living as an ordinary person

935
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,540
for a while.

936
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,030
Even if only for a few days.

937
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,180
See the world

938
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,950
through a different lens.

939
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,060
Once you feel

940
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,100
the joy of a new life,

941
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,790
no matter what happened in the past,

942
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,540
it will feel as light as a feather.

943
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,430
And if nothing changes?

944
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,540
Then

945
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,510
fight and struggle again.

946
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,180
It won't be too late.

947
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,740
No matter what,

948
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,030
give yourself room to breathe.

949
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,100
Okay.

950
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,580
I will try

951
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,510
what you suggested for a few days.

952
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,390
But I know myself.

953
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,030
Just as you said,

954
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,830
perhaps,

955
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,180
I am incapable

956
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,220
of stopping.

957
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,320
♪Past events turn to ash,
crushed into mud♪

958
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,750
♪Like a distant dream,
forever out of reach♪

959
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:19,970
♪Your breaths faded
in silence and distance♪

960
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,120
♪Thoughts form a chapter,
with a reluctant prelude♪

961
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:27,020
♪The storm of sorrow is beyond words♪

962
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,600
♪In a glance back,
no traces of the past remain♪

963
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:39,400
♪Lost in regret,
tangled, unwritten, unspeakable♪

964
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:46,200
♪Buried in time, too fragile to name♪

965
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:52,170
♪A cup of cold moonlight.
A page of faded tears♪

966
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:59,020
♪Dreams, scribbled in haste,
fade into dust♪

967
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:05,300
♪A lone wild goose cries,
echoing through the sleepless night♪

968
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:12,750
♪Only to clutch fragments of memory
to soothe the remaining years♪

969
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:32,420
♪A cup of cold moonlight.
A page of faded tears♪

970
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,970
♪Dreams, scribbled in haste,
fade into dust♪

971
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:46,370
♪A lone wild goose cries,
echoing through the sleepless night♪

972
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:53,850
♪Only to clutch fragments of memory
to soothe the remaining years♪
