It's not because I know you,

the knots in your mind,

you were so obsessed with witchcraft

that you refused to study medicine

250

from the family.

Only then

I was bitten

380
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,780
by Guo Yi.

381
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,060
He read worthless books

382
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,820
and passed a pointless exam, so what?

383
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,540
He also ended up being a porter.

384
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,660
I scolded him a little bit,

385
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,060
and he suddenly...

386
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,060
He suddenly started biting people

387
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,060
like crazy.

388
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,260
Demented.

389
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,300
Easily irritated.

390
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,780
A tendency to hurt others.

391
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,380
He is manic.

392
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,060
I need to calm him down first.

393
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,380
Guo Yi,

394
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,940
if I tell you

395
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,700
that I never hurt

396
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,580
the nephew of that guy

397
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,740
or met him before,

398
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,020
will you believe me?

399
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,100
You can't just
listen to one side of the story.

400
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,260
It's not one side of the story.

401
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,180
You killed the nephew of that man,

402
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,780
and he is just over there.

403
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,580
Sir?

404
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,220
Sir?

405
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,460
Where's he?

406
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,700
He was here just now.

407
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,860
Where is he?

408
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,820
Mr. Hai,

409
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,820
the archers are ready.

410
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,980
What are you trying to do?

411
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,500
Don't play any tricks.

412
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,220
Tell them

413
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
to stay put.

414
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:16,980
Yes, sir.

415
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,860
He is educated,

416
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,100
but he ends up as a porter.

417
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,460
He is sympathetic to the weak

418
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,900
and has no trust in officials.

419
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,260
Guo Yi,

420
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,420
you passed
the provincial examination, right?

421
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,620
How did you know that?

422
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,660
How did you know that?

423
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,020
You worked so hard for years

424
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,020
to make an achievement.

425
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,460
If today,

426
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,340
you harm me by mistake,

427
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,660
you will get yourself in trouble, too.

428
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,540
All your hard work

429
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,260
will be in vain.

430
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,820
So what?

431
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,540
I passed the exam,
but it didn't change anything!

432
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,700
You have no idea what I went through.

433
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,140
The Empress came to the throne,

434
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,660
and the world was entering a new era.

435
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,100
If I had met a good official,

436
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,380
I would have had the chance
to start my career.

437
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,180
But I was too naive.

438
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,020
I had no money

439
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,540
and no background.

440
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,500
Even if I wanted to visit any official,

441
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,020
I would need to prepare a gift.

442
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,900
That was why I became a porter.

443
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,100
People scolded and beat me,

444
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,580
but I was also an educated man.

445
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,900
Why?

446
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,300
Why?

447
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,740
[Anxin House]
You have a lot of anger,

448
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,460
and that's why you can be impulsive

449
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,460
and hurt others.

450
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,900
I have anger,

451
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,460
but I never

452
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,540
do harm to the innocent,

453
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,660
and I never regret anything!

454
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,180
The night before yesterday,

455
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,780
if he hadn't argued with me

456
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,340
about the hour,

457
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,420
I wouldn't have fought him.

458
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,780
I regret nothing.

459
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,980
I regret nothing!

460
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,420
Aren't you hurting
an innocent person now?

461
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:00,900
Guo Yi,

462
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,260
Confucius and Mencius

463
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,820
tell us to be kind and righteous.

464
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,620
You read the classics,

465
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,180
and you should be an educated man.

466
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,420
Look at you now.

467
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,180
Is this what a learned man looks like?

468
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,980
You are a kind person.

469
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,580
Do not go astray

470
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,580
because of the difficulties
you are facing.

471
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,220
Alright.

472
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,660
Everyone should leave.

473
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,140
Go.

474
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,780
Mr. Hai,

475
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,100
Guo Yi

476
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,380
was not in a good state.

477
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,780
He didn't mean to harm anyone.

478
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,180
Please

479
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,340
give him a chance.

480
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,100
Ye Ping'an,

481
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,100
I'm impressed

482
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,860
by how you eased tensions

483
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,180
and helped people today.

484
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,860
Mr. Hai,

485
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,820
if you need me anytime in the future,

486
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,860
it will be my honor to help.

487
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,460
Wow.

488
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,540
This is

489
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,140
even more luxurious than our mansion.

490
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,260
Excellent!

491
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,380
Zhao Yu.

492
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:37,940
Yes.

493
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,700
Get someone

494
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,140
to remove this thing

495
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,860
from the wall.

496
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,580
I want it replaced with a rat motif.

497
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,540
Yes, sir.

498
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,300
Sir,

499
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,060
someone was making a scene

500
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,020
at Anxin House just now,

501
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,340
but it was all settled by Ye Ping'an.

502
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,580
Du Liang

503
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,740
must have done something.

504
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,940
Since we are together with Du Liang now,

505
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,660
shall we do him a favor and help him

506
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
[Yuan Hesheng, Yuan Shaocheng's brother]
stop Ye Ping'an?

507
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,100
It's not necessary.

508
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,740
She has no evidence.

509
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,340
Once the evening drum is done,

510
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,300
she will have to die.

511
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,740
Guo Yi,

512
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,020
you just said you argued

513
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,740
about the hour with someone else
the night before yesterday.

514
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,540
What happened?

515
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,220
It was strange that night.

516
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,420
The hour was crawling by.

517
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,380
Why?

518
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,780
From the second hour
to You to the second hour of Hai,

519
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,100
I do four urns of beans every day

520
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,140
for four hours in total.

521
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,420
It never goes wrong.

522
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,420
However, the night before yesterday,

523
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,820
I worked at the usual pace,

524
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,740
but I did

525
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,940
five urns of beans

526
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,940
before hearing the gong.

527
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,100
I told the guard

528
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,220
the watchman
made a mistake about the hour.

529
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,260
On the record,

530
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,900
I put down that I worked for five hours.

531
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,620
If you want to make up
for your mistake today,

532
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,460
you need to bring us the record
as soon as possible.

533
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:03,860
No problem.

534
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,540
Ping'an.

535
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,980
The record. Here you go!

536
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,420
I'm the psychiatrist, Ye Ping'an.

537
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,300
I need to see the Empress.

538
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,180
It's time for the curfew.

539
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,940
The day is gone.

540
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,220
Her Majesty will not see you anymore.

541
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,660
Somebody.

542
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,020
Get her out of here.

543
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,540
The drum is still going on.

544
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,300
The evening drum hits six hundred times.

545
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,820
If the drum is still going on,

546
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,780
the day is not done yet.

547
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,540
So what?

548
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,660
You are just...

549
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,500
Her Majesty's word is solemn.

550
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,660
Even if there is only a second left,

551
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,660
the day is not done.

552
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,740
You kept me from seeing Her Majesty.

553
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,300
Are you trying
to make Her Majesty break her word?

554
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:52,780
You...

555
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,660
Follow me.

556
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,260
This is what happened.

557
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,660
Guo Yi's record can prove

558
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,180
that when I was captured
at Zheng Mansion,

559
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,380
the watchman was an hour
behind the actual time.

560
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,860
It should be the first hour of Zi.

561
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,460
The postmortem report shows

562
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,100
that Mr. Zheng died at the hours of Hai.

563
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,740
When he was killed,

564
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,420
I wasn't there.

565
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,700
And this.

566
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,460
I found it when I was searching

567
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,740
at Zheng Mansion.

568
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,220
My guess is

569
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,940
Mr. Zheng had evidence

570
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,700
that Mr. Du of the Ministry of Revenue

571
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,220
took the military fund for his own,

572
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,060
which got him killed.

573
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,140
Nobody will know
that at the very beginning,

574
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,940
you've switched
the real one with a fake one.

575
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,380
You never know what the rival will do.

576
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,540
To keep us safe,

577
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,820
we must have Du Liang's note

578
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,940
in our own hands.

579
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,500
Give the fake one we copied

580
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,500
to Zheng Yuan.

581
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,220
But if you show the real one

582
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,780
and someone else finds out about it...

583
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,620
Don't worry.

584
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,100
I will see the Empress alone.

585
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,220
No one

586
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
will know

587
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,900
what exactly I tell Her Majesty.

588
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,950
[The fund is 85,000. Report 80,000
and send the rest to the outskirts.]

589
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,260
This is your evidence?

590
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,860
It's useless.

591
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,340
Please forgive me.

592
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,340
Do you think

593
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,460
I'm stupid

594
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,620
or I'm blind?

595
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,940
Are you trying to accuse
a high-ranking official

596
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,060
with a vague letter?

597
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,860
I should have sentenced you
to death yesterday.

598
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,700
Your Majesty is wise for sure.

599
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,140
I'm certain whatever I find,

600
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,020
Your Majesty already knows everything.

601
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,700
I have nothing

602
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,580
but honesty.

603
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,540
Honesty?

604
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,580
Are you the innocent one
or the ambitious one?

605
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,660
The innocent one
is like a resilient bow,

606
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,260
while the ambitious one
is like a sharp arrow.

607
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,340
Together, they complement each other,

608
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,980
both loyal subjects of Your Majesty.

609
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Zheng Yuan's death

610
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,580
is not on you.

611
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,860
However, forget about

612
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,780
this letter as well.

613
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

614
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,460
The Li family and the Wu family
are competing with each other.

615
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,780
After getting the letter,

616
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,100
the Empress might suspect

617
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,340
that it is the Wu family
trying to frame Du Liang.

618
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,660
She won't rush to a conclusion.

619
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,540
Moreover, Du Liang
has a lot of connections

620
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,820
in the Li family.

621
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,540
With only one letter,

622
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,420
we won't be able to take him down.

623
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,260
What should we do then?

624
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,900
Is it all for nothing?

625
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,220
No.

626
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,700
I'll prove my innocence

627
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,980
with the chance the Empress granted me.

628
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,140
In her eyes,

629
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,660
she is my life-saver,

630
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,700
and I am only

631
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,900
a chess piece that is only loyal to her.

632
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,940
As long as we manage to let

633
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,740
the Ministry of Justice

634
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,740
find out where Du Liang's foundry is,

635
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,820
and with this letter,

636
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,220
we can plant a seed of suspicion

637
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,780
in the mind of the Empress.

638
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,580
That's all we need.

639
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,580
You know how to read faces and minds,

640
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,900
but in the future,

641
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,900
don't deceive me by claiming

642
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,740
you can glimpse their dreams.

643
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,620
Do you understand?

644
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,580
Yes.

645
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,220
Some illnesses

646
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,300
go beyond the mind.

647
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,580
They are deep-rooted,

648
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,260
like a chronic national disease.

649
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,540
Your Majesty,

650
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,060
if I am ever needed,

651
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,500
it will be my honor to help.

652
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,700
Don't worry.

653
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,660
Take it easy.

654
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

655
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,700
We have an anonymous tip

656
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,580
that ten li east of the capital,

657
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,860
[Two hours ago]
someone is recasting the official ingot.

658
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,900
Over there!

659
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,260
Follow me!

660
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,740
Chief,

661
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:57,740
the constables are here.

662
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,940
Chief, there are constables!

663
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,460
What?

664
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:03,860
Sir,

665
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,060
what brings you here?

666
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,620
Move!

667
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,780
This foundry is off the record.

668
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,660
We are shutting it down.

669
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,740
Get them!

670
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,180
[Du Mansion]

671
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,340
I didn't see that Hai Yiping

672
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,540
would get involved

673
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,980
and help Ye Ping'an.

674
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,860
It was also strange
that the Ministry of Justice

675
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,940
confiscated the foundry.

676
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,660
Luckily, the money from the fund

677
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,620
was already taken care of.

678
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,220
Losing a foundry

679
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,060
is not a big deal.

680
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,140
About the people in the jail...

681
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,500
Don't worry, Mr. Du.

682
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,540
They won't say a word.

683
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,340
Who do you think is behind this?

684
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,580
I'm afraid

685
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,580
that the Mei alliance is part of it.

686
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,260
[Gui, from the black market]
Everything is ready.

687
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,420
Thank you, Gui.

688
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,020
We will guard here

689
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,460
and wait for them to walk into the trap.

690
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,100
Du Liang

691
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,980
had all these tricks

692
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,780
to try to get rid of Ye Ping'an,

693
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,980
but she

694
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,700
survived anyway.

695
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,100
I underestimated her before.

696
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,100
It can't be a coincidence

697
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,980
that she was involved
in Zheng Yuan's case.

698
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,340
Did you look into her?

699
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,660
I did,

700
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,740
but failed to find out
where she was from.

701
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,900
The strangest thing is,

702
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,620
I investigated her aunt

703
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,220
and found she associates
with the lower classes

704
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,180
and has no official family record.

705
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,580
That's right.

706
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,900
My guess

707
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,620
is that

708
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,900
she is adopted,

709
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,700
which explains why we found nothing

710
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,100
about her background.

711
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,420
Lately,

712
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,020
there are a lot of people

713
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,100
with no background.

714
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,060
She

715
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,460
and the maid of the Zheng Mansion.

716
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,260
Something's up.

717
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,900
Alright.

718
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,780
You over-think everything.

719
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,900
Don't you get tired?

720
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,020
Sir,

721
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,100
something's wrong!

722
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:03,940
The 80,000 military fund

723
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,100
that is supposed
to arrive in the capital tomorrow

724
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,580
went missing on the official road.

725
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,420
What?

726
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,940
It's time.

727
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,060
Lady.

728
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,660
Stay away from me.

729
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,820
Stay away from me.

730
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,660
Let's have a drink.

731
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,420
Stop.

732
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,060
Thanks to you,

733
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,300
or I wouldn't know what to do

734
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,780
at this time of the night.

735
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,180
So perceptive.

736
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,380
You saw through it immediately.

737
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,500
When someone is scared,

738
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,060
their hands will be shaking,

739
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,300
but you were not.

740
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,620
Are you

741
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,580
with Du Liang?

742
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,140
Jin,

743
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,940
she is hilarious.

744
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,980
She said I was with Du Liang.

745
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,400
[Jin, working for Nichang]

746
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,400
[Zheng Mansion]

747
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,740
Zheng Yuan and I had a history.

748
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,500
Before he was killed,

749
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,420
I sent Jin

750
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,620
to guard his mansion

751
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,900
and looked for a chance for revenge.

752
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,580
On the day he was killed,

753
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,460
you showed up in the mansion,

754
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,660
and then

755
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,900
a lot happened there.

756
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,420
Isn't it natural to suspect

757
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,100
you are the one

758
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,140
who set up the whole thing?

759
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,580
It is

760
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,420
a bold guess.

761
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,420
Not as bold as you.
You risked your own life.

762
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,460
I should be the one who killed him,

763
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,580
but now you took my chance.

764
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,780
Why would you want him dead?

765
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,820
Why would you want him dead?

766
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,820
You are here

767
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,580
seeking an alliance.

768
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,580
Since you want one,

769
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,460
stop testing me.

770
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,540
You are right.

771
00:31:59,380 --> 00:31:59,820
So please,

772
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,300
just tell me

773
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,980
what you are

774
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,100
thinking about.

775
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,500
I don't care about your history.

776
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,940
You came here for help,
yet you refuse to listen.

777
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,900
Therefore, I don't need you at all.

778
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,100
Go back

779
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,900
to where you are from.

780
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,300
At Wanguoxiang,

781
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,540
I can learn a lot

782
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,300
from those young men
of noble families,

783
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,300
such as

784
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,860
the case of the censor
in Tongquan.

785
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,660
From now on,

786
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,260
we can do a lot together.

787
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,620
I'm going to see

788
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,580
what you are capable of.

789
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,340
Please don't let me down.
