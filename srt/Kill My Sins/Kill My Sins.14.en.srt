00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,550
Look at you.

3
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,360
What are you giggling about?

4
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,110
Top-quality Yutian Jade.

5
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,910
How did you get it?

6
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,670
I saw it a long time ago
in the jade shop.

7
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,310
Now that I had enough money,

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,160
I finally bought it.

9
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,190
Then you should give it to her
as soon as possible.

10
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,600
You are a man.

11
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,640
Don't be shy.

12
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,000
Let me tell you.

13
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,520
I've prepared

14
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
the betrothal gifts for you.

15
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,390
Don't let me down.

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
- Look.
- Look.

18
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,360
Look!

19
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,830
Divine bird.

20
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,200
It's a divine bird!

21
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,240
Divine bird!

22
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,360
Divine bird!

23
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,710
The divine bird brings fortune.

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,550
This is my first gift

25
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,830
for Princess Jiayue.

26
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,640
You said it was the first one,

27
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,960
so there's a second one?

28
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:07,960
It's...

29
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,150
Why is it gone?

30
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,800
Right.

31
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,830
The divine bird is gone.

32
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,110
Yes.

33
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,110
- It's back.
- It's back.

34
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,080
It's back!

35
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
What's that box?

36
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,960
It's indeed a divine bird.

37
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,550
That's right.

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,990
What's that?

39
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,080
It's a big box.

40
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,590
That's amazing.

41
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,920
- I can't see clearly.
- It's brilliant.

42
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,430
It's indeed a divine bird.

43
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,830
It's coming down.

44
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,240
It's truly a divine bird.

45
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,200
It reads people's minds.

46
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,360
It's amazing!

47
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,920
I didn't know

48
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,390
that your son could train beasts.

49
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,430
This is

50
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,390
a great gift.

51
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,270
Your Highness,

52
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,150
you have such an impressive son.

53
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,320
It's enviable!

54
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,110
This is

55
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
the second gift

56
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,360
I present.

57
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,520
Within this box

58
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,680
lies "The Grand Peace of the Ages,"

59
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,080
a masterpiece from Great Feng.

60
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,000
Today, I present it to Your Highness

61
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,150
to celebrate the marriage alliance

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,710
between Great Feng and Shuodan

63
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,320
and it is my best wishes
for everlasting prosperity!

64
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,350
Excellent!

65
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,960
- Great!
- Great!

66
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,880
- Great!
- Great!

67
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,200
Move away!

68
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,590
Put out the fire!

69
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,230
Who is that?

70
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,350
Hurry up! It's on fire!

71
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,790
Something's going on there.

72
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,520
Get him!

73
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,440
Let's go.

74
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:04,760
I...

75
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,120
Go!

76
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,910
Assassin!

77
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,270
Assassin!

78
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,960
Go! Assassin!

79
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,680
Stay put!

80
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,590
There are traitors

81
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,590
trying to assassinate the envoy

82
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,560
in the banquet tonight,

83
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,120
hoping to trigger a war

84
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,320
between the Great Feng and Shuodan.

85
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,230
Somebody!

86
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,640
Catch the assassins.

87
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,790
Do not

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,830
let anyone escape.

89
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,880
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

90
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,520
Hurry.

91
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,710
Go.

92
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,030
Let's go!

93
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:02,960
Father!

94
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,320
Give me the painting.

95
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,350
Father!

96
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,000
Father.

97
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,030
You...

98
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,910
Give it to me.

99
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,350
Zhao.

100
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,630
Keep her alive.

101
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,080
Ping'an,

102
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,870
I'm afraid

103
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,750
that I can't go on with you.

104
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,990
Run!

105
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,630
What's going on?

106
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,830
Assassin! Go!

107
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,830
Go!

108
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,920
Go!

109
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,200
Wenyu!

110
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,680
What happened?

111
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,680
Where's everyone else?

112
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,400
For some reason,

113
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,080
Li Zongxu

114
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,990
found out about our plan.

115
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,400
My people were ambushed.

116
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,510
Where are you going?

117
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,960
I need to find Cailian.

118
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,750
Listen to me!

119
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,870
Right now,

120
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,080
we have to leave.

121
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,830
Otherwise, the rest of us

122
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,590
will be in danger.

123
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,510
Let's go!

124
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,440
Let's go!

125
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,630
Block the street.

126
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,350
Check everyone.

127
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,560
Seize anyone

128
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,400
who is suspicious!

129
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,320
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,560
I've been looking for you.

131
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,230
How are you?

132
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,510
Have you found Cailian?

133
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,680
What's wrong?

134
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,630
Cailian

135
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
is dead.

136
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,960
Li Zongxu is a wretched man.

137
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,200
How did he find out about our plan?

138
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,080
He will make another move.

139
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,110
What else can he do to frame me?

140
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,350
Mang Gutter.

141
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,590
By pinning this on Mang Gutter,

142
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,630
he'll make me the prime suspect.

143
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,440
He will then suspend

144
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,160
people of the Court of Judicial Review

145
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,350
and round up Mang Gutter

146
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,710
with the Administrator of Luozhou,

147
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,920
trying to make me admit it.

148
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,040
You need to find some help,

149
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,830
and I will go to Mang Gutter

150
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,590
and buy you some time.

151
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,590
Be careful.

152
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,440
Wait.

153
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,320
About Li Zongxu's salt granary,

154
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,040
do you know where it is?

155
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,200
Yes,

156
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,590
but it is heavily guarded.

157
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,080
Li Zongxu's secret guards

158
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,750
are also there.

159
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,200
Find a way

160
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,350
to set a fire.

161
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,440
Master will give your family

162
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,230
one hundred liang of silver

163
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
and make sure
they have a comfortable life

164
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,200
for the rest of their life.

165
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,470
You have nothing to worry about.

166
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,560
Master,

167
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,870
there were eight in total.

168
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,590
They realized
they couldn't get away with it,

169
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,800
so they killed themselves.

170
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,710
No one is alive.

171
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,990
No one is alive?

172
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,320
Who were they?

173
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,320
Well...

174
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,560
[Li Kun, Administrator of Luozhou]
Nothing on them

175
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,630
can prove their identity.

176
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,440
I'm afraid
that we need further investigation.

177
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,400
Further investigation?

178
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,320
What is that for?

179
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,080
They were all from Mang Gutter.

180
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,510
Mr. Li,

181
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,870
Her Majesty

182
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,990
especially granted me an opportunity
to hold a banquet

183
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,920
and welcome the mission today.

184
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,920
Without a leader,

185
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,750
these lowlifes from Mang Gutter

186
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,870
would not have done this.

187
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,750
Who is from Mang Gutter,

188
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,830
and how did these people

189
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,870
get into the banquet?

190
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,590
Isn't the Court of Judicial Review
suspicious?

191
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,510
Your Highness,

192
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,990
this is the crossbow the assassin used

193
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,510
to injure the envoy.

194
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,350
Rat pattern?

195
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,560
There aren't a lot of people

196
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,560
using the rat pattern, is it?

197
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,510
Yuan Shaocheng, Vice Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review,

198
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,750
is the suspect in the attempted murder
of the envoy tonight.

199
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,110
Get a team
to the Court of Judicial Review.

200
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,040
For the rest,

201
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,920
stay here for further investigation.
No one shall leave!

202
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,680
Yes, sir.

203
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,800
Wait a second.

204
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,400
Mr. Li,

205
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,750
there must be

206
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,040
more suspects hiding in Mang Gutter.

207
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,400
We need to find them

208
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,920
to identify their leader.

209
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,010
It's time

210
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,010
to clean that filthy place.

211
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,340
Everyone, listen.

212
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,850
Round up Mang Gutter.

213
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,060
Not even a rat shall get away!

214
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,610
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,730
I know

216
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,130
what they took.

217
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,060
Well done.

218
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,980
Now,

219
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,130
you can have your own land and house.

220
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,370
Thank you, Your Highness.

221
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:52,890
From now on,

222
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,980
may I be your follower?

223
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,420
Stop!

224
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,530
Freeze!

225
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:22,730
Go!

226
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,420
Mother!

227
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,890
Let go of my child!

228
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,220
Let go of my child!

229
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,530
What are you doing?

230
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,700
[Hai Mansion]
You

231
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,220
shouldn't be here.

232
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,060
I don't need you

233
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,730
to show up in person, Mr. Hai.

234
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,060
All I want is...

235
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,010
Someone died in the banquet.

236
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,460
Was it Ye Ping'an?

237
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,650
Things happened all of a sudden.

238
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,300
I didn't even have time

239
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,420
to react.

240
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,530
I think

241
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,580
you still need to learn what loyalty is.

242
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,130
You still have the chance.

243
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,420
Kill her,

244
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,180
and I will help you out.

245
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,860
Ye Ping'an is nothing.

246
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,220
I will kill her.

247
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,660
But please, Mr. Hai,

248
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,810
help me with Mang Gutter now.

249
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,730
Mr. Yuan,

250
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,050
the clock is ticking.

251
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,250
When you are done,

252
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,220
you can come to see me again.

253
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,330
Mang Gutter is so stinky.

254
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,220
Why are you here?

255
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,770
You can't hurt people for no reason!

256
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,330
- That's right!
- That's right!

257
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,290
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

258
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,220
Tonight

259
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,660
in the banquet,

260
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,860
someone from Mang Gutter

261
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,220
tried to murder the envoy from Shuodan.

262
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,090
Look.

263
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,330
This is the evidence.

264
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,730
Rat pattern?

265
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,530
Good that you recognize it.

266
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,530
This is the arrow of the assassin.

267
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,050
Who gave the order to assassinate?

268
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,530
Where can this person be found?

269
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,460
As long as someone
can answer these questions,

270
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,140
the people of Mang Gutter

271
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,530
will all be safe.

272
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,620
Nonsense!

273
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,180
This is the planted evidence!

274
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,460
We have always

275
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,700
kept to our own business.

276
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,940
We will never

277
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,810
assassinate anyone!

278
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,250
If no one admits,

279
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,420
everyone from Mang Gutter

280
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,570
will be considered an accomplice.

281
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,860
Then...

282
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,330
Mr. Li,

283
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,420
don't talk about killing all the time.

284
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,900
Those who report it will get credit

285
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,460
and be rewarded.

286
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,700
This is the reward

287
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,050
for the person
who gets the first credit.

288
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,250
I'm an old man.

289
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,940
Why am I staying up late

290
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,660
for a young man like you?

291
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,220
Li Zongxu

292
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,180
will not stop

293
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,250
after taking me down.

294
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,860
If the game is not going well,

295
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,380
I can start a new one.

296
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,730
If the chess piece is not good,
I can get another piece.

297
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,940
Now you are asking me

298
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,180
to play the game you lost?

299
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,460
I didn't ask you

300
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,660
because I lost.

301
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,810
All I want is to catch a breath.

302
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,620
The people of Mang Gutter
are all I care about.

303
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,140
Please, Chancellor Mei,

304
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,810
save the people of Mang Gutter.

305
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:02,900
Well,

306
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,530
what can you give me in return?

307
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,460
From now on, my life

308
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,730
will be yours.

309
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,010
If I do anything against you,

310
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,330
I will have no friends or family

311
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,770
and end up in misery.

312
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,810
Go back to Mang Gutter.

313
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,530
I will be there.

314
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,460
Thank you, Chancellor Mei.

315
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,180
Master,

316
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,010
shall I get the carriage ready?

317
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,250
Take it easy.

318
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,660
He has potential,

319
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,700
but also a lot of edges.

320
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,940
There is a lot on his mind.

321
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,900
He needs to make some decisions.

322
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,380
You shouldn't

323
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,250
only think for yourselves

324
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,620
but also for your family

325
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,940
and children.

326
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,100
If Mr. Li gets impatient,

327
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,420
I will not be able to stop him.

328
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,140
You are shameless!

329
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,770
No one wants your filthy money.

330
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,460
We're poor

331
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,460
and our lives mean nothing.

332
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,460
However,

333
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,700
we have integrity.

334
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,330
- That's right!
- That's right!

335
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,090
We can tell right from wrong.

336
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,660
We won't admit anything

337
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,180
that we didn't do!

338
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,250
- Right!
- Right!

339
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,490
We won't admit it!

340
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,250
No!

341
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,940
You are trying to plant the evidence

342
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,180
and frame us!

343
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,860
Dear!

344
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,420
Dear!

345
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,730
Dear!

346
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,140
You are wretched.

347
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,900
You are monsters!

348
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,770
You are monsters!

349
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,010
How could you take innocent lives?

350
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,090
Monsters!

351
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,090
Listen!

352
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,940
From now on,

353
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,490
if everyone remains silent,

354
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,050
I will kill someone

355
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,730
on the count of three.

356
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,050
Someone!

357
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:26,940
What are you doing?

358
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,730
Let go of me!

359
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,380
Dear!

360
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,900
What are you doing?

361
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,460
Let go of me!

362
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,460
What are you doing?

363
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,900
Three.

364
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:34,810
Get off me!

365
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,530
Two.

366
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,570
One.

367
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,380
I know who you are looking for.

368
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,050
What are you hiding behind a mask?

369
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,460
I'm afraid of retaliation

370
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,220
and just trying to protect myself.

371
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,860
I saw him asking someone

372
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,050
from the Court of Judicial Review

373
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,220
to set fire to the salt granary
on Shuofang Street.

374
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,220
What does it do with the banquet?

375
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,770
I think you are

376
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,620
making up a lie.

377
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,420
Someone.

378
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:14,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

379
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,140
Master!

380
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,530
Master, something is wrong!

381
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,420
Master,

382
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,770
someone set fire to the salt granary.

383
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:29,860
Mr. Li,

384
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,090
please send a team to help.

385
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,570
You guys, follow him

386
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,700
to the salt granary.

387
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,290
Yes, sir.

388
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:37,530
Let's go.

389
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,530
It seems like

390
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,620
you do know something.

391
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,730
What's your relationship with him?

392
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,420
He is my enemy,

393
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,050
and is looking for help now.

394
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,380
Help?

395
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,140
Hai Yiqing.

396
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,460
He is only the Minister of Personnel.

397
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,330
What can he do?

398
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,290
Keep going.

399
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,380
Wait.

400
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,140
Hai Yiping
likes to stick his nose into everything.

401
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,730
If too many people die here tonight,

402
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,810
I'm afraid he'll use it to destroy me.

403
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,090
Since Yuan Shaocheng is coming,

404
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,050
we may as well wait for a little while.

405
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,530
Mr. Yuan,

406
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,180
you are finally here.

407
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,980
Where is your help?

408
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,420
He has none.

409
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,620
They are together!

410
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,730
How dare you kill people

411
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,730
for no reason here.

412
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,770
What?

413
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,660
The people from this area
assassinated the envoy.

414
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,940
It's treason.

415
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,420
None of you can stay out of it,

416
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,770
including you, Yuan Shaocheng.

417
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,900
This is the suspect.

418
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,090
Seize him!

419
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,900
Li Zongxu
and the Administrator of Luozhou

420
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,570
framed the people of Mang Gutter

421
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,460
and killed the innocent.

422
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,330
You are heinous!

423
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,700
You are right.

424
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,250
Look at this.

425
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,700
Mr. Gu!

426
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:47,770
Step back.

427
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,330
Li Zongxu, you...

428
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,010
As far as I know,

429
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,220
he's always been
a strong support to you,

430
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,330
and you regard him

431
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,730
like a father, right?

432
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,810
He needs no support.

433
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,700
We may come

434
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,380
from humble beginnings,

435
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,570
but we've got spine!

436
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,250
Yuan Shaocheng,

437
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,220
he is the head of Mang Gutter.

438
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,570
If you don't confess,

439
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,010
he will take the fall.

440
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,250
Since Minister Yuan
has left his low status behind,

441
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,620
he has nothing to do
with Mang Gutter anymore.

442
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,860
No one of Mang Gutter

443
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,460
would assassinate the envoy,

444
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,090
or do anything

445
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,220
against our conscience.

446
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,380
We will not admit anything

447
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,860
that we didn't do

448
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,010
even in the face of death!

449
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,530
Yuan Shaocheng,

450
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,090
I'm asking you one more time.

451
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,900
Did you send people

452
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,460
to kill the envoy?

453
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,570
Who is behind your back

454
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,050
that allows you

455
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,420
to be so arrogant and defiant?

456
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:10,620
Mr. Li.

457
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,290
Yes.

458
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,810
Listen to it carefully. Be the witness.

459
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,050
Say it.

460
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,290
Sure.

461
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,860
As long as you keep the rest

462
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,980
of Mang Gutter out of it,

463
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,570
about the banquet...

464
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,860
Everyone, remember.

465
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,420
If the person

466
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,810
who works so hard for Mang Gutter

467
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,940
goes down,

468
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:39,290
Mang Gutter will be trampled

469
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,730
even if

470
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,730
it escapes the suffering today.

471
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,900
Our

472
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,620
families

473
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,730
will be humiliated

474
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,530
and left unprotected!

475
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,140
I guess I don't need the answer anymore.

476
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,010
Li Zongxu!

477
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,860
- Mr. Gu!
- Mr. Gu!

478
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,140
Mr. Gu!

479
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,330
You should have sold
Mang Gutter to me.

480
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Get it straight.

481
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,460
If you don't admit it,

482
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,770
all the deaths here

483
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,530
tonight

484
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,460
are because of you.

485
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,290
Mr. Li.

486
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,730
Yes.

487
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,290
You can handle this.

488
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,420
The blood of the people of Mang Gutter

489
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,900
is filthy.

490
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,290
Minister Yuan,

491
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,810
Mr. Gu will be glad
to have your company.

492
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,810
Stop it!

493
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,530
I didn't know

494
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,010
that the Administrator of Luozhou

495
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,980
also ran the business here,

496
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,900
even overstepping
the Court of Judicial Review.

497
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,940
That's not true, Chancellor Mei.

498
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,660
The people of Mang Gutter
assassinated the envoy.

499
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,770
Minister Yuan

500
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,330
has a close tie with this place.

501
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,090
I'm only holding the suspect.

502
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,220
Suspect?

503
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,530
I don't think so.

504
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,290
If the assassination of the envoy

505
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,860
is related to Minister Yuan,

506
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,570
it should be reported to Her Majesty.

507
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,980
Probably the three bureaus also need to
take part in the investigation.

508
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,620
Lynching is only going
to make it look like

509
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,050
you are torturing him into confession.

510
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,860
You've been in this position for years.

511
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,980
I thought you were better than this.

512
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:03,770
I...

513
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,660
Chancellor Mei,
there must be some mistake.

514
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,980
The people of Mang Gutter

515
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,570
are the descendants of criminals.

516
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,530
They are sneaky and cunning.

517
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:14,530
The assassination of the envoy

518
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,530
happened all of a sudden.

519
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,220
If the suspect is not seized in time,

520
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,140
there might be a bigger problem.

521
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,010
Now I see the benefit of your last name.

522
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,420
As long as you are Mr. Li,

523
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,660
you get to tell people what to do
as a prince

524
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,250
even without any official position.

525
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,220
It was not my intention.

526
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,180
I was only holding the banquet

527
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,940
with the permission of Her Majesty.

528
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,810
As long as it's not a usurpation.

529
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,140
Yuan Shaocheng,

530
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,050
you can explain everything

531
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,010
in the imperial court tomorrow.

532
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:57,980
Someone.

533
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,380
Get the one with the mask.

534
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,530
I will handle it.

535
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,050
Your Highness...

536
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,330
Mr. Gu.

537
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,300
- Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

538
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,500
Mr. Gu.

539
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,820
[Rat]

540
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,500
This one is for you.

541
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,300
Hesheng and I

542
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,730
each have one.

543
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,170
Our family

544
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,420
should have something of our own.

545
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,820
This is great.

546
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,780
Great indeed.

547
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,020
Mr. Gu!

548
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:23,940
Stop.

549
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,570
Let go of her.

550
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,650
Chancellor Mei,

551
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,090
why did you save me?

552
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,420
I'm just an old man

553
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,050
enjoying a show.

554
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,860
The show is still on.

555
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,980
You should take care of yourself.

556
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,730
Also, she keeps saying
that you are nice.

557
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,670
[Anxin House]

558
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,130
What happened tonight?

559
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,380
Why did you get hurt?

560
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,210
Where is Cailian?

561
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,050
Why isn't Cailian

562
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:36,860
back with you?

563
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,210
Say something!

564
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,650
Where is Cailian?

565
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,210
No way.

566
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:09,780
Where's Cailian?

567
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,090
What happened to her?

568
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,900
What exactly happened tonight?

569
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,460
I thought we agreed

570
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,570
to give up if anything went wrong.

571
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,210
Ping'an.

572
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,780
Ping'an, say something!

573
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,130
Li Zongxu

574
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,780
found out about our plan.

575
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,050
Cailian followed him

576
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,780
to get the evidence,

577
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,610
but Li Zongxu had too many

578
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,900
secret guards.

579
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,500
How about

580
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,210
her body?

581
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,900
They took it.

582
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,090
I need revenge for her.

583
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,020
Tell me what I need to do.

584
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,020
Alright.

585
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,570
I'm telling you now.

586
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,900
Don't do

587
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,940
anything.

588
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,940
What do you mean?

589
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,300
Are you worried

590
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:28,980
about Danxin and me,

591
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,420
and you are going to take revenge

592
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,780
all by yourself?

593
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,250
I told you.

594
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,650
Don't do anything.

595
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,610
Do you understand?

596
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,170
But this is...

597
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,250
Listen to Ping'an!

598
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,820
At this moment, you cannot

599
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,940
try to get revenge on Li Zongxu.

600
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,690
We can't afford to lose anyone else!

601
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,820
But...

602
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,300
I got it.

603
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:52,940
We will listen to you,

604
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,500
as usual.

605
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,130
Ping'an.

606
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,820
I need some space.

607
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,730
All the men with me were dead.

608
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,420
Ping'an made the plan.

609

We followed everything

610
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,420
she said,

611
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,980
but in the end, we completely lost.

612
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:44,980
What are you trying to say?

613
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,170
Are you trying

614
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,170
to blame everything on Ping'an?

615
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,570
I'm not blaming her.

I'm just saying

617
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,210

Someone betrayed us.

622
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,940
There were so many people in the plan.

623
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,730
