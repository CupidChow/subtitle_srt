00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,920
The Prince of Kangping
is trusted by the Empress.

196
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,630
He's certain to come with her.

197
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,280
Miss Wu.

198
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,750
The Prince of Kangping asked me

199
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,320
to tell you

200
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,440
that Ye Ping'an escaped.

201
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,080
Go after her then!

202
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,680
We are trying.

203
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,830
Ye Ping'an will

204
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,590
notify the Empress.

205
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,350
I guess the Empress

206
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,800
will not come here tonight.

207
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,710
Tell my father

208
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,750
to spread the news

209
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,320
that there are explosives
at the Eternal Pavilion.

210
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,040
He needs to find a way

211
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,080
to divert

212
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,110
the Right Yulin Royal Guard
in the palace.

213
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,280
But...

214
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,200
Only when the force is divided,

215
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,710
my father can take the Empress down.

216
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,510
Do it now!

217
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,470
Understood.

218
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:20,120
[Tongtian Gate]

219
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,280
Miss Ye,

220
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,830
I'm returning
to the Court of Judicial Review.

221
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,830
Let's stick to the plan.

222
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,870
Thank you, Mr. Guo.

223
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,680
Nichang,

224
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,400

225
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,470
Tell him...

226
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,280
Stop there.

227
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,470
Who are you?

228
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,870
I need to see Wu Xian'er.

229
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,470
I'm Ye Ping'an.

230
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,560
Traditionally,

231
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,310
Her Majesty would have been here.

232
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:05,920
But today,

233
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,790
we've been waiting for a long time,

234
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,360
and Her Majesty hasn't arrived yet.

235
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,880
Mr. Li,

236
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,270
are you blaming
Her Majesty for being late?

237
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,510
I wonder

238
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,600
if Miss Wu can tell me

239
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,920
where

240
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,790
the Prince of Kangping is.

241
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,600
As I recall,

242
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,400
isn't Wu Ankang supposed to be back

243
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,710
in the capital

244
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,400
around now?

245
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,470
Is the Prince of Kangping

246
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,200
occupied

247
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,550
by something related, Miss Wu?

248
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,990
I think

249
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,360
you are getting drunk.

250
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,230
Somebody,

251
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,030
take Mr. Li away to wake up,

252
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,200
so that he doesn't misbehave

253
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,710
in front of Her Majesty.

254
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,680
Mr. Li,

255
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,750
please.

256
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,160
Miss Wu...

257
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,440
Mr. Li,

258
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,990
it's a good thing

259
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,070
that you think about Her Majesty,

260
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,550
but right now, you are

261
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,550
worrying too much.

262
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,960
The Prince of Kangping is indeed
occupied by something important,

263
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,030
something arranged by Her Majesty.

264
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,270

275
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,180
please take a seat.

276

277
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:41,940
Miss Wu,

278
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,810
we've got the criminal, Ye Ping'an.

279
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,090
Where did you get her?

280
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,730
Outside the palace.

281
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,250
She was trying to see the Empress.

282
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,900
There aren't many guards
left in the palace, right?

283
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,570
No.

284
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,730
Then my father

285
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,460

00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,210
The Empress

573
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,420
set off the fireworks for you.

574
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,690
When Wu Xian'er believes

575
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,300
that the Wu family is winning,

576
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,900
her mind will be

577
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,940
the most vulnerable

578
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,300
because of her arrogance.

579
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,130
I will compel her at that moment

580
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,210
and buy time

581
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,050
for our men to enter the pavilion.

582
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,570
Nichang,

583
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,900
I need you to play the pipa

584
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,210
to cover for the ring of my bell,

585
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,250
in case Wu Xian'er notices it.

586
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,690
Miss Ye.

587
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,050
Protect the officials

588
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,210
and evacuate them from the pavilion.

589
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:52,980
Hurry up.

590
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,610
Go.

591
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,170
This way.

592
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,860
Hurry.

593
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,690
No way.

594
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,300
No way.

595
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,500
No way!

596
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,690
Xian Guangping

597
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,210
set off the fireworks.

598
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,570
Don't lie to me!

599
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,250
The Prince of Kangping

600
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:23,980
lost.

601
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,690
He lost?

602
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,300
How's that possible?

603
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,130
The Yulin Royal Guard

604
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,250
was already gone!

605
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,250
Xian'er!

606
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,690
Come to your senses.

607
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,730
You lost.

608
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,570
It's time to wake up.

609
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,730
Don't get lost in your dreams.

610
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,500
Shut up!

611
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,860
I see.

612
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,860
Those

613
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,940
who surrounded the pavilion

614
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,690
were people from you.

615
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,460
Only the winner makes the rules.

616
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,610
So

617
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,090
this is the taste of the loser.

618
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,340
Ye Ping'an.

619
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,210
In the end,

620
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,730
you won.

621
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,860
Ping'an.

622
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,900
Do you still remember

623
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,900
what you gave me

624
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,570
the first time I visited your place

625
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,380
and asked you to treat me?

626
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,500
This liquor

627
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,980
is strong,

628
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,380
but

629
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
nothing special.

630
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,460
This is

631
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,020
what you need.

632
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,250
What can unravel these woes of mine?

633
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,380
I know but one drink, Du Kang Wine.

634
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,250
Unfortunately,

635
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,530
there is

636
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,250
no liquor like that

637
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,300
to cure my mind anymore.

638
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,090
You should go.

639
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,780
Xian'er!

640
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,610
Watch out!

641
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,800
[Zhanlu Hall]

642
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,170
You are saying

643
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,610
that Ye Ping'an is dead?

644
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,130
Your Majesty,

645
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,610
she died in the fire.

646
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,500
We cannot get her body.

647
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:25,940
Your Majesty,

648
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,300
Mr. Yuan was dedicated
to protecting Your Majesty.

649
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,020
He also exposed the scheme of Wu Youjing

650
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,250
and figured out the problem of the salt.

651
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,090
However, he goes his own way

652
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,130
and likes to exaggerate for credit.

653
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,820
He should be punished.

654
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,900
You are very talkative now.

655
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,650
Yuan Shaocheng,

656
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,130
during the investigation,

657
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,380
you acted in your own way,

658
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,050
sometimes very inappropriate.

659
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,610
You are penalized
with half a year's pay.

660
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,050
Reflect on your mistakes.

661
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,340
Thank you for your forgiveness,
Your Majesty.

662
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,780
You may rise.

663
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

664
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,650
However,

665
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,860
for the first three things
Fan Cheng mentioned,

666
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,340
you made extraordinary contributions.

667
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,860
The Right Chancellor's position

668
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,210
has been empty for a while.

669
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,380
Are you interested?

670
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,090
I would like

671
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,900
to recommend someone.

672
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,980
Mr. Ji, the Minister of Revenue,

673
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,250
is benevolent

674
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,460
and loyal.

675
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,020
He is more suitable
to be the Right Chancellor than me.

676
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,380
Mr. Ji

677
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,020
is a good candidate indeed.

678
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,340
However, you should still be rewarded.

679
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,460
Do you have any requests?

680
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,300
With due respect, I would like

681
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,980
to present a memorial

682
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,020
about the low status,

683
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,340
the land,

684
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,940
and the salt.

685
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,900
[Low status]
Nothing you mentioned...

686
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,460
[Land]

687
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,300
[Salt]
is minor.

688
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:58,780
I am aware

689
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,340
that it is not realistic to abolish

690
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,420
the low status completely.

691
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,340
However,

692
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,420
the people of Mang Gutter
have been slaves for three generations.

693
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,900
They have nothing to do

694
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,500
with the mistakes their ancestors made.

695
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,780
I would like to propose

696
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,610
the removal of low status

697
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,170
for the capable and virtuous ones

698
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,380
among them.

699
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,250
If these people

700
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,500
get the chance to serve the realm,

701
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,650
they will be very grateful
to Your Majesty.

702
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,610
Yuan Shaocheng.

703
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,250
You are

704
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,900
very bold.

705
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,690
You want to measure the land

706
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,500
and collect tax from everyone,
including the royals and officials.

707
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,340
You also want to
give the land of the convicts

708
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,610
to the farmers.

709
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,820
Even if I agree with your suggestions,

710
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,250
it will be extremely difficult

711
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,530
to put them into practice.

712
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:40,900
It might not

713
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,610
go as you wish.

714
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,210
As for the salt...

715
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,090
Your Majesty,

716
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,980
the price of salt is still rising.

717
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,420
Illegal salt can still be found.

718
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,610
I believe

719
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,460
it cannot be solved simply by punishing

720
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,300
the corrupt officials.

721
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,210
Now, the border is peaceful,

722
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,050
and Your Majesty

723
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,300
is reforming the bureaucracy.

724
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,340
The national treasury is filling up.

725
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,300
It would be nice

726
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,530
to take the chance

727
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,690
and reform the salt system.

728
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,610
Free trade should be allowed.

729
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:07,820
An auspicious sign

730
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,020
appears in Zechuan.

731
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,570
Make a draft

732
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,340
to grant an amnesty.

733
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,210
The people of Mang Gutter should be able
to get rid of their low status

734
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,610
and own land.

735
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,130
There will no longer be official salt,

736
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,650
but the free trade of salt.

737
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,730
Mr. Ji

738
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,380
is promoted to Right Chancellor,

739
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,860
with the authority
to participate in key decisions.

740
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,130
Yuan Shaocheng,

741
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,090
since you're determined

742
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,090
to do more good for the people,

743
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,730
I will

744
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,860
transfer you to the Ministry of Revenue.

745
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,570
You will serve as Minister of Revenue.

746
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,940
I am very grateful, Your Majesty.

747
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:55,150
[Zhanlu Hall]

748
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,020
I saw the people of Mang Gutter

749
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,130
at the Eternal Pavilion last night.

750
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,820
They are finally seen by the Empress.

751
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,050
Ping'an,

752
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,530
you should take the credit with me.

753
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,650
I'm not going.

754
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,500
However,

755
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,730
I need two promises.

756
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,130
Tell me.

757
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,170
First,

758
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,090
when Her Majesty rewards you
or your service,

759
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,460
I want you to request
a reform of the salt administration

760
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,250
and reasonable salt prices.

761
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,250
Sure. I will.

762
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,500
How about the second one?

763
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,300
If the Empress ever asks,

Why?

766
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,900
The Empress was the one who told me

767
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,250
the Wu family would send a message
by using fireworks.
