[Episode 7]
[A Humble Life Holds Endless Potential]

3
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,410
Ping'an was imprisoned

4
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,780
and accused of being involved
in the military fund case.

5
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,780
Which scoundrel

6
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,620
leaked the information?

7
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,530
I suspect it was Yuan Shaocheng.

8
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,410
Ping'an set him up before,

9
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,620
causing him to be tortured by Du Liang.

10
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,060
Looks like he's holding a grudge.

11
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,650
It's possible.

12
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,970
But...

13
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,250
But what?

14
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,810
If it was him,

15
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,250
why hasn't anyone

16
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,370
come to capture us yet?

17
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,780
Who else could it be if not him?

18
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,340
Ping'an has already told us

19
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,060
he's

20
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,300
cunning and cruel.

21
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,020
It's no surprise

22
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,690
he'd do something

23
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,940
like burning bridges.

24
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,850
The fact that he
hasn't come for you two yet

25
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,690
might mean

26
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,620
he's plotting something worse.

27
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,250
Was she sent to the prison
of the Court of Judicial Review?

28
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,340
No,

29
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,530
she was taken away by Li Jun.

30
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,810
Oh, no.

31
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,900
Falling into his hands

32
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,060
is worse than death.

33
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,130
I'm going to rescue Ping'an now.

34
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,940
Cailian,

35
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,300
don't lose your composure.

36
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,300
Let's come up with a plan first.

The liquor I have here

56
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,010
is average.

57
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,330
But when you're promoted,

58
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,130
I'll take you to Mei Mansion

59
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,250
to sample finer ones.

60
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,130
Now,

61
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,770
I am under your command.

62
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,330
If you have anything to say, Mr. Hai,

63
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,420
please go ahead.

64
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:10,740
Let me ask you something.

65
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,860
What exactly is your relationship

66
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,860
with Ye Ping'an?

67
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,940
I've only known her
for less than half a month.

68
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:18,770
Currently,

69
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,810
we are merely carrying out

70
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,100
an assigned task together.

71
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,450
That's good.

72
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,570
Right now, you're in the midst

73
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,940
of an important promotion.

74
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,420
You know who should be helped

75
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,500
and who shouldn't.

76
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,100
You're a smart person.

77
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,740
That's all

78
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,810
I need to say.

79
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,420
After such a victory tonight,

80
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,620
why do you look like this?

81
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,890
It's nothing.

82
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,980
I just feel a little sad.

83
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,130
Sad?

84
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,540
So it's because of that Ye Ping'an,
isn't it?

85
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,770
When I first met her,

86
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,570
I thought she was just a fraud.

87
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,500
What about afterward?

88
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,740
Afterward,

89
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,860
I realized that encountering her,
this venomous creature,

90
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,010
was like a game of chess
with a worthy opponent.

91
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,570
There aren't many who can be called

92
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,300
your opponent.

93
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,420
So, who exactly

94
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,330
wants her dead?

95
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,010
I don't need you to tell me.
I already know.

96
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,330
It's Hai Yiping, isn't it?

97
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,500
Don't look at me like that.

98
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,250
The only person who can make you

99
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,210
weigh your options right now

100
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,420
is Mr. Hai.

101
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,420
Normally,
I just can't be bothered to think.

102
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,660
You don't actually think
I'm foolish, do you?

103
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,330
Hesheng,

104
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,420
I don't usually say it,

105
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,130
but I know exactly what you're doing.

106
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,810
Whenever

107
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,180
there's a chance to stand out
in front of others,

108
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,450
you always step aside
and let me take the lead.

109
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,450
It's all for me

110
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,660
to earn more credit,

111
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,620
so that we,

112
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,540
the people of Mang Gutter,

113
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,010
can break free
from the lower status faster.

114
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,250
I know you don't let emotions

115
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,250
cloud your judgment,

116
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,330
but as for Ye Ping'an,

117
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,770
are you really not going to save her?

118
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,810
If you're still hesitating,

119
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:42,980
maybe it's best

120
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,540
to leave the decision to fate.

121
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,300
I fear not the chill wind
rising from within.

122
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,130
I wait only for the scent
of plum blossoms to fill the air.

123
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,810
Torture

124
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,130
is an art,

125
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,980
and your wounds

126
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,100
are like crimson plum blossoms

127
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,420
blooming in the darkness.

128
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,690
Look.

129
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,300
Don't they resemble white snow

130
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,140
drifting onto the branches?

131
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,380
The sweat drawn by pain
still carries a subtle fragrance.

132
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,330
It perfectly matches this verse.

133
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,140
I can't help but admire myself.

134
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,260
So, you enjoy playing

135
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,140
these games during the interrogation.

136
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,610
Start talking.

137
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,570
The military fund
mysteriously disappeared.

138
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,660
What's really going on here?

139
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,260
Who's the one that made you

140
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,570
commit this felon?

141
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,140
The person behind it all

142
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,020
is right there tonight.

143
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,780
You mean Mr. Yuan?

144
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,210
It's Du Liang, obviously.

145
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,380
The military fund was in his mansion,

146
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,660
and so was I.

147
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,450
If I stole them,

148
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,940
it was under his orders.

149
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,690
He

150
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,970
is the true mastermind.

151
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,570
Blaming everything on a dead man,

152
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,730
do you really think I'd believe that?

153
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,690
A mere fifth-rank director

154
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,900
daring to embezzle
all the military fund

155
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,940
and stash it in his own home?

156
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,810
Even if he had the nerve,

157
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,490
someone

158
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,690
must have emboldened him,

159
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,900
don't you think?

160
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,060
This is exactly
what you wanted, isn't it?

161
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,490
Honestly,

162
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,780
you didn't even need to torture me.

163
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,330
I would have confessed
everything anyway.

164
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,780
Just tell me who you want me to accuse:

165
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,780
a general,

166
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,900
a minister,

167
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,060
or the Grand Chancellor.

168
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,300
Be it a minor offense

169
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,690
or a crime that wipes out
an entire lineage,

170
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,090
I'll sign wherever you want.

171
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,810
Listen,

172
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,330
it's only the Hour of Hai.

173
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,450
Seeing you like this

174
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,380
is quite disappointing.

175
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,330
I had an entire night

176
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,210
prepared just for you,

177
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,260
with tortures no one

178
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,060
has ever had the privilege
of experiencing.

179
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,660
The Golden Cauldron,

180
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,330
the Sea of Serpents,

181
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,810
the Bone Flute…

182
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,260
Without a little persuasion,

183
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,660
the truth never comes out.

184
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,900
Now, I understand.

185
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,850
Of all the people you've interrogated,

186
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,540
which ones

187
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,490
bring you the greatest thrill?

188
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,740
I'd guess

189
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,830
it's the powerful and noble.

190
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,350
Seeing them

191
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,260
dragged from their high status
into the filth,

192
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,350
with their pride
shattered piece by piece.

193
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,230
That irony

194
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,230
is what excites you the most,

195
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,070
isn't it?

196
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,070
Master.

197
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:13,830
Mr. Zhang.

198
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,590
Go ahead.

199
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,990
Tell us the situation tonight.

200
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:18,860
Yes, sir.

201
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,950
Mr. Yuan brought people

202
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,950
into Du Liang's mansion tonight

203
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,470
and found the missing military fund.

204
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,070
Du Liang has been executed

205
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,950
for embezzling the fund.

206
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,500
He... he accidentally died from a fall.

207
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,020
Mr. Zhang,

208
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,860
I think Cheng Hui
is somewhat undervalued.

209
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,990
The Ministry of Justice

210
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,380
still has positions to fill, doesn't it?

211
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,380
Thank you, Master.

212
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,310
I will never forget this favor.

213
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,470
I'll also ensure your sister

214
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,620
and mother

215
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,310
are well taken care of.

216
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,380
Thank you, Master.

217
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,110
You may rise.

218
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,900
Yes, sir.

219
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,380
Also, Ye Ping'an

220
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,740
has been arrested by Li Jun

221
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,990
and is being interrogated
overnight in the prison.

222
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,070
This matter

223
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,540
must be settled tonight.

224
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,140
Understood.

225
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,350
For such a major case,

226
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,310
the Ministry of Justice

227
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,620
needs to draft a memorandum.

228
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,620
To report to the palace,

229
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,070
it will have to wait until tomorrow.

230
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,070
Mr. Hai,

231
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,230
I must take my leave now.

232
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,540
I won't see you off.

233
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,230
Send someone to keep an eye on Cheng Hui

234
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,740
and see

235
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,950
if he can eliminate Ye Ping'an.

236
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,950
Yes, sir.

237
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,020
Why do you suspect

238
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,990
[Hidden chamber]
Ye Ping'an is the survivor

239
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,620
of the censor's case?

240
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,830
When the Zheng Yuan case happened,

241
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,620
I thought

242
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,830
she was just a scapegoat.

243
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,350
But to my surprise,

244
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,590
she used the case

245
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,830
to secure an official position.

246
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,740
Moreover,

247
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,900
she was fully aware
of Du Liang's embezzlement

248
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,350
and sought to use
the military fund case

249
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,430
to bring him down when she came to me.

250
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,830
That's when I realized
that she was a meticulous person

251
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,020
and certainly not someone
to be underestimated.

252
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,830
At my mother's birthday banquet,

253
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,310
the person involved in the censor's case

254
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,260
came to offer his congratulations.

255
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,110
The Seven-Petal Epiphyllum mark

256
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,660
on his concubine's arm

257
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,430
caught Yan's attention,
and she stared at it for a long while.

258
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,830
I guided her

259
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,900
to draw it,

260
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,590
and it turned out

261
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,350
that she was indeed a victim

262
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,380
in the censor's case.

263
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,020
With a meticulous mind

264
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,950
and the audacity
to involve herself in this,

265
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,990
she's someone who seeks
to dominate others' wills.

266
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,260
Such a person

267
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,780
must be eradicated.

268
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,070
Who knew you'd be the one
who truly understands me?

269
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,900
Using torture devices
to strip away their identities.

270
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,230
Now that's the ultimate art.

271
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,660
But alas.

272
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:06,860
Tell me

273
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,020
who exactly instructed

274
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,860
Du Liang to rob the military fund

275
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,500
from the official road.

276
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,260
Of course, it's someone
from a noble family.

277
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,310
Speaking of nobility,

278
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,900
you came from humble origins,

279
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,070
struggling for years
before becoming an official.

280
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,660
But the aristocracy,

281
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,140
disdainful of your background,

282
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,020
hindered your promotion.

283
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,710
From that point onward,

284
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,310
you harbored hatred for them,

285
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,380
even though the Right Chancellor,
Fu Shengjun,

286
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,860
considered you a close friend.

287
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,990
Yet, you still dragged him

288
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,780
into a place of no return.

289
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,950
A close friend?

290
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,140
Fu Shengjun was always high and mighty,

291
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,860
and deep down, he saw me

292
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,660
as nothing more than a plaything.

293
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,140
All of you

294
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,540
treat me like a mad dog,

295
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,740
but this mad dog

296
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,990
has helped Her Majesty
clear countless obstacles.

297
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,020
Am I wrong for doing that?

298
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,070
Then why did you kill

299
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,260
that sick commoner?

300
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,350
How many of the common folk's blood

301
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,660
is on your hands?

302
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,110
Are you trying to say

303
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,140
that we both come
from humble beginnings,

304
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,190
born of the same background,

305
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,350
so there's no need
to turn against each other?

306
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,900
Too bad,

307
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,430
your silver tongue

308
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,070
doesn't work on me.

309
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,020
During every interrogation,

310
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,380
the most boring part for you

311
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,380
is when the person dies,

312
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,860
no longer struggling or moving.

313
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,430
So,

314
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,780
for a frail prisoner like me,

315
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,020
I have a unique method of torture,

316
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,900
one that's effective
but won't cause serious harm.

317
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
Interested?

318
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,540
I'm listening.

319
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,740
Dragon scales blanket the bed,
the waves dampening the air.

320
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,830
Blood droplets fall as the lady weeps.

321
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,140
Take the fish scales as dragon scales,

322
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,830
embedding them into the skin

323
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,140
before removing them later.

324
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,380
The blood will then stain the bamboo.

325
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,430
This

326
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,190
is the weeping of the lady.

327
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,710
Someone,

328
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,830
go get me some fish right now!

329
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,260
It's already curfew.

330
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
Where can I possibly get any fish?

331
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,310
Just do whatever you can to get them!

332
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:31,990
All right.

333
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,950
Take her back to the cell

334
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,620
and let her rest.

335
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,430
We'll deal with her properly later.

336
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,820
[Ministry of Justice]

337
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,310
It's already so late.

338
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,660
Where are we supposed to find fish?

339
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,900
He's already torturing the prisoner,

340
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,830
now he's taking it out on us too.

341
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,990
I know, right?

342
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,620
Fish?

343
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,860
What is Ping'an trying to tell us?

344
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,260
Fish can't live without water,

345
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,070
which refers to places with water

346
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,670
The message Ping'an can convey

347
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,260
is quite limited,

348
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,950
so it must point

349
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,870
to a very specific location.

350
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,230
So it's...

351
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,230
- The black market.
- The black market.

352
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,910
That's right.

353
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,340
The only place
where we can buy fish after curfew

354
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,870
is the black market.

355
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,630
I understand what Ping'an means now.

356
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,100
We need to head there quickly.

357
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:47,820
Just

358
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,020
drink this.

359
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,430
If you kill me,

360
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,910
not only will you not earn any merit,

361
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:55,990
but you'll also end up dead.

362
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,430
What nonsense are you talking about?

363
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,780
Drink this!

364
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,300
Before Du Liang died,

365
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,820
he told me a secret.

366
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,340
You saw it too, didn't you?

367
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,990
It's very important
for those behind you.

368
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,340
What did he tell you?

369
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,020
Du Liang bribed many people,

370
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,260
and he kept a record

371
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,710
of all his transactions.

372
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,230
If things go south,

373
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,630
this ledger will be made public,

374
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,990
and your backers

375
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,780
will be in serious trouble.

376
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,470
However, if you

377
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,260
manage to get it,

378
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,260
you'll be making a great contribution.

379
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,150
So where is it?

380
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,150
Tell me!

381
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,990
The fish store in the black market.

382
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,710
Shaocheng,

383
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,230
what are you doing?

384
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,260
My old man was a blacksmith.

385
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,150
He could turn any scrap metal

386
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,390
into something useful

387
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,710
with his hammer.

388
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,870
What are you trying to make?

389
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,870
Badges for my family.

390
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,950
You're bottling up too much inside.

391
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,540
It's going to crush you.

392
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,950
You can't just take it out

393
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,910
on the metal

394
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,150
and expect it to go away.

395
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,020
Mr. Gu,

396
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,500
you know,

397
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,150
sometimes,

398
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,260
I feel that my hands are tainted.

399
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,100
So, I keep trying

400
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,150
to wash them with liquor,

401
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,340
but no matter how much I try,

402
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,630
I can't get rid of the smell of blood.

403
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,910
After that, my heart

404
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,820
just becomes harder

405
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,100
and colder.

406
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,060
Actually,

407
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,500
if you take matters into your own hands
in the military fund case,

408
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,630
then Ye Ping'an...

409
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,020
Right now, the most important thing

410
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,390
is to gain the trust
of the Mei alliance.

411
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,870
Everyone

412
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,710
has their own path to follow.

413
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,430
Once you've made your choice,

414
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,100
you shouldn't pin your hopes

415
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,430
on others.

416
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,580
I think this way,

417
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,780
and so does Ye Ping'an.

418
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,500
If she

419
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,910
can't even save herself,

420
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,470
with so many dangers ahead,

421
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,230
she'll die sooner or later.

422
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,630
So, why should I
go out of my way for her?

423
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,540
Someone wants to kill you?

424
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,060
Why?

425
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,870
Before Du Liang died,

426
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,580
he told me about a list of bribes

427
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,150
hidden in the black market.

428
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,500
Instead of making things difficult

429
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,060
for someone insignificant like me,

430
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,300
you would be better off

431
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,150
following those trying to kill me

432
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,230
and uncovering

433
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,910
the powerful officials behind it.

434
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,670
That way,

435
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,540
you'll earn a far greater reward.

436
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,710
Stay here and keep your eyes on her.

437
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,470
Don't go anywhere.

438
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,190
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,230
Come here

440
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,260
and take a look.

441
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,630
These are all rare treasures.

442
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,990
Feel free to have a look.

443
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,950
Hey, do you want to take a look?

444
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,580
Don't leave just yet.

445
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,150
Have a browse.

446
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,230
Everything here is top-notch.

447
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,060
Buy it if you want,

448
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:54,950
or just leave.

449
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:01,950
Nice liquor!

450
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,190
Sir.

451
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,910
Are you here to buy fish?

452
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,820
They're freshly killed.

453
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,580
I work for Mr. Du.

454
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,710
I'm here to retrieve

455
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,990
the ledger he entrusted to you.

456
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,430
Ledger?

457
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,740
What ledger?

458
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,820
We just sell fish here.

459
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,910
We don't have anything like that.

460
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,950
Sir, wait.

461
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,190
I remember now.

462
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,150
There was

463
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,020
a Mr. Du

464
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,820
who left something here.

465
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,390
What was it called?

466
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,190
A copper scroll?

467
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,470
Is that what you're referring to?

468
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,870
Yes,

469
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,260
the copper scroll is the ledger.

470
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,780
Give it to me.

471
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,340
You'll need the owner's token

472
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,060
to get it.

473
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,910
Do you have it?

474
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,630
I... I do.

475
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,260
One moment, please.

476
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,300
Why didn't you say so earlier?

477
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,670
Hand over the copper scroll.

478
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,470
All right.

479
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,300
Please stay calm.

480
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,990
Give it to me now!

481
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,910
All right.

482
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,100
Mr. Li!

483
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,910
Go after him!

484
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,500
Why are there two groups of people here?

485
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,100
We make a good team.

486
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,670
Ping'an must have tricked them

487
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,820
into coming for Du Liang's ledger

488
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,780
to buy some time.

489
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,580
I gave him an empty copper scroll.

490
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
It's a good thing you reacted quickly.

491
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,820
But

492
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,470
the copper scroll

493
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,150
will likely be exposed soon enough.

494
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,820
Every moment we delay
is a moment gained.

495
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,950
The reason Li Jun is here

496
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,470
is that Ping'an

497
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,740
wants him

498
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,540
to deal with the right people.

499
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,060
Master,

500
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,910
the one monitoring
Cheng Hui has informed us

501
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,870
that he suddenly left the prison

502
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,990
and headed for the black market

503
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,540
for some unknown reasons.

504
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,950
That means

505
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,470
he didn't manage

506
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,390
to kill Ye Ping'an.

507
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,870
What should we do now?

508
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,230
Split up and pursue.

509
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,710
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,190
Cheng Hui.

511
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,540
I got it.

512
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,100
[The steward of Hai Mansion]

513
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,190
Mr. Hai
will take good care of your family.

514
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,340
Don't worry.

515
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,670
Over there!

516
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,500
Tell me.

517
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,820
Who was it that tried to kill you?

518
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,630
My mother

519
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,430
can finally live a good life.

520
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,630
Mr. Li,

521
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,340
it's empty.

522
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,870
In such a short time,

523
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,300
they couldn't have taken the ledger.

524
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,820
Could we have been tricked?

525
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,950
How dare you trick me!

526
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,300
Ye Ping'an!

527
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,340
I'm going to skin you alive!

528
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,020
Mr. Li.

529
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,870
You...

530
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,430
You didn't manage to catch anyone?

531
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,710
Catch my foot.

532
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,300
That person named Cheng Hui

533
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,020
has already been silenced.

534
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,630
The Du Liang ledger you mentioned

535
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,100
is nothing but a fabrication.

536
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,150
You wanted to use me

537
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,260
to help catch the people behind this.

538
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,950
You're still under suspicion,

539
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,340
yet you dared to deceive me.

540
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,780
I'll let you experience

541
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,430
all the torture devices in this prison.

542
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,190
Miss Wu is here.

543
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,910
Here's Her Majesty's verbal decree.

544
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,910
Li Jun.

545
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,910
Ye Ping'an is the commissioner
I appointed.

546
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,150
How dare you arrest her without cause.

547
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,470
I command you

548
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,470
to release her at once
and drop the charges.

549
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,260
I have failed to understand
Her Majesty's intentions.

550
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,300
I am guilty.

551
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,470
- I...
- Mr. Li,

552
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,780
if you continue to act so recklessly,

553
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,300
those tortures of yours

554
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,710
might just

555
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,950
be used on you.

556
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,780
Now, get out of here!

557
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,870
Let's go.

558
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,540
You're in such a hurry to see me.

559
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,300
Has there been any progress

560
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,780
on the military fund case?

561
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,540
Your Majesty has granted me

562
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,150
the authority
to assist in the investigation,

563
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,580
and I feel truly honored.

564
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,580
However, once I finish this case,

565
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,820
I fear I will no longer have the chance

566
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,470
to return this token

567
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,780
to Your Majesty personally.

568
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
What do you mean by that?

569
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,540
I have said before

570
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,260
that I am willing
to be the harsh remedy

571
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,340
to cleanse Your Majesty's wounds.

572
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,260
But, Your Majesty,
apart from me as your remedy,

573
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,910
there are also those merciless officials
as your heavy sword.

574
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,340
I have no high rank,

575
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,390
no alliance,

576
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,430
and no noble background.

577
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,430
I'll just make more and more enemies.

578
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,670
If they fabricate

579
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,630
charges against me

580
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,630
and that sword swings,

581
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,820
I fear my fragile body

582
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,230
will be shattered beyond repair.

583
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,100
You've come to ask me

584
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,230
to keep you alive?

585
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,260
Put your token away.

586
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,430
No one can touch

587
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,710
that little head of yours,

588
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,390
except for me.

589
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

590
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,740
The lost military fund

591
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,100
has been fully recovered
by me and Mr. Yuan.

592
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,230
Yet, I hope Your Majesty

593
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,020
will keep this matter secret for now

594
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,430
and grant me two more days

595
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,820
to uncover

596
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,950
the festering corruption behind it.

597
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,670
Granted.

598
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,350
[Court of Judicial Review]

599
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,580
Yuan Shaocheng

600
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,950
has demonstrated loyalty to the Empress
and devotion to the country,

601
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,340
fulfilling his duties
with utmost dedication.

602
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,780
He made the leading contribution
in the military fund case

603
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,540
and has now been promoted
from Assistant Minister

604
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,820
to Vice Minister,

605
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,270
as decreed by Her Majesty.

606
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,750
I appreciate it, Your Majesty.

607
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,860
[Three months ago]
Since I ascended the throne,

608
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,580
there was first
the rebellion of Prince Yu,

609
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,860
and then the interference
of the civil officials.

610
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,470
Some took advantage of the chaos,

611
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,060
squandering resources
meant for the future.

612
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
Take Fu Shengjun, for example,

613
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,540
who seized vast stretches
of fertile land,

614
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,780
causing many to flee as refugees.

615
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,860
This

616
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,100
should have been dealt with properly
long ago.

617
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,540
But, alas,

618
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,820
there are few I can truly trust

619
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,990
by my side.

620
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,950
Though I come from humble beginnings,

621
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,430
I am determined
to root out corrupt officials

622
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,030
and serve Your Majesty
with utmost loyalty.

623
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,190
With salt prices rising across the land,

624
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,710
there's undoubtedly something amiss.

625
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,700
Xian'er has mentioned Du Liang,
Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

626
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,540
secretly colluding

627
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,860
with a merchant named Qi Junshan,

628
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,190
using gambling houses
as a front for corruption.

629
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,980
Investigate him first.

630
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

631
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,780
He's just a clinging vine.

632
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,740
What truly matters

633
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,230
is the tree that supports him.

634
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,940
The reason I haven't taken action
against certain people

635
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,060
is because I still need
to care for the noble families

636
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,740
and officials from the previous dynasty.

637
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,380
Do you understand?

638
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,780
I understand.

639
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,300
I will ensure they do not notice,

640
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,020
so that Your Majesty's

641
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,300
strategic governance
over the nation is not affected.

642
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,940
Mr. Zeng,

643
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,020
you may stay at my mansion
for the evening.

644
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,820
Please.

645
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,140
Assistant Officer,

646
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,300
there are eyes on you.

647
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,500
To preserve your life,

648
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,780
the only option is to send you
away from the capital.

649
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,940
I faked the death of Zeng Xuan

650
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,620
to gain Du Liang's trust.
Afterward, I uncovered

651
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,030
that Du Liang had been colluding
with Qi Junshan for many years,

652
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,190
amassing a fortune
of approximately 300,000 Liang.

653
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,540
Currently, I have recovered 94,000,

654
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,140
along with confiscated assets
from the Du Liang family

655
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,980
and the gambling fund
from Qi Junshan's gambling house,

656
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,540
all of which have been fully returned
to the national treasury.

657
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,980
You've done a great job

658
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,580
in investigating Du Liang.

659
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,780
It is all due to
Your Majesty's wise leadership

660
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,910
and strategic planning.

661
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,620
I merely followed your orders

662
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,030
and dare not claim any credit.

663
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,030
How's the investigation
into the rising salt prices going?

664
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,470
I

665
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,340
have not yet found evidence
of Du Liang's involvement.

666
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,620
However,

667
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,740
I suspect that someone
may have used Du Liang

668
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,580
to manipulate the salt tax
in the Ministry of Revenue.

669
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,740
I hope Your Majesty
will grant me permission

670
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,300
to fully investigate
the Ministry's accounts.

671
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:26,990
Permission granted.

672
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,860
But keep it discreet.

673
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,540
Just take one or two

674
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,670
capable people with you.

675
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

676
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,100
Your Majesty,

677
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,620
I have a suspect in mind,

678
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,540
but without concrete proof,

679
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,860
I dare not make any rash statements.

680
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,140
I know.

681
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,460
If you lack proof,

682
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,020
go gather it and then report it to me.

683
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

684
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
[Anxin House]

685
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,470
Congratulations.

686
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,990
You've risen two ranks,

687
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,500
and that belt looks great.

688
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,540
Do you not resent me

689
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,300
for not offering you any help?

690
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,260
Why would I resent you?

691
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,860
We are not friends, after all.

692
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,380
We're both just acting
in our own interests.

693
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,470
Besides,

694
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,260
with your promotion at stake,

695
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,510
you could not afford to be associated
with someone like me,

696
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,540
who was guilty.

697
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,540
I'd rather

698
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,340
you scold me

699
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,780
than

700
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,300
congratulate me here.

701
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,910
Yuan Shaocheng,

702
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,580
deep down,

703
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,270
you're not content

704
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,540
with your current position.

705
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,060
You aim to become the Grand Chancellor,

706
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,540
don't you?

707
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,020
I've been to Mang Gutter,

708
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,540
and I've heard

709
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,340
of the hardships in the Longmen Arena.

710
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,260
The life of the people
in Mang Gutter is incredibly hard.

711
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,580
Born into low status,

712
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,060
they can't own land,

713
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,060
let alone take the imperial exams
and become officials.

714
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,620
Generations of them are condemned
to a life of suffering

715
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,860
simply because they
are considered lowborn.

716
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,140
Though they may be honest and virtuous,

717
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,100
they are treated like criminals.

718
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,820
The only hope for change

719
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,380
lies in power,

720
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,740
the kind that places one person

721
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,460
above all others,
second only to the ruler.

722
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,860
I don't resent you for this,

723
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,620
as this path is fraught with danger,

724
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,340
and one wrong move
could lead to complete ruin.

725
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,780
If I were in your shoes,

726
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,220
I would have made the same choice.

727
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:51,980
Well,

728
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,460
I never expected

729
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,980
that someone who truly understands me

730
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,620
would be someone

731
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,540
I've known for only a few months.

732
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,140
Here.

733
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,740
Here's to you.

734
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,260
Stop being so dramatic.

735
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,220
Besides, since I've chosen this path,

736
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,620
if I don't think things through

737
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,740
and can't even save myself,

738
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,350
relying solely on others to help me,

739
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,700
then I might as well

740
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,060
just abandon it all and start over.

741
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,380
Tell me

742
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,260
the truth behind the censor's case.

743
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,470
Why did Du Liang say
that you were also guilty

744
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,990
before he died?

745
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,660
What good would it do
to tell you the truth?

746
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,580
If I became an obstacle

747
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,140
in your career,

748
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,660
would you help me?

749
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,830
I

750
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,310
am a practical person.

751
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,390
Since you can't help me,

752
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,390
telling you the truth is pointless.

753
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:56,950
All right,

754
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,830
you don't have to tell me.

755
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,470
Your wooden hairpin dropped.

756
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,910
Here's a new one for you.

757
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,540
You should return the wooden one to me.

758
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,540
I can't find it.

759
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,740
I won't take this anyway.

760
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:11,740
Why?

761
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,350
The wooden hairpin is perfect.

762
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,260
Even if it falls into the dirt,

763
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,140
it won't break,

764
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,580
unlike jade,

765
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,220
which is delicate and fragile.

766
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,740
I like wearing a wooden hairpin.

767
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,430
Take it or leave it.

768
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,870
How's your injury?

769
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,390
Curious, are you?

770
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,060
Here's your chance.

771
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,390
Help me apply the ointment.

772
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,180
What's the matter?

773
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,700
Feeling a bit shy?

774
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,580
If you're not bothered by it,

775
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,990
why should I be?

776
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,870
Do you really think
I don't hold grudges?

777
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,540
An eye for an eye.

778
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,510
Such shamelessness.

779
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,180
You considered me a confidant
just a moment ago,

780
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,540
but now you think I'm shameless?

781
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,790
What's wrong with that?

782
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,790
You're no better

783
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,830
yourself.

784
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
Do it yourself.
