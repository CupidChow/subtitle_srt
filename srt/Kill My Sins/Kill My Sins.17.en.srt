I'm scared.

Since I decided to come to the capital,

255
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,340
this is the first time
I've felt this way.

256

I'm not done with Li Zongxu.

264
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,820
Recently, I've been trying
to find evidence

265
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,100
of Xu Qing's complicity with him.

266
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,530
Xu Qing visited a pawnshop a lot.

267
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,010
He is involved
with the business of salt.

268
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,610
So just leave it

269
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,700

270
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:35,650
alright?

271
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,420
I know what I'm doing.

272
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,530
By the way,

273
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,370
did you say you wanted to give me

274
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,250
a jade hairpin

275
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,180
or something else?

276
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,370
I'd like something valuable.

277
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,100
Didn't you say

278
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,180
that it was too fragile?

279
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,770
You are not going to break this one.

280
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,060

You like it?

283
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,460
I do.

284
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,770
One of the ingredients

285
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,850
of the rock sugar cakes,
the Nine-Spice Honey,

286
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,980
can only be found by the cliff.

287
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,010
It is very rare.

288
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,610
The cake is sold out
at the Su's Pastry Shop.

289
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,370
Where did you get this, Ankang?

290
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,370
It was a gift from Yuan Shaocheng.

291
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,610
A lot of people
want to make a connection with us.

292
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,010
They sent us paintings, antiques,

293
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,610
or woodcarvings that you liked,

294
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,850
but you never received anything.

295
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,530
He is smart.

296
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,180
He has potential.

297
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,060
Mr. Mei said so, too.

298
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,010
Kang,

299
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,060
have you visited

300
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,610
Princess Jiayue

301
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,060
since the incident at the banquet?

302
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,730
You should go.

303
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,730
Li Zongxu

304
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,580
treated Shuodan like nothing

305
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,940
and harmed our envoy.

306
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,340
This is unforgivable!

307
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,770
Luckily,

308
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,300
it is a minor injury.

309
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,250
The most important thing now

310
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,660
is to give a name to the Empress

311
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,860
about the prince consort.

312
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:06,770
Your Highness,

313
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,330
is Wu Ankang still the person

314
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,010
in your mind?

315
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,660
If so,

316
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,460
the Li family will be glad.

317
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,250
It's their business.

318
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,010
I have nothing

319
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,810
to do with that.

320
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,980
General Wu.

321
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,420
I shall take my leave.

322
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,490
General Wu,

323
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,980
I only got close to you
when I was a kid.

324
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:50,860
Since then,

325
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,460
I could only see you
across the battlefield.

326
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,140
Even after I came to the capital,
there was a distance.

327
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:55,940
Finally, I can

328
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,860
get a good look at you.

329
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,220
You're not looking at me, Your Highness,

330
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,290
but

331
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,810
the person

332
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,810
who dragged you

333
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,620
out of the pit,

334
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,900
the general with armor

335
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,900
on the battlefield.

336
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,810
It will be the same

337
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,860
even if I'm someone else.

338
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,460
I understood

339
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,660
that love takes time.

340
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:17,900
After all,

341
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,730
it's all you remember

342
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,660
about me.

343
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,570
And there are so many beautiful women

344
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,050
here in the capital.

345
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,290
On the way here,

346
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,290
I even thought

347
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,140
what if you told me

348
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,530
that you loved someone else.

349
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,730
Do you want to know the truth?

350
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,570
The complete truth,

351
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,730
not even a bit of a lie.

352
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:47,860
As you know,

353
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,330
my help

354
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,940
was not motivated by my feelings.

355
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,940
However, the marriage

356
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,660
was never about feelings.

357
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,570
Politically speaking,

358
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,250
if your threat is war

359
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,460
unless I marry you,

360
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,420
then

361
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,730
I will be the prince consort.

362
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,660
Good.

363
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,220
Let me tell you.

364
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,330
If you don't want to marry me,

365
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,730
I'll have my father

366
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,620
send his troops to the border.

367
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,090
I'm just kidding!

368
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,420
I'm not

369
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,420
naive.

370
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,620
So you are saying

371
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,220
you really don't want to be

372
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,220
the prince consort.

373
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,330
No.

374
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,660
I have my ambition.

375
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,940
Since I was young,

376
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,380
all I want is to serve the country.

377
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,770
I will be a loyal general

378
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,050
and an upright official.

379
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,220
If

380
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,180
I become the prince consort,

381
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,490
I will not be able

382
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,980
to be at the frontier
and protect my country.

383
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,380
I will

384
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,810
be trapped

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,380
What should I do?

574
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:27,810
Here.

575
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,570
Hold my hand

576
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,530
and close your eyes.

577
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,140
Imagine what I say

578
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,330
and tell me

579
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,620
what you see.

580
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,220
Imagine

581
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,140
we are walking

582
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,140
on an open field.

583
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,810
It is very quiet.

584
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,330
You can only hear the sound of the wind.

585
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:14,700
Where are you?

586
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,180
There is grass,

587
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,570
and I see military tents in front of me.

588
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,050
It looks like

589
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,810
the northern frontier.

590
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,380
There will be two people ahead.

591
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,290
When they turn around,

592
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,380
you will see their faces.

593
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,490
He is

594
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,010
getting close.

595
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,010
Hold my hand.

596
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,570
Don't hide away,

597
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,220
or fight against him.

598
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:01,730
Trust me.

599
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,220
Have faith in me.

600
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,460
They won't hurt you anymore.

601
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,330
So the war

602
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,380
is what has been bothering me,

603
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,810
right?

604
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,460
Look around.

605
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,290
Father.

606
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,810
Father.

607
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,140
Father!

608
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,380
Father!

609
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,700
Easy.

610
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,330
No one is around.

611
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,010
This is a room

612
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,330
where you feel safe.

613
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,900
There is someone inside.

614
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,700
He won't harm you.

615
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,220
Go.

616
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,980
We've met at last.

617
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,730
Can you tell me

618
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,610
what kind of person

619
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,530
you are now?

620
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:10,820
I'm not sure.

621
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,010
Maybe I'm

622
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,610
not exactly a good man

623
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,260
in others' minds.

624
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,170
Will you take away

625
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,820
the food from the poor

626
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,130
and make them starve?

627
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:25,780
No.

628
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,820
I want everyone

629
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,860
to have a full belly

630
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:30,610
and stay warm.

631
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,570
I don't think

632
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,570
you are a bad person then.

633
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
But you look

634
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,940
very sad

635
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,050
and scared.

636
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,900
Why?

637
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,300
When I was young,

638
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:43,900
my father

639
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,420
fought the Longmen Battle

640
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,130
because of me.

641
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,210
I watched him

642
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,530
beaten to death.

643
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,530
My mother was sick, lying on the bed.

644
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,690
I couldn't do anything
to save her either.

645
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,690
Father!

646
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,530
On the battlefield,

647
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,090
there were countless enemies
in front of me.

648
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,690
The bodies of my mates

649
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,860
were lying on the ground.

650
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,210
I couldn't save any of them.

651
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,650
And Mr. Gu.

652
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,260
I couldn't do anything every time.

653
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:17,780
So,

654
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,650
how can you

655
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,690
avoid losing them?

656
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,570
Be the stronger one.

657
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,650
Only then,

658
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,530
you can protect the weak,

659
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,250
and protect the ones around me.

660
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,980
I don't want to see

661
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,380
any other kids

662
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,020
growing up in pain

663
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,050
like me.

664
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:39,980
But

665
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,980
even the strongest person

666
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,780
will not be able to protect everyone.

667
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,730
When I'm tired,

668
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,460
I will hold tight to the wooden sword,

669
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:04,900
thinking

670
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,250
that when I can

671
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,130
hold the iron sword up,

672
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,340
no one

673
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,570
can harm me anymore.

674
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,170
Now,

675
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,610
you must be able to hold

676
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,420
the iron sword up,

677
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,340
but it is

678
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,420
not what you need,

679
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:21,650
right?

680
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,780
What do I need then?

681
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,940
What you really need

682
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,090
is warmth.

683
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,530
Do you want to take me away

684
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,250
or keep me here?

685
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,020
How are you feeling?

686
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,380
I think I can

687
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,340
have a good sleep.

688
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,460
But how about you?

689
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,380
You said

690
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,690
I didn't sleep enough,

691
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,300
but it was the same for you.

692
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,460
You went through so much pain

693
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,820
after the censor's case.

694
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,420
How did you

695
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,980
get through all these years?

696
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,570
The past is the past.

697
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,570
I don't want to mention it.

698
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,420
I see you as my soul mate,

699
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,860
but you are not willing
to open your mind to me.

700
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,500
It is very rare

701
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,090
to have a soul mate.

702
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,090
Can't soul mates

703
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,570
hold something back

704
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,900
from each other?

705
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,380
You are right.

706
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,820
It is rare.

707
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,020
People

708
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,050
cross paths and part ways.

709
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,730
Perhaps, you will be the only one.

710
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,170
After the banquet,

711
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,050
the Empress didn't punish Li Zongxu.

712
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,250
On the other hand, there are

713
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,090
more and more guards around his mansion.

714
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,380
The Empress has executed
quite a few members

715
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:29,900
of the Li family.

716
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,530
If she leaves Li Zongxu there,

717
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,020
it means

718
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,690
that she has her own thoughts.

719
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,420
Alright.

720
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,130
You should get a good sleep.

721
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,130
I have one more question.

722
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:49,610
Go ahead.

723
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,730
This is the second time I tried this,

724
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,130
but it was a different feeling.

725
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,570
Since you have the skill,

726
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,130
why don't you apply it

727
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:01,530
on those

728
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,820
you investigate?

729
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,380
I tried,

730
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,380
but

731
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,300
when I get close to the truth,

732
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,650
the only thing I see

733
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,900
is the darkness within humanity,

734
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,380
and the web

735
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,250
spun by power and desire.

736
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,730
The only thing that can tear them apart

737
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,570
is the law.
